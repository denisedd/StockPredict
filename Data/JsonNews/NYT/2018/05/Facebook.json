{"Headline": "Leslie Moonves and Shari Redstone Dig In for a Long Legal War at CBS", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe hostilities between two prominent media companies are unlikely to cool off any time soon.The legal maneuver was the latest in a series of steps taken by CBS to prevent Ms. Redstone, the president of National Amusements, which acquired CBS in 2000, from merging the company with Viacom, its corporate sibling.CBS amended the lawsuit in the wake of a tense meeting during which its board voted to dilute Ms. Redstone\u2019s influence over the company. Immediately after the vote, National Amusements called it invalid. In the amended complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, CBS asserted the independence of its board and asked the court to rule on which side\u2019s interpretation of the recent vote is lawful.The amended suit also accuses Ms. Redstone of trying to \u201ccompel\u201d the merger of CBS and Viacom, which it described as \u201cnot in the best interests of CBS and its stockholders.\u201d While favoring a merger, Ms. Redstone has maintained that she has no intention of forcing one.The daughter of the ailing entertainment mogul Sumner M. Redstone, Ms. Redstone has been seeking a merger of CBS and Viacom since 2016. The two companies were one and the same, within the Redstones\u2019 company, between 2000 and 2005, when National Amusements split them apart. In recent months, CBS has resisted a reunification.On the day before the CBS board was scheduled to meet last week, National Amusements made a sudden and significant change to the CBS bylaws: From now on, the company said, any vote would require a supermajority \u2014 90 percent of the 14 CBS board members \u2014 for approval.The showdown took place last Thursday on the 35th floor of the CBS Building, known as Black Rock, in Midtown Manhattan. Mr. Moonves and Ms. Redstone, onetime allies, were both present as the board voted 11 to 3 to significantly diminish Ms. Redstone\u2019s voting power. But that result fell shy of 90 percent.Afterward, both sides declared victory, meaning that they are effectively deadlocked.Was the vote valid? Was National Amusements within its rights to change the CBS bylaws? Or, as the amended lawsuit filed by CBS suggests, should the CBS board operate independently of its main shareholder? These are questions for the Delaware Court chancellor to settle in the weeks or months ahead.\u201cNational Amusements exercised its legal right to amend CBS\u2019s bylaws, and this change was effective immediately,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident the court will uphold National Amusements\u2019 action.\u201dAt stake is whether Mr. Moonves will remain in power at the company where he has held significant sway for two decades.Viacom, the beleaguered media company that owns Paramount and cable networks like Comedy Central and MTV, has been in search of a turnaround in recent years. CBS, the owner of Showtime, Simon & Schuster and the broadcast network that is home to \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cSurvivor,\u201d has had a run of success since it was split from Viacom in 2005.The two companies are operating as relatively small shops while many others are trying to bulk up to compete with upstart digital rivals like Netflix and Facebook.Analysts are divided over what they see as the likely outcome. The firm Bernstein Research said last week that there was a \u201cnear-zero chance\u201d that CBS would be forced to merge with Viacom.\u201cBy the way, if there is a company out there who is thinking about making a bid for CBS, now would be the perfect time to do so,\u201d the firm said in a statement to investors. \u201cThe stock price is low, and the controlling shareholder would have a particularly hard time rejecting a strong offer.\u201dThe Redstones are the controlling shareholders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon, the Elephant in the Antitrust Room", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhen it comes to antitrust enforcement, one of the guiding principles is the effect on consumer prices. So the antitrust question of the moment is this: Will combining AT&T with Time Warner or Sprint with T-Mobile so diminish competition that prices go up?To justify the move, Amazon cited higher costs and the fact that it\u2019s only the second increase since it introduced its Prime service, for $79, in 2005. Still, Amazon\u2019s move suggests a degree of pricing power that its anxious rivals can only envy. Amazon said it now had over 100 million Prime customers, and its first-quarter profit, announced last week, jumped more than 120 percent, sending its stock price soaring.Netflix, too, has been raising prices, doing so most recently in October.As the seemingly unstoppable Amazon juggernaut rolls on, there\u2019s no doubt that media and telecommunications markets are converging and undergoing radical transformation. AT&T wants to combine its distribution channels with Time Warner\u2019s content creation, a transaction known as vertical integration because the two companies aren\u2019t direct competitors.While antitrust challenges to vertical combinations have been rare, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger on grounds that the combined companies might threaten to withhold Time Warner content to extract higher prices from rival distributors (a claim the companies have dismissed as economic nonsense).But Amazon is already vertically integrated \u2014 it creates content and distributes it over the internet. So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings).AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, repeatedly referred to the technology giants during the trial, and made clear that they are what drove the merger. \u201cThe media and entertainment industry is going through some rather significant disruption,\u201d he testified. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from predominately folks in the tech sector.\u201dThe Time Warner chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, made the same argument. \u201cThey have the content, the programming, and they have the technological capability of delivering it straight to you,\u201d he said, adding that by \u201cthey\u201d he meant the FANGs. \u201cAnd they can communicate with you about that relationship and what to watch and how to value the program.\u201dIn closing arguments this week, AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s lead trial lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that a combined company could use the kind of data about its users that is routinely collected by the tech companies to enhance its programming and offer more targeted advertising. It could use the resulting higher revenues to reduce consumer prices by what he estimated to be $500 million per year.The government\u2019s lead lawyer, Craig Conrath, provided a counterargument: \u201cThe fact that AT&T may want to compete in some other market, that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to reduce competition in the pay-TV market,\u201d he said. (The pay-TV market has traditionally included subscription TV providers, including cable and satellite, but not over-the-internet providers like Amazon and Netflix.)AT&T sees Netflix, YouTube and Amazon as \u201cthe wolves at the door,\u201d said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. \u201cThat\u2019s the center of their theory.\u201dTime Warner\u2019s content companies, like HBO, CNN and the Turner channels, \u201care just islands of content unmoored from the consumer,\u201d he said.Of course, the argument can be made that AT&T doesn\u2019t need to buy a company like Time Warner \u2014 it could create a media content company of its own. That\u2019s what Amazon and Netflix did, and both companies now outspend Time Warner on original programming.But from a consumer standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cThe major tech platforms are becoming vertically integrated as they create their own content to push out over their distribution platforms,\u201d Rich Greenfield of the investment firm BTIG wrote in a recent research note. \u201cIn turn, is it O.K. to be vertically integrated if you build your way in, but not to buy your way into it? What if instead of an acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T just spent $8 billion a year on content creation, the way Netflix is \u2014 would that be legal, but buying Time Warner is not?\u201dWhether the FANG companies compete in the same markets with AT&T and Time Warner is of more than academic interest \u2014 it could well influence Judge Richard Leon\u2019s decision, which he said he would deliver no later than June 12.If Judge Leon does take such an expanded view of the market, AT&T and Time Warner would most likely prevail. Even if he does find some violations, he could impose conditions on the merger rather than block it entirely, much as Comcast had to accept conditions on its purchase of NBC Universal.Making a case that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile merger would benefit consumers is far more difficult. The deal has drawn near-unanimous opposition from antitrust experts.The Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up, in contrast to AT&T-Time Warner, would be a horizontal merger \u2014 a combination of direct competitors, that way reducing the number of players operating in the market. Those kinds of deals have traditionally received more antitrust scrutiny.The government rejected the same merger less than four years ago, and the result was robust competition and lower prices for wireless services \u2014 exactly what antitrust regulators fervently hope for. Before that, in 2011, the government blocked a proposed merger of AT&T and T-Mobile.So the question is whether the markets in which they compete have so changed since then that a merger now wouldn\u2019t harm consumers.The two companies will need to argue that the market is no longer just the four wireless providers, but now includes the technology giants and broadband and cable companies like Comcast. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile would command only a small share of such a vastly expanded market, and wouldn\u2019t have the power to raise prices.That may arguably be the case for video, which can now be streamed over wireless handsets, but not for voice calls and texting, at least not yet. Sprint and T-Mobile are talking up the potential for 5G technology to further blur the lines between traditional markets, but widespread use of 5G is still years in the future.Courts and antitrust regulators \u201cdon\u2019t usually consider merger defenses that depend on the existence of undeployed technology,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. \u201cOur crystal balls aren\u2019t that good. We don\u2019t have the power to gaze five years down the road, especially when it comes to fast-changing technology.\u201dWhile Professor Hovenkamp said he understood the argument AT&T and Time Warner were making about Amazon, \u201cthis whole generic idea that companies need to merge to go up against Amazon may play to a general audience, but if you take it to its logical conclusion, it could be used to validate nearly every merger.\u201dPerhaps T-Mobile and Sprint could hold off a few years, and return with evidence that they\u2019re actually competing with the big tech companies rather than merely anticipating that competition.Then again, given the vagaries of the Trump administration\u2019s antitrust policies, \u201cthey may feel there\u2019s no reason not to roll the dice now,\u201d Mr. Hovenkamp said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Adds A.I. Labs in Seattle and Pittsburgh, Pressuring Local Universities", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat is certainly true in the important area of artificial intelligence, which Mr. Zuckerberg says can help the social media giant deal with some of those problems.Facebook is opening new A.I. labs in Seattle and Pittsburgh, after hiring three A.I. and robotics professors from the University of Washington and Carnegie Mellon University. The company hopes these seasoned researchers will help recruit and train other A.I. experts in the two cities, Mike Schroepfer, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, said in an interview.As it builds these labs, Facebook is adding to pressure on universities and nonprofit A.I. research operations, which are already struggling to retain professors and other employees.\u201cIt is worrisome that they are eating the seed corn,\u201d said Dan Weld, a computer science professor at the University of Washington. \u201cIf we lose all our faculty, it will be hard to keep preparing the next generation of researchers.\u201dWith the new labs, Facebook \u2014 which already operates A.I. labs in Silicon Valley, New York, Paris and Montreal \u2014 is establishing two new fronts in a global competition for talent.Over the last five years, artificial intelligence has been added to a number of tech products, from digital assistants and online translation services to self-driving vehicles. And the world\u2019s largest internet companies, from Google to Microsoft to Baidu, are jockeying for researchers who specialize in these technologies. Many of them are coming from academia.\u201cWe\u2019re basically going where the talent is,\u201d Mr. Schroepfer said.But the supply of talent is not keeping up with demand, and salaries have skyrocketed. Well-known researchers are receiving compensation in salary, bonuses and stock worth millions of dollars. Many in the field worry that the talent drain from academia could have a lasting impact in the United States and other countries, simply because schools won\u2019t have the teachers they need to educate the next generation of A.I. experts.Over the last few months, Facebook approached a number of notable researchers in Seattle. It hired Luke Zettlemoyer, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in technology that aims to understand and use natural human language, the company confirmed. This is an important area of research for Facebook as it struggles to identify and remove false and malicious content on its networks.In the fall, Mr. Zettlemoyer told The New York Times that he had turned down an offer from Google that was three times his teaching salary (about $180,000, according to public records) so he could keep his post at the university. Instead, he took a part-time position at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a Seattle lab backed by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.Many researchers retain their professorships when moving to the big companies \u2014 that\u2019s Mr. Zettlemoyer\u2019s plan while he works for Facebook \u2014 but they usually cut back on their academic work. At Facebook, academics typically spend 80 percent of their time at the company and 20 percent at their university.Like the other internet giants, Facebook acknowledges the importance of the university system. But at the same time, the companies are eager to land top researchers.In Pittsburgh, Facebook hired two professors from the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, Abhinav Gupta and Jessica Hodgins, who specialized in computer vision technology.Andrew Moore, dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon, did not respond to a request for comment. But over the past several months, he has been vocal about the movement of A.I. researchers toward the big internet companies. Google also operates an engineering office near Carnegie Mellon.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not necessarily good for society, but it is rational behavior by these companies,\u201d he said.The two new Facebook labs are part of wider expansion for the company\u2019s A.I. operation. In December, Facebook announced that it had hired another computer vision expert, Jitendra Malik, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He now oversees the lab at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.Even with its deep pockets, Facebook faces fierce competition for talent. Mr. Allen recently gave the Allen Institute, which he created in 2013, an additional $125 million in funding. After losing Mr. Zettlemoyer to Facebook, the Allen Institute hired Noah Smith and Yejin Choi, two of his colleagues at the University of Washington.Like Mr. Zettlemoyer, both specialize in natural language processing, and both say they received offers from multiple internet companies.The nonprofit is paying Mr. Smith and Ms. Choi a small fraction of what they were offered to join the commercial sector, but the Allen Institute will allow them to spend half their time at the university and collaborate with a wide range of companies, said Oren Etzioni, who oversees the Allen Institute.\u201cThe salary numbers are so large that even Paul Allen can\u2019t match them,\u201d Mr. Etzioni said. \u201cBut there are still some people who won\u2019t go corporate.\u201dOthers researchers believe that companies like Facebook still align with their academic goals. Nonetheless, Ed Lazowska, the Bill and Melinda Gates professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said he was concerned that the large internet companies were luring too many of the university\u2019s professors into the commercial sector.Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington, he said, are working on a set of recommendations for commercial companies meant to provide a way for universities and companies to share talent more equally. Mr. Lazowska added that every university should ensure that it did not become too close to one company.\u201cThe university must be a Switzerland,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want every company to collaborate with us and to feel like they have an equal opportunity to hire our students and work with our faculty.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Ed Lazowska\u2019s position at the University of Washington. He is the Bill and Melinda Gates professor of computer science, not the chairman of the computer science and engineering department.Advertisement"}

His father, Wayne, managed a service station and later owned a hardware store. His mother, Virginia (Gray) Peck, was a homemaker who also worked as a bookkeeper at the store.He immersed himself in the distant world through National Geographic magazine and the maps he studied in school. He devoured Stephen Crane\u2019s \u201cThe Red Badge of Courage\u201d and Margaret Mitchell\u2019s \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d And his fourth grade teacher introduced him to Mark Twain.\u201cMrs. Cole stepped up behind me with a book in her hand,\u201d he said in the 2013 speech. \u201cShe handed it to me and said, \u2018Here, you might try this.\u2019 Notice the verb, \u2018try.\u2019 Not \u2018like.\u2019 Adults weren\u2019t concerned with what children liked.

He then earned a master\u2019s in English from Southern Illinois University.He went on to teach English at Glenbrook North High School in Northbrook, Ill., and at Hunter College Campus Schools in Manhattan, where his students were at the junior high level.In all, he wrote more than 40 books, mostly for fourth to seventh graders but sometimes for teenagers. He also wrote a few for adults, including \u201cLondon Holiday\u201d (1998) and \u201cNew York Time\u201d (1981), and a memoir, \u201cAnonymously Yours\u201d (1991).He said the novel came about after he had read books about rape and teenage victims that did not satisfy his interest in their fate.\u201cI had to do a lot of research and interview a lot of people and go to a lot of places,\u201d he said in an interview cited in the book, \u201cRichard Peck: The Past Is Paramount\u201d (2009), by Donald R.

The novel, which won the prestigious Newbery Medal for children\u2019s literature, employed a familiar theme of Mr. Peck\u2019s: that youngsters should get to know their elders.Mr. Peck was a showman, frequently delivering speeches about children\u2019s literature and promoting his books at schools around the country.\u201cHe wrote a kind of nostalgia, with a Garrison Keillor style, that kids could grasp,\u201d Betsy Bird, a children\u2019s book author and the collection development manager of the Evanston Public Library system in Illinois, said in a telephone interview.

The agreement was confirmed Thursday by Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for PayPal.\u201cSmall businesses are the engine of the global economy and we are continuing to expand our platform to help them compete and win online, in-store and via mobile,\u201d said PayPal\u2019s chief executive, Dan Schulman.The agreement is the latest example of a promising European start-up selling itself to a larger American company. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft have all used acquisitions in the region to gobble up promising technology and sought-after engineers. Past deals include Google\u2019s purchase of the London-based artificial intelligence start-up DeepMind; Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Mojang, the Swedish maker of popular video game \u201cMinecraft\u201d; and Apple\u2019s deal for the music-recognition company Shazam and digital-assistant maker VocalIQ, both of which started in Europe.The trend is troubling for European policymakers who have been eager to develop a homegrown tech sector that has lagged the United States and China.Founded eight years ago and based in Stockholm, iZettle began as a maker of products like credit card readers. But it has expanded its offerings to analytics software and even small business loans, giving it a strong foothold among such companies in Europe and Latin America.Last week, it filed to go public, announcing plans to list itself on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange, with ambitions for a $1.1 billion valuation. Among its existing investors are Mastercard and American Express, as well as the venture capital firm Index Ventures.The purchase would boost PayPal\u2019s international expansion, and help it compete with Square, which has focused on processing payments for small businesses. Both companies are trying to capitalize on the growing volume of purchases being made on mobile phones and the internet.Michael J. de la Merced reported from London and Nathaniel Popper from New York.

{"Headline": "In Virtual Reality, How Much Body Do You Need?", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt might be as little as a pair of hands and feet, researchers in Japan found after recording subjects who wore an Oculus Rift headset.How connected are your body and your consciousness? When Michiteru Kitazaki, a professor of engineering at Toyohashi University of Technology in Japan, recently posed this question in an email, he evoked an idea from Japanese culture known as tamashii, or the soul without a body. Will it soon be possible, he wondered, to simulate the feeling of a spirit not attached to any particular physical form using virtual or augmented reality?If so, a good place to start would be to figure out the minimal amount of body we need to feel a sense of self, especially in digital environments where more and more people may find themselves for work or play. It might be as little as a pair of hands and feet, report Dr. Kitazaki and a Ph.D. student, Ryota Kondo. Using an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and a motion sensor, Dr. Kitazaki\u2019s team performed a series of experiments in which volunteers watched disembodied hands and feet move two meters in front of them in a virtual room. In one experiment, when the hands and feet mirrored the participants\u2019 own movements, people reported feeling as if the space between the appendages were their own bodies. This demonstrates the power of synchronized actions and our brain\u2019s ability to fill in missing information, said V.S. Ramachandran, a professor at the University of California, San Diego and rubber-hand illusion pioneer who did not participate in the new study. The \u201cimprobability of synchrony occurring by chance\u201d overrides all other information, he said, even knowledge that an invisible body cannot be yours.Antonella Maselli, a researcher at the Santa Lucia Foundation, a neurological rehabilitation hospital in Italy, noted that the subjects in the study did not show significant conscious responses to seeing their invisible avatars being cut by a knife or colliding with a table.

It was a criticism of an economic principle that Mr. Buffett had coined in 1999 and that has become something of a mantra for his faithful: Invest in businesses \u201cthat have wide, sustainable moats around them.\u201dSuch moats, Mr. Buffett has said, are made of the competitive advantages that benefit major brands and companies, like distribution networks, pricing power and brand reputation.But to Mr. Musk, they are a metaphor for being stuck in the past. \u201cIf your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is the pace of innovation \u2014 that is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness.\u201dAt a time when technology is upending even old-line industries that once seemed impenetrable to competition, might Mr. Musk be right?\u201cElon may turn things upside down in some areas,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d want to take us on in candy,\u201d suggesting Berkshire\u2019s See\u2019s Candies division enjoyed an unassailably wide moat. The quip elicited laughter from the 20,000 shareholders who packed the CenturyLink Center.Mr. Musk answered the challenge immediately, saying he was starting a candy company. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Not only that, Mr. Musk said, he planned \u201cto build a moat and fill it with candy\u201d \u2014 making it impossible for Mr. Buffett to resist sinking his money into the venture.The repartee was good for some chuckles and clickbait headlines, but the mini-spat masked a more serious and significant debate taking place across corporate America: Have the traditional moats shrunk?When direct-to-consumer brands like Dollar Shave Club have been able to take on consumer giants like Procter & Gamble\u2019s Gillette \u2014 so much so that Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion \u2014 are any businesses still safe? Mr. Buffett owns Kraft Heinz, for example, but could upstart food companies one day overtake it, breaking through the substantial network of distribution and marketing arrangements \u2014 and brand loyalty \u2014 that Kraft Heinz has built up over decades?Mr. Buffett acknowledged that times had changed. \u201cThere have been more moats that have become susceptible to invasion than seemed to be the case earlier,\u201d he said.To a large degree, Mr. Musk is a living embodiment of a gleeful invader. With Tesla, he is trying to prove that what was long thought of as a substantial moat around the automobile industry could be overcome. He has gone direct to consumer with Tesla vehicles, bypassing the traditional car dealers that were once considered a barrier to entering the automotive business. He even had what seemed like his own moat: a network of Supercharger stations around the country that he recently opened up to competitors. (His initial panning of the \u201cmoat\u201d idea followed a question about why he was willing to cede the advantage that the closed charging network provided.)But, in truth, Mr. Musk\u2019s experience \u2014 and challenges \u2014 at Tesla may demonstrate just how much a moat remains a powerful deterrent to competitors.In the case of the automobile industry, perhaps the biggest barrier is the huge amount of capital needed \u2014 Tesla has already raised more than $12 billion. But even with huge amounts of money, Tesla\u2019s recent production struggles \u2014 it has repeatedly missed its targets for making the new mass-market Model 3 \u2014 show the immense value of manufacturing experience.Mr. Musk\u2019s willingness to challenge convention has clearly pushed the automobile industry forward, but his progress has lately been bumpier than he initially expected. That\u2019s not to say he won\u2019t succeed, but if he does, he may be the exception, not the rule.There are still huge swaths of our economy that have dauntingly wide moats, many of them protected by regulatory walls. Banks, which have been speculated about as ripe for disruption by financial technology companies, seem more likely to buy start-ups than compete against them. Airlines \u2014 which Mr. Buffett once called \u201ca death trap for investors\u201d \u2014 have consolidated, and enormous corporations control virtually all the landing slots at airports around the globe. Before it could get off the ground, any insurgent hoping to challenge them would have to find a spot to come down.Even many digital businesses have a moat: Google and Facebook control so much of the advertising market that it is hard to see how a kid in a garage with an idea could usurp them anytime soon. Amazon has itself has become so powerful that virtually every seller feels it has to go through it. And Mr. Buffett has convinced himself that Apple\u2019s deep relationship with its customers through its ecosystem of products and iCloud mean the business has a defensible moat.\u201cThere are some pretty good moats around,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cBeing the low-cost producer, for example, is a terribly important moat,\u201d he said, citing Geico, the low-cost insurance company Berkshire owns.Saturday night, after the Berkshire meeting ended, Mr. Musk was still tweeting: \u201cSaying you like \u2018moats\u2019 is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies.\u201dFor better or worse, the limited competition that oligopolies face is usually good for investors \u2014 even if consumers might disagree.But whether they have been dug by a company\u2019s experienced hand, the good will of its customers or the heavy machinery of governmental regulation, moats remain a formidable form of protection, even from the most willing of raiders.Perhaps Charlie Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, put it best: \u201cElon says a conventional moat is quaint. And that\u2019s true of a puddle of water.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Before vanishing, he punched out a short message on Facebook: \u201cI am being arrested.\u201dIf similar cases are a guide, it could be months or years before he can post again.In fact, Mr. Sisi has gone in the opposite direction, arresting Mr. Abbas and others activists in the past month, in what appears to be an effort to silence even the small number of critics still inside Egypt, including some who had already started to self-censor out of fear of arrest.\u201cThe difference with this crackdown is that it\u2019s going in every direction,\u201d said Hossam Bahgat, a prominent journalist and human rights activist. \u201cThey appear to have a list of people they are going after, based on their public profile rather than anything they have said. It\u2019s scary.\u201dMilitary courts have taken up some cases, often imposing harsh sentences on dissenters. On Tuesday, human rights activists said a court sentenced Ismail Iskandarani, a researcher and writer, to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment on a raft of charges including membership in a banned organization.Mr. Iskandarani is a scholar on Sinai, where the Egyptian army is waging a military campaign against the Islamic State without much outside scrutiny because journalists and researchers are forbidden to enter the area.On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch said the army had destroyed at least 3,600 homes and commercial buildings in the area since January as part of its drive against the Islamic State in Sinai. An Egyptian military spokesman denounced the report and said the government had paid $51 million in compensation to affected families.Many Egyptian activists have won international awards for their work in recent years. But western accolades or large social media followings offer little protection from prosecution in Mr. Sisi\u2019s Egypt.A few days later Ms. Fathy, her husband and their 2-year-old son were taken to a police station in the middle of the night. She is awaiting trial on charges of inciting terrorism over the internet and spreading fake news.There was no word late Wednesday of the charges faced by Mr. Abbas, 43, whose lawyer described his status on Twitter as \u201ckidnapped, not arrested.\u201dMr. Abbas came to prominence in 2006 after he posted leaked videos of police brutality under President Hosni Mubarak, one of which resulted in the conviction of two officers. In 2007 the International Center for Journalists presented him with the Knight International Journalism Award. In recent years he has used his Twitter account, which has 350,000 followers, to attack Mr. Sisi.\u201cIt\u2019s rich that activists like Wael Abbas won awards for their contestation on social media,\u201d she said, \u201cand the sites were credited for their role in revolutionary events. And today, these same sites are the ones that are silencing folks.\u201dA spokesman for Twitter declined to comment on the case, and referred to the company\u2019s rules.Advertisement"}

It was my son\u2019s first soccer match. He was 6 years old and had just joined our local suburban soccer club with 10 of his friends from kindergarten. The boys had no idea about the rules of junior soccer, and could barely kick a ball. They spent most of the match facing the wrong way on the pitch. But as this photo shows, they were having the time of their lives. These little Aussies from all different cultural backgrounds seemed to know without being taught that sport is fun, not just because you might win a trophy at the end of the season, but because you get to be part of something bigger with your friends. That\u2019s what they were interested in: one another. It was a game of \u201cI\u2019m here with you, mate.\u201d Ever since that first soccer match, I\u2019ve come to realize just how tightly the rituals of Saturday-morning sport are woven into the fabric of Australian families\u2019 lives: the early-morning rush to find lost jerseys and shin pads, the piling of siblings into the car, collecting other teammates on the way to local sports grounds to cheer on loved ones little and large, and have a yarn about the week.

She had been looking for housing since the summer, when she left an affordable apartment for a relationship that didn\u2019t work out.

{"Headline": "Why Work When You Can Procrastibake?", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll procrastibakers do not bake alike.Procrastibaking \u2014 the practice of baking something completely unnecessary, with the intention of avoiding \u201creal\u201d work \u2014 is a surprisingly common habit that has only recently acquired a name. Medical students, romance writers, freelance web designers: Almost anyone who works at home and has a cookie sheet in the cupboard can try it.\u201cI started procrastibaking in college as a way to feel productive while also avoiding my schoolwork,\u201d said Wesley Straton, a graduate student in Brooklyn. \u201cBaking feels like a low-stakes artistic outlet.\u201dSome procrastibakers like to make long, slow recipes that break up the entire day, returning to their spreadsheets or study guides in between steps like proofing, chilling and rising. Those who use baking as a transition into a creative state of mind are more likely to stir up a quick banana bread or pan of brownies.It\u2019s clear that for many cooks, today\u2019s telecommuting jobs, combined with the comforting rituals of the kitchen and the lure of Instagram \u201clikes,\u201d have made procrastibaking irresistible.\u201cWe make an emotional, irrational decision to do what feels good right now,\u201d instead of doing what is necessary, he said. \u201cPresent self feels better, but future self gets jerked around.\u201d Procrastibaking, he added, like procrasticleaning, is an unconsciously deployed strategy that makes us feel skilled, nurturing and virtuous in the present while distracting us from the future.Best practices for procrastibaking are still being established.Also, any recipe that requires leaving the house to buy ingredients is not in the spirit of procrastibaking. The procrastibaker must believe that it is possible to be simultaneously working on a document, buttering pans and separating eggs. A shopping trip to buy cocoa powder destroys the fantasy that the baking is not really an interruption of the work. That\u2019s why recipes like \u201ckitchen sink\u201d cookies, which use whatever ingredients are on hand, are ideal.Jonathan Martin, a medical student in London, says that the best recipes for effective procrastibaking are those with many steps, allowing the procrastibaker to get some work done in between and sustain an illusion of efficiency. \u201cI make a few sourdough loaves, with the autolyzing, bulk proofing and then final rising steps all hours apart,\u201d he said.Another favorite is millionaire\u2019s shortbread, which demands time for the layers \u2014 shortbread, then caramel, then chocolate \u2014 to chill between steps. \u201cLooking forward to the next step allows me to enjoy and justify the time spent,\u201d he said.Many writers say that procrastibaking is actually part of their work, allowing them to enter a \u201cflow state\u201d that is conducive to creative thinking.She said that procrastibaking is her way out of writer\u2019s block \u2014 especially pie, because it is more stimulating to the senses than other recipes. \u201cYou can bake an entire cake without touching anything,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a pie, you squeeze the dough, you slice the fruit, you crimp the crust.\u201d Baking helps her get out of the tangle of words in her head and into the physical world, she said, which helps with her particular line of work.More surprisingly, there are many professional bakers who procrastibake.\u201cBeing in a field where I have to be creative on demand, I think my brain needs to ride on cruise control before getting down to business,\u201d she said. So when she is procrastibaking, she sticks to the recipes she can make without thinking, like cookies, scones and brownies.\u201cMaybe I\u2019m like a professional athlete,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just get out there on the floor and start playing and be at the top of our game.

{"Headline": "He Wrote Disturbing Plans for a School Shooting. But Was That a Crime?", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFAIR HAVEN, Vt. \u2014 When people who knew Jack Sawyer saw something, they said something.A mother told the police that Mr. Sawyer, who had seemed troubled in the past, had just bought a gun. A friend of the young man also contacted the police: He was talking admiringly of the school massacre in Parkland, Fla., the friend warned, and hinting at sinister plans of his own.The police soon detained Mr. Sawyer, 18, a former student at Fair Haven Union High School. They said they had found a journal in his car that laid out disturbing plans for a shooting at the high school. \u201cI\u2019m aiming to kill as many as I can,\u201d the journal read. The school resource officer, the journal went on, might have to be shot \u201cpoint blank\u201d in the head.Mr. Sawyer was charged with aggravated assault, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and one count of attempted first-degree murder \u2014 all felonies \u2014 and held without bail. Many in Fair Haven, a town of 2,700 residents on the western edge of Vermont, exhaled, believing they had stopped America\u2019s next mass shooting.But last month, a ruling by the Vermont Supreme Court cast doubt on the viability of the charges against Mr. Sawyer. The most serious charges were soon dropped, leaving only misdemeanors, and he was released on bail last week.Residents were outraged \u2014 fearful for their safety and angry at a legal system that seemed not to take into account the realities of school shootings. In recent weeks, school officials said, the district spent $150,000 on new school security measures. Parents were consumed with questions about security for graduation or prom. State troopers\u2019 cars became a sight as common as the school bus outside of Fair Haven Union High.\u201cI think we are the ones in prison now,\u201d said Jessica Nadeau, 37, whose daughter, Olasia, 14, spoke of a nightmare about Mr. Sawyer and the stories of what he might do. \u201cNow we\u2019re all the ones who are locked into this fear.\u201dAs the nation grapples with massacres in places like Parkland and Las Vegas, much attention has been given to the importance of identifying would-be gunmen and stopping them long before carnage begins. But this case, which has unfolded in Vermont over the last three months, shows that even in situations where warnings emerge, there is no simple way to weigh the seriousness of a threat against the legal rights of an individual in a case where no shooting has happened.The Vermont Supreme Court said Mr. Sawyer\u2019s acts did not meet the legal standards of the most serious charges against him. To constitute an attempted crime, the justices said, someone would have to not only prepare to commit a crime but take clear steps toward carrying it out.\u201cAn \u2018attempt\u2019 under Vermont law requires an intent to commit a crime, coupled with an act that, but for an interruption, would result in the completion of a crime,\u201d three justices wrote. They looked to a 1906 case, in which the Supreme Court found that a prisoner who had obtained 12 hacksaws \u2014 but not yet used them to try to saw through the bars of his jail window \u2014 could not be convicted of attempting to escape. Mr. Sawyer, they said, \u201ctook no action so proximate to the commission of a school shooting as to constitute an attempt.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Sawyer, Kelly Green, said that common sense \u2014 not just legal precedent \u2014 would argue that Mr. Sawyer\u2019s acts did not add up to attempted murder, a crime that can carry life in prison.\u201cJack simply had thoughts about committing these crimes, wrote in his journal about committing the crimes, wrote his fantasy plans, and he purchased a gun,\u201d Ms. Green said. \u201cThe average person on the street can understand that all of that is not good, but it\u2019s not an attempted murder.\u201dThe first signs of a problem in Fair Haven appeared on Feb. 14, an afternoon when images of the school shooting in Parkland were beginning to spread across the nation\u2019s televisions. A parent told the police that Mr. Sawyer, who had left Fair Haven in 2016, had returned and had bought a gun. In court documents, police wrote that they knew Mr. Sawyer had made threats against the school two years earlier, but did not see evidence of anything new, and decided not to hold him at that point.A day later, a teenage girl warned the police that Mr. Sawyer had described the Parkland shooting as \u201cfantastic,\u201d and wrote to her, in a Facebook message, \u201cJust a few days ago I was still plotting on shooting up my old high school.\u201dWith that, the police detained Mr. Sawyer and questioned him for hours. They said they seized a shotgun, ammunition, the journal and books about the massacre at Columbine High School from his car. According to a police affidavit, Mr. Sawyer told them that he had left a residential program where he had been getting treatment for depression and anxiety and that he had stopped taking medication that was prescribed to him. The police said he also told them that he intended to carry out a shooting at his former school.\u201cSawyer stated it may not be next week, next month or even next year, but eventually he will carry out his plan,\u201d Detective Sergeant Todd Wilkins, of the Vermont State Police, wrote in court documents.The State Supreme Court\u2019s ruling set off anger around the state and a flurry of calls for a rewrite of state law, which some experts said was more ambiguous on the legal issue of \u201cattempted\u201d crimes than other states. Prosecutors added misdemeanor charges of criminal threatening and carrying a dangerous weapon, and dropped the felony charges against Mr. Sawyer. The lowered charges carry a maximum sentence of three years in prison, in all, and Mr. Sawyer was released from jail on $10,000 bail.\u201cI am extremely concerned and frustrated that our current laws have allowed for the release of an individual who \u2014 as the court record shows \u2014 intended, and may still intend, to carry out a horrific crime,\u201d the governor of Vermont, Phil Scott, announced.Mr. Sawyer\u2019s family did not respond to a request for comment, and Mr. Sawyer, who left jail last week, could not be reached. Ms. Green said that Mr. Sawyer was receiving mental health treatment in a residential facility, which prosecutors said was voluntary. A judge placed strict conditions on his release, including barring him from entering Fair Haven. Ms. Green said his family was committed to ensuring that he and the rest of the community were safe.She accused the state of causing panic in Fair Haven by sensationalizing the case. \u201cThe state\u2019s attorney charged these outlandish and, on its face, frivolous charges, which caused a cacophony of terror in the community,\u201d Ms. Green said.In Fair Haven, people say they have a mix of complicated feelings. Some said they fear the town would never really feel secure again; still, many of them also said they knew Mr. Sawyer.\u201cHe was one of our kids,\u201d said Andrea Ochs, 46, an office manager and bookkeeper who has two daughters at the high school. \u201c\u2018How did we fail him?\u2019 is almost how I felt.\u201dHe was an introverted student, said Jason Rasco, the acting principal of the school, and in 2016, administrators became worried about his abiding interest in the Columbine shooting. After he briefly ran away, his parents sent him out of state for treatment, according to court documents.\u201cIt\u2019s not a popular thing to say I care about him, but I really do,\u201d Mr. Rasco said. But, he added, \u201cI fear him because of what he is doing to others in the building, and what he is doing to my staff.\u201dSome staff members have decided not to return to school next year, Mr. Rasco said. Several students have been absent since the threat emerged. And many who come to school \u2014 where security measures, like new surveillance cameras, have been installed \u2014 have made new routines. Olasia Nadeau, Ms. Nadeau\u2019s 14-year-old daughter, has moved her seat in some classrooms so she is always facing the door. A parent, Scott Hadeka, said he would start driving his son home after school instead of allowing him to walk. Czarina Ranney said her son, who is in middle school, now carries a bulletproof sheet in his backpack.For students like Leah Gannon, 18, there are still standardized tests to take, jobs to hold down, and trips to neighboring towns to secure prom clothes. But she said she had to remain alert.\u201cI don\u2019t try to forget it, because I always want it in the back of my mind, to feel safe,\u201d Ms. Gannon said. \u201cWe do not feel safe.\u201dMany residents have read the chilling contents of the journal, which prosecutors made public. \u201cWe know all of his deepest thoughts,\u201d said Michelle Murray, who has two children at the high school. \u201cHe managed to terrorize a community.\u201dOn April 27, the day that Mr. Sawyer was released from jail, word spread quickly. In Whitehall, N.Y., 15 minutes away, students were given fliers showing Mr. Sawyer\u2019s face.Julia Adams, a social studies teacher in Fair Haven, said some students left school early. Some who remained peppered her with questions about the risks. She told them that school, with its locked doors and state troopers outside, was the safest place they could be. It was a relief, she said, when they turned back to studying the Civil War.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a poor substitute for a court of law, with lopsided, inconsistent rules of evidence. When coupled with a ban on group activity, mandatory arbitration can deter aggrieved workers from coming forward in the first place.The technicalities of arbitration rules are dreary, which is why it has taken the #MeToo movement to highlight why they are so unfair to employees. Survivors of sexual harassment and assault have rightly demanded an end to the practice, in which the proceedings are kept secret. High-profile employers are responding to this criticism cynically, at best, by agreeing to eliminate mandatory arbitration only for #MeToo-type claims.\u201cIt\u2019s great that we\u2019ve started talking about forced arbitration, but it\u2019s unfortunate we\u2019re only talking about it in the context of harassment, not pregnancy discrimination or pay discrimination or wage theft,\u201d said Juno Turner, a lawyer with Outten & Golden, a firm based in New York City that represents employees. \u201cAnd there is no attention brought to the issue of class and collective waivers, which also have an impact on the ability of multiple women victimized by the same harasser to speak out.\u201dIt\u2019s to the tremendous credit of the #MeToo movement that Americans are now talking so openly about the disproportionate abuse faced by women on the job. The current focus on sexual harassment and bodily violence, however, should not blind us to other workplace indignities. Being cheated out of overtime pay or the minimum wage is no less a violation, nor is discrimination on the basis of illness or age. Each is an affront that must be dealt with appropriately \u2014 in state or federal court.\u201cIf the Supreme Court holds that class-action waivers are perfectly legal, it\u2019s going to continue the trend of making it difficult to enforce wage laws in any systemic way,\u201d said Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney for Uber drivers and other low-wage workers.E.

She knew that eating meat put her in the minority among the Hindu vegetarians at her school, and she came to think of lunchtime as an opportunity to quietly rebel, to assert all the particulars of her identity while relishing in its flavors.In 1947, the country was split into India and Pakistan, and millions of people were displaced. Though many Muslim families went to Pakistan, Ms. Rushdie\u2019s family stayed put in Bombay. \u201cTo be a Muslim who had not defected to the promise of safety and prosperity was a complex and confusing thing,\u201d she wrote in her book, which has since fallen out of print in Britain.There were no photographs in the original book, though Ms. Rushdie did appear on the cover with short, shiny black hair, wearing a glamorous red-trimmed white sari and a string of pearls, sitting down at an elegant table crammed with platters of food, as if a dozen dinner guests would arrive at any moment.That cover might suggest a kind of cushy, dated charm, but in her writing, Ms. Rushdie was sharp and ahead of her time as she aimed to dismantle the stereotypes that had shaped outsiders\u2019 perceptions of Indian cuisine for centuries \u2014 stereotypes that persist today.\u201cI was young, I was direct and I was cross about a lot of things,\u201d said Ms. Rushdie, who is now 69.As a working mother in London in the 1980s, she was furious with the myths and clich\u00e9s surrounding Indian cuisine, which as she noted in her book were established during British colonial rule.She knew very well that the food of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh wasn\u2019t an intensely spicy monolith, or the stuff of cheap lunch buffets. She knew it wasn\u2019t all greasy, overcooked or brightly tinted with food coloring, as it often was at restaurants in Britain at the time.\u201cThe food that people called Indian food, I thought it was so awful,\u201d Ms. Rushdie said. She barely recognized it.Inspired by writers like Claudia Roden, Madhur Jaffrey and Elizabeth David, Ms. Rushdie took a clear, matter-of-fact tone and a precise, unfussy approach, reclaiming the story of Indian cuisine and reshaping the narrative by sharing the foods of her North Indian family.\u201cI wasn\u2019t setting out to cover the whole subcontinent,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to do something personal to me, to talk about Indian food in a real way.\u201dBeing \u201creal\u201d meant being specific and sidestepping all of the clich\u00e9s, including the notion that Indian cuisine was too mystical, complex or time-consuming for the average home cook to handle. (\u201cFor best results, cook your biryani by candlelight,\u201d Ms. Rushdie wrote sarcastically in the book\u2019s introduction.)She knew from experience that she could get home from work, where she taught adults to read and write, and get a satisfying meal on the table for her family in about 45 minutes. She wanted her book to illustrate that, not just for those unfamiliar with Indian cuisine, but for Indian home cooks, too.\u201cI remember thinking, it wasn\u2019t going to have any glossy pictures, because it was so low budget,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the recipes had to be good.\u201dAs she worked on them, Ms. Rushdie enlisted her brother, Salman Rushdie, to help. (His novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d was published in 1988, the same year as her cookbook.)\u201cI was the other person who knew what our family\u2019s food should taste like,\u201d said Mr. Rushdie, 70, who became his sister\u2019s unofficial recipe tester, taking each freshly typed recipe back to his own apartment in Islington, following it without deviations and reporting back on the results.\u201cIf the book had come out in the U.S. back then, in 1988, I don\u2019t think there would have been wide interest because there wasn\u2019t wide interest in Indian cuisine here,\u201d said Mr. Rushdie, who moved to New York in 1999. \u201cIn a city of a million restaurants, Indian cuisine was very poorly represented. And when it was, it was represented at the bottom end of the market.\u201dOn a visit to Los Angeles, Mr. Rushdie remembers being taken out to what he was told was a very good Indian restaurant. \u201cAnd all the waitresses were dressed as belly dancers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an education into how unreal people\u2019s understanding of India was at the time.\u201dMeherwan Irani, an American restaurateur who moved from India to the United States to attend graduate school in South Carolina in the 1990s, remembers a string of poorly made curries at lunch buffets in the South that followed what he called \u201cthe usual tropes.\u201dIt was a familiar experience for any immigrant moving to the United States, but Mr. Irani took it personally. He felt the food misrepresented who he was, and where he came from.When Ms. Rushdie found out that her book was returning to print in the United States this year, she was thrilled. \u201cI get a feeling that Indian food is so much more on the map now,\u201d she said.\u201cThere was a time when people were very reluctant to cook Indian food at home; they felt it was very other,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ingredients were not easily available, but now you can get everything, everywhere.\u201dMs. Rushdie left Bombay as a teenager and briefly went to school in England, but soon left for school in Pakistan at 16. \u201cFor years, the family was in flux,\u201d she said, with her brother at boarding school, her mother in India and her father in England.Though Ms. Rushdie worked in Karachi, Pakistan, as a lawyer for a few years after college, she soon shifted to working in adult literacy in London, teaching people to read and write.In 1983, Ms. Rushdie married Abdul Momen, a Bengali man with roots on India\u2019s eastern coast, and though she hadn\u2019t been too fond of fish before that, her cookbook contains a variety of seafood recipes that she learned to make through him. Now divorced, they have two daughters, who both live in London.Ms. Rushdie said she learned the basics of how to cook in about a week, when her mother had to leave town abruptly to take care of her own mother, and gave her some brief instructions for feeding the family.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to it,\u201d her mother said, as Ms. Rushdie got out a pencil and tried to write everything down: how brown the onions should get, how soft the potatoes should be. A teenager at the time, she had no choice but to develop a fast, confident and practical approach in the kitchen.\u201cI was thrown in at the deep end,\u201d Ms. Rushdie said. \u201cAnd what I learned was that you don\u2019t have to be born with some gift to cook. We can all do it.\u201dAnd to Drink \u2026An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the Rushdie sisters in a 1950s photo.

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s File on Me Was Huge. Here\u2019s Why It Wasn\u2019t as Creepy as My Facebook Data.", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixYou may wonder: Why is that? After all, we turn to Google for not only our internet searches but also for our emails, calendaring, maps, photo uploads, video streaming, mobile phones and web browsers. That\u2019s far more pervasive than the baby photos and comments that we post on Facebook.What I found was that my Google data archive was much larger than my Facebook file \u2014 about 12 times larger, in fact \u2014 but it was also packed with fewer unpleasant surprises.Most of what I saw in my Google file was information I already knew I had put in there, like my photos, documents and Google emails, while my Facebook data contained a list of 500 advertisers with my contact information and a permanent record of friends I thought I had \u201cdeleted\u201d years ago, among other shockers.Whenever I was perturbed by parts of my Google data, like a record of the Android apps I had opened over the past several years, I was relieved to find out I could delete the data. In contrast, when I downloaded my Facebook data, I found that a lot of what I saw could not be purged.Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company had spent many years developing tools for people to download their information.\u201cIt should be easy for people to understand and control their Google data,\u201d he said. \u201cWe encourage everyone to use these tools so they can make the privacy choices that are right for them.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say that we should be complacent. Tech companies like Google and Facebook have an incredible amount of power over us that only increases with the more that they know. So downloading and analyzing your Google data, and determining what information you want to keep around or delete, is an exercise I highly recommend. Here\u2019s how I did it \u2014 and what I learned.If you download your whole archive, your file will probably be enormous. Mine was eight gigabytes, enough to hold about 2,000 hours of music. After I requested my archive, it took Google about half a day to send an email with links to download my files.Here\u2019s what jumped out to me:\u2022 The most noteworthy folder is labeled My Activity, which is an overview of what you have done on Google\u2019s products, including Android, Google Maps and Google News.Inside My Activity is a subfolder labeled Ads. This record contained a history of many websites I had visited, including those I had reached without the help of Google.com. Even sites I opened through Twitter or links I clicked on through a text message were recorded in the Ads folder.What gives? Google said that many web articles load advertisements served through its ad network, and when you visit sites loading Google ads, you are contributing to an advertisement-related profile that Google is building about you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s logged in the My Activity folder.In my conversations with Google, the company argued that it was better to be transparent about the information being collected as opposed to not showing it at all.Brian Fitzpatrick, the former Google manager who led the team that created Takeout, put it another way. \u201cCompanies are gathering this data about you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just an honest way to look at it.\u201dMy take: It is helpful to see that this data is collected. But it should be labeled precisely \u2014 like \u201cPages We Know You Visited\u201d \u2014 so people can find this data more easily and decide whether to delete it.\u2022 A subfolder labeled Android contained a detailed history of the Android apps I had opened over the past three years, including the time and date I had launched each app. For example, my log showed I opened the Instagram app in March, the Gmail app in December 2015 and the Google Play Music app in January 2016.\u2022 Many files in my archive were odd formats that were not easy to open or read. For example, some files included the extension .JSON. My Google Maps location history was stored in a .JSON file, and it displayed an unintelligible list of GPS coordinates and time stamps.Google explained that Takeout was designed for people to be able to easily remove their data from Google and use it elsewhere. Files like those with the .JSON extension are common formats designed to be machine readable so that other programs and tools can make use of the data, according to Google.That makes sense \u2014 but our data should be readable by us, too.After poring through your Google file, ask yourself what personal data you are uncomfortable with having the company keep. Everybody is going to have a different answer.For me, I was troubled by Google keeping a history of websites I had visited even when I wasn\u2019t using Google products. I also found the company\u2019s log of my Android apps usage overly intrusive.I opted to purge the entire history for Ads, where my web-browsing activity was being tracked even when I was not using Google products. I also deleted all my Android data. Once I got going, I also deleted my history of requests made to Google\u2019s voice assistant and the web-browsing histories for sites I visited through Google News and Google Chrome.But that all raises a larger question. What does it mean to delete something from Google? Is it just hidden from plain sight or actually expunged?In other words, some of the data you eliminate will actually be deleted eventually, and some will not.That may not offer much solace. But short of ceasing to use the web entirely, occasionally purging parts of your account data, much like you would do with unwanted junk in your home, is the best you can do.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How SpongeBob SquarePants Became a Meme Factory", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cSpongeBob\u201d and its titular character made their debut in 1999. The show has aired on Nickelodeon for nearly two decades. In the nearly two decades since, Mr. Hillenburg\u2019s work has been spun into a Broadway musical, a number of video games and two films. A third film is also scheduled to be released in 2020.The yellow sponge in rectangular pants has also been at the center of online meme culture for a generation who grew up as the internet came into its own.If you\u2019re not in that generation, or if you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you may have missed the continued cultural relevance of SpongeBob. We\u2019re here to help.SpongeBob SquarePants.That\u2019s really it! You\u2019re caught up. (Be sure to share this story on Facebook before closing the tab.)Fine, fine.SpongeBob SquarePants, the sea creature at the heart of the animated television show that bears his name, is an absorbent, yellow and porous sponge.SpongeBob \u2014 Mr. SquarePants, if you prefer \u2014 is theoretically a sea sponge, but he presents as a yellow kitchen sponge who wears a shirt, tie and, as his surname suggests, rectangular brown pants.He is a rather cheerful, spirited fellow who works as a short-order cook. He\u2019s na\u00efve and fairly pure of heart, generally assuming the best in everyone.He also happens to live in a pineapple in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom. The town is kind of an aquatic ecosystem unto itself, inhabited as it is by a colorful assortment of anthropomorphic marine animals that you wouldn\u2019t expect to see cohabitating in a tank at your local aquarium.Among the principal characters in \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d are a dimwitted starfish named Patrick who lives under a rock, a surly octopus named Squidward Tentacles who resides in a moai statue, a parsimonious crab who owns a fast-food restaurant, a teenage sperm whale who is somehow the crab\u2019s daughter, a Texan squirrel in scuba gear and a plankton bent on world domination who is married to an apparently waterproof supercomputer.Also, SpongeBob has a pet sea snail named Gary who meows like a house cat. Despite this, the show\u2019s other characters can generally understand him, and Gary often serves as the voice of reason.As might be suggested by a cartoon about a humanoid kitchen tool, \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d is replete with visual gags and aquatic puns. For example: When SpongeBob and Patrick go \u201cjellyfishing,\u201d they\u2019re catching jellyfish in butterfly nets and then milking them for their jelly. In another early episode, SpongeBob also plays hooky \u2014 which involves not only ditching work but also having fun with fishing hooks.Much of the show\u2019s humor also has cross-generational appeal. The show was designed for children, but it\u2019s peppered with in-jokes that wink at teenagers and adults. Take SpongeBob\u2019s squirrel friend, who is named Sandy Cheeks. (In the spirit of \u201cSpongeBob,\u201d we\u2019ll let you work it out for yourself.)Nineteen years later, the show is still running. The cartoon is currently in its 11th season and has aired more than 230 episodes, making it Nickelodeon\u2019s longest-running series.The other thing that happened: SpongeBob\u2019s quirky underwater world saturated the internet just as it was rapidly expanding.More like \u201cwhat do you meme?\u201d(Fine, I\u2019ll leave the jokes to the \u201cSpongeBob\u201d writers.)All the while, the show continued to gain fans among new classes of kindergartners who eventually grew up to ruin the internet.\u201cSpongeBob\u201d was so ubiquitous at the beginning of the 21st century that references to the show are widely understood. And with its high episode count, the show offers a lot of cultural references. It\u2019s easy meme fodder.sO wHaT aRe The MeMeS?Oh, sorry \u2014 that\u2019s one of them.More recently, the internet meme-ified an image of Patrick Star, SpongeBob\u2019s bestie, looking particularly evil. It comes from an episode in the first season, in which SpongeBob gives up his modern urban life to live among the jellyfish. When Patrick, feeling ditched, tries to catch SpongeBob with a net, he makes a wicked face that internet users adopted.There are others that rely on some understanding of the show, like the meme that draws on the contrast between SpongeBob\u2019s place of employment, the Krusty Krab, and the inferior Chum Bucket, run by the villainous Plankton. Internet users replace the restaurant names with two things they\u2019re comparing. They\u2019re counting on viewers to get that one is vastly superior.What are you, new here?Like most popular things, SpongeBob has drawn his fair share of detractors. But the criticism spreads beyond \u201cSpongeBob\u201d haters and has placed the show at the center of the culture wars.Well, for starters, in 2005, some religious conservatives accused SpongeBob of promoting a gay agenda.If you\u2019re looking for specific episodes, many fans agree that the show\u2019s prime was its first three seasons, before Mr. Hillenburg resigned as showrunner.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Pleasure and Pain of Being California, the World\u2019s 5th-Largest Economy", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When a transportation agency said two years ago that rush hours were a thing of the past on a major highway in the San Francisco Bay Area, it was not good news.\u201cFor the first time on record, the morning and evening peak periods have merged,\u201d said a spokesman for the agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, \u201ccreating a continuously congested freeway from 5:30 in the morning until nearly 8 o\u2019clock at night.\u201dIt has only gotten worse.California\u2019s economy has soared into the stratosphere, but not without inflicting some pain. Paralyzing traffic is one symptom; the increasingly absurd price of putting a roof over one\u2019s head is another.One person from the Midwest devised a quick formula to calculate the price of a house in the Bay Area: See how much a similar house would cost in Minnesota and then add a million dollars.Every few weeks there seems to be another story in the California news media about a dilapidated shack in an ordinary neighborhood selling for seven figures, just to be torn down. It has become common enough to lose its shock value.California recorded another milestone last week, one reflecting a prouder facet of the state\u2019s success. If the state were an independent country, its economy would rank as the fifth-largest in the world, ahead of Britain\u2019s (which has been crawling lately). California held that spot once before, but it slipped a bit during the Great Recession a decade ago.As the state has blossomed, outpacing many others, it has reinforced a liberal narrative about growth, that a state can have big government and a booming economy, too. (Texas is the conservatives\u2019 counterexample: a big, fast-growing economy under laissez-faire government.)California has strict environmental protections, a progressive tax system and an ascendant minimum wage, now $10.50 an hour and set to rise in stages to $15 in 2023. The state welcomes immigrants, celebrates ethnic and linguistic diversity, and actively tries to combat climate change. And with all that, its economy continues to soar.\u201cWe have raised income taxes and imposed increasingly high fees to reduce greenhouse emissions,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. \u201cNone of that has overridden the attractiveness of this state for talent and innovation and entrepreneurship.\u201dCalifornia is not the only state doing well, of course. The federal Bureau of Economic Analysis produced a map last week showing a somewhat lopsided pattern of prosperity in America. The economies of states like Kansas and Louisiana shrank slightly last year, while those in the West thrived: Nevada grew by 3.5 percent, Washington by 4.4 percent, Arizona by 3.2 percent.Even among its booming neighbors, though, California, which saw 3 percent growth last year, stands out for the diversity and sheer size of its economy.Every sector contributed to the state\u2019s growth last year except agriculture, according to Irena Asmundson, the chief economist of the California Department of Finance. Financial services and real estate led the pack, and even manufacturing, often said to be in decline in America, grew significantly, contributing $10 billion in output to the $127 billion the state added over all.\u201cMost of this is a lot of relatively small firms that are very specialized,\u201d Ms. Asmundson said of the growth in manufacturing.Unsurprisingly, Silicon Valley is a big part of California\u2019s success. One of the state\u2019s technology giants, Apple, brought in more revenue in its latest fiscal year \u2014 $229 billion \u2014 than the entire economic output of Wyoming, five times over.All of that money pouring in to California\u2019s tech and entertainment industries produces a big wealth effect, ballooning what the state\u2019s workers can spend \u2014 and not just those who work directly in those fields.When Gov. Jerry Brown returned to office in 2011, he faced a budget deficit of $27 billion. Now, after eight years of economic expansion, the state has a surplus of $6 billion, and its tax revenues are running well ahead of projections.Yet it is hard to overlook the pain that prosperity has brought: traffic, property prices, homelessness.Those last two issues are increasingly seen as sides of the same coin. In 2017, California saw the fastest growth in its homeless population of any state (14 percent), and also had the highest proportion of them unsheltered: 68 percent of the state\u2019s 134,000 homeless people sleep outdoors.All economic booms run out of steam sooner or later, and some Californians say they might welcome a little relief from this one. William Yu, an economist with the Anderson Forecast at the U.C.L.A. Anderson School of Management, recalls a panel discussion a month ago with real estate developers.\u201cOne developer was asked, \u2018Are you worried about a recession coming?\u2019\u201d Mr. Yu said. \u201cThe developer said, \u2018I\u2019m not worried at all. I\u2019m waiting for it.\u2019\u201dWhy? So he can snap up some properties at cheaper prices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young People Keep Marching After Parkland, This Time to Register to Vote", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The pace of new voter registrations among young people in crucial states is accelerating, a signal that school shootings this year \u2014 and the anger and political organizing in their wake \u2014 may prove to be more than ephemeral displays of activism.They could even help shape the outcome of the midterm elections. If voters in their teens and 20s vote in greater numbers than usual, as many promised during nationwide marches for gun control this spring, the groundswell could affect close races in key states like Arizona and Florida, where there will be competitive races for governor, the Senate and a number of House districts in November.The deadly shooting on Friday at Santa Fe High School in Texas will probably add urgency to the efforts. Hours after the carnage, young organizers mobilized by the February mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., were vowing a political response.Their voices have already risen. The question is whether they will vote. Even some Republicans are beginning to believe they will.\u201cThe shooting at Parkland high school was the tipping point for these kids,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster. \u201cThe bravery and activism of the Parkland kids ignited their peers across the country, and these newly minted 18-year-old voters are already motivated. The school shooting in Texas surely adds to their resolve but, honestly, they didn\u2019t need any more motivation.\u201dVoter data for March and April show that young registrants represented a higher portion of new voters in Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, among other states. In Florida, voters under 26 jumped from less than 20 percent of new registrants in January and February to nearly 30 percent by March, the month of the gun control rallies. That ticked down to about 25 percent in April, as the demonstrations subsided, but registration of young voters remained above the pace set before 17 students and faculty were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.In North Carolina, voters under 25 represented around 30 percent of new registrations in January and February; in March and April, they were around 40 percent.In Pennsylvania, voter registrations across age groups increased sharply in March and April before the primary last week, but registrations of young voters increased the fastest, jumping to 45 percent in March and more than half in April, from fewer than 40 percent of voters in January and February.The trend was particularly stark in Broward County, site of the mass shooting in Parkland \u2014 and where more than a thousand young people were added to voter rolls in the week leading to the student-led March for Our Lives protests in March. Young voters represented only 16 percent of new registrants in January and February. In March, that number jumped to 46 percent, before slipping back to 25 percent in April.Registrations among other groups remained relatively constant during the same period, in Broward and in Florida generally, according to data provided by the Florida Department of State Division of Elections.And those new registrants lean Democratic. Of the new voters ages 25 and under in the state, a third registered as Democrats; 21 percent signed up as Republicans; and 46 percent registered as either unaffiliated or with another political party. For new registrants over 25, 27 percent were Democrats; 29 percent were Republicans; and 44 percent were independent or affiliated with a different party.\u201cWhat I have seen is what I am calling a once-in-a-generation attitudinal shift about the efficacy of participating in the political process,\u201d said John Della Volpe, the director of the institute, who has specialized in polling younger voters for nearly two decades. \u201cI am optimistic that the increasing interest we have tracked in politics will likely lead to increased participation in the midterms.\u201dThe combination of registration data, the Harvard survey and the firepower of the independent groups suggest that younger voters, who typically do not turn out for midterms in great numbers, just might show up at the polls in November.\u201cBottom line is that so far we are not seeing any higher level of self-described interest in the election among voters 18 to 34 years old than in past off-year elections,\u201d he said.Comparison of voter registration numbers can be fraught. Fluctuations often represent changes in the law or the registration process as much as changes in voter enthusiasm. For example, some states, like California, have made mechanical changes to the registration process that make it easier to sign up to vote. Such mechanical changes do not necessarily translate into votes on Election Day.Young voters typically vote at a lower rate in part because of a belief that their vote will not bring about meaningful change. But the data from Harvard shows that the percentage of young voters who disagreed with the statement that \u201cpolitical involvement rarely has any tangible results\u201d rose to 36 percent this spring from 27 percent in spring 2016, and the number who agreed dropped to 22 percent from 26 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s a net difference of 13 points in two years,\u201d Mr. Della Volpe said.In California, young voters are registering in record numbers. In the first three months of the year, more than 65,000 people ages 18 to 21 registered, numbers that were higher than either 2014 or 2016, said Paul Mitchell, president of Political Data, a private company in Sacramento that tracks registration in the state.But in the Golden State, where the voting population continues to swell, those increases may not make much of a difference. So far, young voters there actually represent a smaller share of the registration this election cycle \u2014 13 percent \u2014 than the 19 percent share in 2014.Mr. Mitchell cautioned that it was not possible to pinpoint whether the new voter registrations were driven by the marches or the Parkland shooting.So far, the Harvard polling indicates that Democrats are the more likely beneficiary of the increased commitment to voting, with half of voters 18 to 29 saying they will vote Democratic. The remainder are divided between Republicans and independents.\u201cAlso, just the sheer number of individuals who say they will definitely vote, 37 percent, is as high as it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Mr. Della Volpe said. \u201cThat\u2019s likely to only grow stronger. The number among Democrats is 51 percent saying they will definitely vote.\u201dYounger voters were not moved by either President Trump or Hillary Clinton, but Mr. Trump\u2019s election reawakened them \u201conly to be brought to life in more powerful ways in the last two months, post-Parkland shooting,\u201d Mr. Della Volpe said. \u201cThis now has the potential to turbocharge that.\u201dThe deaths in Texas may only add more fuel.\u201cWe are fighting for you,\u201d David Hogg, a Parkland survivor and organizer, declared hours after the shooting at Santa Fe High School.Several groups are working to help that happen. NextGen America, a group funded by the activist billionaire Tom Steyer, is targeting voters ages 18 to 35 in 10 traditional battleground states, in addition to Arizona. The group reported on Monday that it had registered 36,789 voters, including 8,459 in Florida, its top state.\u201cThis shows an increase in energy,\u201d said Aleigha Cavalier, the communications director for NextGen. \u201cWe know that young people don\u2019t vote as often as they should. This year we are seeing energy because they have a feeling of voting for or voting against, whether it\u2019s Donald Trump or issues that they care about, and on issues like gun safety, because we are seeing things happen in real time, like Parkland, that weren\u2019t happening before.\u201dAnother group, Inspire U.S., has been concentrating on registering high school students in their classrooms. They have registration drives in 10 states and more than 200 high schools and have registered more than 41,000 students since the group started three years ago. Inspire also uses a texting app to remind users to vote.\u201cIn training high school students to register their peers, that\u2019s where the power is,\u201d said Eileen Haag, who founded the group with her husband, Ira Lechner. \u201cStudents respond to other students.\u201dThe Parkland shooting suddenly made high schools an even more obvious place to register voters, she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a spark in awareness, but there is still a lot of work to be done to actually get these kids to the ballot box,\u201d she said.Many governors are promoting voter registration drives in their state\u2019s high schools, including Virginia in recent weeks.There are also signs of more direct activism. In Michigan, Katie Fahey, 28, has built a group from a single Facebook post to a 10,000-person volunteer organization that is trying to end the practice of gerrymandering in the state. She started the nonpartisan organization, Voters Not Politicians, shortly after the election, and it gathered 425,000 signatures in just 100 days from all 83 Michigan counties for a ballot initiative that would make the drawing of legislative districts nonpartisan.\u201cI was just tired of excuses and tired of waiting for somebody else to fix it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust politicians to deliver on promises.\u201dThe convergence of the reaction to an issue that young voters care deeply about \u2014 gun violence \u2014 and a push for greater registration is rare.\u201cWhen young people are thinking about their activism and voting at the same time, that\u2019s actually something that hasn\u2019t happened for the last eight years,\u201d said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, the director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts, which studies political engagement of young Americans. \u201cThey are usually focusing on direct impact, and there is skepticism around \u2018why should we vote.\u2019 That sentiment is considerably less prominent. That gives me hope that this is actually an opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How well did Flipkart\u2019s investors do?\u2022 What did AT&T and Novartis want from Michael Cohen?\u2022 What the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal means for the business world.\u2022 The bottom line on Vodafone\u2019s big deal with Liberty Global.The story of Walmart\u2019s $16 billion deal for Flipkart began nearly two years ago and spanned secret negotiations in both Bentonville, Ark., and Bangalore, India. Here\u2019s an account of how it came together based on interviews by people involved in the transaction, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal.Walmart had initially approached Flipkart in 2016. But it quickly backed away to focus on its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, one of these people said.By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.Walmart could also provide a permanent base of capital, which would allow Flipkart to avoid raising money every few years. For its part, Walmart would feel more comfortable if it had majority control, even as it was prepared to give Flipkart\u2019s management some degree of independence.In December, Amazon entered the fray, these people said. The e-commerce titan sought to buy Flipkart outright. But Flipkart was wary. It worried regulators would block a deal that would have combined India\u2019s two biggest e-commerce services.Discussions with Walmart pressed forward. Over the next few months, the boards of Walmart and Flipkart refined what became Wednesday\u2019s deal: The size of the stake Walmart would buy and at what price. They also settled on which of Flipkart\u2019s investors would sell. Some, including the investment firm Tiger Global Management and the Chinese internet giant Tencent, wanted to stay on board, betting that Flipkart would continue to grow. Others, including the nearly $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, were happy to cash out.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s how well some of them did:Some investors who are keeping stakes in Flipkart \u2014 including Tiger Global, which will maintain a roughly 5 percent stake, Microsoft and the Chinese internet giant Tencent \u2014 could continue to reap returns should Flipkart eventually go public.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedWhat exactly were AT&T and Novartis after when they made payments to a firm set up Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer?- Peter EavisDetails\u2022 Walmart will buy an initial stake of 77 percent in Flipkart and invest $2 billion in fresh capital into the Indian firm.\u2022 The two companies said they are in continuing talks with other investors to purchase a stake, which might reduce Walmart\u2019s eventual shareholding in Flipkart.\u2022 Walmart said the purchase would reduce its net income by at least $750 million this year and by more than double that amount next year.It\u2019s a risky bet for Walmart\u2022 Although India\u2019s population is rapidly coming online, the number of people with enough income to shop online is still tiny.\u2022 Walmart is paying a hefty premium to buy its way into the pole position in India\u2019s e-commerce market, but it has not yet outlined any strategy that would keep it ahead of Amazon there.\u2022 While Flipkart is currently the market leader, Amazon\u2019s relatively new India site is quickly closing the gap.The big winners\u2022 Sachin Bansal. Flipkart's co-founder, is selling his entire 5.5 percent stake in the company, becoming an instant billionaire.\u2022 SoftBank Vision Fund, the investment vehicle run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart in August. That the stake will now be sold for about $4 billion.The advisers\u2022 Walmart was advised by JPMorgan and Barclays on the banking side and Hogan Lovells, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher on the legal side.\u2022 Flipkart was advised by Goldman Sachs and law firms Gunderson Dettmer LLP, Khaitan & Co., Allen & Gledhill LLP and Dentons Rodyk & DavidsonCritic\u2019s CornerUna Galani of Breakingviews writes: \u201cAfter buying Jet.com for $3 billion a couple years ago, Walmart\u2019s efforts to compete online in the United States have hit some bumps. Earlier misadventures in China prompted it to join forces with local rival JD.com in return for a small stake. India will test the U.S. company\u2019s ability to keep pace halfway around the world with Amazon, whose investors are as patient as boss Jeff Bezos. This will be a make-or-break overseas deal for Walmart.\u201dSturm Ruger had urged shareholders for weeks to reject a proposal from a group of Roman Catholic nuns demanding more transparency from the company on whether it planned to develop safer products and monitor the ones already in circulation.The vote was a rebuke to the company\u2019s leaders and a victory for gun control activists.Ruger must now produce a report by February on how it tracks violence associated with its firearms, what kind of research it is conducting related to so-called smart gun technology and its assessment of the risks that gun-related crimes pose to the company\u2019s reputation and finances.\u2014 Tiffany HsuSears said it will provide customers who purchase any brand of tire on Amazon, including the Sears DieHard brand and full-service tire installation and balancing.The service initially will available at 47 Sears Auto Centers in eight metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.This the second partnership that Sears has struck with Amazon in the past year. Last July, Sears said it would sell its Kenmore appliances of Amazon. The announcement pushed Sears\u2019s shares up 24 percent. The stock is down more than 70 percent over the past 12 months.AT&T said Essential was \u201cone of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\u201d and that its contract ended in December. Novartis said that its contract ran for a year, through February.\u201cRight around [when the] inauguration is happening, we need somebody who knows the administration,\u201d the person said. \u201cHow does he think? What are their priorities?\u201dThe price of benchmark American crude oil rose to more than $71 early Wednesday.Oil prices are hovering near highs not seen since 2014 would seem to run counter to the President\u2019s stated, or tweeted, preference for lower oil prices. But as American oil production has surged, the traditional view that higher oil prices act as a clear drag on American growth has become less of an item of faith.We believe this event is a bellwether for the sector, and could potentially contribute toward a flurry of consolidation across Europe.Not so fast: Expect Deutsche Telekom, now in Vodafone\u2019s cross hairs, to fight the transaction.Advertisement"}

But when that happens, the drug is discontinued and the patient is prescribed a different medication, said Dr. Cuffe, who has studied A.D.H.D. for two decades.Drugs like methylphenidate have a short half-life, meaning they don\u2019t accumulate in a patient\u2019s body.

{"Headline": "The Secret History of White Power", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow did you first become interested in the white power movement? White supremacy has been around for centuries. Why, in your view, was the Vietnam War so significant?The Vietnam War created an opportunity for people and groups who had previously been at odds to unite in a common cause. And it provided a narrative \u2014 betrayal by the state \u2014 that structured the movement. The magnitude of military technologies available in that war \u2014 land mines, C-4 plastic explosives, anti-tank rockets, and AR-15s and M-16s \u2014 escalated the violent capacity of the movement, and the death toll.How has the white power activism since the 1970s differed from its predecessors? Although it drew on previous Klan mobilizations, it united groups that hadn\u2019t aligned before: Klansmen, neo-Nazis, radical tax protesters, skinheads. It was also revolutionary, in its relationship with the government. Earlier mobilizations \u2014 particularly the best-known and largest wave of Klan activity in the 1920s \u2014 had been vigilante organizations; that is, they had worked to support the state. Think of the famous image of Klansmen marching on the Mall in Washington \u2014 in robes and hoods, but with their faces visible. The \u201920s Klan was very mainstream, and was aligned with all kinds of above-board politics.What was the outcome of that self-declared war?Then what happened?Who are some of the key figures in the post-Vietnam War movement?David Lane was a member of The Order who while imprisoned wrote a slogan called the \u201cFourteen Words,\u201d which has become a rallying cry and code of the movement. The words \u2014 \u201cWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children\u201d \u2014 have been used to justify violence.Don Black, the founder of Stormfront \u2014 one of the most prominent white-power websites in the 1990s \u2014 appears in my book through his earlier movement activity, including an attempt to invade the Caribbean island of Dominica in order to funnel money to the Klan in the United States.What are the biggest misconceptions about the white power movement?The idea of \u201cleaderless resistance\u201d \u2014 intended to prevent infiltration by government operatives and prosecutions \u2014 allowed white power to sort of disappear as a movement. White power violence has too often been described as the disconnected acts of lone wolves or madmen, and this is precisely because people \u2014 the public, prosecutors, jurors, the government \u2014 haven\u2019t understood it as a connected and coherent social movement. Relatedly, people often think of those involved in organized racist violence as uneducated, backward, or part of one class or regional identity. This is a misconception that really distorts the movement I study, which included people from all class backgrounds, from all regions of the country, from cities and rural areas alike. It also included rich people and poor people; high school dropouts and people with advanced degrees; religious leaders, along with felons; men, women, and children.How would you characterize the white power movement today? Has it been emboldened by the Trump administration?I should underline that I\u2019m a historian, and my expertise ends in 1995. The kind of research I do won\u2019t even be possible to pursue about our current moment for another five or ten years, because the archive simply hasn\u2019t been compiled yet. But history shows that having an executive seen as sympathetic to the movement has not, in the past, worked to appease white-power activists or curb violence. The fact that the movement last turned violent during the Reagan administration \u2014 and at a moment of seeming state support for many of its goals \u2014 underlines the fact that this ideology was not aimed at electoral change.Is the movement more, or less, powerful than it was in the mid-1990s, the endpoint of your study? It\u2019s difficult to say. Certainly we know from watchdog organizations that hate crimes and hate group memberships are rising. And certainly these ideas have entered the mainstream in new ways. I think the archives teach us that there has never been an effective stop delivered to this movement. The criminal prosecutions have been ineffective, there hasn\u2019t been a turn in public opinion, and white power activity has been very effective at going underground, reforming and resurging.Getting handcuffed is only the first step in a path for arrestees that winds its way through holding cells in police station houses and eventually courtrooms. The process can take months. And racial disparities have seeped into every layer of the criminal justice system.Even today, defense lawyers say prosecutors are more likely to decline to prosecute marijuana cases against white people than against black people. When I watched arraignments in Brooklyn one morning, the defendants facing marijuana charges who hired private lawyers got to go before the judge first, while those with public defense lawyers \u2014 almost all of them black \u2014 sat in the courtroom pews for hours.The top prosecutors in Manhattan and Brooklyn have said they will stop prosecuting many marijuana cases, but appear likely to carve out exceptions for some people with criminal records. Police officials have backed off defending some marijuana arrests, but suggested they still want to go after people with criminal records. And those policies, too, could fall hardest on people living in mostly black neighborhoods, since they have faced decades of aggressive policing of minor offenses and are more likely to have records.Is Childish Gambino (Donald Glover) calling out America for \u201cslippin\u2019 up\u201d with his newest music video, \u201cThis Is America\u201d?

{"Headline": "Bots and Trolls Elbow Into Mexico\u2019s Crowded Electoral Field", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The message that circulated on social media earlier this year \u2014 most Mexicans would have to re-register within days if they wanted to vote in the presidential election \u2014 set off a low-level panic on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.The thing is, it wasn\u2019t true.The source remains unclear. But whether the message was a dirty trickster\u2019s attempt to undermine the system or just an ill-informed public service effort, the anger and uncertainty it generated represented an early skirmish in the battle over disinformation in this year\u2019s fiercely contested election season.\u201cWhat candidates do on social media will be decisive,\u201d said Carlos Merlo, managing partner of Victory Lab, a marketing firm dedicated to spreading viral claims, saying they must respond quicker than ever to combat disinformation.There is a lot at stake in the July 1 vote: over 3,400 elected positions at the local, state and federal levels, more than in any other election in Mexican history. The biggest prize is the presidency, with five candidates on the ballot competing to succeed President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto for a six-year term.Fake news has been flowing fast, and the campaigns have traded accusations that they have hired paid, online agitators called trolls and used automated programs known as bots to flood social media platforms with messages intended to deceive and manipulate voters.And as investigators in the United States continue to investigate the extent of Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election, the threat of Russian interference has loomed over the Mexican race as well.Mexican officials say they have not found evidence of Russian meddling or received any from their American counterparts, and the Russian authorities have denied engaging in such activity.Enrique Andrade, a top official at Mexico\u2019s National Electoral Institute, said the agency was on guard against any foreign interference. \u201cWe do think it is a possibility, and we are preparing ourselves so that it will not affect the process,\u201d he said.Some analysts have speculated that Russia might still try to disrupt the region by intensifying political polarization in Mexico ahead of the vote. And, they say, the Russians may view Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the front-runner in the polls who has cut a more antagonistic figure toward the United States than his rivals, as a useful vehicle for that goal.Manuel Coss\u00edo Ramos, a digital strategist, claims to have found Russian fingerprints on social media traffic concerning the election, much of it about Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador. Mr. Coss\u00edo is not affiliated with a presidential campaign, but acknowledges being no fan of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador.Using an analytics tool called NetBase, Mr. Coss\u00edo said he found that 4.8 million items about Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador had been posted to social media and news websites in the past month by users outside Mexico. About 63 percent were associated with users in Russia, he said, and 20 percent with Ukraine.Similar searches for two other leading candidates, Ricardo Anaya and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, found that most of the foreign activity was coming from the United States, with only 4 percent emanating from Russia, Mr. Coss\u00edo said.But other digital consultants, running different programs, said they had found no such evidence of election-related social media activity from Russia, and Mr. Coss\u00edo\u2019s findings could not be independently verified.Officials with Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s campaign have dismissed Mr. Coss\u00edo\u2019s findings as biased because of his political inclinations.The many pieces of fake news that have circulated in Mexico of late include a claim that Pope Francis weighed in on the presidential race and criticized Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s political ideology. (He didn\u2019t, according to Verificado 2018, a fact-checking group established in March to verify election-related news.)Another recent claim \u2014 also exposed as false by Verificado \u2014 held that Mr. Anaya was related to members of the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration and, thus, his opposition party was in league with it.Since then, the online audience has nearly doubled: about 71.3 million internet users in Mexico, according to the latest census data, up from 40.9 million in 2012. At the same time, the campaigns have become more adept at designing online strategies.\u201cFrom this point on, the battle will be fought on the social networks,\u201d said Javier Murillo, co-founder and chairman of Metrics, a digital technology consultancy in Mexico.Using proprietary algorithms, Mr. Murillo said he found that bots and trolls generated up to 27 percent of election postings on Facebook and Twitter in Mexico during a recent monthlong period.Digital consultants working with the campaigns of the three leading presidential candidates \u2014 Mr. Lopez Obrador, Mr. Anaya and Mr. Meade \u2014 denied that the campaigns were using such methods, or spreading fake news.\u201cSocial media is now an obligatory part of any campaign war room,\u201d said Mr. Anaya\u2019s digital strategist, Juan Pablo Adame Alem\u00e1n. \u201cBut we see no benefit to inflating topics\u201d with bots or trolls.In an effort to get ahead of the problem as Election Day draws closer, Mexican authorities have reached agreements with Facebook, Twitter and Google on ways to counteract fake news and spread accurate information. Facebook, as part of its agreement, placed ads in Mexican newspapers this spring providing guidance on how to detect fake news.Election officials have been particularly worried about rumors that seem intended to undermine the integrity of the system. The message concerning voter registration this year was of the biggest concern to them so far, said Mr. Andrade of the National Electoral Institute.\u201cThen again,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cwe are only getting started in terms of the campaign process.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She realized that South Africa\u2019s long road to peace \u201creally was extraordinary,\u201d though in many ways the nation\u2019s journey remained unfinished. Using a medium format camera, she made 18 photographs that were not inspired by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but by Nelson Mandela\u2019s 1994 inaugural address as South Africa\u2019s first democratically elected president: \u201cEach one of us is intimately attached to the soil of this beautiful country.\u201d These landscapes often have the added weight of symbolism, which helps bring into focus that the issues of the nation's colonial past and post-apartheid present are rooted in forgiveness. They allude to an uncertain future of black and white relations that depend on racial healing 24 years after Nelson Mandela declared South Africa \u201ca rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world.\u201d Ms. Terry\u2019s snapshot of two empty chairs \u2014 one white and the other colored \u2014 set opposite each other inside the East London City Hall building where Archbishop Desmond Tutu led the first Truth and Reconciliation Commission meeting in 1996 is a simple symbol of what the peace process achieved and what remains undone. \u201cI like photographs that ask questions rather than give you answers because that invites reflection as opposed to a statement of what you\u2019re seeing,\u201d Ms. Terry said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I worked on in these landscapes. They are a way of asking, \u2018What does the landscape of forgiveness look like?\u2019 I think the horrors and struggles of post conflict are real, but I\u2019m trying to understand what it means to learn how to be human again, and how it is we live again, we connect again and we build community again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Air France Dispute Threatens to Escalate Macron\u2019s Battle With Labor", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 In the first year of his presidency, Emmanuel Macron has pushed business-friendly labor laws through Parliament, made it easier for companies to hire and fire, cut the wealth tax and decentralized collective bargaining. Through it all, France\u2019s most militant unions have resisted.His changes, which set out to reshape the way France\u2019s economy and society work, are now facing increasing pushback from labor groups. For weeks, unions have staged a series of strikes to oppose efforts to make the nation\u2019s main railway system, the SNCF, more competitive. And unions representing Air France-KLM staff on Monday called for new strikes after rejecting a pay proposal.While Mr. Macron\u2019s economic changes do not take aim at the nation\u2019s flagship air carrier, his administration has inserted itself directly into the fight, warning labor leaders that they risked driving Air France to the brink of calamity.France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the company might \u201cdisappear\u201d if unions persisted in their demands for an immediate 5 percent wage increase and continued rolling strikes that have already affected tens of thousands of fliers worldwide. The French government, which owns a minority stake in Air France, would not ride to the rescue with a taxpayer bailout if the airline faltered, Mr. Le Maire said.The standoff, which has already cost the airline an estimated 300 million euros, or $360 million, in lost revenue, prompted the abrupt resignation of the airline\u2019s chief executive. Shares of the company were down 13 percent on Monday.\u201cI am not taking the money of the French and putting it in a company that isn\u2019t at the required competitive level,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said.The battle is an outgrowth of Mr. Macron\u2019s effort to remake the French economy.Mr. Macron\u2019s moves have been cheered by businesses and investors. It has encouraged drawn companies like Facebook and Amazon to step up their presence in France.In many ways, that has been Mr. Macron\u2019s point. Although only around 8 percent of the nation\u2019s workers are unionized, organized labor has long held outsize clout at the negotiating table with employers. In France, even small changes tend to agitate unions, which have historically sought to secure workplace protections through protests and strikes.Before pushing through changes to the labor laws, Mr. Macron held more than 50 meetings with unions shortly after his election in an effort to get them onboard with his program.The General Confederation of Labor, known as the C.G.T., has largely resisted, seeing an effort to repeal hard-won labor rights. The union has been at the forefront of mobilizing actions that in recent weeks have led hundreds of thousands of people into the streets, and encouraged regular strikes at the nation\u2019s railway system that are scheduled to last until July.At Air France, the government pushed back against labor groups over the weekend after the chief executive, Jean-Marc Janaillac, resigned abruptly on Friday. Mr. Janaillac had failed to win workers over in a contentious internal referendum that proposed a 7 percent pay increase for pilots and staff over four years.Air France\u2019s hard-line pilots\u2019 union had demanded an immediate 5 percent raise to make up for wages that have been frozen for nearly five years. The company has recorded record profits thanks to lower oil prices since 2016, prompting the union to insist that Air France could afford the pay increase.Still, it has set up a dangerous game of brinkmanship between unions and the French government, which has hinted that it is willing to let Air France go under.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t make the necessary efforts to be at the same competitive level of Lufthansa and other major airlines, it will disappear,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said on the French television station BFM on Sunday. He added that the union\u2019s salary demands were \u201cunjustified\u201d and urged employees to show \u201cresponsibility.\u201dSuch talk is reminiscent of Mr. Macron\u2019s broader approach to overhauling the economy. Some analysts have criticized the way he has pushed through changes to the labor laws, most of which have been done by the equivalent of executive order, raising questions about how democratic \u2014 or not \u2014 his methods have been.\u201cEmmanuel Macron is walking a fine line between the rehabilitation of a certain presidential authority and authoritarianism,\u201d Jean-Claude Monod, a specialist in political philosophy, said in an interview published Monday in the French daily Le Monde. \u201cOne has the impression of a deafness in front of forms of protest or political experimentations, of a will to use force for his reforms.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the G.D.P.R., Europe\u2019s Tough New Data Law, Means for You", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what it means for you.The law, which goes into effect on May 25, strengthens individual privacy rights and, more important, it has teeth. Companies can be fined up to 4 percent of global revenue \u2014 equivalent to about $1.6 billion for Facebook.Europe is attempting to push back.It\u2019s too early to know how effective the law will be, but it is being closely watched by governments globally.Not really.Supporters of the law say it will bring sweeping changes to how companies operate online, but in reality, the effect on your internet experience will be minimal. An American visiting Europe, for example, isn\u2019t likely to see a difference.If you live in one of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states, there is one change you may welcome \u2014 you are likely to see fewer of those shoe or appliance ads that follow you around the internet after you do some online shopping.As e-commerce became commonplace, a cottage industry sprang up to track people around the web and nudge them back to online stores to complete a purchase. Advertisers call these ads \u201cfine tuned,\u201d but most people consider them creepy, said Johnny Ryan, a researcher at PageFair, which makes tools to help companies work around ad-blocking software.Mr. Ryan said the new rules would make it harder for ad-targeting companies to collect and sell information.The new law requires companies to be transparent about how your data is handled, and to get your permission before starting to use it. It raises the legal bar that businesses must clear to target ads based on personal information like your relationship status, job or education, or your use of websites and apps.That means online advertising in Europe could become broader, returning to styles more akin to magazines and television, where marketers have a less detailed sense of the audience.Even if you don\u2019t notice big changes, the new law provides important privacy rights worth knowing about.But the new rules allow people to band together and file class-action style complaints, a legal approach that hasn\u2019t been as common in Europe as in the United States. Eager to exploit the new law, privacy groups are planning to file cases on behalf of groups of individuals. The hope is that a few successful lawsuits will have a ripple effect and lead companies to tighten up how they handle personal data.The law requires that the terms and conditions be written in plain, understandable language, not legalese. Companies must also give you options to block information from being gathered.But the deluge of emails is leading to concerns that users are agreeing without taking a closer look.A similar reaction came after the European Union required companies, starting in 2011, to put warnings on websites alerting users that they were being tracked. The rules have led to so many pop-up disclosure boxes that people often consent just to make the warnings disappear.Companies argue that they are being careful to comply with General Data Protection Regulation, but Giovanni Buttarelli, who oversees an independent European Union agency that advises on privacy-related policies, has been unimpressed.He has criticized the wave of privacy policy emails as being posed in a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d manner that leaves users thinking they have to accept the terms in order to keep using a service, rather than letting people choose what information to share.Mr. Buttarelli said the messages may violate the \u201cspirit\u201d of the law.It\u2019s too soon to tell.That may be an unsatisfactory answer, but the long-term effects of the new law won\u2019t be known for years.Much will depend on how strictly national regulators enforce the rules, and how they use their tight budgets. Data-protection agencies in each European Union country will be in charge of policing the companies that have European headquarters within its borders.A lot of responsibility also falls on you to keep tabs on how companies use your data.The General Data Protection Regulation provides ways to take action if your information is being misused. But the question is whether people care enough, or if trading privacy for convenience remains a worthwhile deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Heartbreak of Kanye West", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Hampton has written about music for The Village Voice, Spin, NPR and\u00a0other outlets.Mr. West thought his recent return to Twitter after an almost yearlong hiatus, with relentless contrarian, stream-of consciousness tweets from the minuscule Negro corner of the alt-right world, would read like a takeover of Twitter. But that\u2019s not how the platform works. Black Twitter runs Twitter, and Black Twitter swiftly handed Mr. West his lunch. Mr. West was reading the blowback and did exactly what a person does when he or she is losing \u2014 he dug in.Like Mr. Trump, who also brags about not reading books, Mr. West is parroting the racist right-wing talking points he has learned from watching YouTube videos. The same white power wing nuts who trolled him for years as a way of defending Taylor Swift\u2019s honor are now over the moon to hear the rapper blame President Barack Obama for not ameliorating gang violence in Chicago, to see Mr. West at the office of the gossip website TMZ blaming his own enslaved ancestors for their enslavement.Because the trolls won the election, their dangerous drivel sometimes becomes policy, as the musician John Legend tried to tell Mr. West in a series of reasonable texts that Mr. West immediately published. Those talking points from Alex Jones and company perpetuate mass criminalization and incarceration, deportation and worse.When a poll shows 20 percent of Trump supporters would have opposed the freeing of slaves, it\u2019s more than a fun punctuation ending the night on cable news. Those talking points run in tandem with textbooks used in Texas schools that describe slaves as \u201cworkers\u201d and their journey to America as \u201cimmigration.\u201d The denial of the sadism and brutality of slavery is perpetuated when there\u2019s \u201canother side\u201d arguing to keep statues and symbols of the Confederacy in public places, and when plantation tours explain the generosity with which slave owners cared for their chattel.When Mr. Legend and Mr. West later demonstrated their lasting friendship by publishing pictures of themselves at a baby shower \u201cdespite their differences,\u201d they advanced the fiction that theirs are two equal but divergent viewpoints. They are not. There is the same old white supremacy that denies black humanity, and there are people who struggle mightily against white supremacy and for black life.It would be unfair to call Mr. West\u2019s public outbursts mere stunts. He was right about the MTV Video Music Awards best female video of 2009. Beyonc\u00e9 should have won. Mr. West was at his most profound in 2005 when he said George Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people after that president did a flyby of the poor and black victims of New Orleans\u2019s levee failure.When Hurricane Katrina happened, Mr. West was a new artist and his \u201cCollege Dropout\u201d was an album that helped give millennials a clear sense of identity. He wrote about being insecure, about not being comfortable managing his new money and visibility. That honesty was refreshing. His self-reflection and self-diagnosis felt familiar to a generation that drafted dozens of confessionals a day on social media.Kids who were in high school and younger when Mr. West made his debut connected with him more than they did with M.C.s like Jay-Z or even Tupac Shakur or Biggie Smalls, who deserve respect but belonged to another era. 50 Cent seemed a Neanderthal compared with the nerdy, backpack-wearing Mr. West.Mr. West rose as the economy collapsed, and his open insecurity spoke to a generation whose struggle was the housing market collapse, not a crack epidemic. He is the son of a single mother, a professor who raised him abroad for a semester or two in China. His story was more like President Obama\u2019s than 50 Cent\u2019s.This new generation didn\u2019t necessarily believe in crowns, but Mr. West was their guy, and almost immediately after being chosen, he began to collapse from the pressure.We\u2019ve seen Mr. West melt down before. His 2013 radio interview with the journalist Sway was as unhinged as Mr. Trump\u2019s recent call-in to \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d Mr. Trump and Mr. West both seemed to want the same thing in those tirades \u2014 to be recognized as gods. Mr. Trump roared into the phone about the Breitbart calculator he uses to argue voter fraud cost him the popular vote. The rapper screamed at Sway, who seemed unwilling to concede that Mr. West is the greatest artist of his generation. Or maybe Mr. West was arguing he was the greatest artist of any generation. It\u2019s hard to remember. We got a harmless new pop culture refrain from the interview \u2014 \u201cHow, Sway?\u201d \u2014 and mostly moved on.But unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s call, Mr. West\u2019s interview with Sway was videotaped. We were witnessing something more than his outsize ego doing battle with his mammoth insecurity. His refusal to make eye contact with Sway was particularly off-putting. He spent the hour talking to the heavens \u2014 not to the interviewer, not even to the audience. Absent was the wink and nod embedded in Muhammad Ali\u2019s news conference performances, where he talked about himself in the third person and invented the kind of braggadocio that would become hip-hop\u2019s bedrock. Watching Mr. West during that interview, some of us began to worry about his mental health.Like most of his fans, I\u2019m not qualified or interested in actually attempting to diagnose an illness in Mr. West. He has shared with us that he has been medicated and hospitalized. He has also told us that his recent Twitter rant is unconnected to his mental health, that he is fine. His performance at TMZ was similar to his interview with Sway. It wasn\u2019t until Van Lathan, on the staff there, interrupted to take him on about slavery that Mr. West even seemed present in the room, and that was truly heartbreaking to watch.But what was dangerous was the way Mr. West included Candace Owens, an alt-right darling, a black woman and puppet, on his broadcast from the TMZ office. Her participation was most likely arranged by alt-right operatives. A Black Lives Matter strategist hypothesized as much on his Facebook page when he noticed white power operatives taking credit for connecting the two.With uncharacteristic generosity, Mr. West ceded the mic to Ms. Owens, who allows a racist, misogynist movement to hold her up as evidence that it is neither. Mr. Trump\u2019s speechwriters made sure to include Mr. West in his recent speech to the National Rifle Association, thanking the rapper for \u201cdoubling\u201d his approval numbers among black people. He was referring to a real poll, but he got it wrong. The doubling was only among black men, from 11 percent to 22 percent (with a margin of error of nine points).Mr. West barely owned the entire week. R. Kelly had some karma delivered to his front door, and the fascist, feeble Rudy Giuliani had his moments, embarrassing himself. But Mr. West\u2019s shrill missives from the monochromatic sunken place that is his mansion may be consequential in ways he can\u2019t fathom.Dream Hampton (@dreamhampton) is a filmmaker and writer.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scientists See Promise in Resurrecting These Rhinos That Are Nearly Extinct", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven if the technology can bring back the northern white rhinoceros, should we do it?With no members of the subspecies left in the wild and just two females remaining in captivity, it felt like the last bit of sand was draining through the rhino\u2019s hourglass. But several teams of scientists are working to flip the hourglass back over. With the right advances in assisted reproduction or cloning, there could be a second chance for this \u201cunique form of rhinoceros,\u201d said Oliver Ryder, director of conservation genetics at San Diego Zoo Global. They also point out that any resurrected northern white rhinos would likely remain in captivity, rather than roaming free in their former habitat in central and eastern Africa, where poaching for horns remains a serious threat. The researchers sequenced these genomes and compared them to genomes from southern white rhinos, the northern white rhino\u2019s closest kin, which underwent a spectacular recovery under protection over the last century, although it remains near-threatened. The scientists also discovered sufficient genetic diversity in their northern white rhino samples when compared with the southern white rhinos, Dr. Ryder said. \u201cIf it came down to the materials in the Frozen Zoo, we could turn those cells into animals.\u201dBut Marty Kardos, an evolutionary biology researcher at the University of Montana, cautioned that the southern white rhino comparison is \u201cnot necessarily worth banking on.\u201d Purely by chance, harmful mutations could exist at high frequency among the northern white rhinos, and have a detrimental effect, he said.Joseph Bennett, a conservation researcher at Carleton University in Ontario, feels the northern white rhino is a good candidate for resurrection because there\u2019s a relatively high chance of success compared to more ambitious projects like the de-extinction of the woolly mammoth or passenger pigeon.It could be a \u201creally nice \u2018good news story\u2019 for people,\u201d he said. Dr. Ryder said his team\u2019s efforts are not in lieu of, but in addition to, efforts to conserve wild animals, adding that \u201cwe are seeing species go extinct in spite of a global commitment\u201d to protect them.In light of that, he said, providing \u201cmore options for the existence of species into the future is an appropriate quest.\u201d Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Shari Redstone\u2019s response to the CBS lawsuit.\u2022 A tough road ahead for the Trump administration on trade.\u2022 Who doesn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s lifeline to ZTE?Less than an hour before hearing, Ms. Redstone issued a change to the CBS bylaws that would grant her more control of the network\u2019s board. Under the new rules, decisions on dividends would need to be approved by a \u201csupermajority\u201d of CBS\u2019s board. That likely would have blocked a potential move by most of CBS\u2019s board to issue a special dividend to water down the Redstones\u2019 voting stake to 17 percent from 79 percent.The change to bylaws is now on hold: The judge said on Wednesday that he would issue his legal opinion on Ms. Redstone\u2019s change to the bylaws in his decision on Thursday.Ahead of the hearing, Ms. Redstone\u2019s National Amusements filed its legal response to a CBS lawsuit, seeking to prevent her from blocking a special meeting of its board on whether to water down her controlling stake.Here are some of the notable parts of the filing by lawyers for National Amusements:\u2022 On CBS\u2019s contention that Ms. Redstone intends to replace its board because of its resistance to a deal: \u201cN.A.I. does not have, and has never had, any intention of replacing the CBS board or taking other action to force a merger.\u201d\u2022 Why Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery should reject a CBS board move to dilute the Redstones\u2019 voting power to 17 percent from 79 percent: \u201cThis is an unprecedented usurpation of a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting power.\u201d Later, Ms. Redstone\u2019s lawyers add, \u201cThis court has held that, absent a compelling justification (which is non-existent here), a board of directors breaches its fiduciary duty of loyalty by acting for the primary purpose of diluting a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting rights.\u201d\u2022 The revelation of which CBS director National Amusements had suggested was involved in questionable activity. The filing includes an affidavit by Robert Klieger, a CBS board member and lawyer for the Redstones (whom other directors have argued is working on behalf of Ms. Redstone), regarding a call he had had last week with Bruce Gordon, the head of the CBS board\u2019s special committee:Specifically, I noted National Amusement Inc.\u2019s discomfort with the continued CBS board position of Charles K. Gifford given certain incidents that took place in 2016 and 2017. I also discussed the possibility of facilitating Mr. Gifford\u2019s exit from the CBS board with minimal disruption and public attention, including, in the event of a merger of CBS and Viacom, through his potential non-appointment to the board of a combined company.\u2022 A lament for what Ms. Redstone is her current predicament:\u201cPlaintiffs have forced CBS\u2019s controlling stockholder into a position of having to make a Hobson\u2019s choice\u2014of either accepting massive dilution of its voting power (thereby losing control of the company and suffering the economic detriment to its stake that entails), or acting as a stockholder to prevent such dilution and protect its voting power, knowing that doing so might trigger the departure of (and payment of massive parachute payments to) key management and directors of the company.CBS filed a response to National Amusements saying that Ms. Redstone\u2019s opposition to the special meeting is proof that CBS need a temporary restraining order.\u201cUnless restrained, defendants will use the consent process to replace directors or amend bylaws in advance of Thursday\u2019s board meeting.\u201dThe context\u2014 Michael de la MercedSenate Democrats narrowly won a vote on Wednesday to save so-called net neutrality rules.Cecilia Kang of the NYT reports:The Senate passed a resolution in a 52-47 vote to overturn a decision last December by the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle Obama-era rules that prevented broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast from blocking or speeding up streams and downloads of web content in exchange for extra fees.

Yet in the last 20 years, the whites of Italy have gotten better and better.These include familiar names like Soave, where dedicated producers are now demonstrating the potential of the garganega grape. Many of Italy\u2019s vast array of grapes remain relatively new to the world\u2019s wine lists, despite their ancient origins.You may already be familiar with vermentino, verdicchio and vernaccia. But how about vespaiola, vespolina and vitovska? From good producers, all are verifiably delicious. Beyond the v\u2019s, consider carricante, grillo and erbaluce, just to name a few.Here at Wine School, exploration is our pleasure. Each unfamiliar wine we open holds the potential not only for joy, but also for adding context to our own mental wine map. Every new impression provides one additional component leading toward confident judgment and discernment \u2014 in a word, experience, which, more than classes or books, is the essential element in attaining a comfortable relationship with wine.Now, a confession: Often, but not always, I suggest wines that I am familiar with and that I know will be good or at least representative examples of the genre we are examining. Sometimes, however, I suggest a wine that I have not tried, but that I have good reason to believe will be interesting.In the case of the fianos, one of these three wines was very much not like the other two. It was the Cantina Giardino Gaia, a bottle I had not sampled before. While the Maffini and the Picariello were both classic examples of modern white wines \u2014 clear, bright and clean \u2014 the Gaia was something else entirely: hazy and amber colored.Most white wines today are made in a roughly similar manner. After the grapes are harvested, they are de-stemmed and crushed. Most of the time, the juice is quickly whisked away from the skins and seeds, which contain pigments and tannins that can add color and astringency. At most, the juice may stay in contact with the skins for a few hours.And so, the Cantina Giardino Gaia was pure, brisk and herbal, bright and alive in the glass. The wine was energetic and zesty, with citrus and mineral flavors. In the mouth, it had a pleasant rasp of astringency. As fianos go, it was very much atypical, but delicious nonetheless.By contrast, the Maffini and the Picariello followed the playbook for moderately priced, entry-level modern white wines. They were fermented at cool temperatures and aged in steel tanks, a method that enhances freshness, clarity and aromas, producing wines that are lively, clear and, texturally, at least, relatively simple.The Maffini was broad and herbal, with flavors of nuts and citrus. It had length and heft, meaning substance and character rather than heaviness. The Picariello tasted of citrus and herbs, too, though with more minerality and linearity than the rounder Maffini. It was lively and substantial, with real personality. Both were admirable and enjoyable.Aside from the differences in production, the Gaia was aged in barrels rather than steel tanks, and for a year rather than months. The barrels were old, and made of chestnut and acacia rather than oak, woods that were traditionally used in the area.I can\u2019t say that the winemaking techniques did not overshadow the expression of place in the Gaia. It would have been impossible for them not to, given how different it was. Elements of Campania shone through, though, in particular the herbal, citrus and mineral flavors that typify fianos.The Gaia was produced oxidatively, exposing the wine to small amounts of air, whether during fermentation or simply though the micro-oxygenation that takes place in barrels. This can often add complexity to aromas, flavors and textures.I love the poetry of her description, even if my own observations were more prosaic. The fianos had a clear sense of minerality, but nothing like the salinity of the carricantes. The fianos seemed richer as well, with more nutlike flavors. Obviously, they are different grapes and places, but it\u2019s interesting to wonder whether the more general consistencies of minerality are related at all to the volcanic soils.If you find the fianos intriguing, I recommend moving up a step, to those labeled Fiano di Avellino, which come from vineyard areas considered to have greater potential. Keep in mind that we have only begun to explore the potential of Italian white wines.Advertisement"}

The key assumption of that era was that markets work best when the government focuses exclusively on enforcing contract and property rights.This sort of agreement is now illegal, but businesses have nevertheless found new and creative ways to achieve monopoly profits, while antitrust enforcers have fallen behind.According to one study, the power of firms to raise prices above the competitive level or cut wages below it increased more than threefold from 1980 to 2014.To revive economic growth and restore equality, we need to update the solutions first developed a century ago. Then, the focus was on breaking up monopolies, prohibiting cartels and blocking mergers. These laws helped advance broadly shared prosperity, but owners of capital devised strategies to evade them. These strategies must be addressed with new regulatory approaches.We also need a renewed public awareness of the dangers of monopolies to ensure that in the future antitrust enforcers feel the pressure to keep up with the ever-changing faces of monopoly power.Advertisement"}

That was a tough situation, I have to tell you,\u201d the president said to Mr. Holt, his family and lawmakers from Utah during brief remarks shortly before 9 p.m.Mr. Trump also promised that \u201cwe have some others coming.\u201d\u201cWe are in the midst of some big negotiations,\u201d he said.The president gave few details, but he did mention the case of a Christian pastor in Turkey and said that the United States government had been working for the pastor\u2019s release.Mr. Holt expressed his gratitude to Mr. Trump and the lawmakers who helped secure his release from a jail in Caracas, Venezuela\u2019s capital.\u201cIt was not really the great vacation that I was looking for,\u201d he said, apparently referring to his trip to Venezuela to marry his wife, who sat on a couch nearby. \u201cBut we\u2019re still together, starting off a marriage rough, but now we are going to be together.\u201dMr. Trump made the announcement on Saturday morning that Mr. Holt was on his way home to the United States and would be reunited with his family at the White House that evening.In a tweet, Mr. Trump called Mr. Holt a \u201chostage,\u201d and said that the release would make the people of Utah happy.Mr. Holt was arrested shortly after arriving in Venezuela and was accused by the government there of stockpiling weapons. Supporters said they believed that the charges were overstated by the Venezuelan government.\u201cI could not be more honored to be able to reunite Josh with his sweet, long-suffering family,\u201d Mr. Hatch said in the statement.In the Oval Office, Mr. Hatch heaped praise upon Mr. Trump, saying the president was \u201cdoing a terrific job, and this shows why I supported you.\u201dMr. Hatch added, \u201cWhen you look back over your tenure in the presidency, this is just one of the many great things you are doing.\u201dMr. Hatch also thanked Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who met Friday with Mr. Maduro in Venezuela.In the Oval Office session on Saturday evening, Mr. Corker described some harrowing moments as he attempted to fly to the United States with Mr. Holt and his wife. As their plane was beginning to take off, the engines stopped and the aircraft returned to the gate, prompting fears that the government was stopping the departure.Mr. Corker said it turned out to be only a malfunction with some of the plane\u2019s instruments.\u201cFinally, we got out of there, and obviously Josh had a huge smile on his face,\u201d Mr. Corker told the president.Mr. Holt\u2019s release comes days after he posted two short videos to Facebook pleading for the United States government to help him. In one video, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve been begging my government for two years. They say they\u2019re doing things, but I\u2019m still here.\u201dFreeing Mr. Holt appeared to be a step to try to lower tensions between Washington and Venezuela.In addition to the gesture to the United States with the release of Mr. Holt, there were indications Mr. Maduro was also loosening his hold on some Venezuelan prisoners.\u201cI want these people to go free \u2014 and that they\u2019re offered a chance for national reconciliation,\u201d he said.Alfredo Romero, the head of a group that represents Venezuelan political prisoners, said at least 20 people were released Friday in the state of Zulia, after protesting there this year over a lack of electricity.Mr. Corker told Mr. Trump he believes that the release of Mr. Holt is evidence that there are people in Mr. Maduro\u2019s government who are willing to work with the United States to improve relations between the countries.\u201cThere are people who really want to affect the relationship in a good way,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cThey were very helpful to us.\u201dBut Omar Mora, a Venezuelan lawyer representing political prisoners, said the recent releases sidestepped the fate of the more than 450 politicians and activists, by his count, who remain jailed because the government continues to see them as a threat.\u201cThe government pretends to release people, and in the end, it doesn\u2019t release any of the political prisoners who are on our lists,\u201d Mr. Mora said.Michael D.

In the late \u201990s, companies like AltaVista and Razorfish received the most extraordinary valuations in the history of the stock market, and their foosball-table-filled offices were the subject of breathless coverage. Their employees were rich \u2014 congenital dorkiness having become phenomenally lucrative \u2014 and a \u201cnew economy\u201d was on the horizon. The proof? In some parts of the country, you could log onto America Online through a dial-up modem, sign into Kozmo.com and order a Coca-Cola to be delivered in about an hour. Ah, liberty! In 2001, the bubble burst, but the dream of a genuinely profitable, internet-fueled economy remained.That economy is now here, most visibly in the form of a sleek slab of phone on which you might be reading (or, really, scrolling) this, and the bloom is off the digital rose. You can still get a Coke delivered, but it will be handed to you by an independent contractor for Caviar, cycling around town with a humiliating giant orange box on his back, as he makes well under minimum wage. Or it will eventually come in the back seat of a robot UberEats car, which might well have slammed into a few pedestrians on the way \u2014 the price of progress. Now, or soon, anything you want can be paid for and delivered, virtually at any time, at nearly any speed. For this great convenience, Amazon can now pretty much gull every mayor in America into selling their schools, transportation systems, birthrights, etc., in order to draw 50,000 tech employees \u2014 among the least beloved specimens of humanity \u2014 to invade and comprehensively ruin their city, block by blessed block. Those employees will be mostly white, mostly men, and mostly known for upholding an industry whose sexism is towering, peerless and, according to charmers like James Damore, not even as sexist as it should be.The effects of this bargain on all of us have been well documented \u2014 even if some of its political consequences, as with the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal, are continually ramifying \u2014 but the lives of the people who work in the industry and have foisted it on us are less well known, and this is where Corey Pein\u2019s \u201cLive Work Work Work Die\u201d attempts to fill in the picture. Pein, a staff writer for the caustic and essential little magazine The Baffler, is a former newspaper reporter, who experienced the depredations of tech \u201cdisruption\u201d firsthand. Thinking he was following the money, in 2012 he joined a Seattle-based \u201cavant-garde online news service\u201d called Demotix as its editor in chief. Soon into his tenure, Demotix was bought by Corbis, an online photography database, which proceeded to reassign photographers from war zones to \u201cchase reality TV stars around red-carpet events\u201d; not long after, Pein learned that Corbis also planned to lay off half of Demotix\u2019s employees.So, in the spirit of gonzo journalism, he decides to high-tail it to the Bay Area to sell a start-up and document the horrors of his temporarily adopted home along the way. The idea he comes up with is called \u201cLaborize,\u201d a company that would hire itself out to one organization to unionize a rival \u2014 it would, say, contract with Uber to unionize Lyft \u2014 and therefore ruin the competitive advantage that comes from denying health care, steady wages and other benefits of unionization. It is a clever ploy that cuts to the heart of what makes Silicon Valley a very pure example of capitalism: the fact that it screws over, or tries to automate into the digital ether, a vast proportion of the American work force, in order to enrich, artificially and enormously, a small proportion of investors and owners, whose companies are \u2014 more often than not \u2014 profoundly unprofitable.It probably doesn\u2019t ruin the surprise to point out that Pein\u2019s efforts are a failure: His start-up plans stall out. Nor does his exhaustive, scathing description of what Silicon Valley companies do make for a serious contribution to journalism about the tech industry. More than gonzo, an aura of laziness pervades the exercise. In an emblematic passage, Pein visits the Googleplex in Mountain View, but doesn\u2019t manage to get inside any of the buildings, which in my experience is not so hard to do. Instead he wanders around outside, telling us that it \u201clooks like pretty much any other dismal suburban office park\u201d and that \u201cthe real story hid behind the blackened windows of the squat office buildings.\u201d The real story \u2014 digitizing, data mining, etc. \u2014 turns out to be what is already widely available in reporting elsewhere, in any case uncited in Pein\u2019s book.Still, despite and perhaps a little because of its lackadaisical approach to its subject, \u201cLive Work Work Work Die\u201d manages to capture something essential about Silicon Valley that has eluded other authors. This is because Pein starts from the grimy underbelly of tech and never makes it out, which accurately reflects the experience of many tech workers. We only learn of those who make it big \u2014 Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. We rarely hear of the people who fail, or work uselessly and endlessly hard, without much in the way of reward.Struggling to find an apartment in San Francisco\u2019s stratospherically overheated rental market, Pein settles for an Airbnb in which he has to share a room with four people and, because of what appears to be its uncertain legal status, has only one key. Calling it the Hacker Condo, he notes that all four residents are \u201cimmigrants or the children of immigrants, and therefore accustomed to getting jerked around,\u201d and that the foreign-born residents are on H-1B visas, an arrangement that requires them to stay employed. But the lure of making it big keeps everyone working insane hours. Many of the people he meets \u201chad a mysterious \u2018side project\u2019 \u2014 a start-up in the making \u2014 that was inevitably too ill formed to talk about, or far too technically complicated to remember.\u201d Pein realizes that most of these \u201ctech bros\u201d were \u201cdoomed to be desk jockeys for life, forever dreaming of their star turn as Job Creators.\u201dThis is an exhausting, one-note book, but the tinny, grating note Pein repeatedly strikes may nonetheless be one the world needs to hear more often. As Pein migrates from the Hacker Condo to, eventually, a literal tent ($35 a day on Airbnb), he passes through lurid publicity parties for companies like Nerdwallet, which raised $64 million in its first round of fund-raising and makes money from advertising and referral fees earned when it steers users toward certain loans or insurance policies. Its employees describe their executives (on the review site GlassDoor) as \u201ctreacherous, languishing souls who want to claw as much money as possible\u201d from their investors and clients, and claim not even to know \u201cwhat the product is.\u201d He pays $29.70 to join a start-up pitch competition \u2014 a kind of live \u201cShark Tank\u201d \u2014 whose theme is captured in the downer of a phrase \u201cHack immigration.\u201dHis failed journey around the depressing periphery of the tech industry, its warrens suffused with the distinct scent of unadulterated bull, is a preview of the bleak, airless future it aims to deliver, by driverless car or drone, to all of us.Nikil Saval is the author of \u201cCubed: The Secret History of the Workplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Instead, he used chemistry to explain how undifferentiated balls of cells generated form in organisms. And try, Turing did. \u201cHe came up with a mathematical representation that allows form to emerge from blankness,\u201d said Dr. Swinton. In Turing\u2019s model, two chemicals he called morphogens interacted on a blank arena. \u201cSuppose you\u2019ve got two of these, and one will make the skin of an animal go black and the skin of the animal go white,\u201d explained Dr. Swinton. \u201cIf you just mix these things in an arena, what you get is a gray animal.\u201d But if something caused one chemical to diffuse, or spread, faster than the other, then each chemical could concentrate in evenly spaced localized spots, together forming black and white spots or stripes. This is known as a \u201cTuring instability,\u201d and, the Chinese researchers who published the new paper determined that it could explain the way shapes emerged in salt-filtering membranes. By creating three-dimensional Turing patterns like bubbles and tubes in membranes, the researchers increased their permeability, creating filters that could better separate salt from water than traditional ones.\u201cWe can use one membrane to finish the work of two or three,\u201d said Zhe Tan, a graduate student at Zhejiang University in China and first author of the paper, which means less energy and lower cost if used for large-scale desalination operations in the future. Beyond his final publication, Turing\u2019s notes revealed the complicated ideas he was wrestling to explain. Turing appeared to be looking for a general mechanism for the creation of form \u2014 like how thought or consciousness spontaneously emerges or how sunflowers neatly pack their seeds together. But Turing would die before completing and publishing his final musings. \u201cWhat I hope we appreciate more because of him, is to value diversity and individual creativity in our science base,\u201d Dr. Dawes said. \u201cWe need people who we allow to be driven by their curiosity, and we also need people who will take those basic science ideas and turn them into useful technology.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frog-Killing Fungus Found to Have Origins on Korean Peninsula", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the 1970s and 1980s frogs and other amphibians seemed to be disappearing overnight. By 1999, researchers had determined the culprit was a deadly disease caused by chytrid fungus which infected the animals with tiny, swimming spores. Today this disease, called Chytridiomycosis, is thought to be one of the deadliest pathogens on the planet. It infects hundreds of species of amphibians and is thought to have wiped out a third of all frog species. These animals are important contributors to biodiversity, insect and disease control and may even be sources of new types of medicine.Previously, researchers were limited by the scrappy bits of the fungus\u2019s DNA they could obtain by smearing a cotton swab across the skin of a frog or a salamander.They also discovered that this Korean lineage contained strains that were more genetically diverse than any others \u2014 and because it infected animals but didn\u2019t kill them, it likely had been living with amphibians, who adapted to tolerate or defend against it, for some time. The researchers think the virulent, global strain emerged within the past century coinciding with rapid development in global technology, commerce and trade. During this time, animals stowed away in equipment or produce or they were traded directly as scientific or medical specimens, food and pets. These amphibians likely harbored the fungus, allowing it to become more virulent and spread to others not adapted to it. And it\u2019s still happening, said Dr. O\u2019Hanlon. Many regulators have assumed that animals can harbor only one kind of chytrid fungus. But Dr. Lips said this paper brings attention to how diverse strains of the fungus could slip through the cracks and cause greater declines if trade is left unregulated. \u201cThey like to say, well the horse has left the barn, and I say, well maybe one horse left the barn and all the other ones are still in there,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to make sure they don\u2019t get out either, and that they don\u2019t mate and have babies that also escape.\u201d But she emphasized that, \u201cthis is a much bigger picture than frogs, chytrid and amphibians.\u201d This case merely highlights the importance of preventing the global spread of infectious diseases for all kinds of plants and animals.

{"Headline": "What I Learned From Gay Conversion Therapy", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Rodgers is a writer, speaker and advocate for L.G.B.T.Q. people in faith communities.In the national conversation about conversion therapy, people often focus attention on the 10 states (plus Washington) that have banned the practice for minors. But these laws, and this conversation, address conversion therapy only as it\u2019s practiced by mental health professionals with minors. That\u2019s not where most conversion therapy is happening, though. I know, because I spent the better part of my 20s involved in it.Most conversion therapy occurs not with mental health professionals but in conservative Christian communities. Numbers are hard to come by, because the communities usually don\u2019t come out and say they\u2019re doing conversion therapy; in fact, they\u2019re often skeptical of therapy in general. Groups that help people \u201cleave homosexuality\u201d are usually nonprofit ministries, and the counseling is facilitated by pastors and lay leaders who are not trained professionals. These groups are protected by religious freedom laws, so laws banning conversion therapy for minors do not apply to them.These communities will urge countless more adults to take a similar path. And while adults have the power to leave or remain in those communities, my heart still goes out to them. They face intense pressure to rid themselves of desires that research has shown will never go away.I was taken to an \u201cex-gay\u201d organization when I came out at the age of 17, and I spent almost 10 years involved in a member ministry of Exodus International, an umbrella organization that promoted conversion therapy and that shut down in 2013. From that experience, here are a few things to consider as we think about the future of conversion therapy in Christian communities.First, it\u2019s important to know that the people in conversion therapy don\u2019t actually become straight. If you listen to their testimonies, they say they decided to \u201cfind their identity in Christ\u201d rather than in their sexuality. They show pictures of themselves flouting stereotypical gender norms in \u201cbefore\u201d pictures and wearing clothes that fit within those norms in \u201cafter\u201d pictures. They try not to engage in sex with people of the same gender, and some even date and marry people of the opposite sex. But very few in the videos say their attractions changed.I attended several of my gay friends\u2019 weddings to people of the opposite sex, and I sat across from them years later when they grieved over the end of their marriage. They might have changed the way they identified, but they felt a longing for intimacy with someone of the same sex that simply could not be met by their spouses. Some white-knuckled their way through the rest of their lives in these marriages, often with secret hookups that left them deeply ashamed, sometimes suicidal. Others eventually ended their marriages, and they despaired over the pain they caused their spouses and children.These stories never show up in the short videos on ex-gay ministries\u2019 websites. Ex-gay organizations create emotional short films with earnest young people who talk about hope and redemption, and then they quietly remove the videos when these very same people come out years later with the truth about themselves that they tried to suppress. In fact, that\u2019s what happened to me.Equally important, the narrative that people find \u201cfreedom from homosexuality through Jesus\u201d fails to acknowledge the existence of the thousands of people who identify as L.G.B.T.Q. Christians. Sexual and gender minorities do not have to choose between their faith and queerness: Both parts of their complex identities belong, and the two actually inform each other. I\u2019m engaged to a woman named Amanda Hite, and our shared passion for Jesus is central to our relationship.I feel compassion for the people who will attend the Freedom March on Saturday. The videos on their Facebook page feature young people who say they left a lifestyle of anonymous sex, drug addiction and despair. But I have a lot of L.G.B.T.Q. friends, and I don\u2019t know any who would describe their lives in that way. My community comprises queer pastors, psychologists, professors and entrepreneurs. Some of them are married, some are celibate, many are sober, and all of them are extraordinary human beings.I can\u2019t help wondering whether the young people in the videos found themselves in destructive cycles because of the shame they carried from the teaching they heard growing up. It\u2019s hard for me to believe they would seek to rid themselves of their God-given desire to love someone of the same sex if it weren\u2019t for the leaders in their communities who fail to consider the possibility that they\u2019re wrong about the value and dignity of L.G.B.T.Q. people made in the image of God.As several Christian leaders have already said: If the gospel someone preaches is not good news for the marginalized \u2014 for people of color, those with disabilities, immigrants and L.G.B.T.Q. people \u2014 then it\u2019s not good news for anyone. The message the organizers of the Freedom March preach is certainly not good news for people like me. But I have found the Gospel of Jesus \u2014 the one who drew near to the outcasts and touched the despised with his own hands \u2014 to be very good news to me as a lesbian Christian. I want those attending the Freedom March to know this good news is for them, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Scientists Made Snails Remember Something That Never Happened to Them", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTransferring memories from one living thing to another sounds like the plot of an episode of \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d But it may be more realistic than it sounds \u2014 at least for snails. In experiments by Dr. Glanzman and colleagues, when these snails get a little electric shock, they briefly retract their frilly siphons, which they use for expelling waste. A snail that has been shocked before, however, retracts its siphon for much longer than a new snail recruit.Recently, the scientists realized that even when they interfered with their trained snails\u2019 brain cells in a way that should have removed the memory completely, some vestige remained. They decided to see whether something beyond the brain cells\u2019 connections to each other \u2014 namely, RNA \u2014 could be hanging on to the memory.You might remember RNA from high school biology: It is best known for ferrying messages between the genome and the rest of the cell. But scientists have gradually realized that there is more to RNA than playing messenger. There are some kinds of RNA that, instead of carrying messages, help switch genes on and off. They have been shown to be involved in long-term memory in snails, mice and rats, through their ability to influence chemical tags on DNA. These tags in turn influence whether a gene will be turned on in an organism.To understand what was happening in their snails, the researchers first extracted all the RNA from the brain cells of trained snails, and injected it into new snails. To their surprise, the new snails kept their siphons wrapped up much longer after a shock, almost as if they\u2019d been trained. Next, the researchers took the brain cells of trained snails and untrained snails and grew them in the lab. They bathed the untrained neurons in RNA from trained cells, then gave them a shock, and saw that they fired in the same way that trained neurons do. The memory of the trained cells appeared to have been transferred to the untrained ones.Dr. Glanzman said that this is the first study since the flatworm work to propose that memories can be transferred in such a way. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m way out on a limb, frankly,\u201d he said. The team\u2019s findings are a long way still from being applied to people and how our memories form. But Dr. Glanzman hopes others will try to replicate the experiments in other animals, potentially opening the door one day to understanding how RNA and genetic tags on DNA could be involved in memory.

But, on the East Coast, clams are especially summery.I\u2019ve long wanted to spend a month or two on the beach with a rake and a bucket, clamming every day and eating my bounty every night. A big pot of steamed clams would always be welcome, whether flavored with garlic and parsley, or with lemongrass and chiles. I would make chowders of every sort, paella with clams and, of course, a lot of clam pasta, perhaps in a light, tomatoey broth, or \u201cacqua pazza.\u201dMany Italian recipes call for simmering fish and shellfish in acqua pazza, or crazy water. It\u2019s not a loony notion, just a quick way to make a small amount of tasty broth, something obviously more flavorful than poaching seafood in plain water.Every cook prepares crazy water differently, but most recipes involve olive oil, tomato and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Garlic, parsley, capers, lemon and even smashed anchovy could also be part of the mixture.It\u2019s the perfect medium to simply and quickly cook fish fillets or shrimp. It takes only a few minutes to put together, and the cooking liquid, conveniently, is also the brothlike sauce. But the spicy broth can be put to good use, too, in a stellar casual dish of clams and spaghetti. You suck the clams from their shells. You attack all the savory juices with soup spoons and chunks of crusty bread.For a finishing flourish and to give the dish an even more summery feel, I add basil leaves and colorful fresh cherry tomatoes, halved and drizzled with olive oil and salt.

The reorganization was intended to streamline the company and clarify who oversees what after a long period of growth and numerous acquisitions, according to another person involved.Facebook now plans to organize its product and engineering teams under three new categories, grouping its biggest moneymaking services together and separating them from its moonshot technologies.One new group will focus on Facebook\u2019s key products, including the social network itself, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, all of which generate the most revenue for the company. The second will concentrate on emerging technologies such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. The third will be centered on ads, personnel, security and growth.Facebook\u2019s key products group will be run by Chris Cox, its chief product officer. The emerging technologies division will be led by Mike Schroepfer, the chief technology officer. And Javier Olivan, a vice president of growth, will lead the final group.Other executives are changing jobs as part of the shifts. WhatsApp, for instance, will now be led by Chris Daniels, a Facebook executive who was previously tasked with bringing new people online through a free or affordable version of Facebook called Internet.org.The roles of the company\u2019s top two leaders \u2014 Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer \u2014 remain unchanged. Ms. Sandberg\u2019s business teams are unaffected by the restructuring.Ari Ratner, a former Obama administration official who now runs Inside Revolution, a strategic communications firm, said the restructuring would likely have little impact on the root issues that Facebook has been grappling with.This \u201cwill have minimal impact on the issues themselves,\u201d said Mr. Ratner. \u201cIf you want to send the message things will be different, I\u2019m not sure if that accomplishes much.\u201dUnder Facebook\u2019s new emerging technologies group, Mr. Zuckerberg has also created a new team focused on blockchain, a digital ledger that underpins virtual currencies like Bitcoin.

{"Headline": "How a Low-Carb Diet Might Aid People With Type 1 Diabetes", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike many children, Andrew Hightower, 13, likes pizza, sandwiches and dessert.But Andrew has Type 1 diabetes, and six years ago, in order to control his blood sugar levels, his parents put him on a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet. His mother makes him recipes with diabetic-friendly ingredients that won\u2019t spike his blood sugar, like pizza with a low-carb, almond-flour crust; homemade bread with walnut flour instead of white flour; and yogurt topped with blueberries, raspberries and nuts.Andrew\u2019s diet requires careful planning \u2014 he often takes his own meals with him to school. But he and his parents say it makes it easier to manage his condition and, since starting the diet, his blood sugar control has markedly improved and he has not had any diabetes complications requiring trips to the hospital.\u201cI do this so that I can be healthy,\u201d Andrew, who lives with his parents in Jacksonville, Fla., said of his diet. \u201cWhen I eventually move out and go to college, I\u2019m going to keep up what I\u2019m doing because I\u2019m on the right path.\u201dIt found that children and adults with Type 1 diabetes who followed a very low-carb, high-protein diet for an average of just over two years \u2014 combined with the diabetes drug insulin at smaller doses than typically required on a normal diet \u2014 had \u201cexceptional\u201d blood sugar control. They had low rates of major complications, and children who followed it for years did not show any signs of impaired growth.The study found that the participants\u2019 average hemoglobin A1C a long-term barometer of blood sugar levels, fell to just 5.67 percent. An A1C under 5.7 is considered normal, and it is well below the threshold for diabetes, which is 6.5 percent.\u201cTheir blood sugar control seemed almost too good to be true,\u201d said Belinda Lennerz, the lead author of the study and an instructor in the division of pediatric endocrinology at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing we typically see in the clinic for Type 1 diabetes.\u201dWhile it was not a clinical trial, the study is striking because it highlights a community of patients who have been \u201cextraordinarily successful\u201d at controlling their diabetes with a very low-carb diet, said Dr. David M. Harlan, the co-director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, who was not involved in the study. \u201cPerhaps the surprise is that for this large number of patients it is much safer than many experts would have suggested.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m excited to see this paper,\u201d Dr. Harlan added. . \u201cIt should reopen the discussion about whether this is something we should be offering our patients as a therapeutic approach.\u201dThe authors of the paper cautioned that the findings should not lead patients to alter their diabetes management without consulting their doctors, and that large clinical trials will be necessary to determine whether this approach should be used more widely.About 1.25 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Managing the condition requires administering insulin throughout the day, especially when consuming meals high in carbs, which raise blood sugar more than other nutrients. Over time, chronically elevated blood sugar can lead to nerve and kidney damage and cardiovascular disease. The standard approach for people with Type 1 diabetes is to match carb intake with insulin. But the argument for restricting carbs is that it keeps blood sugar more stable and requires less insulin, resulting in fewer highs and lows. The approach has not been widely studied or embraced for Type 1 diabetes, but some patients swear by it.Dr. Bernstein argues that the fewer carbs consumed, the easier it is to stabilize blood sugar with insulin. He recommends foods like nonstarchy vegetables, seafood, nuts, meat, yogurt, tofu and recipes made with almond flour, sugar substitutes and other low-glycemic ingredients. His plan emphasizes protein intake, which he says is especially important for growing children.Dr. Carrie Diulus, an orthopedic surgeon with Type 1 diabetes who follows a low-carb vegan diet, credits the Bernstein approach with helping her keep her blood sugar under control. \u201cIt allows me to perform complex spine surgeries without worrying about my diabetes because my blood sugar stays relatively stable,\u201d said Dr. Diulus, who helped inspire the new study when researchers learned about her participation in the TypeOneGrit community.The most striking finding of the new report was that A1C levels, on average, fell from 7.15 percent, in the diabetic range, to 5.67 percent, which is normal. The rate of diabetes-related hospitalizations also fell, from 8 percent before the diet to 2 percent after, including fewer hospitalizations for hypoglycemic seizures.Those following the diet had increased LDL cholesterol, likely from consuming more saturated fat, which some experts said was potentially concerning and deserved further study. But other heart disease risk factors appeared favorable: They had high HDL cholesterol, the protective kind, and low triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood linked to heart disease.Dr. Joyce Lee, a diabetes expert at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study, said the findings were impressive and merited further follow-up, and that patients who wanted to explore a low-carb approach might do so while being monitored by their health care team. But she also noted that the patients in the new study were a \u201chighly motivated\u201d group, and that it would be difficult for many people to adopt the restrictive regimen they followed.\u201cThe reality is that it\u2019s really hard to do low-carb, given our cultural norms,\u201d said Dr. Lee, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan.In an interview, Dr. Bernstein, a co-author on the paper, said it demonstrates what he sees in his practice: That there are diabetics on his regimen \u201cwho are walking around with normal blood sugars and they are happy about it, healthy, and growing if they are kids.\u201dDerek Raulerson, 46, a human resources manager in Alabama, agrees. Both he and his son, Connor, 13, have Type 1 diabetes. Mr. Raulerson said he struggled for years to control his blood sugar. But six years ago, he gave up juice, bread, potatoes and other simple carbs, and made protein and nonstarchy vegetables the focus of his meals.Since going low-carb, he said, he has lost weight, cut in half the amount of insulin he uses daily, and watched his A1C fall from the diabetic range to normal levels.\u201cI have normalized, steady blood sugars now,\u201d he said. \u201cI am no longer on the roller coaster.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jury Leaves $4 to Family of Man Killed by Sheriff\u2019s Deputy, Along With Many Questions", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than four years, questions swirled about the shooting death of Gregory Vaughn Hill Jr. at his home in Fort Pierce, Fla. After all, there were only three witnesses to how the entire episode unfolded: two St. Lucie County sheriff\u2019s deputies and Mr. Hill.Mr. Hill, a 30-year-old African-American, was fatally shot by a white sheriff\u2019s deputy who had responded to a noise complaint about music Mr. Hill had been playing in his garage. Toxicology reports showed Mr. Hill was drunk at the time. And after a brief encounter with the deputies, he was discovered dead inside the garage with a gun in his back pocket; the deputies said he had been holding it during their confrontation, though that claim is in dispute. Mr. Hill had been shot three times by one of the deputies, Christopher Newman.Among other things, a federal jury hearing a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by Mr. Hill\u2019s family was asked to decide whether his constitutional rights had been violated and whether his estate should be awarded damages. How much, jurors were asked, were the pain and suffering of Mr. Hill\u2019s three children worth?Last week, the jurors delivered their verdict. Deputy Newman had not used excessive force, they concluded, but the St. Lucie County sheriff, Ken Mascara, had been ever so slightly negligent given Deputy Newman\u2019s actions. The jury awarded $4 in damages: $1 for funeral expenses and $1 for each child\u2019s loss.Because jurors also found that the sheriff\u2019s office was only 1 percent at fault in the death, that award was reduced to four cents. And furthermore, because jurors found that Mr. Hill was intoxicated and mostly to blame for the shooting, a lawyer for his family said Tuesday that a judge would reduce the four-cent award to nothing.\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d the family lawyer, John M. Phillips, said.\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Mr. Hill\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Monique Davis, said. \u201cThere are a lot of questions I want to ask.\u201dSo far, Ms. Davis and Mr. Phillips said, they have not gotten any answers. Mr. Phillips said jurors did not stay after the verdict last week to speak with lawyers and have not approached him since. Through a spokeswoman, Judge Robin L. Rosenberg declined to comment on the case or release any information about the jurors.\u201cDeputy Newman was placed in a very difficult situation, and like so many fellow law enforcement officers must do every day, he made the best decision he could for the safety of his partner, himself, and the public given the circumstances he faced,\u201d he said. \u201cWe appreciate the jury\u2019s time and understanding.\u201dA lawyer representing Sheriff Mascara and Deputy Newman did not respond to an email seeking comment.The lawsuit was filed in 2016 by Mr. Hill\u2019s mother, Viola Bryant, on behalf of his estate. Mr. Phillips said that although he had deferred to the jury, he had signaled in court that the estate was seeking at least several hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages.Mr. Phillips said that a grand jury did not bring criminal charges against Deputy Newman.Court documents lay out what happened on Jan. 14, 2014. Around 3 p.m., a mother picking children up from an elementary school heard loud music coming from the garage of a home nearby. She called in a noise complaint, and two St. Lucie County sheriff\u2019s deputies \u2014 Deputy Newman and Edward Lopez \u2014 responded. When they arrived at Mr. Hill\u2019s home, the garage door was closed; they banged on it, and eventually it opened to reveal Mr. Hill.Whether Mr. Hill, who worked at a Coca-Cola factory and had a history of serious traffic offenses, was holding a gun and whether he was ordered to drop it are in dispute.Regardless, the garage door was eventually closed, and Deputy Newman fired four times through it, striking Mr. Hill once in the head and twice in the abdomen. The entire episode took less than two minutes.Eventually, a SWAT team arrived, released chemical agents into the home and used a robot to pierce the garage door and photograph the inside. The authorities then realized Mr. Hill was dead.The only gun recovered was found in Mr. Hill\u2019s back pocket and was not loaded. Lawyers have argued about whether it was possible for Mr. Hill to have moved the gun to his pocket after the garage door closed.Toxicology reports revealed that Mr. Hill\u2019s blood-alcohol content was several times the legal limit to drive.According to a verdict form, the jury found that Mr. Hill was responsible for 99 percent of the negligence in the case.Mr. Phillips said he would have preferred for the jury to have found that there was no negligence than to have found that there was and awarded such paltry damages.\u201cI think they were trying to insult the case,\u201d Mr. Phillips said of the jury. \u201cWhy go there with the $1? That was the hurtful part.\u201dEight hours into a 10-hour deliberation the jury indicated that it was unable to reach a verdict. Mr. Phillips said some appeared visibly \u201cincensed\u201d and red in the face.Still, they were sent back to continue deliberating; eventually, the jury said they had a verdict.\u201cThere was a tug of war somewhere in there,\u201d Ms. Davis, 35, said. \u201cAnd then everybody\u2019s mind changed to one? Something went on.\u201dMr. Phillips added, \u201cIt seems like jurors gave up.\u201dHe said he was drafting a motion for a new trial. If the motion is denied, he said, he will file an appeal.\u201cI\u2019m going to keep fighting until I get some justice,\u201d said Ms. Davis, who had planned to marry Mr. Hill less than two months from the day he died. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way I\u2019m going to get peace.\u201dFrances Robles contributed reporting.

Although many Times employees are journalism-school graduates who have always wanted to report, produce or edit, \u201cthere\u2019s certainly a subset of people that have come from theater and the restaurant industry,\u201d Mr. McElroy said.Mr. Moon, frequently referred to as the \u201cnewsroom ham,\u201d is known for his knack for bringing absurdity to the mundane.Mr. Moon approaches daily tasks \u2014 like ordering ergonomic equipment or making signs for conference rooms \u2014 with levity. The self-proclaimed Times \u201cHead of Eating,\u201d he\u2019s the guy who always manages to find, and help himself to, any snacks that appear in the office. (\u201cI can sniff out free food like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d he said.)\u201cHe\u2019s built up quite a fan base,\u201d said The Times\u2019s senior night editor, Steve Kenny. \u201cHe knows names, habits, whereabouts and interests of so many of his colleagues, and he plays to his audience.\u201d\u201cHe has a whole other agenda in his life and career, but he still doesn\u2019t phone it in here. He is very present,\u201d Mr. McElroy said. \u201cSomehow I think it makes all of us feel a little less stressed out.\u201dAccording to his parents, Mr. Moon has always had his own vision. When he was in elementary school, his mother encouraged him to play baseball. But one day, he walked off the field during the middle of the game, tired of being stuck out in right field. \u201cThe coach and I were trying to convince him to go back out and he just said: \u2018It\u2019s boring. I don\u2019t want to do this,\u2019 \u201d his mother, Angela Moon, remembered.Mr. Moon said his inspiration to be an actor came when he was 10 and watched a commercial for \u201cFight Club\u201d starring Brad Pitt. In high school he became a champion fencer; he planned to fence at Ohio State, but once he was enrolled, he decided to pursue theater instead.After graduating, Mr. Moon moved to New York and got a job selling merchandise \u2014 programs, T-shirts, fridge magnets \u2014 for Broadway shows. While appearing in a play, he met an actor who was married to a Times employee, and Mr. Moon applied for a job at The Times.Recently promoted to supervisor on The Times\u2019s newsroom operations team, he now oversees a group of news assistants who help with building operations. But his schedule is flexible and allows for some acting commitments. \u201cMost of the time I\u2019m just going for an audition, which is usually like 15 minutes, and then I\u2019ll come back,\u201d Mr. Moon said. (He also uses his lunch breaks.)He recently appeared in Season 1 of \u201cThe Tick,\u201d a comic-book-inspired series on Amazon, in a recurring role as one of the bad guys, Khufu. He\u2019s now also writing a television series called \u201cThem\u201d which deals with gender issues in rural America.Still, his parents would like to see him commit to the stability of a job at The Times.His father, Jim Moon, said he told Paul, \u201cIf you get cast in a role, don\u2019t just say, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ve made it and I\u2019m resigning.\u2019 \u201dMr. Moon says that\u2019s the plan for now \u2014 until, of course, \u201cI book something huge.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As their ancestors had done for centuries, they conducted military exercises amid the pageantry.But that year was different.A few months earlier, a deadly earthquake and tsunami had hit eastern Japan, sending 32-foot waves over the Fukushima Daiichi power plant and triggering the world\u2019s largest nuclear meltdown since Chernobyl. Despite death and displacement, and the loss of their horses and their armory, the samurai decided they had to come together. \u201cI\u2019ve been investigating the evacuees not as victims, but as part of a thousands-year-old folk culture of the area and representation of Japanese identity, examining how they are surviving and fighting their fate to retain their sense of self,\u201d she said. \u201cThese festival rites, which are rooted in the local land, have fostered people\u2019s sense of pride in their hometowns and created this firm sense of identity,\u201d she said. \u201cConscious or not, every person of this land has been connected to the Nomaoi throughout its long history.\u201dPersuading the samurai to document their recovery process wasn\u2019t easy at first. Ms. Takasugi, who is Japanese, had to gain their trust. \u201cIt was very difficult to convince them to be photographed wearing their jinbaori, standing in their hometown where they have emotional attachment,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, they understand my work and it became easier.\u201d It also forced her to re-examine her own past.\u201cI had been fighting for my identity then when I first took photos of Soma Nomaoi,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more I listened to their story, spent time with them, and took photos of them, the more I came to feel that I am taking self-portraits.\u201dBut others are determined to stay connected to their land and rituals.Advertisement"}

Both Anglos and Filipinos have gone out of their way to bring people together. They cheer each others children on. They help each other when tragedies hit. They share meals together, often.And in conversations from the pub to the piggery, I heard both pride and frustration: pride, because people felt that what they had learned about how to build a multicultural community should be applied more broadly; frustration, because small-town views are so often ignored.Canberra, they said, was too focused on petty squabbles and the problems with immigration. City elites, they added, rarely invest much time in engaging with people who are different.\u201cCity people are so wrapped up in their own world,\u201d said Gail Smith, the breeding supervisor at Kia-Ora, the pig farm Tom runs with his sons. \u201cThey need to broaden their horizons.\u201dMany of the Filipinos I met in Pyramid Hill agreed, having moved from cities like Brisbane.Their comments made me think not just of my own life in Sydney, but also New York \u2014 a diverse but highly segregated city by race and income, where people often think they\u2019re open-minded simply because they share a subway car with people from different backgrounds.In fact, it takes quite a lot more than proximity to create social cohesion \u2014 a society that truly reflects the Enlightenment principle of equality for all.But Pyramid Hill speaks to something else: the power of individual actions, sustained over time.At the end of the day, many people told me, countries \u2014 like towns, or city neighborhoods, or even sports teams \u2014 only cohere when people prioritize getting to know each other and looking out for each other.I keep coming back to what Tom told me when I asked why Pyramid Hill seemed to be so integrated, with connections spanning ethnic boundaries and conversations that go beyond platitudes or conventional wisdom.\u201cPeople in the country mix, and need to mix,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just different out here; it\u2019s the only way to survive.\u201dSomething to chew on.______Before we dive into the week\u2019s stories you shouldn\u2019t miss, along with a recommendation, a bit of community housekeeping is in order:\u2022 Many of you shared fantastic lists of Top 5 things you love about Sydney (and one you loathe).

{"Headline": "In India, Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp Plays Central Role in Elections", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANGALORE, India \u2014 Waving a giant saffron flag, Pranav Bhat last week joined a political rally for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India\u2019s ruling party here in this sweltering port city on the southwest coast.Milling on a vast field with his college buddies, Mr. Bhat, 18, cheered for Mr. Modi and his Hindu-oriented Bharatiya Janata Party, which was trying to wrest control of Karnataka state from the more secular Indian National Congress in legislative elections.Yet the most intense political campaigning was not taking place on the streets. Instead, the action was happening on WhatsApp, a messaging service owned by Facebook that has about 250 million users in India.\u201cEvery minute, I\u2019m getting a message,\u201d said Mr. Bhat, a college student.Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp is taking an increasingly central role in elections, especially in developing countries. More than any other social media or messaging app, WhatsApp was used in recent months by India\u2019s political parties, religious activists and others to send messages and distribute news to Karnataka\u2019s 49 million voters. While many messages were ordinary campaign missives, some were intended to inflame sectarian tensions and others were downright false, with no way to trace where they originated.In the run-up to the May 12 vote in the state \u2014 the results of which are set to be announced on Tuesday \u2014 the B.J.P. and Congress parties claimed to have set up at least 50,000 WhatsApp groups between them to spread their messages. At the same time, many others \u2014 their identities are unknown \u2014 distributed videos, audio clips, posts and false articles designed specifically to rile up the area\u2019s Hindu-Muslim fissures.Like the rest of India, Karnataka is a Hindu majority state. A staple of electoral politics here is pitting Muslims against Hindus, and various Hindu castes against each other.Ankit Lal, a top strategist for the Aam Aadmi Party, which fielded 28 candidates for Karnataka\u2019s 224 legislative seats, said WhatsApp has become the most important tool in digital campaigning. \u201cWe wrestle on Twitter. The battle is on Facebook. The war is on WhatsApp,\u201d he said.WhatsApp has largely escaped that notice because it is used more heavily outside the United States, with people in countries like India, Brazil and Indonesia sending a total of 60 billion messages a day. And unlike Facebook and Instagram, where much of the activity is publicly visible online, WhatsApp\u2019s messages are generally hidden because it began as a person-to-person communication tool.Yet WhatsApp has several features that make it a potential tinderbox for misinformation and misuse. Users can remain anonymous, identified only by a phone number. Groups, which are capped at 256 members, are easy to set up by adding the phone numbers of contacts. People tend to belong to multiple groups, so they often get exposed to the same messages repeatedly. When messages are forwarded, there is no hint of where they originated. And everything is encrypted, making it impossible for law enforcement officials or even WhatsApp to view what\u2019s being said without looking at the phone\u2019s screen.\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with ghosts,\u201d he said. Boom worked with Facebook during the Karnataka elections to flag fake news appearing on the social network.WhatsApp officials said they are concerned about misuse of the platform, whose terms of service forbid hate speech, threats of violence and false statements. A few weeks ago, its systems detected an attempt by someone in Karnataka to create dozens of groups very quickly using automation. After some people reported getting spam from these groups, the company blocked them all. WhatsApp declined to say who it suspected was behind the group creation.\u201cWe\u2019re working to give people more control over groups and are constantly evolving our tools to block automated content,\u201d WhatsApp said in a statement, adding that it was stepping up education on its safety features and how to spot fake news and hoaxes.India\u2019s Congress party, which has ruled the country for most of the period since independence, has lost control of the central government and several key states but has held on to power in Karnataka. If the B.J.P. wins the state when votes are counted on Tuesday, it would give Mr. Modi\u2019s party crucial momentum ahead of India\u2019s 2019 national elections.Neelanjan Sircar, who was in Karnataka last week studying electoral behavior for the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, said the flood of WhatsApp messages probably did not change voters\u2019 political views. But they did push emotional buttons and increase turnout in areas with strong caste or religious divisions.\u201cWhat it does do is get people out on the street,\u201d Mr. Sircar said. State officials said voter turnout was 72 percent, the highest level since 1952.Four years ago, during India\u2019s national parliamentary elections that swept Mr. Modi to power, the primary digital tool was Facebook. But as smartphone use in India has exploded over the past year and a half, WhatsApp became the country\u2019s default communication mode \u2014 and the preferred medium for distributing campaign messages.So when the time came to gear up for Karnataka\u2019s state elections, the parties turned to the same WhatsApp playbook.\u201cWhatsApp works like a nuclear chain reaction,\u201d said Randeep Singh Surjewala, the Congress party\u2019s chief spokesman.U.T. Khader, an incumbent member of Karnataka\u2019s legislative assembly, experienced the WhatsApp effect firsthand. Just before the election, Mr. Khader, a Muslim in the Congress party, was the target of what Mangalore police said was a disturbing new type of WhatsApp attack: a series of profane audio messages purporting to be an escalating exchange of threats between Hindus and Muslims over his candidacy.In one recording, which was supposedly a phone call between two Hindu political activists, one voice harangued the other for putting a saffron-colored shawl, which the B.J.P. views as a Hindu symbol, around Mr. Khader.\u201cWhy did you put a saffron shawl on Khader? Do you love your life or not?\u201d the first voice said. \u201cIf I shove a knife into you, do you think Khader will come to your support?\u201dLater messages sounded like they came from Muslims threatening to kill the first voice in response. \u201cSon of a prostitute, I\u2019m warning you,\u201d said one. \u201cI\u2019ll take you out.\u201d The messages were sent to various WhatsApp groups, so they were heard by many voters.Mr. Khader, who has represented the area for more than a decade and won with a large margin last time, said the alleged conversations were fake and recorded in a studio.He said WhatsApp has a social responsibility to stop such hate speech, but he also believed the negative messages backfired, increasing the support he got from his constituents, half of whom are Muslim. And WhatsApp has been useful for his campaign in other ways.\u201cTV channels and newspapers largely tend to ignore me,\u201d Mr. Khader said. \u201cWhatsApp has helped me reach my supporters without the help of the mainstream media.\u201dMr. Bhat, the college student and B.J.P. youth leader, said WhatsApp has been effective for him as well. After the polls closed on Saturday, he said the messages he shared with the 60 voters assigned to him had helped persuade 47 of them to vote for the B.J.P., including 13 who were previously uncommitted.\u201cI was successful in making them vote for B.J.P.,\u201d he said.Sudipto Mondal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Industry Lawyer Expected to Head F.T.C. Consumer Protection", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe lawyer, Andrew M. Smith, would recuse himself from any potential investigations or enforcement involving dozens of companies he has worked for over the past two years while at Covington & Burling in Washington, including many banks, lenders, credit-reporting agencies and technology companies, according to two people familiar with his proposed appointment but were not authorized to speak publicly.Joseph J. Simons, the F.T.C.\u2019s chairman, has put Mr. Smith\u2019s appointment up for a vote, causing debate among the five commissioners, one person close to the F.T.C. said. Such appointments are typically perfunctory votes. Four of the commissioners, including Mr. Simons, were sworn in this month. Mr. Simons and the two other Republican commissioners are expected to approve Mr. Smith\u2019s appointment, the person said.Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic senator from Connecticut and the ranking member of the Senate\u2019s consumer protection subcommittee, said in an interview that regardless of his recusals, Mr. Smith had the wrong r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to run the nation\u2019s top consumer protection office.\u201cIt isn\u2019t the specific clients. It\u2019s the culture and mind-set that\u2019s important. He\u2019s on the wrong side of these issues,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said. \u201cI can imagine worse choices, but not many.\u201dMr. Blumenthal said Mr. Smith\u2019s appointment was particularly concerning given that, for a congressional hearing on the Equifax breach last fall, the trade group representing credit reporting agencies chose Mr. Smith to testify on behalf of the industry.In that testimony, Mr. Smith said he did not think credit bureaus should have a fiduciary duty to consumers whose data they collect, and that current regulations on the industry were sufficient.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, criticized Mr. Smith\u2019s impending appointment. \u201cInstead of demanding accountability, the F.T.C. puts Equifax\u2019s hired gun in charge of the bureau that\u2019s supposed to protect consumers,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis is corruption, plain and simple.\u201dDavid Vladeck, head of the consumer protection bureau from 2009 to 2012, said some recusals were common for F.T.C. officials, but it is unusual for an official to have to step aside from his office\u2019s most important cases.\u201cThere\u2019s no question about his qualifications. The question is, Covington has a very large practice in many of the fields where the bureau is supposed to be the principal law enforcer, including financial regulation, privacy and data security,\u201d said Mr. Vladeck, who now teaches law at Georgetown University. \u201cSo there are legitimate questions to ask about how far-reaching the recusals will be.\u201dMr. Vladeck added that the Facebook and Equifax cases were \u201ctwo extremely important investigations and both of them will be precedent-setting.\u201dThe F.T.C. confirmed in March that it was investigating whether Facebook violated a consent decree it signed in 2011 after the regulator concluded Facebook routinely shared its users\u2019 data without permission.The decree required the company to give users more control over their data and assess other potential privacy risks. In recent months, Facebook has said the political data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested the public profile data of up to 87 million of its users.The F.T.C. is also investigating Equifax, one of the three major consumer credit reporting agencies, after it revealed last year that hackers had gained access to company data that potentially compromised the personal data of about 143 million Americans.Mr. Vladeck said he did not have any recusals when he was tapped to lead the bureau, but that was unusual. He said the bureau\u2019s acting director, Thomas Pahl, had recused himself from the Equifax investigation because of past legal work for the company.Terrell McSweeny, a former F.T.C. commissioner who stepped down last month, said that although the number of Mr. Smith\u2019s recusals seemed atypical, she was confident the bureau would be able to effectively investigate Facebook, Equifax and others, in part because there are able staff members already at work on those cases. \u201cThe F.T.C. is a strong institution,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Academics, meanwhile, believe \u201cUncle Drew\u201d is the first feature film of its kind, taking product placement one step further in a new avenue for branding and signaling the film industry\u2019s willingness to \u2014 ahem \u2014 play ball.In short, Pepsi needs to tap new audiences for its product, and \u201cUncle Drew\u201d is, as Rohit Deshpande, a marketing professor at Harvard Business School, put it, \u201canother salvo in the cola wars.\u201dThe \u201cUncle Drew\u201d story begins in 2011, when Mr. Irving, then a 19-year-old newcomer to the N.B.A., agreed to appear in a Super Bowl promotion for Pepsi. The collaboration went well and Pepsi signed him to a deal. Afterward, Pepsi\u2019s agency partner, Davie Brown Entertainment, and Mr. Irving conceived the idea of a geriatric character who would show young players what real basketball looked like. Pepsi executives were intrigued. They wanted to shift away from traditional advertising and toward storytelling.With Mr. Irving\u2019s character, Pepsi hopes to extend its brand while entertaining viewers at the same time.\u201cEveryone has so many marketing methods coming at them so often that it\u2019s tough to break through,\u201d said Lou Arbetter, the general manager of Pepsi Productions. He helped develop the original shorts. \u201cYou want to create things that people actually want to see.\u201dThis is in line with recent research showing that consumers have grown increasingly wary of traditional advertising.\u201cIt\u2019s not that people don\u2019t like ads; it\u2019s that people don\u2019t like being sold to,\u201d said Beth Egan, an associate advertising professor at Syracuse University. \u201cMillennials especially are really keen to have a relationship with brands, but that has to be a true, authentic and two-way relationship.\u201dIn preliminary findings from a recent study led by Ms. Egan, when subjects were exposed to branded content, prominent mention of the brand increased viewers\u2019 suspicion of the messaging.So how do you mostly remove the brand but keep the association?Pepsi filmed several videos, written and directed by Mr. Irving, featuring cameos from other N.B.A. names, including Mr. Irving\u2019s then-teammate, Kevin Love, and the retired Hall of Fame center Bill Russell. The Pepsi logo wasn\u2019t conspicuous other than a \u201cPepsi Max presents\u201d at the beginning and some shots of spectators drinking Pepsi.\u201cThere\u2019s a strong association now between Irving, \u2018Uncle Drew\u2019 and the Pepsi brand,\u201d Mr. Deshpande said.\u201cThis was just another chapter in how to bring the brand\u2019s story to life,\u201d Mr. Arbetter said. \u201cNobody has done it before, but I would venture to take a guess that this won\u2019t be the last time.\u201dPrincipals involved with the movie insist that while the film may have originated with a company best known for its soda, the integrity of \u201cUncle Drew\u201d as a film is genuine.\u201cI would say that you \u2014 we \u2014 would be pretty foolish to view this as a two-hour-long commercial,\u201d Mr. Arbetter said. \u201cI think that would not do the brand any good.\u201dJim Miller, an executive vice president of Lionsgate, said: \u201cHonestly, aside from they\u2019re our partners, it has nothing to do with Pepsi. If there wasn\u2019t a great story in there, we wouldn\u2019t have engaged.\u201dThe feature film version is an extended, fleshed-out version of the original commercials. The cast includes the retired N.B.A. players Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Reggie Miller and Chris Webber, along with appearances by a who\u2019s who of basketball. The movie was shot in a little over a month last year, mostly in Atlanta, with about a week spent in Rucker Park.If the original shorts went out of their way not to blast the Pepsi brand, the movie takes a different tack. The opening credits say the film was made \u201cin association with Pepsi.\u201d The Rucker Park scenes show various iterations of the brand logo surrounding the court. Mr. Kroll\u2019s character, the villainous coach of a rival team, gives a shout-out to Pepsi during an interview with ESPN.Pepsi and Lionsgate declined to reveal the film\u2019s budget or the financial terms of their partnership. Mr. Arbetter would only acknowledge Pepsi\u2019s role in funding the screenplay.As for the film industry, will this unexpected partnership lead to more such deals? Paula Kupfer, a senior vice president at Lionsgate, said to ask her in July \u2014 after the \u201cUncle Drew\u201d premiere. But she did acknowledge an emerging reality: In an era when Netflix and Amazon have become prominent players in content creation, and Facebook and Apple are taking steps to get involved, \u201ca good idea can come from anywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Abortion Vote Nears, Irish Fashion Designers Choose a Side", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo weeks before a historic referendum, the style set make a statement in Dublin \u2014 and not just of the fashion kind. Dublin is not a city known for its fashion extravaganzas. But last Thursday, inside the vaulted atrium of the upmarket Powerscourt Centre shopping arcade, models took to the catwalk clad in one-off couture creations by a dozen of Ireland\u2019s best known designers. One model wore a knit navy sweater with neon yellow trim, covered in prints based on the number 8, by Pearl Reddington. Another wore a trilby hat by the milliner Margaret O\u2019Connor; it was bedecked with colored sequins and black ribbons emblazoned with the word \u201cRepeal.\u201d A third woman modeled a black shift dress with puffed sleeves, finished with chiffon ruffles and a large scarlet heart, by Natalie B. Coleman.It was a visual statement, but not solely of the fashion kind.Titled \u201cFashion Is Repealing,\u201d the event had been organized by abortion rights advocates, two weeks before a vote on Ireland\u2019s strict abortion laws, with every garment then offered for sale to benefit the Together for Yes campaign.On May 25, voters will be asked if they want to repeal Article 40.3.3 (known as the Eighth Amendment), which since 1983 has effectively enshrined a ban on abortion in the Irish constitution. \u201cThe abortion issue is primarily a women\u2019s issue, and until recently I noticed a lot of women\u2019s media here hadn\u2019t really broached the topic,\u201d said Andrea Horan, a Dublin-based nail bar owner. \u201cSo making Irish fashion a focus of our campaign was partly a bid to draw that media spotlight in on us, and get more voices heard.\u201dMs. Horan was the driving force behind the \u201cRepeal\u201d show and is the founder of the women\u2019s rights discussion platform Hunreal Issues, which she describes as \u201cthrowing glitter on issues without minimizing them.\u201d\u201cA lot of the time, political conversations can be academic, highbrow and exclusive. And fashion can act as a great leveler in terms of welcoming a bigger audience who may not be politically minded,\u201d Ms. Horan said. \u201cThis abortion vote is going to be the most important we\u2019ve ever had in this country. It was great to see so many Irish designers felt they had something to say about it.\u201dMs. O\u2019Connor, the milliner, who lived in Britain for eight years before moving back to County Clare in western Ireland in 2017, said: \u201cI can look back at this and see that I spoke out, created some art and at least did something. I\u2019d hate to look back 20 years from now and think I was one of the people in the corner who said nothing because it felt safer.\u201dThat the established fashion community, predominantly populated by left-leaning social liberals in Ireland as it is in many countries, overwhelmingly landed on the side of abortion rights is not surprising to many observers. (In the United States, the Council of Fashion Designers of America has supported Planned Parenthood, handing out pink pins during one fashion week.)\u201cWearing what you believe is more apparent with this debate in Ireland than ever before,\u201d said Deirdre McQuillan, the fashion editor of the Irish Times newspaper. \u201cOne of the most powerful symbols of the entire pro-choice movement has been the Repeal Project sweatshirts, which you now see out on the streets at the moment almost every day.\u201dBlack with the word \u201cRepeal\u201d stamped in a slogan-like graphic across the front, these sweatshirts were the brainchild of the activist Anna Cosgrave. She founded the Repeal Project after attending a vigil for Savita Halappanavar, an Indian-born woman whose death in 2012, after her requests for an abortion were refused by a hospital in Galway, Ireland, prompted widespread outcry across the country. Similarly, an alliance called Abortion Rights Campaign has been selling popular T-shirts printed with \u201cFree Safe Legal.\u201d And Repealist, a brand that specializes in clothing and housewares, has created a dress that reads, \u201cOur Bodies Our Choice,\u201d with a print of an upside-down hanger, emblazoned with \u201cHanging in the Balance.\u201d\u201cAt one level they are just garments,\u201d Ms. Cosgrave said. \u201cBut now they are also a rallying cry.\u201dIt\u2019s a call that has been heard by several young Irish fashion designers living and working across the sea in Britain. More than 4,000 Irish women leave home for England every year to get an abortion, according to data from Marie Stopes, an organization that provides sexual and reproductive health care.\u201cComing from a working-class background and being brought up by strong women, the debate around abortion is one I\u2019ve been having for as long as I can remember. At root, it\u2019s not just a women\u2019s rights issue, it is a human rights issue,\u201d said Mr. Malone, who has been back and forth between London and Ireland in recent months to canvass for the Yes campaign. \u201cMy work is all about what it means to be a woman and making statements about femininity. This issue, for me, is impossible to ignore.\u201dFor Mr. Malone, luxury meant an unfettered freedom of expression: He drew hearts and slogans in red across the glass panes, and had organized a number of speakers to read from Una Mullally\u2019s \u201cRepeal the 8th\u201d book, along with dancers and music as part of his installation in the window. The store\u2019s management was not amused.\u201cSelfridges is a politically neutral safe space for everyone, and it\u2019s regrettable that a platform for celebrated creative talent was commandeered in this manner,\u201d a Selfridges spokesman said in a statement after the event.Still, Mr. Malone remained unrepentant. \u201cIt was disappointing, but sometimes as a designer there are more important things than working with stores \u2014 you have to stay true to your voice,\u201d he said. \u201cFashion is so concerned with image making, or faux politics for an Instagram post, which means nothing. You have to physically get out there and do it. All I can do now is raise awareness and use my platform within fashion and beyond. Ours is a battle that hasn\u2019t been won yet.\u201dPaul McLauchlan contributed reporting from Cork.Advertisement"}

And we can still trace his operatic highs and lows \u2014 professional or otherwise \u2014 across dimly lit bar tops, white linen restaurant tables and opulent hotel rooms throughout the city.At the restaurant\u2019s bar, under a smiling statue of Old Blue Eyes, we recently met Eliot Weisman, Sinatra\u2019s former manager, who told us about the side of the singer that few witnessed up close.\u201cEveryone saw him as a tough guy, but most of the time he was really quiet and even-keeled,\u201d said Mr. Weisman, the author of \u201cThe Way it Was: My Life With Frank Sinatra\u201d and who has also represented stars like Sammy Davis Jr. and Liza Minnelli. \u201cHe was the easiest guy to work with \u2014 if you got it right.\u201d\u201cAnd no one was bigger than Sinatra,\u201d he added.Thanks to New York.The fever he incited in his fans was a precursor to the fandom that would later surround Elvis and the Beatles.Mr. Weisman, who began managing Sinatra in the mid-80s, said he was a \u201ctrue professional\u201d who \u201cset the tempo\u201d with those who worked for him. But even while he sold out concert halls across the globe, there was still one place that could make him nervous.\u201cCarnegie Hall, that\u2019s the only place I ever felt him get the jitters,\u201d Mr. Weisman said. \u201cHe would say, \u2018Do you know the history of this place?

They just loved being in his presence.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:A mostly cloudy morning with a chance of light rain will slowly brighten throughout the day, leaving behind periwinkle skies and a high of 73.Temperatures will rise tomorrow, and we could see showers on Wednesday.Dear New York Today readers,In your weekly tangle of quickly worded emails, unpunctuated Slack messages and emoji text conversations, when was the last time you sat down and collected your thoughts on a sheet of paper?Here at New York Today, we\u2019re running an experiment to revive the lost art of letter writing.We\u2019re looking for readers who want to be paired up with a pen pal and exchange missives about the city and their lives.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg Gets an Earful From the E.U.", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEuropean lawmakers barraged Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Tuesday with a litany of questions about his company\u2019s global power, its role in elections and its misuse of user data. One even raised the prospect of breaking up the social media giant.But the meeting in Brussels ended with members of the European Parliament complaining that Mr. Zuckerberg had used the session\u2019s odd format to evade specific questions and just repeat statements he had made in the past. Several shouted follow-up questions out of turn, one complained that he had asked six yes-or-no questions to which he received no clear reply, and another argued that Mr. Zuckerberg had used the event\u2019s structure to deliberately sidestep details.But the session with Mr. Zuckerberg, which was scheduled for one hour and 15 minutes, was set up so that lawmakers asked questions one after the other without a pause for answers. That left Mr. Zuckerberg only minutes to speak at the very end, allowing him to select which questions to address in a general way.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s visit to the European Union\u2019s typically sleepy Parliament starkly contrasted with his grilling in Congress last month over the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Over two days of appearances on Capitol Hill, which were televised live and became a media spectacle, Mr. Zuckerberg faced hours of questions from lawmakers and repeatedly said Facebook could do better.Mr. Zuckerberg had initially resisted meeting with the European authorities, and his appearance on Tuesday was a limited concession. Europe\u2019s Parliament is markedly weaker than Congress, and it does not have the power to regulate Facebook. The session was originally scheduled to be held behind closed doors, but after an outcry in Brussels, Facebook agreed to make the questioning public by streaming it online.The meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg brought a rare buzz to the European Parliament. The body\u2019s live stream for his appearance temporarily crashed, most likely because of the high interest in the meeting. Security around the Parliament building was extremely tight, at a level typically reserved for national leaders.\u201cPeople are thrilled to put Zuckerberg on the grill,\u201d said Karl Pincherelle, an aide to a French member of the European Parliament.Then the questions began.\u201cIt is time to discuss breaking Facebook\u2019s monopoly,\u201d said Manfred Weber, a German lawmaker and the leader of the European People\u2019s Party, which makes up the biggest bloc in Parliament. He added that the company had \u201ctoo much power.\u201dAnother member asked if Mr. Zuckerberg wanted to be remembered in the same high regard as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, or for undermining democracy. In all, nearly a dozen lawmakers spoke, each with multiple questions, some of them very detailed and pointed about issues such as online bullying and election interference.Throughout, Mr. Zuckerberg, dressed in a dark suit and purple tie, sat stone-faced, jotting down notes and occasionally sipping from a glass of water.Once the lawmakers finished asking their questions, Mr. Zuckerberg largely avoided answering specifics and repeated previous statements. He mentioned Facebook\u2019s development of artificial intelligence technology to spot violent content and bullying, and its partnerships with fact-checker groups to prevent the spread of misinformation.He also referred to setting up Facebook in his Harvard dorm room, something he frequently noted during his testimony to Congress.Mr. Tajani later said that he had devised the format of the questioning because the European Parliament typically does not invite chief executives for meetings and so was treating him as a private citizen.Ultimately, it all lasted less than two hours. As lawmakers headed for a news conference, Mr. Zuckerberg made a swift exit. He was next set to visit Paris, with lunch on Wednesday with President Emmanuel Macron.Asked about the time constraints by his frustrated fellow members of Parliament, Mr. Tajani referred to the Facebook executive\u2019s travel schedule saying, \u201cThere is a flight.\u201d He insisted at a news conference afterward that the meeting had been \u201ca great success.\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ireland, Enthusiastic About Gay Rights, Frets Over Abortion", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARRIGTWOHILL, Ireland \u2014 When it comes to the Roman Catholic Church, Judy Donnelly has been something of a rebel over the years. Like much of Ireland, she supported contraception, voted in a referendum to legalize divorce and, three years ago, backed same-sex marriage.That last vote was joyously celebrated around the country and the world, placing Ireland, which elected its first gay prime minister last year, at the vanguard of what many called a social revolution.But when it comes to the historic decision on legalizing abortion, which will be put to the nation on Friday, Ms. Donnelly says she will vote no, as will enough of her countrymen and women, including lawmakers across the political divide, to throw the referendum result into doubt. Polls for the May 25 vote have narrowed so tightly in recent weeks that \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d campaigners are not able to confidently predict a victory.\u201cIt\u2019s just not the same,\u201d said Ms. Donnelly, 46, who works in a pub in Carrigtwohill. \u201cIt\u2019s about values and morals.\u201dEven if Ireland is becoming more culturally liberal in many respects, opposition to abortion is deeply ingrained, as many people are still strongly against it on moral grounds. To some, abortion amounts to murder rather than being about liberal cultural values.Advocates of abortion rights cite several reasons for why attitudes have not changed: a history of female oppression; the church\u2019s continuing grip over sexual education; and very private experiences around miscarriages, fetal deformities, adoption difficulties and spousal disagreements over whether to keep a baby.At the same time, many Irish say, sex and sexual health remain somewhat taboo subjects. Often, the negative consequences of sexual activity, including infections or unplanned pregnancies, are seen through a moral lens rather than as health issues.The Catholic Church opposes abortion, and some Mass-goers here said priests had told their congregations that they would not be able to receive Communion if they voted yes in the referendum.Ironically, it was a gay prime minister, Leo Varadkar, who called for this referendum that will essentially ask voters to repeal a 1983 amendment to the Constitution that gives a fetus the same right to life as the mother and allow unrestricted terminations of pregnancies for up to 12 weeks.\u201cI know I come across as a hypocrite,\u201d said Darren Haddock, 48, a cabdriver who initially planned to vote in favor of abortion because he saw it as a woman\u2019s right. But now, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about hurting a life.\u201dThe referendum on gay marriage was different, he said. \u201cThe time was right for Ireland to come out of the Dark Ages, to break the shackles from the church, and it was a victory for people to stand up to it,\u201d he said.Ms. Donnelly, who recently divorced, voted in favor of same-sex marriage because her sister-in-law was part of the first gay couple to get married in England. Another cousin is gay, and recently got married, too.When it came to abortion, she reflected on some of her other relatives who had miscarriages, having wanted children badly. \u201cAnd then you have people who cross over to England to get an abortion,\u201d she said, although she said there were some exceptions, as in the cases of rape or incest. \u201cBut just because you made a boo-boo doesn\u2019t mean you get an abortion.\u201dStill, she voted in three previous referendums allowing women to have abortions if their lives were in danger, to travel abroad for the procedure and to have access to information about it. The legalization of abortion, she said, would \u201cmake it easier for people to say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll just go and rid of it.\u2019\u201dMs. Donnelly spoke as an older woman slowly pushed a baby carriage up the street, carrying two baby dolls under plastic wrapping to protect against a cold drizzle. Mr. Haddock recalled seeing the woman nearly four decades ago, when he was a child. She had had several miscarriages, he explained, and hadn\u2019t stopped pushing the carriage ever since.\u201cMisogyny is much more embedded in Irish life than homophobia,\u201d she said. \u201cIreland has a terrible history of oppressing women, and the legacy of the Catholic Church is control,\u201d she added, referring to the thousands of unmarried women who became pregnant and were placed into servitude or mental asylums since the 18th century until as recent as the mid-1990s.Even when the country in 1985 legalized condoms to be sold without prescriptions, she said, it was to deal with the AIDS epidemic, rather than to give women their reproductive rights. \u201cWomen\u2019s autonomy has always been viewed with suspicion or through a lens that is very bizarre,\u201d she said.In Cork, Ireland\u2019s second-biggest city, placards for opposing campaigns were attached to almost every street lamp, but the mood was subdued. Most people interviewed for this article didn\u2019t want their names published; many of them hadn\u2019t even spoken about the subject with their friends, let alone their families.\u201cOh God, no,\u201d exclaimed a 24-year-old barista named Maedhbh who worked in a coffee shop and wore a nose ring and a bright yellow sweatshirt with the words \u201cBitter Lemon\u201d printed on it.\u201cMy grandparents don\u2019t want to engage in it,\u201d she said, just as her grandfather Paddy walked in. When asked about the referendum, he stopped in his tracks and pretended to be hard of hearing. \u201cYou could be shot for giving an answer,\u201d a customer standing nearby said smirking, before rushing out the door. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in Irish: \u2018Whatever you say, say nothing.\u2019 \u201dWhile the church\u2019s influence has fallen drastically in most spheres of Irish life, its hold on sexual education remains strong \u2014 the institution still controls most schools in the country.Even young, internet-savvy Irish in their early 20s spoke about receiving more of a lesson in biology, and a cursory one at that, than instructions about sexual health and safety.\u201cWhen we were 16 we had two lads, monks, come in to talk about abstinence, and that one in 10 people get pregnant and that you can still get STDs from wearing condoms,\u201d said Ben Collins, a 22-year-old college student, who plans to vote to legalize abortion. \u201cIt was basically fear. The Catholic influence is so big here, but you don\u2019t even realize it.\u201dDeirdre Allinen, 32, recalled sitting in a classroom and having nuns wheel in a television before being shown a grisly video about abortion. \u201cThen we\u2019d say the rosary and stand around praying,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way it\u2019s taught to us, it\u2019s still in me. The curriculum is still hidden in our brains. It took me a long time to shake it off.\u201d\u201cA lot of these issues around sexual health and reproductive rights all stem from a lack of information and shame,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest element \u2014 what we do with our bodies and with other people carries shame.\u201d\u201cWe see ourselves as global, checking in at airports, L.G.B.T., Eurovision,\u201d he said, and Ireland as a mecca for tech giants like Google, Facebook and Apple. \u201cBut this crushing theocratic doctrine put on Irish society has permeated right to the core,\u201d he added, \u201ceven to the person who doesn\u2019t go to church: that sex is seen as a sin. It\u2019s in our DNA.\u201dThe dearth of a proper national conversation is part of the reason Ireland is seeing a surge in sexually transmitted diseases, Mr. St Leger said, with 15- to 24-year-olds, for example, making up half of Ireland\u2019s number of reported annual chlamydia infections.The nation is also in the throes of an H.I.V. crisis, he added, pointing to opinion polls that show one-quarter of respondents are not properly informed about the virus. At least a quarter of respondents still believe they can catch it by kissing or sitting on a toilet seat. And for all the excitement around the vote on same-sex marriage, Mr. St Leger pointed out, the government has since 2009 cut the budget in half for Gay Men\u2019s Health Service, which provides H.I.V. testing, screenings and treatments for sexually transmitted infections, and outreach.The same-sex marriage vote was \u201call about love and relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t talk about sexual health.\u201dStill, sexual education has improved from Ms. Donnelly\u2019s time, when nuns taught her class: \u201cIf a lad sat on your lap, you\u2019d put a newspaper on your lap. That was the contraception of the day.\u201dIn recent years, Ireland has seen some of the biggest turnarounds in public opinion in the Western world. In 1992, for example, when homosexuality was still considered a crime in the country, participants in a gay pride parade in Cork wore masks so as not to embarrass relatives. In 2018, Ireland has a gay prime minister, same-sex marriage is allowed and some of the world\u2019s most progressive bills concerning lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are being put forward in Parliament.For many voters, the referendum over abortion is, ultimately, a deeply private choice.In 2015, after the same-sex marriage vote, \u201cit was like Glastonbury; it was party central,\u201d recalled Mr. Haddock. But this week, he said, \u201cno matter who wins or loses, there\u2019s not going to be a party.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An American Alternative to Europe\u2019s Privacy Law", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in telecommunications.Imagine that you\u2019ve been struggling with a serious and fairly embarrassing personal problem. Putting aside a longstanding reluctance to address it, you finally consult a therapist. The therapist is friendly and welcoming and promises to protect your privacy. Gaining a sense of trust, you bare your soul, describing the issue you are struggling with in all of its painful detail.Only later do you realize, to your horror, that your confessions were being recorded and retained by the therapist. It turns out that your therapist, to supplement his income, has gotten into the advertising business: He takes data gleaned from his patients and offers it to advertisers (or any other interested party) for a fee.Everyone would be outraged by this; it is professionally unethical and a serious breach of trust. Yet what I\u2019ve described is not so different from our relationship with businesses like Google, Facebook, Quora and Amazon. They hold themselves out as trustworthy, enticing us to share our information with them \u2014 from the banal details of our lives to our most intimate secrets \u2014 without making it very clear that everything is being recorded, kept and used for advertising.The Europeans find this kind of thing distasteful, which is why last Friday they instituted a strict online privacy law \u2014 the General Data Protection Regulation. The law\u2019s approach is, for want of a better word, European: broad, rule-driven and administered by regulators. Under the G.D.P.R., any company that gathers or processes personal data is defined as a \u201cdata controller\u201d and is subject to a raft of new rights and duties that are enforced by Europe\u2019s member states.For all these reasons, the United States may need to try something different and more American: namely, to rely on judges and state law to establish that the legal concept of \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d can apply to technology companies.To understand what fiduciary duties are, return to the example of the unfaithful therapist. Given that he used a position of trust and expertise to gain sensitive information from you, medical ethics and the law hold that he has a special obligation to be loyal and careful with your data. He is a fiduciary. (The word derives from the Latin for \u201ctrust.\u201d) The idea of a fiduciary duty is intuitive and familiar to American law: Your lawyer, your doctor, your therapist and your accountant are all fiduciaries.So why not your search engine, your digital assistant and your social media platform? These entities present themselves as trustworthy, have a special expertise and usually require you to reveal information about yourself to be useful. As Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, himself put it: \u201cWe have a responsibility to protect your data.\u201d These companies should be considered, to borrow a term coined by the law professor Jack Balkin, \u201cinformation fiduciaries\u201d \u2014 or perhaps \u201cdata fiduciaries.\u201dHow would this work in practice? Once these fiduciary duties were established by state legislation or a court ruling, questions about the breach of such duties would be addressed case by case, by courts and judges, in the American common-law manner. Instead of asking what responsibilities all \u201cdata controllers\u201d have, as the Europeans must now do, courts in the United States could ask more specific questions.For example: Did Equifax, the credit reporting agency, fail to adequately protect user data? (Obviously.) Should a firm like Quora, the question-and-answer website, require that users \u201copt in\u201d before allowing other people to find out what you are asking about? (Almost certainly.) Should Alexa, Amazon\u2019s digital assistant, require users to \u201copt in\u201d before it listens to their conversations? (It depends on how it would be carried out.)A defining fact of our existence today is that we share more of ourselves with Silicon Valley than with our accountants, lawyers and doctors. It is about time the law caught up with that.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Missing After Flash Flooding Rages Through Community Near Baltimore", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne person was missing after flash floods rampaged on Sunday through the downtown of a Maryland community that was devastated by flooding nearly two years ago.The community, Ellicott City, about 15 miles west of Baltimore, experienced floodwaters six feet deep in some places, according to witnesses. Heavy rains that started around 3 p.m. prompted residents to seek shelter in upper floors and the authorities to dispatch swift-water rescue teams.On Monday, officials said they were searching for Eddison A. Hermond, 39, who was last seen around 5:20 p.m. on Sunday in a parking lot, Mark Miller, a spokesman for Howard County, said.\u201cSome people said they thought they saw him get swept away by the water,\u201d he said, adding that the man\u2019s family reported him missing at 12:30 a.m. on Monday.\u201cWe had a very, very heavy cell move over us, and it just unloaded and did not let up,\u201d Mr. Miller said.Mr. Miller said the episode equaled or perhaps exceeded the July 2016 flooding in which two people died after more than six inches of rain fell in two hours.That flooding ripped up sidewalks, gutted many of the town\u2019s quaint shops and carried off vehicles, depositing some of them blocks away.Sally Fox Tennant, the owner of Discoveries, a craft and jewelry shop, said she felt \u201ccompletely numb\u201d and in shock.\u201cI was putting sandbags in front of the shop doors, watching the street flooding out front, thinking, Wow, I don\u2019t think those street drains are keeping up.\u201dMs. Tennant, who lives in an apartment above her store, left her cat behind and escaped to another shop across the street once her basement began to flood. With waters rising, she said, she climbed through a third-floor window of that shop, then sought shelter in a stranger\u2019s home. She was later transported to the Howard County Police Headquarters.She tried to call loved ones using her waterlogged cellphone.\u201cI\u2019ve owned that shop for 38 years,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring the flood two years ago, I almost lost everything. This time, it looks so much worse. I think my store is completely gone. I just don\u2019t think I can start all over again.\u201dFounded in 1772 as a mill town, Ellicott City has for the past several decades catered to tourists with its historical charm and antique shops. Its location in the Patapsco River Valley and its position on a granite bedrock make it susceptible to flooding \u201cwith terrific force,\u201d Mr. Miller said.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Eddison A. Hermond. He is 39, not 40.Christopher Mele reported from New York, and Emily Baumgaertner from Ellicott City, Md. Christina Caron contributed reporting from New York.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018He\u2019s a Pit Bull\u2019: T-Mobile C.E.O. Is the Colorful Outlier of Wireless", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, T-Mobile\u2019s chief executive, John Legere, crashed the AT&T party at the Venetian hotel. Wearing a black leather jacket and his customary pink T-Mobile T-shirt, Mr. Legere said he was just hoping to see the rapper Macklemore perform.Since taking over T-Mobile in 2012, Mr. Legere has made a name for himself with those kinds of publicity stunts \u2014 promoting his own brand while undermining the competition.But now, Mr. Legere may have truly crashed the party.Under the terms of the proposed deal, Mr. Legere would become chief executive of the combined company, which would keep the T-Mobile name.It\u2019s a bold move, and one that illustrates Mr. Legere\u2019s willingness to disrupt the status quo, even if he appears to have the weaker hand.\u201cHe wants to take on the titans of AT&T and Verizon,\u201d said Steve Grasso, director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel and a market analyst for CNBC, who knows Mr. Legere socially. \u201cHe\u2019s a pit bull.\u201dThe combination of T-Mobile and Sprint has been years in the making, as both companies have sought to add scale and compete with their larger rivals. Yet the last time the companies formally attempted a deal, in 2014, it was Sprint that was planning to acquire T-Mobile.That deal fell apart in the face of regulatory scrutiny. And since then, Mr. Legere has managed to build T-Mobile\u2019s business by flouting convention. Under his leadership, T-Mobile began offering unlimited data, reduced prices and less stringent contract commitments.When Mr. Legere took over in 2012, he was a very different executive, and T-Mobile was a very different company.T-Mobile was reeling from a failed attempt to sell itself to AT&T and struggling to distinguish itself from other low-cost carriers like Sprint and Metro PCS. Mr. Legere, who spent 20 years working at AT&T, was a conventional, if ambitious, telecommunications executive.\u201cHe was a finance guy,\u201d said Dan Hesse, the former chief executive of Sprint, who was a mentor of Mr. Legere\u2019s at AT&T. \u201cThe first time I saw John after he was named C.E.O. of T-Mobile, he was there in his suit.\u201dThat soon changed. In 2013, Mr. Legere was onstage at an event in Las Vegas with Joe Torre, the former manager of the Yankees, promoting a partnership between T-Mobile and Major League Baseball.When reporters asked him about the state of the wireless industry, he responded with a tirade about how badly customers were mistreated, and what he planned to do differently.Soon, Mr. Legere, now 59, had a whole new look. He grew his hair to his shoulders. He wore company T-shirts wherever he went. He pulled on custom pink Converse sneakers emblazoned with the T-Mobile logo. Before long, the finance guy looked more like an aging rock star.And on Twitter, he began hurling insults at competitors and tangling with rival C.E.O.s \u2014 including Sprint\u2019s Marcelo Claure.Offline, Mr. Legere also cultivated an eccentric image. He is a regular visitor to T-Mobile stores and call centers, where he delivers boisterous pep talks. At company meetings, he offers employees $100 if they will ask him a question in the form of a song. And in the office, he is fond of riding around on a Segway.\u201cJohn has built a franchise around T-Mobile, which is in part his own,\u201d said Stephen Scherr, head of the consumer and commercial banking division at Goldman Sachs, who has worked with Mr. Legere for more than a decade.But Mr. Legere has paired showmanship with results. During his tenure, T-Mobile has added subscribers and increased revenues and profits. \u201cHe\u2019s also a great operator,\u201d Mr. Scherr said. \u201cHe runs a really good business.\u201dIf Mr. Legere succeeds in finally joining T-Mobile and Sprint, the man who wanted to come off as the consummate outsider will have pulled off the ultimate insider move: a mega-merger to combine two rival companies and seize a greater share of a changing industry.Under President Trump, antitrust enforcement has become unpredictable. The Justice Department has mounted a court fight against the proposed combination of AT&T and Time Warner, which do not directly compete with each other. At the same time, there appears to be little resistance to the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets by Disney, a deal which would reduce competition in the film and television industry.Mr. Legere, who is sensitive to public perceptions, seems to have anticipated this moment. In January 2017, after Mr. Trump\u2019s election but before his inauguration, Mr. Legere was asked about his view of the regulatory environment under the Trump administration.\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be excited,\u2019\u2019 he said, about regulatory views that would be \u201cconducive to us significantly expanding our business.\u201dMr. Legere knew from firsthand experience. In 2015, after Mr. Trump insulted the U.F.C. fighter Ronda Rousey on Twitter, Mr. Legere came to her defense. In the ensuing exchange, Mr. Legere said Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t presidential material.\u201cI am an undecided Republican,\u201d Mr. Legere wrote. \u201cWell not totally undecided, I know what I don\u2019t want :)\u201dBut it seems that the prospect of a multibillion-dollar deal can heal old wounds.Mr. Legere has since deleted that tweet about the president. And on Sunday, Mr. Legere was making the rounds with Mr. Claure of Sprint, another old social media sparring partner, to talk up their alliance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Entire Economy Is MoviePass Now. Enjoy It While You Can.", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIt\u2019s called the 75 Cent Dollar Store. We\u2019re going to sell dollar bills for 75 cents \u2014 no service charges, no hidden fees, just crisp $1 bills for the price of three quarters. It\u2019ll be huge.You\u2019re probably thinking: Wait, won\u2019t your store go out of business? Nope. I\u2019ve got that part figured out, too. The plan is to get tons of people addicted to buying 75-cent dollars so that, in a year or two, we can jack up the price to $1.50 or $2 without losing any customers. Or maybe we\u2019ll get so big that the Treasury Department will start selling us dollar bills at a discount. We could also collect data about our customers and sell it to the highest bidder. Honestly, we\u2019ve got plenty of options.If you\u2019re still skeptical, I don\u2019t blame you. It used to be that in order to survive, businesses had to sell goods or services above cost. But that model is so 20th century. The new way to make it in business is to spend big, grow fast and use Kilimanjaro-size piles of investor cash to subsidize your losses, with a plan to become profitable somewhere down the road.\u201cThe fact that Google and Facebook were able to generate such enormous profits and growth does give hope to some companies,\u201d Mr. Ritter said. If start-ups can figure out to convert a large user base into paying customers, he added, \u201cit can be enormously profitable.\u201dBut investors aren\u2019t convinced. Shares of MoviePass\u2019s parent company, Helios and Matheson Analytics, have fallen more than 90 percent since October, and the company recently reported that it has been burning through its cash reserves, spending an average of $21.7 million per month with just $15.5 million left in the bank at the end of April. On Tuesday, Helios reported that MoviePass lost $98.3 million in the first quarter, despite adding more than a million net subscribers.Mitch Lowe, the chief executive of MoviePass, told me in a phone interview this week that the company\u2019s financial troubles have been exaggerated. The company has access to a $300 million equity line of credit that will keep it solvent, he said, and blamed the company\u2019s competitors, such as large theater chains, for sowing the seeds of doubt.\u201cThey smell blood in the water, so they\u2019re spreading rumors and hypotheses,\u201d he said.Ultimately, companies like MoviePass illustrate the perilous tightrope many growing businesses must walk. Spend too little on acquiring new customers and drawing business away from your competitors, and you won\u2019t make it off the ground. Give too many freebies away, and you risk running out of cash before you\u2019re big enough to cash in.\u201cPricing can be strategic,\u201d said Kara Nortman, a partner at Upfront Ventures, which invests in technology companies. \u201cIf you can attract a lot of consumers to your product or service, it gives you a lot more power with incumbents who are limiting your growth.\u201dThe king of money-losers, of course, is Amazon, which went years without turning a profit. Instead, it plowed billions of dollars back into its business, building out its e-commerce infrastructure and jump-starting side efforts like Amazon Web Services and Amazon Prime Video. Those years of investments paid off, and Amazon is now the second most valuable company in the world, with $1.6 billion in profit last quarter alone.An economy full of unprofitable companies has risks, of course. Along with the danger of investor wipeouts \u2014 which are unavoidable in early stage investing \u2014 customers of these companies have come to expect a kind of whiplash that can involve sudden price hikes, disappearing benefits, and useless subscriptions and meaningless warranties. It\u2019s also difficult for small businesses without access to huge amounts of capital to compete with the Googles and Amazons of the world, which further distorts economic growth in favor of corporations that can afford to spend billions of dollars undercutting the competition.For consumers who are willing to do their research, though, this can be a golden age of deals. We can get our \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d tickets and pecan-crusted salmon meal kits, reaping the benefits of artificially cheap goods and services while investors soak up the losses. The current crop of money-losing companies may not survive forever, but as long as someone is willing to keep funding these types of gambles, there\u2019s no reason to stop enjoying the fruits of their optimism.So, back to the 75 Cent Dollar Store. Are you in?An earlier version of this article misstated when Uber is expected to go public. It is 2019, not this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Unofficial History of Memorial Day", "Date": "2018-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDigging through an archive at Harvard, Dr. Blight found that the largest of these commemorations took place on May 1, 1865, at an old racecourse and jockey club where hundreds of captive Union prisoners had died of disease and been buried in a mass grave. The black residents exhumed the bodies and gave them proper burials, erected a fence around the cemetery, and built an archway over it with the words, \u201cMartyrs of the Race Course.\u201dSome 10,000 black people then staged a procession of mourning, led by thousands of schoolchildren carrying roses and singing the Union anthem \u201cJohn Brown\u2019s Body.\u201d Hundreds of black women followed with baskets of flowers, wreaths and crosses. Black men, including Union infantrymen, also marched. A children\u2019s choir sang spirituals and patriotic songs, including \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201dThe African-American origins of the holiday were later suppressed, Dr. Blight found, by white Southerners who reclaimed power after the end of Reconstruction and interpreted Memorial Day as a holiday of reconciliation, marking sacrifices \u2014 by white Americans \u2014 on both sides. Black Americans were largely marginalized in this narrative.\u201cIn the struggle over memory and meaning in any society, some stories just get lost while others attain mainstream recognition,\u201d Dr. Blight wrote.His claim is not universally accepted; the fact-checking website Snopes says of the 1865 remembrance: \u201cWhether it was truly the first such ceremony, and what influence (if any) it might have had on later observances, are still matters of contention.\u201dWhat is clear is that the holiday is about freedom. Speaking at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day in 1871, Frederick Douglass laid to rest what today we would call a false equivalency \u2014 the notion that both sides were engaged in righteous struggle.\u201cWe must never forget that victory to the rebellion meant death to the republic,\u201d Douglass said. \u201cWe must never forget that the loyal soldiers who rest beneath this sod flung themselves between the nation and the nation\u2019s destroyers.\u201dBy John Eligon and Brandon K. Thorp\u201cJohnson Weds White Girl\u201d was the headline when he married Lucille Cameron in 1912. He has been called a \u201cnegro pugilist and convicted white slaver,\u201d who left a stain \u201con boxing and on his race\u201d and abused \u201cthe fame and fortune that came to him.\u201d Yet, condescendingly, he also was described as being \u201cfar above the average negro both mentally and physically.\u201dFor The Times, Johnson, who in 1908 became the first black boxer to win the world heavyweight title, was inseparable from his race. It permeated how the newspaper covered every detail of his life, from his boxing to his legal troubles to his demeanor and success.The Times\u2019s coverage illuminates the challenges for broad acceptance faced by Johnson, who inspired the 1967 play and 1970 movie \u201cThe Great White Hope,\u201d an account of his life and career and the resolve of white society to dethrone him, both in the ring and outside it.Johnson resurfaced in the news last month when President Trump tweeted that he would consider pardoning Johnson, who was convicted on federal charges of transporting a woman across state lines \u201cfor immoral purposes.\u201d Johnson, who served a year in prison, had been a lover of that woman, Belle Schreiber, who was white and had worked as a prostitute.The campaign for it had been complicated in part by allegations that Johnson had a history of domestic violence, as historians have chronicled. It was one reason the Obama administration cited for not granting a pardon.In preparing articles on the president\u2019s intentions, we examined our coverage of Johnson from his era, and were struck by how The Times, like many newspapers then, seemed to wrestle with his fame and race.As Johnson\u2019s chaotic life unfolded, The Times often covered it extensively, but time and distance now allow for a recognition, seemingly oblivious to the writers at the time, of the racial overtones around many of the troubles he faced.Often, official police accounts of his run-ins with the law were simply parroted without any probing or deeper analysis of what truly had happened. This sort of blind faith in the police version, typical of the day, was particularly damaging to people like Johnson. He was a well-known black athlete who, at a time when racial animosity and lynchings were widespread, was brash, taunted his opponents, dated white women and openly enjoyed the luxuries of his wealth.Today, people still seem to struggle with black athletes who are outspoken. So while the harsh and sometimes racist tone of the coverage came as no surprise, it was jarring still.Johnson, a native of Galveston, Tex., began his professional boxing career in 1897, but The Times did not start covering him until about a decade later as he grew to become a leading contender for a world title. The Times\u2019s articles showed that the public could not necessarily stomach a black man achieving that accomplishment. The articles about his boxing were highly critical of him, even when he found success.Here are some of the stories that we\u2019re talking about, beyond The Times.We publish many articles that touch on race. Here are a few you shouldn\u2019t miss.Dovey Johnson Roundtree, Barrier-Breaking Lawyer, Dies at 104Though little recognized, Ms. Roundtree won advances for black people and women at the bar of justice, challenging the Jim Crow society she knew too well.There Are Two Georgias.

Up until 2015, she only begrudgingly accompanied her husband to haunted houses in the weeks before Halloween. But her perspective changed when she visited Thrillvania Haunted House Park, a collection of three attractions on 50 acres east of Dallas, which is often listed among the best destinations for thrill seekers in the country.\u201cAll I wanted to do was stop and stare at what was in the corners of every room,\u201d she said. Over the next two years, Ms. Keasler visited 13 popular haunted houses in the United States where every nook and cranny is carefully designed to add to a visitor\u2019s immersive, theatrical experience. In those corners, she found the primary subject for her book.Often, the details in Ms. Keasler\u2019s photos are easy to place in a haunted house. In one photo, a group of dusty skeletons sit at a banquet table. In another, severed heads are lined up on a mantel. Several others feature the kind of over-the-top blood, guts and gore that one could find only in a commercial haunt. But other images look like they could have been taken anywhere. One simply features a cigarette vending machine. Another highlights the objects in a boudoir, including a teacup, a potted orchid, and a picture frame. In some, only the smallest detail reveals the scene\u2019s manufactured nature.\u201cThose photographs aren\u2019t just about what this haunted house looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are on their own an eerier sort of darker thing that points to our fears. Knowing something\u2019s off and not being able to put your finger on it for me is a pretty scary idea.\u201dSimilarly, by photographing haunted houses, Ms. Keasler wants to raise larger questions about American anxieties. In that spirit, she said, the haunts she photographed are often as revealing for the topics they avoid as those they address. While serial killers are common haunted house fare, she said, other prominent contemporary threats \u2014 terrorism, gun violence, hijackings \u2014 are notably absent. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that we only have fun in being scared if we know deep down that we\u2019re safe,\u201d she said.

The floor is a black-and-white checkerboard. The bar is made of polished marble the color of beef carpaccio. There is a house Chianti, and it comes in a straw-covered bottle. There is hope for a red-sauce renaissance, after all.It arrived right on schedule with my first drink, which a server strained into a glass through a coffee filter cone lined with espresso ice. It was called Americano, Americano, and combined at least three meanings of the word: a highball, an Italian aperitif wine and a diluted shot of espresso. The Americano highball, so simple that just about any bartender can make it, doesn\u2019t need much improvement.But I have to admit that the coffee did give it some ballast. I\u2019m also happy to report that this was one of the last bits of stagecraft I saw at Don Angie. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have a few tricks up their sleeves, but they save them for the kitchen. The result is food that is creative in a more interesting and more consistently successful way than it was at Quality Italian.And it arrives at the table without the aid of trolleys. When you get a Caesar salad, the server doesn\u2019t whip together the dressing on the spot. It\u2019s been done in the kitchen, where the chefs replaced romaine with tender chrysanthemum leaves that taste like some newly discovered herb. (The feathery leaves firmly grip the dressing and the fluffy rasped cheese, too.)I can\u2019t remember seeing chrysanthemum in an Italian restaurant before, and it shows the chefs\u2019 skill for cross-pollinating with other cuisines, especially Asian ones. While the Torrisi-Carbone axis is generally faithful to Italian-American standards, using more expensive ingredients and more modern techniques but leaving the basic ideas intact, the Rito-Tacinelli approach is more radical.They trample on tradition when they feel like it. Prosciutto and honeydew melon are tossed with candied hazelnuts and mint leaves in a lime, tamarind and fish-sauce dressing. This very good salad, which obviously glances toward Southeast Asia, is a smart way to handle an antipasto standby that is usually pointless except when melons are in season.Their garlic bread turns out to be a very thin disc with garlic chives and melted cheese inside and sesame seeds on top. Lightweight, salty and irresistible, it\u2019s modeled on Ligurian focaccia di recco, but it may also bring to mind Turkish gozleme, Azeri kutab or even a Chinese scallion pancake.There\u2019s China again, in the pepperoni fried rice served under barbecued squid. Ignore the squid unless you like it leathery, and just focus on the rice, stirring it with labneh when the heat starts to rise.The dish everybody has seen on Instagram is the pasta called caramelle. In Italian it means caramel, as in candy, but the shape will remind most Americans of an elongated Tootsie Roll, with twists at either end of a drum that\u2019s filled with buffalo ricotta. Cameras come out because the dough is striped, with black sesame-flour bands alternating with ordinary egg pasta. The sesame barely registers; the fun of the dish is the sauce, a peppered, pickled cantaloupe that tastes like it\u2019s still percolating.But the dish that could be Don Angie\u2019s lasting contribution to the pasta sciences is the garganelli with meatball rag\u00f9. The central problem of red-sauce restaurants is this: Pasta and meatballs are always served together, but they remain stubbornly separate. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have found a way out of this conundrum by crushing meatballs into a tomato-guanciale rag\u00f9. It\u2019s not quite as simple as I\u2019ve made it sound, but you don\u2019t know that when you\u2019re eating it; you just think you\u2019re magically eating meatballs and pasta at the same time.They\u2019ve also tried to salvage chicken scarpariello, a dish that is almost always overcooked. Their solution is to make a kind of pie with chicken meat pressed down into a kind of crust made of sausage. The flavors are accurate, and for once it\u2019s not dry, but it\u2019s not as engaging as other main courses, like the veal cutlet with speck and pickled mustard seeds, or the grilled fillet of orata next to herbed fregola, with buttermilk as the sauce.Reworking tiramis\u00f9 almost never improves it, but as a change of pace I did like how the one at Don Angie shifted the emphasis from espresso to bittersweet cocoa. There\u2019s a delicious, if more conventional, plate of tender, light zeppole with tangy whipped robiola under an Andy Warhol mop of spun sugar that people go wild for.I was charmed by a smaller, quieter dessert: a mochi cake stuffed with fior di latte ice cream, with sea salt and a fragrant scribble of olive oil. It\u2019s like eating a mozzarella ball that wanted to become a dessert when it grew up, and did.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Burmese Cuisine, a New York Rarity, at Rangoon Spoon", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City8 PhotosShan tofu, named for its origins in the eastern Shan State of Myanmar, has little kinship with its better-known East Asian cousin. At Rangoon Spoon in Gravesend, Brooklyn, it\u2019s made not with soybeans but with chickpea flour that\u2019s soaked overnight, drained and soaked again, then simmered, requiring constant churning until it turns into a dense congee.Once chilled, it takes on a texture somewhere between bean curd and Chinese liang fen (mung bean noodles), with more spring than slip. Amy Tun, the chef, cuts it into strips and glosses it with tamarind paste, garlic oil and fish sauce. Kaffir lime leaves gleam, dark as jade, shredded down to the width of pine needles.If you ask for it, this salad \u2014 such a harmless word \u2014 will come armed with enough chile to annihilate conversation. Under the heat, the tofu itself is confoundingly cool.Ms. Tun, 28, grew up in Yangon (formerly Rangoon), then the capital of Myanmar, and moved to Brooklyn in 2005, when a change in the United States\u2019 immigration policy enabled greater numbers of Burmese to find sanctuary here from their country\u2019s repressive government.Here, house-made fish cakes laced with lemongrass come in spongy blocks as orange as carrots. They could well be called fish tofu for their texture and their benign, unobtrusive character, which makes them an ideal backdrop for a squeeze of lime, cilantro and gently sweated onions, covered in a film of their own sugars. Hoops of green chile lie like discarded earrings, seeds still clinging.Laphet thoke is a tangle of fermented tea leaves (shipped from Myanmar by Ms. Tun\u2019s eldest sister) and cabbage still crisp, freshness set against the profundity of age. A crowd of ingredients \u2014 pumpkin seeds, fried garlic, cashews, curls of dried shrimp and too many others to list \u2014 bring crackle and tang to each mouthful.Contrast is essential, as in a plate of shwe taung noodles with kinks of crispy noodles heaped over chewy ones. A cloud of coconut cream rests in one corner and loose chickpea powder in another, waiting to be mixed into a luxurious, musty velvet.Ms. Tun cooks alongside her husband, Danny Aung, and Winnie Catungal, her older sister. In the beginning, her mother and brother also pitched in: Ms. Tun had never run a restaurant before, and she was five months pregnant. (Now her mother babysits.)On a recent daytime visit, not all dishes were available \u2014 none with Shan tofu (\u201cIt takes a long time to make,\u201d the waiter explained) or pickled mustard greens \u2014 and flavors were less distinct. Come evening, everything snaps into focus.The dining room is understated, with a few puppets and framed kalaga (embroidered tapestries) on the walls. A Burmese cover of \u201cDespacito\u201d might lilt over the speakers, accompanying forkfuls of pork belly contoured with funky, forthright ngapi (shrimp paste) or beef shank, relaxed and obliging after a long braise with curry leaves and cardamom, both green with its delicate menthol and black with its smoke.At meal\u2019s end, there is falooda, a tall drink with Persian roots, milk stained pink by rose syrup. The depths are a swirl of tapioca, agar-agar and basil seeds like a hundred tiny eyes, jellied on the outside with a crunch within. And on top: ice cream and a hunk of vanilla pudding, which slowly sink, until all are one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Deal With Overly Chatty Group Texts", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour family has roped you into another group text about politics, which has your phone buzzing like crazy for the rest of the day. If you\u2019re tired of the distraction, here\u2019s how to deal with those annoying group messages without silencing everything else on your phone.Both iPhones and Android phones have the ability to mute notifications on a conversation-by-conversation basis. That way, you can ignore group messages that don\u2019t interest you, but still get notifications for all your other text messages. New messages will still appear in those muted conversations, and you can read them at your leisure \u2014 this merely stops your phone from dinging constantly as your relatives discuss the issue du jour.If you\u2019re using an iPhone, open the group message in question, tap the \u201ci\u201d icon in the upper-right-hand corner of the screen, and scroll down to the \u201cHide Alerts\u201d switch. Flick that on, and you\u2019ll no longer be bothered by notifications for that group.Every Android phone is a little different, but you should be able to mute notifications by opening the group message in question, clicking the three dots in the upper-right-hand corner, and going to \u201cPeople & Options\u201d (or something similar). From that settings page, tap \u201cNotifications\u201d and turn them off.If you\u2019re using an iPhone, you have another more aggressive option: leaving the group message entirely. Other group members will see that you\u2019ve left, and their messages will not appear on your phone at all. This works only if the entire conversation is among iPhone users using iMessage (with the blue bubbles). If you have any non-iPhone users in the conversation, you\u2019ll be able to mute it only as described above.If it\u2019s a blue-bubbled iMessage conversation with more than three people, though, you can open it, tap the \u201ci\u201d icon in the upper-right-hand corner, and scroll down to \u201cLeave This Conversation.\u201d Tap that button, and you will leave the conversation for good (or at least until someone starts a new group message with you on it).This annoyance isn\u2019t limited to text messages. Most other messaging apps offer options to mute notifications and leave group messages. In WhatsApp, you can open the conversation, tap the menu button, and go to \u201cGroup Info\u201d to turn off notifications or exit the group. In Facebook Messenger, head to the conversation\u2019s options and turn notifications off or leave the group entirely. (You can also \u201cignore\u201d the group, which will move it to \u201cmessage requests\u201d where you don\u2019t have to see it, but the other recipients won\u2019t be notified like they would if you left the group.)When in doubt, any messaging app you\u2019re using probably has this option \u2014 you just have to check the options for the message you want to ignore. Of course, you could also tell your aunt to stop messaging everyone with pictures of puppies, but if you\u2019d rather not rock the boat, muting the conversation will suffice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Race Problem Beyond the Numbers", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Williams is a tech executive and startup adviser.With this in mind, when concerned lawmakers scrutinize diversity at tech companies, they should look beyond the raw numbers to ask questions like: Do minorities typically have to have more accomplishments than their peers to be promoted? Do the companies enforce consistent expectations for each role? Are metrics for success clear and communicated? Are all employees given equal opportunities to achieve the goals that are required for promotion to leadership roles? Is there a concrete plan to increase diversity in leadership? All of these things make it more likely that members of underrepresented groups will be treated and promoted fairly \u2014 and that they will also be in positions to help shape its culture and its priorities.In future conversations, the caucus should push companies that boast about such pipeline solutions to go a step further and take a serious look at their effectiveness. Members should ask tech companies how they measure the success of program participants and the impact of their programs on the industry. For example, tech firms could release data on participants\u2019 college matriculation rates, selected majors, admission to accelerators or other tech-focused training programs and employment rates. Keeping tabs on the success rates of these initiatives would ensure that companies are doing more than simply throwing money at the problem and are held accountable for whether their efforts are making a difference.I was pleased to learn that the caucus delegation to Silicon Valley did address at least one issue other than inclusive hiring: They indicated that they planned to scrutinize the impact of major tech companies on the communities that surround their headquarters.There are additional ways in which tech companies can have a positive impact on the people of color in the areas outside their campuses, like Oakland, where I live. One of these is the implementation of robust supplier diversity programs \u2014 business initiatives incentivizing the use of minority-owned, women-owned, veteran-owned, L.G.B.T.Q.-owned and disabled-owned businesses to provide the outside goods and services that companies need. Such programs are mandatory for government contractors but are optional in the private sector. Some tech titans already have such programs in place, and I spearheaded the creation of Facebook\u2019s during my tenure there. The caucus should consider encouraging the many smaller tech companies to do the same, with an emphasis on contracting with companies with local communities.The lawmakers who visited Silicon Valley obviously care very much about the impact of the tech industry on members of racial minority groups. I hope they continue to keep in mind \u2014 whether they\u2019re having discussions with industry leaders or drafting litigation \u2014 what those of us who work in tech know well: that the still-dismal diversity numbers are just one small part of the problem.Advertisement"}

It seems like a great perk, but it can also remove the structure that holds your days together. Before you know it, it\u2019s 4 p.m., you\u2019re still in your pajamas and you haven\u2019t eaten lunch \u2026 let alone seen the outside world.Are you a night owl or an early bird? The beauty of working from home is that you can work during your best hours. Your boss may require you to be available during certain times, but hopefully they give you enough flexibility to shift your schedule accordingly.With those good hours in mind, set a time to start and end your designated work hours. If you can avoid it, try not to start working right when you wake up. Give yourself time to eat breakfast, shower and get dressed, just like you would if you were going to an office.Keeping this morning ritual also ensures you don\u2019t wake up, work through breakfast and ignore personal hygiene. A similar ritual at the end of the day \u2014 like turning off your computer, leaving your office and locking your office doors \u2014 helps you stay away from work in the evening, too.Most importantly, protect your sleep schedule, says Kimber Streams, an editor at Wirecutter. \u201cIf my sleep schedule gets out of whack, it\u2019s hard to make myself get out of bed \u2014 and it\u2019s even harder when you don\u2019t have to physically go into an office,\u201d Mx. Streams said. \u201cIf I\u2019m tired, it\u2019s harder to do my job. And if I can\u2019t do my job, then I feel guilty outside of work hours, my work/life boundaries melt and the delicate balance unravels. Burnout. If I keep a strict schedule, including sleep, it helps me better manage my work/life boundaries.\u201dIt may seem excessive, but when I had trouble sticking to a schedule at home, I set a number of alarms to structure my day. Take a break to work out at 10:30, eat lunch at noon, stop working at 3, and so on. Once you\u2019ve set those alarms, take those breaks seriously. \u201cWalk away from your work space for lunch,\u201d Mx. Streams said. \u201cEven better, go outside! If you\u2019re bad at noticing that it\u2019s lunch time, set a calendar event (or an alarm) to notify you that it\u2019s time to step away.\u201dAs time goes on, this schedule may become second nature, and you can turn off those alarms. But when you\u2019re just starting out, having those notifications can help you avoid sitting in your chair for 11 hours.Once you have your schedule mapped out, do your best to stick to it. If you can force yourself into a routine, you\u2019ll find it easier to keep the work-life balance that can so easily slip away when you work from home.After a few weeks of tracking your time, you\u2019ll begin to see trends, and you can reprioritize. Maybe you need to waste less time on Facebook, or maybe you need to do a better job of listening to those alarms and actually taking out-of-the-office breaks. Once you reassess, you can tweak your schedule and create the ideal workday.Advertisement"}

But if Comcast offers a significantly higher bid than the $52.4 billion that Disney has put forward, as it has hinted that it would do, other shareholders could scuttle Murdochs\u2019 deal with Disney.Here\u2019s how\u2022 how deeply the family was involved in negotiating the Disney deal, and\u2022 how disproportionately the Murdochs may benefit from a lower-priced but all-stock Disney bidThe stockholders have also agreed not to facilitate any effort or attempt by another entity to make an acquisition proposal for 21CF, including by refraining from discussing or providing information to any person in connection with such a proposal.A spokesman for Fox declined to comment on Comcast\u2019s announcement on Wednesday. But this is what Lachlan Murdoch, one of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sons and the company\u2019s executive co-chairman, said on an earnings call earlier this month:\u201cWe\u2019re not going to kind of engage in a lot of speculation around this, but I can say that we are committed to our agreement with Disney and are working through the conditions to bring it to a closing. In addition, our directors, though, of course are aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.\u201dThe cable giant said on Wednesday what we and others have reported: that it is in the \u201cadvanced stages of preparing\u201d a counter bid for the 21st Century Fox assets that Walt Disney has agreed to buy for $52.4 billion.Any offer for Fox would be all-cash and at a premium to the value of the current all-share offer from Disney. The structure and terms of any offer by Comcast, including with respect to both the spinoff of \u201cNew Fox\u201d and the regulatory risk provisions and the related termination fee, would be at least as favorable to Fox shareholders as the Disney offer.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe lawsuit comes in the wake of a tense meeting during which its board voted to dilute Ms. Redstone\u2019s influence over the company. Immediately after the vote, National Amusements called it invalid. In the amended complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, CBS asserted the independence of its board and asked the court to rule on which side\u2019s interpretation of the recent vote is lawful.ContextOn the day before the CBS board was scheduled to meet last week, National Amusements made a sudden and significant change to the CBS bylaws: From now on, the company said, any vote would require a supermajority \u2014 90 percent of the 14 CBS board members \u2014 for approval.The board voted 11 to 3 to significantly diminish Ms. Redstone\u2019s voting power.

The sales of its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia helped lift Uber\u2019s bottom line. Exclude those transactions and Uber would have reported a loss of roughly $550 million.\u2022 Revenue jumped 70 percent from the prior year to $2.59 billion.\u2022 Gross bookings climbed 55 percent.The ride-hailer has long resisted the financial burden of providing its drivers and couriers with health care benefits. But under the leadership of Dara Khosrowshahi, that appears to be slowly changing.The figures aren\u2019t huge. Uber will pay just \u00a31,000 for maternity and paternity leave.

{"Headline": "Diving Into the Artichoke, That Delicious Mess", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteThere is something extravagant about trimming an artichoke heart. The vegetable matter is peeled, plucked and trimmed into a messy heap that is larger than the center bit we manage to save.To an artichoke novice, it can seem absurdly wasteful. And to all cooks, it\u2019s a time-consuming process.But all that trimming is necessary, and the payoff is big. Biting into a well-trimmed artichoke, without any fibrous distractions, is one of the best things about springtime eating \u2014 the joys of asparagus, peas and ramps included.And I promise, the more practice you get, the easier it is. Pull off any leaf (also colloquially called a petal) that feels thicker than a sheet of newspaper. If you can\u2019t easily bend it with your fingers, it will be too tough to chew, even after cooking.Then reach into the center of the flowerlike thistle and scrape out any purplish spikes you see, along with the white choke lying like a shag carpet over the flesh. A serrated grapefruit spoon works nicely here, but a regular spoon or paring knife will also get the job done.One thing you should not trim away, though, is the artichoke stem, particularly on medium to large thistles. The white core, which you can see from the bottom of the stem, tastes as sweet and nutty as the heart. Peel or cut off the outer green parts, and keep as much of this core as you can.Sometimes I munch the stems raw, dunked in olive oil and salt while I hack my way through a mountain of artichokes. It\u2019s the chef\u2019s treat \u2014 the vegetable version of eating the chicken tail when you\u2019re carving up a roasted bird.Roasted artichokes also make an excellent salad, albeit one with a softer texture than the slawlike raw kind, and a browned, almost meaty flavor. Here I toss the roasted wedges with peas and plenty of mint, and serve them on a bed of lemon-flavored ricotta, an idea I picked up at a dinner party on my last trip to Rome.Another dish inspired by Italian sojourns is pasta with a sauce of saut\u00e9ed artichoke hearts and pancetta. The key here is to use the starchy pasta water to bring the elements together; the artichokes themselves don\u2019t exude enough liquid to create a sauce. But they\u2019ve got an intense flavor that stands up to the salty pancetta and the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on at the end.If you\u2019d rather be more minimalist in terms of trimming, you can follow the French and steam your artichokes whole.You\u2019ll still need to snip off the pointed petal tips to keep from scratching yourself while eating.

{"Headline": "China Tries to Erase Taiwan, One Ally (and Website) at a Time", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 Can China use its enormous economic and diplomatic leverage to simply erase Taiwan\u2019s international identity?China seems to be trying. But its increasingly aggressive posture toward Taiwan is creating a backlash here that is undermining Beijing\u2019s ultimate goal: bringing the island\u2019s 23 million residents under its authority.Although China has long sought to isolate Taiwan, people here said its latest efforts have been the most intense in decades. China\u2019s economic and diplomatic moves have coincided with a series of military exercises that officials said were explicitly aimed at Taiwan and its president since 2016, Tsai Ing-wen, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally supported independence.\u201cThe Chinese government always says it wants to win the hearts and minds of the Taiwanese people, but their military threats against Taiwan and the diplomatic assault against Taiwan are not doing that,\u201d the foreign minister, Joseph Wu, recently told reporters.Even the slightest misstep can provoke China\u2019s vindictive pique.\u201cChina\u2019s goal regarding Taiwan has never changed,\u201d Lee Teng-hui, who in 1996 became Taiwan\u2019s first democratically elected president, said in a rare interview.\u201cThat goal is to swallow up Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty, exterminate Taiwanese democracy and achieve ultimate unification,\u201d said Mr. Lee. At 96, the former leader is calling for a referendum that could pave a path toward sovereignty by explicitly declaring the island Taiwan, not the Republic of China, as it is formally known.Ms. Tsai\u2019s government has tried to push back against China\u2019s campaign \u2014 \u201con a daily basis,\u201d as Mr. Wu, the foreign minister, put it. He and others here acknowledge, however, that China\u2019s economic clout has cowed corporations \u2014 and countries \u2014 fearful of losing access to the world\u2019s largest consumer market.Fire EX, an indie punk band here in Taiwan, knows what it is like to endure China\u2019s disapproval.Fire EX once played in China, but it has not done so since the protests, depriving it of revenue and greater exposure among millions of potential Mandarin-speaking fans.\u201cThose who want to make money will never touch on these topics,\u201d said the band\u2019s lead singer, who prefers to be known by a single name, Sam. \u201cNot talking about these things makes many people believe they are not important. So actually, China\u2019s tactic has succeeded.\u201dThe cost for China, though, is high.The cultural and political divides between China and Taiwan are only deepening. Although many in Taiwan are descendants of Chinese who, along with the Republic of China government, fled the civil war that ended with the Communist takeover in 1949, the potential appeal of unification has waned here, at least in part because of China\u2019s aggressive attitude.\u201cIt\u2019s totally two different countries,\u201d Sam said.Others, too, are resisting.\u201cMy works have been inspired by cultures all over the world but rely entirely on the germination, growth and evolution of the land \u2018Taiwan,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cLike the Taiwan clouded leopards in my next work, the Taiwan hemlock, the ocean around it and the more than 200 mountains of three thousand meters \u2014 to abandon this land, this name, my work would have no basis.\u201dWhile many here still look to China for economic opportunities, Ms. Tsai\u2019s government is moving to strengthen economic \u2014 and diplomatic \u2014 ties with friendlier countries, including the United States, the European Union and Japan.Ms. Tsai reacted angrily when Burkina Faso severed official relations and recognized China. Its move came only weeks after the Dominican Republic did the same. Now only 17 countries and the Vatican have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.As the world\u2019s 22nd-largest economy, Taiwan has its own leverage, and many here argue that the government could use it to become less dependent on economic ties with China, which are deep despite the political frictions.\u201cThe economy is over-reliant on China,\u201d said Mr. Lee, the former president. \u201cChina\u2019s economic incentives for Taiwan are part of a policy to create addictive subsidies that serve a political agenda.\u201dStill others cling to a quixotic hope that Taiwan can reverse the tide and emerge with independent, internationally recognized status.In Hsinchu, a technology hub on the western coast, 200 students participating in an annual Model United Nations conference last weekend practiced the ways of an organization in which Taiwan, because of China, is not now allowed to participate.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to change the situation right now,\u201d one of them, Grace Kung, 15, acknowledged. But she and her peers brim with hope that that could change.Ms. Kung criticized the World Health Organization for not inviting Taiwan to the annual assembly on global health. \u201cThe government and people of Taiwan want to help,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be blocked by any government, including China\u2019s, because of a political stance.\u201dBy chance, she was assigned to represent China in the students\u2019 model conference, which gave her an appreciation of what Taiwan is up against.\u201cBeing the delegate for China,\u201d she said, \u201cis a powerful feeling.\u201dOlivia Mitchell Ryan contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Transparency\u2019 Is the Mother of Fake News", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneMr. Fish is a legal scholar and author.For some time now everyone has been worrying about \u201cfake news\u201d or the world of \u201calternative fact\u201d and wondering just how and why this unhappy phenomenon has flourished. My take on this question is simple, although I hope not simple-minded: Fake news is in large part a product of the enthusiasm \u2014 not to say rage \u2014 for transparency and absolutely free speech.I know that this is a counterintuitive proposition. I would like to begin my defense of it with an anecdote.In November 2016, Scott Titsworth, dean of the Scripps College of Communication at Ohio University, informed the university community of the first meeting of a presidential advisory group charged with recommending free speech policies for the campus. Titsworth reported that the group\u2019s first action was to affirm transparency as one of its \u201ccore values\u201d; the second action was to decide (unanimously) that its meetings would not be open to the public, but held in private.As you can imagine, it was easy to make fun of the obvious contradiction, but the contradiction is not so glaring once we understand that two notions of what \u201cfree\u201d means are in play here. The group wants (understandably) to be free of the pressures that would be felt if the proceedings were conducted under public scrutiny; at every moment members would be tempted to tailor what they said to the responses and criticisms of an imagined audience. In short, they would not be speaking freely but under a shadow if the meaning of \u201cfreely\u201d in force were \u201centirely without filters, gatekeepers and boundaries.\u201dThat sense of \u201cfreely\u201d is championed by techno-utopians whose mantra is \u201cinformation wants to be free\u201d and who believe that the promised land predicted by the authors of every technological advance \u2014 the printing press, newspapers, the telegraph, the railroad, radio, television, the digital computer, the internet \u2014 is just around the corner. It is a land in which democracy\u2019s potential is finally realized in a communication community where all voices are recognized and none marginalized, with no one hoarding information or controlling access or deciding who speaks and who doesn\u2019t.What Titsworth and his fellow committee members see is that this more ambitious and abstract sense of \u201cfreely\u201d is antithetical to the successful completion of their task: Not speaking freely in front of everyone is a condition of speaking freely \u2014 without anxiety and mental reservation \u2014 on the way to exploring the complexities and difficulties of their charge.The moral (provisionally, and perhaps prematurely, drawn) is that transparency is not unambiguously a good thing. (I pass over for the moment the prior question of whether it is a possible thing.) And if that is right, then the proliferation of speech may not be a good thing either; silence and the withholding and sequestering of speech may be useful and even necessary in some contexts, like the preparing of a report or maintaining of a marriage. I say this aware that many free speech advocates believe that the more free speech there is the better the human condition will be, and who believe, too, that it is the business of our institutions, including our legislatures and courts, to increase the amount of speech available.At first glance the bias in favor of unlimited speech and information seems perfectly reasonable and even unassailable. What arguments could be brought against it? An answer to that question has been offered in recent years by a small, but growing, number of critics.Another way to put this is to say that information, data and the unbounded flow of more and more speech can be politicized \u2014 it can, that is, be woven into a narrative that constricts rather than expands the area of free, rational choice. When that happens \u2014 and it will happen often \u2014 transparency and the unbounded flow of speech become instruments in the production of the very inequalities (economic, political, educational) that the gospel of openness promises to remove. And the more this gospel is preached and believed, the more that the answer to everything is assumed to be data uncorrupted by interests and motives, the easier it will be for interest and motives to operate under transparency\u2019s cover.This is so because speech and data presented as if they were independent of any mechanism of selectivity will float free of the standards of judgment that are always the content of such mechanisms. Removing or denying the existence of gatekeeping procedures will result not in a fair and open field of transparency but in a field where manipulation and deception find no obstacles. Because it is an article of their faith that politics are bad and the unmediated encounter with data is good, internet prophets will fail to see the political implications of what they are trying to do, for in their eyes political implications are what they are doing away with.Indeed, their deepest claim \u2014 so deep that they are largely unaware of it \u2014 is that politics can be eliminated. They don\u2019t regard politics as an unavoidable feature of mortal life but as an unhappy consequence of the secular equivalent of the Tower of Babel: too many languages, too many points of view. Politics (faction and difference) will just wither away when the defect that generates it (distorted communication) has been eliminated by unmodified data circulated freely among free and equal consumers; everyone will be on the same page, reading from the same script and apprehending the same universal meanings. Back to Eden!This utopian fantasy rests on a positive, vaguely perfectionist view of human nature: Rather than being doomed by original sin to conflict, prejudice, hatred and an insatiable will to power, men and women are by nature communitarian, inclined to fellowship and the seeking of common ground. These good instincts, we are told, have been blocked by linguistic differences that can now be transcended by the digital revolution.In the alternative and true story rehearsed by many, human difference is irreducible, and there is no \u201cneutral observation language\u201d (a term of the philosopher Thomas Kuhn\u2019s in his 1962 book \u201cThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions\u201d) that can bridge, soften, blur and even erase the differences. When people from opposing constituencies clash there is no common language to which they can refer their differences for mechanical resolution; there are only political negotiations that would involve not truth telling but propaganda, threats, insults, deceptions, exaggerations, insinuations, bluffs, posturings \u2014 all the forms of verbal manipulation that will supposedly disappear in the internet nirvana.They won\u2019t. Indeed, they will proliferate because the politically angled speech that is supposedly the source of our problems is in fact the only possible route to their (no doubt temporary) solution. Speech proceeding from a point of view can at least be recognized as such and then countered. You say, \u201cI know where those guys are coming from, and here are my reasons for believing that we should be coming from some place else\u201d \u2014 and dialogue begins. It is dialogue inflected by interests and agendas, but dialogue still. But when speech (or information or data) is just sitting there inert, unattached to any perspective, when there are no guidelines, monitors, gatekeepers or filters, what you have are innumerable bits (like Lego) available for assimilation into any project a clever verbal engineer might imagine; and what you don\u2019t have is any mechanism that can stop or challenge the construction project or even assess it. What you have, in short, are the perfect conditions for the unchecked proliferation of what has come to be called \u201cfake news.\u201dThat\u2019s not quite right. The insistence on the primacy of narratives and interpretations does not involve a deriding of facts but an alternative story of their emergence. Postmodernism sets itself against the notion of facts just lying there discrete and independent, and waiting to be described. Instead it argues that fact is the achievement of argument and debate, not a pre-existing entity by whose measure argument can be assessed. Arguments come first; when they are successful, facts follow \u2014 at least for a while, until a new round of arguments replaces them with a new set of facts.This is far from the picture of Nietzschean nihilism that Hanson and others paint. Friction, not free invention, is the heart of the process: You commit yourself to the standards of evidence long in place in the conversation you enter, and then you maneuver as best you can within the guidelines of those standards. Thus, for example, a judge who issues a decision cannot simply decide which side he favors and then generate an opinion; he must first pass through and negotiate the authorized routes for getting there. Sometimes the effort at negotiation will fail and he will say that despite his interpretive desires, \u201cThis opinion just won\u2019t write.\u201dAny opinion will write if there are no routes to be negotiated or no standards to hew to, if nothing but your own interpretive desire prevents you from assembling or reassembling bits of unmoored data lying around in the world into a story that serves your purposes. It is not postmodernism that licenses this irresponsibility; it is the doctrine that freedom of information and transparency are all we need.Those who proclaim this theology can in good faith ignore or bypass all the usual routes of validation because their religion tells them that those routes are corrupt and that only the nonmethod of having no routes, no boundaries, no categories, no silos can bring us to the River Jordan and beyond.In many versions of Protestantism, parishioners are urged to reject merely human authority in any form and go directly to the pure word of God. For the technophiles the pure word of God is to be found in data. In fact, what is found in a landscape where data detached from any context abounds is the fracturing of the word into ever proliferating pieces of discourse, all existing side by side, indifferently approved, and without any way of distinguishing among them, of telling which of them are true or at least have a claim to be true and which are made up out of whole cloth.That is the world of fake news. It is created by the undermining of trust in the traditional vehicles of authority and legitimation \u2014 major newspapers, professional associations, credentialed academics, standard encyclopedias, government bureaus, federal courts, prime-time nightly news anchors.When Walter Cronkite was the longtime anchor at CBS, he was known as the most trusted man in America; and when he signed off by saying, \u201cAnd that\u2019s the way it is,\u201d everyone believed him. In the brave new world of the internet, where authority is evenly distributed to everyone with a voice or a podcast, no one believes anybody, or (it is the same thing) everyone believes anybody.This wholesale distrust of authoritative mechanisms leads to the bizarre conclusion that an assertion of fact is more credible if it lacks an institutional source. In this way of thinking, a piece of news originating in a blog maintained by a teenager in a basement in Idaho would be more reliable than a piece of news announced by the anchor of a major network. And, again, what has brought us to this sorry pass is not the writings of Derrida or Foucault or any postmodern guru but the twin mantras of more free speech and absolute transparency.Stanley Fish is a professor of law at Florida International University and a visiting professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. He is the author of many books and is currently at work on a book about free speech in America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stacey Abrams Wins Georgia Democratic Primary for Governor, Making History", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeorgia Democrats selected the first black woman to be a major party nominee for governor in the United States on Tuesday, choosing Stacey Abrams, a liberal former State House leader, who will test just how much the state\u2019s traditionally conservative politics are shifting.By handily defeating Stacey Evans, also a former state legislator, Ms. Abrams also became Georgia\u2019s first black nominee for governor, a prize that has eluded earlier generations of African-American candidates in the state. The general election is sure to draw intense national attention as Georgia voters determine whether a black woman can win in the Deep South, a region that has not had an African-American governor since Reconstruction.She will face either Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, the top Republican vote getter Tuesday, or Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Mr. Cagle and Mr. Kemp will vie for their party\u2019s nomination in a July runoff.Ms. Abrams\u2019s victory, confirmed by The Associated Press, came on the latest 2018 primary night to see Democratic women finding success, as voters in Kentucky, Arkansas and Texas also went to the polls. Among the winners was Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot, who upset Mayor Jim Gray of Lexington in a House primary in Kentucky.Speaking later to a throng of supporters at a downtown Atlanta hotel, Ms. Abrams did not directly invoke her barrier-breaking nomination but held up her candidacy as a sign of the state\u2019s progress.\u201cWe are writing the next chapter of Georgia\u2019s history, where no one is unseen, no one is unheard and no one is uninspired,\u201d she said.When she arrived, Ms. Abrams spoke forcefully, calling herself a \u201cproud daughter of the Deep South,\u201d and referring to Georgia\u2019s rich but \u201ccomplicated\u201d history \u2014 and of leaders who too often had overlooked the \u201cgap between struggle and success.\u201dShe also quoted the Book of Esther, saying \u201cWe were born for such a time as this.\u201dWith Atlanta thriving as a capital of black America and a magnet for immigrants across the world, Georgia\u2019s demographics are changing. Yet even as Democrats eye the state as the next great blue hope, the party has struggled to win statewide office in part because it has had little success with conservative-leaning whites. African-American Democrats have held powerful state offices, like the attorney general\u2019s post, but Republicans currently control every major position in Georgia.Ms. Abrams has signaled that she is unlikely to spend much time pleading with rural whites to return to a Democratic Party that they have largely abandoned. She has embarked instead on a strategy of energizing a coalition of young and nonwhite Georgians who represent a growing share of the state\u2019s population, an approach national Democrats are watching closely as they grapple with how to reclaim the presidency.See full results and maps from the Georgia primaries.And Ms. Abrams\u2019s race and gender may make her bid difficult enough: Georgia has never elected a female governor, and while Atlanta has elected a procession of African-American mayors, they have not found success in running for statewide office.Many Democrats believe that waging a progressive campaign aimed at mobilizing liberals, rather than running toward the center to win over suburban moderates, is folly in a state that has not elected a Democratic governor since 1998.\u201cIt\u2019s still a red state, even though it\u2019s getting more purple every year,\u201d said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University.Yet Ms. Abrams\u2019s candidacy comes at a volatile moment in Georgia, where demographic changes are creating fresh uncertainty about Republicans\u2019 dominance, and when left-leaning voters are highly energized.President Trump carried Georgia by just five percentage points in 2016, a narrower margin than he enjoyed in traditional battleground states like Ohio and Iowa. And booming communities of black, Hispanic and Asian-American voters in the Atlanta area have put Georgia on track to become a majority-minority state inside of a decade.Her candidacy will also be a test of whether the extraordinary energy coursing through Democratic politics at the federal level will also flow into state elections. In a special election for Congress in Georgia last year, grass-roots donors helped a political newcomer, Jon Ossoff, raise nearly $30 million in a losing campaign. But there is little precedent for Democrats pouring small dollars into a state election on that scale, and it is unclear whether Ms. Abrams can expect a similar outpouring of support.Recognizing that opportunity, and facing growing calls for candidate diversity in a party that depends heavily on black voters, several national groups aligned with Democrats have made Ms. Abrams\u2019s campaign a top priority. And African-American activists say they will be watching them to ensure they keep their commitment.\u201cWe need to hold our institutions accountable to investing in black women\u2019s leadership,\u201d said Glynda Carr, who helped found Higher Heights, a group that promotes African-American women in politics.Several potential presidential candidates have already campaigned with Ms. Abrams and are all but certain to return to her side in the general election. Advisers to Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, the Senate\u2019s two black Democrats, both of whom are considering the 2020 race, said Ms. Abrams\u2019s campaign was a high priority for the fall.Only two African-Americans have been elected governor by voters: L. Douglas Wilder in Virginia in 1989 and Deval Patrick in Massachusetts in 2006 and again in 2010.What may prove decisive this fall is whether Ms. Abrams \u2014 in addition to drawing out voters who typically do not vote in a midterm election \u2014 can also win over the sort of white women who have recoiled from Mr. Trump and powered Democratic turnout in a series of special elections and primaries.To do so, she will have to make inroads that have eluded other Democrats. In Georgia, about seven in 10 white women voted for both Mr. Trump in 2016 and Gov. Nathan Deal, the term-limited incumbent, in 2014, exit polls found. In Georgia\u2019s last election for governor, African-Americans made up about 30 percent of the electorate, and nine in 10 gave their votes to Jason Carter, the Democratic nominee and a grandson of the former president Jimmy Carter.But nearly two-thirds of voters in 2014 were white, according to exit polls. Mr. Carter lost his race by eight percentage points \u2014 and a little more than 200,000 votes \u2014 to Mr. Deal. Ms. Abrams will have to drive minority turnout far higher, without losing ground among whites, to avoid Mr. Carter\u2019s fate.In other primary races Tuesday, Ms. McGrath in Kentucky displayed another show of force by a Democratic woman in a contested primary. She seized the party\u2019s nomination for a Republican-leaning House seat based in Lexington, defeating Mr. Gray, the city\u2019s popular mayor.In Texas, Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a lawyer, defeated Laura Moser, a writer and political progressive, in a Houston-area House runoff that once was seen as a major proxy fight between the Democratic establishment and its left wing.But after attacking Ms. Moser during the first round of balloting in March \u2014 a move that seemed to elevate her candidacy by accident \u2014 the House Democratic campaign arm remained silent while still quietly backing Ms. Fletcher. Ms. Moser was then unable to rouse some of the liberal attention she drew in the lead-up to the initial vote.Elsewhere in Texas, Gina Ortiz Jones, an Air Force veteran, won the nomination to run in a heavily Hispanic district that stretches from San Antonio far along the state\u2019s southern border. Ms. Jones, who would be the first lesbian to represent Texas in Congress, will face Representative Will Hurd, a Republican who has won a series of difficult elections.And in a Democratic runoff in the race for governor, Lupe Valdez, the former Dallas County sheriff, defeated Andrew White and will face the Republican incumbent, Greg Abbott, in the fall.The most prominent race in Arkansas on Tuesday was in the state\u2019s most moderate House district, a Little Rock-based seat that sent Democrats to Congress until 2010. Clarke Tucker, a state representative, defeated a handful of more liberal challengers to win the nomination, avoiding a runoff. He will take on Representative French Hill in November.In the Republican primary for governor, Asa Hutchinson held off an aggressive conservative challenge from Jan Morgan, a television personality and gun shop owner. Mr. Hutchinson will face Jared Henderson, the Democratic nominee.Richard Fausset contributed reporting from Atlanta and Michael Tackett from Richmond, Ky.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran, Like Russia Before It, Tries to Block Telegram App", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Iran blocked Telegram, the most popular messaging app in the country, on Tuesday, claiming the service used by 40 million Iranians endangers national security.It was just the latest in a series of moves by the Iranian authorities to limit use of the app, part of a tug of war between hard-liners and President Hassan Rouhani, who has long campaigned for more freedom on social media.The hard-liners complain that Telegram poses dangers because Iran\u2019s censors have no control over it. In a statement posted on the news website Mizan, which is associated with the country\u2019s conservative judiciary, a prosecutor accused Telegram of supporting terrorists and other hostile groups.The minister of information and communication technology, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, at 35 the youngest member of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s cabinet, said on Twitter that trying to stop technology was pointless.There have since been reports, so far unverified, that Mr. Azari Jahromi has resigned.On Tuesday, some users of Telegram in Iran said they were still able to communicate through the app over their home internet connections. In the confusion, several websites that are usually freely accessible \u2014 including Wikipedia and Google \u2014 were hard to reach.In Iran, the battle over the app has become something of a litmus test for Mr. Rouhani, whose popularity has dropped significantly since his re-election in May last year. During his campaign, he promised to deliver more freedoms, to provide greater employment opportunities and to get the country\u2019s notorious morality police off the streets. He has largely fallen short of those goals.Telegram is widely used in Iran, for activities as varied as chatting, booking appointments at beauty salons, selling cars or finding partners. Even the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had his own channel until recently. Such channels, which sometimes draw hundreds of thousands of users who receive instant messages at the push of a button, played a major role in spreading videos of nationwide protests in December.On Monday, Iran\u2019s judiciary issued a decree ordering internet service providers to block access to the Telegram app, as they have already been doing for years for Facebook and Twitter.In recent weeks, government institutions had already begun taking down their Telegram channels, urging people to switch to Iranian applications such as Soroush. But many Iranians chose not to follow the guidance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Water Will Come, but Not to This Miami Home", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 21st-century Atlantis-in-the-making is how many scientists think of Miami Beach. With a projected sea-level rise of three to four feet by the century\u2019s end, huge chunks of the barrier-island city are expected to lie beneath the Atlantic Ocean. But Hany Boutros is staying.In fact, Mr. Boutros, 43, a Detroit-area health care executive and real estate developer, has built a new 3,500-square-foot home in South Beach, the city\u2019s most threatened neighborhood.\u201cI would be foolish if I didn\u2019t take sea-level rise into consideration, but it\u2019s not going to stop me from living the life I want,\u201d he said, standing inside his Prairie Avenue home\u2019s entryway. \u201cI found a solution,\u201d he added, motioning to the retractable automated stairway that connects a 9,400-square-foot open-air gated tropical garden and parking area with the three-bedroom house above it.Designed by the Miami architect Rene Gonzalez as the first in a series of luxury \u201celevated houses\u201d around South Florida, it has been built to allow up to 10 feet of storm surge to safely flow underneath it.\u201cThe house already went through a test when Irma hit,\u201d Mr. Boutros said, referring to the hurricane that swamped greater Miami in September. It was reported that Irma\u2019s 185-mile-an-hour winds had largely spared the area, but it was a different story on the ground. Wind-driven rain flooded the ultramodern high rises and Art Deco hotels alike; two feet of water sloshed through some neighborhoods, while others were left without electricity for weeks.Back in Michigan, Mr. Boutros was poking around Facebook, desperate for a post-Irma update on how his new house had fared.\u201cI saw a nearby neighbor posting pictures of flooding and tree damage as she walked around,\u201d he said.Mr. Boutros messaged her, gave her the access codes to the control panels that essentially run his home and asked her to step inside it. The rest of the street had lost power, but his front gate opened, and the retractable staircase smoothly descended 10 feet on its system of pulleys and cables.\u201cBecause I have a generator that turns on automatically, the house ended up being a shelter. I said, \u2018Bring your friends, bring your kids, there\u2019s hot water for showers \u2014 please use it!\u2019 I had zero damages. It was as if Irma went around my house,\u201d he said.That was no accident, Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cRather than fighting the situation, we have to create spaces that allow us to live in a way that is closer to the environment, closer to the way the Seminole Indians in Florida lived,\u201d with their Chickee huts up off the ground on stilts, protecting against water and allowing ventilating breezes to blow through.Mr. Gonzalez has taken that same approach to the glass walls of this home\u2019s living room. They act as pocket doors, entirely sliding away to create another open-air space. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Mr. Gonzalez used glass sparingly. With the home\u2019s overall cost at $1,700 a square foot, exposed and treated concrete dominates \u201cwith planes that just float, without gravity, if you will.\u201d\u201cThe walls don\u2019t touch the floor. They go up beyond the ceiling, appearing to continue to the sky. It gives you the effect of infinite space.\u201dMiami artists also feature prominently. In the dining room, a massive sculpture by Sinisa Kukec resembles two golden raindrops plinking into puddles. One guest bedroom displays an abstract painting by Lynne Golob Gelfman, the other a drawing by Michele Oka Doner. Separate control panels allow guests to access these rooms and come and go on their own, even if other parts of the home remain locked.While Mr. Gonzalez praised Miami Beach officials for tackling sea-level rise with a $500 million street-raising and pumping project (one that is being re-evaluated amid concerns that plans for further elevated roads may actually worsen flooding of adjoining homes and businesses in the short term), he said he was frustrated with many in the real estate community. Some architects seem happy to take their wedding cake-style McMansions and jack them up on stilts, he noted, regardless of what he calls the poor aesthetics. And some developers still seem to be in denial.That much was clear in Jeff Goodell\u2019s 2017 book \u201cThe Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, and the Remaking of the Civilized World.\u201d Mr. Goodell wrote of cornering Jorge P\u00e9rez at an event honoring Ms. Oka Doner inside his namesake P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami.Ms. Oka Doner had already sold her Miami Beach home, convinced that it would soon be underwater. Mr. P\u00e9rez, one of South Florida\u2019s largest condo developers, was more skeptical. Asked by Mr. Goodell if sea-level rise had altered his business thinking, he replied curtly that it hadn\u2019t. Pressed, Mr. P\u00e9rez said, \u201cIn 20 or 30 years, someone is going to find a solution for this.\u201d He added, \u201cBesides, by that time, I\u2019ll be dead, so what does it matter?\u201dFor his part, Mr. Boutros said the rising sea wasn\u2019t his only concern. Raised in Lebanon before he moved to Detroit to attend college, Mr. Boutros said he practically lived on Beirut\u2019s shoreline. Sun-dappled Miami Beach was a homecoming of sorts, but he was aware of security issues. Hence the retractable staircase. \u201cI\u2019m not here 24/7,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we make sure there\u2019s no access to the house?\u201d With a chuckle, he added, \u201cPlus, I wanted something out of James Bond, something sexy.\u201dThe same playfully louche theme carries through to his master bedroom, where a large doorless shower with transparent glass walls occupies the center of the room. This is not a home for anyone, or their overnight guests, who is bashful about disrobing.\u201cIf someone is with you in this room and you\u2019re not comfortable being naked with them, they shouldn\u2019t be in this room,\u201d Mr. Boutros said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between standing naked in the middle of the room and being naked in bed?\u201dMr. Boutros wasn\u2019t waiting for a reply. He was already bounding up a staircase that led from his bedroom to a roof deck. Open on one side except for a barely there railing, it too was not for the cautious. Or anyone less than sure footed in high heels. Or anyone who\u2019d had a drink or two. Or children. Or \u2026 but Mr. Boutros waved off those concerns as well. \u201cIt\u2019s my space. If I invite you up to the roof, I already know what you\u2019re capable of handling.\u201d His guests seem to have to pass an awful lot of tests just to get past the front door. \u201cIn a good way!\u201d he said, laughing.The roof setting made Mr. Boutros\u2019 brazen enthusiasm more understandable. Partially shrouded by a tropical canopy, it admitted no sound but the chirping of birds. In Michigan, Mr. Boutros works from 8:30 a.m. until 1 or 2 in the morning, so he can board a plane to Florida on Friday and remain through the weekend.\u201cWhen I wake up in Miami, my biggest worry is where I\u2019m going to eat that night,\u201d he said.

Many sexual encounters seem to take place in a so-called gray zone of miscommunication, denial, rationalization and, sometimes, regret.There\u2019s that popular saying, \u201cconsent is sexy.\u201d I\u2019ve seen it proudly written on Twitter, on t-shirts and signs at rallies. But something always sat with me the wrong way about that phrase. Consent isn\u2019t sexy. It\u2019s crucial. It\u2019s not a healthy sexual encounter without full consent.Throughout my three years in college I never, ever moved forward with a girl without first asking her if it was okay. Consent was that simple: \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d In my experience, questions like this, asked with the right cadence and at the right time, made sex a more enjoyable experience.My boyfriend and I have worked out what consent looks like for us. I still struggle with giving a definitive \u201cno,\u201d so our rule is that if the other person isn\u2019t enthusiastically reciprocating, everything stops. If we do any form of role-play, we establish the exact order of activities beforehand, and if at any point we want to step out, we say a safe word and all activity stops.Many people\u2019s first exposure to sexuality is porn, which teaches kids that men should be rough, demanding, and that if a girl says no, you just need to try harder to convince her. We need to teach our children (especially boys) the self control, respect and communication necessary for healthy intimacy, and do it long before they have devices they can watch porn on.Every woman I know carries at least one story of her almost-but-maybe-not-quite sexual assault. And there lies the problem: we have been conditioned to believe that anything less than violent rape by a stranger does not deserve our concern or condemnation. But it\u2019s never been that black and white, and I will now tell you what I wish I could tell my 15-year-old self: Just because he\u2019s your boyfriend doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t assault you. Sexual coercion is a form of sexual abuse. You have the right to stop at any time, yes, even if he\u2019s already horny. Do not give in to sex just to avoid an argument. Do not apologize for saying no.If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted \u2014 or if you\u2019re not sure \u2014 please consider the following resources:EDITORSJessica BennettDaniel JonesAnya StrzemienBonnie WertheimDESIGNTracy MaUmi SyamSOCIAL MEDIASharon AttiaFahima HaqueRESEARCHMiya LeeAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trapping Foxes to Save Plovers Sets Off Showdown at Jersey Shore", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "Wildlife officials have used snare traps to protect the endangered birds. It\u2019s ruffling more than feathers in a town where the fox is the unofficial mascot.Supported byBRIGANTINE, N.J. \u2014 Red foxes can be found all over New Jersey, wandering out of the woods and poking through garbage at dusk in search of a meal. In many places, they might be overlooked, if not seen as a disease-carrying nuisance. But not in Brigantine, an island community where the fox has become an unofficial ambassador.Many residents warmly share stories of their encounters, like the fox that would routinely come up to a back door or the time a children\u2019s soccer game had to pause so one could cross the field. A fox makes an appearance on the cover of the city\u2019s tourism guide, as much of an attraction as its golf course and pristine beaches. A real estate company regularly sends its mascot, Briggy the Fox, to community events.Some are challenging the use of snare traps, a contraption that they describe as cruel and painful. The contretemps has also stirred a wider debate: Is it fair to kill one animal for the sake of protecting another?\u201cIt disgusts me,\u201d said Donna Vanzant, who owns a marina. \u201cWhy go after these gorgeous animals? Just let nature take its course.\u201d\u201cEveryone on the island cherishes the foxes and does not want them killed,\u201d said Donna Grazioli DeAngelis, a retired teacher who started a petition online, which about 90,000 people have signed. \u201cThey have been so respectful, so perfect in every way,\u201d she said of the foxes. \u201cPeople paint them, photograph them. They haven\u2019t been a nuisance in any way.\u201dBrigantine, just north of Atlantic City and connected to the mainland by a single bridge, has wandering roads packed with towering beach houses and dotted with the occasional sign warning of crossing turtles and golf carts. The city has a year-round population of 9,000, with another 20,000 or so residents who, like the plover, flock back when the weather warms up.State officials have set aside a smooth slice of shore, on the north end of the island, for the plovers to build their nests far from any development. After the birds arrive, portions of the beach are closed, giving the visitors a wide berth to lay their eggs. Cages protect nests from predators, and if a wily creature figures out it can dig its way in, another level of security \u2014 electrified fencing \u2014 is added.The United States Fish and Wildlife Service, on behalf of the state, also sets snare traps in the brush along the shore to capture foxes before the birds even arrive, a practice that officials said has been routine for years.The state\u2019s Division of Fish and Wildlife said that only about 10 foxes were captured on Brigantine beach this year, roughly the same number it caught every year, and that the trapping was finished for the season. Hunting and trapping foxes is legal in New Jersey; as many as 9,000 foxes across the state have been \u201charvested\u201d each year by trappers, according to recent state data.The tempest over the foxes has coincided with a decision by state wildlife officials to take control of the beach area where the plovers nest after years of sharing oversight with the city. The Department of Environmental Protection announced last year that it would reduce access for vehicles onto the beach, limiting it to anglers.Since then, one city official said he worried about people coming across \u201cpiles of carcasses.\u201d A resident who said he has recently spotted foxes in the area shields that location as if it were a state secret.Some in Brigantine argue that the fox has been unfairly targeted while other predators like raccoons and even gulls pose just as much of a threat. They have also argued that there must be an option other than killing the animals.\u201cYou have to protect the endangered species, and there\u2019s only so many ways to do it,\u201d Rick DeLucry, a city councilman, said. \u201cBut is this really the only way, or the best way? That can\u2019t be right. There\u2019s got to be something else.\u201dLawrence Hajna, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said the snare traps were \u201can acceptable management tool.\u201d He added that relocating the animals, as some have suggested, was not feasible, citing concerns about possibly spreading disease or creating a nuisance somewhere else.While there are plenty of foxes in New Jersey, the plover is in a much more precarious position. \u201cThey\u2019re having a tough time of it,\u201d Mr. Hajna said.The piping plover, a shorebird with a wingspan of only about 15 inches, has light brown and white feathers that allow it to blend in with the sand. The birds usually return to the Atlantic Coast in March and make nests that are little more than scrapes in the sand lined with pebbles and shells.But a changing coast, in many places consumed by development, has eaten away at their habitat and made it more difficult for them to nest. Some states have made progress in restoring their plover population, but it continues to dwindle in New Jersey and New York. \u201cThere aren\u2019t really any safe havens left for them to nest, or not many,\u201d said Todd Pover, a senior wildlife biologist at the Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey.Researchers say that the bird\u2019s survival, at least in New Jersey, is largely dependent upon wildlife officials stepping in. Dave Jenkins, the bureau chief for the fish and wildlife division\u2019s Endangered and Nongame Species Program, described the piping plover as \u201cone of the most intensively monitored and managed species.\u201d He said the state has a biologist and six other employees and a team of volunteers dedicated to the plover and other endangered shorebirds.Some in Brigantine believe that the intervention has upset the natural balance of the island. Residents complained that foxes were becoming harder and harder to find and that rats and other pests were thriving because the foxes were not there to hunt them.\u201cIt\u2019s an overreach and overreaction,\u201d Philip J. Guenther, Brigantine\u2019s longtime mayor, said of the fox trapping. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense from a protection standpoint.\u201dIt takes a bumpy ride in a four-wheel-drive vehicle to reach the part of the shore reserved for plovers. Longtime residents can tell how the coast has evolved, as wooden piers and the foundation of an old Coast Guard station rise higher out of the sand than they remember.This spring, plovers have made their way back to the island, but their nesting has been delayed by a stubborn winter. An employee with the Division of Fish and Wildlife patrolled the beach on a recent day in a pickup truck, keeping those who did not belong from entering. Waves crashed onto the shore in the wind, and the beach was largely empty. Only a few fisherman had driven onto the sand, and there was not a fox in sight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japanese Seafood Without the Painful Price Tag, at Wokuni", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review8 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Can anybody who has to think about the price of groceries still keep up with the sushi scene in New York? Just in the past year we\u2019ve gotten at least five omakase-only sanctuaries \u2014 Sushi Noz, Sushi Amane, Noda, Shoji at 69 Leonard Street and Ichimura at Uchu \u2014 where the price of a meal, before drinks and tax, is somewhere between $250 and $300. If you were already inclined to think that the Japanese seafood game, like so many other things in Manhattan, is rigged in favor of the robber barons, these restaurants won\u2019t change your mind.Given the mixed messages it sends out, this is understandable. It has soaring ceilings, a backlit bar with shelves so high the topmost bottles can be reached only by a gymnast, an undulating wall of overlapping tiles that suggests Frank Gehry in his fish-scale period, and a constant dance beat in the background that won\u2019t stop no matter how hard you cry. In other words, it looks like the Asian fusion restaurant in the lobby of a W hotel built around 1999.Sushi is rare at standard izakayas, but it is made and sold at Wokuni, at very moderate prices. While many omakase chefs age their fish to make it supple and relaxed, the sushi at Wokuni is almost insolently fresh. And if you merely get a few $5 pieces of king yellowtail sushi, or $6 pieces of sea bream sushi, and maybe a slice or two of golden-eye snapper sushi at $9 each, you won\u2019t regret it. The fish will be shiny. It will probably be chewy. The pinks and reds and ivories and whites in its flesh will be as distinct as if they\u2019d been painted on with a nail-polish brush.But sushi is not the highest use of Wokuni\u2019s seafood. What the place lacks are the seasonal fish that can make a sushi excursion really memorable: gizzard shad, striped jack, firefly squid. When it comes to sashimi, though, this is not much of a liability, and the firmness of Wokuni\u2019s fish becomes a point in its favor.Before ordering sashimi \u2014 or, in fact, anything else \u2014 check the daily specials posted by the chef, Kuniaki Yoshizawa. They will almost always include several cuts of bluefin from farm-raised fish. If you come very early for lunch and manage to get the Wokuni don, a special that centers on a sashimi rice bowl and shrimp tempura, it will strike you as an incredible bargain at $24. The kitchen makes only five Wokuni-dons a day, though, so chances are you will have to content yourself with the kaisen-don, and chances are that even though it doesn\u2019t include tempura, the $18 you pay will still seem like one of the best raw-fish deals in town.Things get even more intriguing when Wokuni\u2019s seafood comes into contact with heat. Again, the specials should be your starting point.There may well be a grilled yellowtail collar. If you are in the habit of ordering this at your favorite izakaya, it is a good bet that you will be surprised by how much cleaner and sweeter it tastes here.Bluefin collars and jaws are not served often enough for anybody to get into the habit of ordering them. The grilled collar at Wokuni one recent night was one of the greatest pieces of cooked fish I\u2019ve had in a long time, every bit of it worth chasing into the hollows of bone, skin and cartilage where it hid. It is not always available, but the grilled bluefin tail is, carved into a steak with the backbone sliced open so you can get at the teaspoonful of hot, clear jelly inside the spine.Mr. Yoshizawa has had the surprising idea of treating the angles and corners of the sea bream\u2019s body like chicken wings. Tucked into triangles, fried until crunchy and served with lemon, they are meant to be gnawned on between sips of sake. On the other hand, ei hire, a frequent special of cured, dried skate fin cut into squares, makes a chewy and likable sidekick to beer. Fish and chips, of course, will go with either \u2014 the fish species changes from night to night, but it tends to be extremely fresh, crunchy and light on batter.The chips, made from the Japanese mountain yam, were never crunchy and always needed more salt. Sometimes salt came with them, and sometimes it didn\u2019t. Those yam fries are an example of what happens once you venture away from seafood at Wokuni: The ingredients aren\u2019t doing the heavy lifting anymore, and everything tastes sort of, well, ordinary.Certain things are on the right side of ordinary, like the fried tofu in dashi; the warm rolled omelet, particularly when topped with grilled freshwater eel; and the tender, ghost-white baby sardines with grated daikon. Others are on the wrong side, like the grilled scallops in butter and the monkfish liver that strongly recalled canned cat food.If I worked in the neighborhood, I would eagerly return at least once a week, sticking as closely as possible to the fish specials. I doubt I\u2019d get bored, but I would keep my eye out for something that Wokuni could put on the menu, but so far hasn\u2019t. The parent company runs a farm that raises tiger blowfish, and about 50 restaurants in Japan that serve it. Tiger blowfish is supposed to be the most delicious kind of fugu. I think New York could make it feel appreciated on Lexington Avenue.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Listening to Elephants With Earthquake-Monitoring Tools", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "Detecting the vibrations that elephants create with their feet and vocalizations may be a useful tool to protect them from poaching.Supported by\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that walking affects their vibrations, but they\u2019re so big that their snorts and grunts also generate very low-frequency vibrations,\u201d said Beth Mortimer, a biologist at both the Universities of Oxford and Bristol and lead author of the study. \u201cAnd by monitoring the vibrations through the ground, we could determine what the elephants were doing.\u201dIt also presents a new opportunity for researchers and conservationists looking to surveil the animals at a distance, a tactic that could be useful for saving a species that is threatened by poachers. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve shown is that we can basically use this as a remote monitoring strategy,\u201d said Dr. Mortimer. Despite international efforts to ban the trade of ivory dating back decades, tens of thousands of African elephants continue to be killed for their tusks every year. The researchers then used computer models to show that the vibrations they recorded could be detected and distinguished nearly four miles away under optimal conditions. By comparison, an elephant\u2019s trumpet can typically only travel about two miles through the air, said Dr. Mortimer.And that may put elephants at more risk than they already face. Because they live in complex, spatially separated communities, elephants depend on long-distance communication to survive. Ground vibrations may be used to warn one another of danger, and also to find mates during an elephant\u2019s very brief mating period. \u201cFor elephants to find one another, they need to be able to advertise their fertility,\u201d Dr. Mortimer said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Citadel Fought the Admission of Women. Now a Female Cadet Will Lead the Corps.", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 When Sarah Zorn applied for admission to the Citadel four years ago, she had not heard the story of Shannon Faulkner, the first woman to gain full admission to the famed Southern military college.Ms. Zorn did not know about the two-and-a-half-year legal battle that had forced the college to accept her, or the death threats, or the sexist epithets spray-painted on her parents\u2019 house, or the federal marshals who escorted Ms. Faulkner to campus on her first day as a cadet in 1995, or that she had dropped out a week later.She knows now. But the 21-year-old college junior believes that the 175-year-old South Carolina institution that once fought admitting women as if they were an invading army has made its peace with the idea.And her accession on Friday as the Citadel\u2019s first female regimental commander \u2014 the top cadet \u2014 is her proof.\u201cI think that women are fully embraced as cadets here,\u201d Ms. Zorn said in an interview. \u201cYou hear a lot of times from fellow cadets, and even from alumni, that having women here has even improved the college.\u201dOn Friday afternoon, Ms. Zorn, in a dress uniform and a black shako, officially took over the post during the Citadel\u2019s pomp-laden graduation parade, known as the Long Gray Line. As the college\u2019s 2,400 undergraduates stood at attention, she received, with great formality, a gilt-handled sword from her predecessor, Dillon Graham.There was no announcement that she was making history. But nearly everyone present recognized a sign of irrevocable momentum in a long process of change.\u201cIt says we can,\u201d said Catherine Hill, 18, a freshman whose father graduated from the Citadel in 1990. \u201cIt says we can be with the guys \u2014 that we can do this.\u201dCitadel officials acknowledge today that the ugly reaction to Ms. Faulkner, which made international headlines, was a deep embarrassment to the institution. They also concede that the college moved too slowly in the years that followed to accommodate the women who came after her.Now the Citadel, one of the few state-supported military colleges in the country, is eager to promote a different story: that women are welcome and in many cases thriving on campus.\u201cI will tell you that I\u2019ve only had one negative phone call\u201d from an alumnus about Ms. Zorn\u2019s selection, Mr. Paluso said. \u201cIt was pretty easy. I called the guy a Neanderthal. Then I educated him on how there\u2019s no all-male military institutions, there\u2019s no all-male corporations in America \u2014 I mean, come on. It\u2019s 2018. She\u2019s the best qualified cadet. So get over it.\u201dAccording to college officials, women make up 10 percent of this year\u2019s 516-member graduating class, and 9 percent of all undergraduates. Including this year\u2019s crop, the Citadel has graduated 475 women since 1999. Officials say that on average, female cadets maintain a higher grade-point average and are more likely to graduate then males; 75 percent of women go the distance.For many years, anyone able to survive the Citadel\u2019s notoriously grueling four-year undergraduate program has been accorded special respect in the South. It begins with a freshman year in which new students, called knobs, are put through an intense period of what the former military personnel who instruct them call \u201cthe infliction of artificial stress,\u201d a boot camp-style effort to break down egos and then build confidence.New cadets\u2019 days often begin with a 5:20 a.m. muster, followed by rigorous physical training, memorization of rules, cleaning of barracks, and full academic course loads. And by tradition, they get a very hard time from senior cadets for any infractions, real or imagined.Some accommodations are made for women. As in the military, they are held to somewhat lower standards on physical fitness tests. Female knobs are not made to shave their heads as the men are, though they must keep their hair very short. Women and men live and train in the same barracks, but not in the same rooms.Ms. Hill, the freshman, said that compared with male cadets, she and her fellow women \u201chave to try twice as hard as they do, because just biologically, they can be stronger.\u201dBut while dressings-down are common, Ms. Hill and others said, sexist comments are not. \u201cAll of our classmates have been very helpful,\u201d said Michelle Banzon, another freshman. \u201cThey\u2019re like brothers, actually.\u201dThe gradual acceptance of women at the Citadel is part of a broader narrative of evolution at one of the country\u2019s most proudly hidebound institutions.Mr. Paluso led an investigation in 2015 that identified and disciplined 19 students involved in hazing incidents.The first days of college for knobs, long referred to as Hell Week, is called Challenge Week these days. But college officials say the experience has not gotten any easier.\u201cI don\u2019t want there to be any idea that we\u2019ve become a kind and gentle and soothing place,\u201d said John L. Dorrian, a retired Air Force colonel and the college\u2019s vice president for communications and marketing.Ms. Faulkner\u2019s swift withdrawal \u2014 she was felled by an intense heat wave on her first day of military training \u2014 remains a sensitive topic. In March, she was invited back to the college, where she told a crowd that she considered herself an alumna. That drew a rebuke from the first woman to graduate, Nancy Mace, now a Republican state representative for the Charleston area.Some have said that Ms. Faulkner did not come physically prepared, but the same cannot be said of Ms. Zorn, who took part in Junior R.O.T.C. in high school and has earned a reputation for posting impressive physical training scores. She can do more than 70 push-ups in two minutes, and has black belts in three karate disciplines.She made an impression on college officials during her first week on campus, following the death of the beloved aunt who had cared for her after her mother died. She was given a brief leave to attend the funeral, and returned after 30 hours. Charles Graham, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who works at the college, said that many students would not have been able to do so after such a shock.\u201cThe corps became her family real quick,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cShe was in physically great shape, and she was mentally tough.\u201dThe top cadet each year is selected by a small board headed by Mr. Paluso and made up of staff members and students. After interviewing a number of candidates, Mr. Paluso said, he was impressed that Ms. Zorn seemed out to do a job, not make a political point.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything about, \u2018Aw, I\u2019d be honored to be the first female,\u2019 there wasn\u2019t anything about, \u2018I\u2019m a trailblazer,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cVery humbly, she said, \u2018I just want to be the regimental commander.\u2019 To me, that\u2019s very mature, and very impressive.\u201dIn an interview at the library, Ms. Zorn spoke with care and precision. She said her mother, an Air Force veteran who died when she was in high school, instilled in her a love of country. She won a four-year Army scholarship, and will serve for at least five years after graduation; about a third of Citadel graduates go on to join the military.David Days, 20, a junior who will serve next year as Ms. Zorn\u2019s second-in-command, said that he and most other cadets were excited for her, though a small group did not want to be led by a woman.Those cadets have apparently decided not to broach the topic with the triple black belt. If sexism remains at the Citadel, Ms. Zorn said, she has not experienced it personally.\u201cYou\u2019re treated as an equal,\u201d she said, \u201cand you are expected to perform as an equal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now I make them for my son \u2014 this one, above, is from his second birthday last year and honors his love of ladybirds! We were living in California at the time, and I had to explain the special religiosity of the book \u2014 oh the sacred page turning! \u2014 to our American friends. My copy of the book is one I bought secondhand when it was out of print some years back. It was very well-loved then, with splatters of cake mix and chocolate on some of the pages, and one mum had lovingly written which child had which cake at what age on some of the pages. I've added to that myself, which feels like I'm carrying on more than one family tradition. MelbourneBy Christal MockenhauptI'm from the United States but married an Australian, and we lived in Melbourne where our son, Kieran, was born.

Once a year though, she promised to spend as much time and effort as needed to bring to life one of these \u201cAustralian Women's Weekly\u201d cakes for our birthdays (sometimes with a bit of help from visiting Aussie friends). We cherished those platypus, punk rocker, Dolly Varden, tea party, swimming pool, and basketball cakes. But mostly we cherished the Aussie tradition here in the United States. And, of course, my friends were always jealous of these amazing Australian cakes. Munich, GermanyBy Jennifer GerigkOn the birth of my first child, my mother gave me her original copy of the \u201cAustralian Women\u2019s Weekly\u201d cake book.

Experience\u2022 The S.E.C. wants to hear from Jay-Z\u2022 Tesla\u2019s shares are down after its earnings call late Wednesday\u2022 Cambridge Analytica goes down, but a sequel is in the works\u2022 China\u2019s biggest unicorn heads to the public marketsChina and the U.S. have both played down the possibility that this week\u2019s negotiations could resolve simmering trade tensions between the two countries.Mr. Bradsher reports:\u201cAfter a bureaucratic reshuffling, the members of China\u2019s new negotiating team have deep backgrounds in economics and finance, but they are less comfortable with the minutiae of trade laws. And although they are familiar with the American delegation\u2019s main players, they are less acquainted with who does what among lower-level advisers and officials when it comes to United States trade policy.\u201dGrowth in the solar industry is estimated to be about 11 percent lower than projections before the tariffs. Those diminished prospects are what prompted SunPower to bulk up its operations by pursuing the purchase of SolarWorld.\u201cThe industry is in a scramble to figure out what all of the impacts are,\u201d said Rob Freeman, chief executive of Tradewind Energy, which is based in Kansas outside Kansas City and develops industrial-scale solar and wind projects. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say it could be worse. I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s a significant negative.\u201dLet\u2019s recap:\u2022 Elon Musk dismissed a question from Sanford Bernstein\u2019s Toni Sacconaghi about capital expenditures and said, \u201cBoring, bonehead questions are not cool.\u201d\u2022 After RBC Capital Markets\u2019s Joe Spak asked about Model 3 reservations, Mr. Musk said that he\u2019d talk to retail investors because analysts\u2019 questions were \u201cso dry.\u201d\u2022 When asked if Tesla should keep its electric car charging network to itself as a strategic asset, Mr. Musk said, \u201cI think moats are lame.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein:\u201cTesla\u2019s Q1 earnings call was a unique experience, to say the least. For those who missed it \u2013 halfway through the call, CEO Elon Musk abruptly declared that our questions were \u2018boring\u2019 and \u2018not cool,\u2019 and pivoted to a 20-minute back-and-forth with a retail investor from YouTube. Beneath the bizarre theatrics, however, we see Tesla\u2019s Q1 as in-line with expectations on most metrics, including revenues, gross margins, and free cash flow.\u201dAdam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley:\u201cTo be clear. Tonight\u2019s conference call didn\u2019t go very well. Feedback we have received from investors during and following the call support this view. Irrespective of the Tesla CEO\u2019s annoyance with the genre of questions he was receiving from the analyst community, we note that an important part of Tesla\u2019s success has been its relationship with the capital markets in funding its ambitious plans.\u201dRyan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan:\u201cGiven that the market has seemed somewhat less focused on cash burn than we have been, initially we believed that the 1Q performance \u2014 combined with forceful management guidance for a strong 2H inflection in revenue, margin, and cash flow \u2014 would be enough to elicit a modestly positive reaction in the shares Thursday. Instead, we expect TSLA to fall today after CEO Elon Musk dismissed multiple analyst questions as \u2018dry\u2019 and \u2018boring\u2019 (including questions probing what we feel are key topics, such as profitability of the Model 3 and the company\u2019s capital requirements).\u201dAlexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Jaffray:\u201cManagement strongly rejected the need for new equity, while trimming its capex forecast and guiding for profitability in 2H. Model 3 choppiness notwithstanding, these results initially looked like a modest positive vs. bearish expectations. But then Elon Musk began dismissing analysts\u2019 questions and decided instead to field TWELVE questions from a YouTuber because it was \u2018way more interesting.\u2019 The unorthodox behavior sparked an after-hours sell-off. We still recommend TSLA, but in the next few months especially, we would expect significant volatility.\u201d\u201cIn March 2016, Iconix publicly announced a $169 million write down of Rocawear, and in March of this year, Iconix announced a further write down of $34 million. The S.E.C.\u2019s application states that the Commission seeks Carter\u2019s testimony to inquire about, among other things, Carter\u2019s joint ventures with Iconix.\u201dThe S.E.C. issued a subpoena in November seeking Mr. Carter\u2019s testimony, and a second subpoena in February after Mr. Carter changed lawyers.\u201cCarter failed to appear as required by the subpoenas and, through his counsel, Carter has declined to provide any additional dates on which he will agree to appear for investigative testimony.\u201dHenry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, K.K.R.\u2019s co-chairmen and co-C.E.O.s, said:\u201cKKR\u2019s conversion from a partnership to a corporation is designed to broaden our investor base, simplify our structure and make it easier to invest in our shares. We believe this change, together with continued strong performance, will increase our ability to generate significant long-term equity value for all of our shareholders.\u201dThe new structure will become effective on July 1.The announcement came a K.K.R. reported first-quarter results.Critics\u2019 cornerTom Buerkle of Breakingviews writes:\u201cThe real potential is in the valuation uplift that may come from more investors being able to buy KKR stock and analyze it like a traditional money manager. Along with other alternative asset firms, KKR trades around 10 times the next 12 months\u2019 forecast earnings, far short of BlackRock\u2019s multiple of more than 17 times.\u201dScreenshots from the company\u2019s internal chat service obtained by Gizmodo show a darkly comic mood in anticipation of the call. One employee shared bleakly titled Spotify playlists in Slack featuring songs like \u201cHigh and Dry\u201d by Radiohead, \u201cThe End\u201d by The Doors, and \u201cHelp!\u201d by The Beatles.Our picks? \u201cClosing Time\u201d by Semisonic and \u201cIt\u2019s the End of the World As We Know It\u201d by R.E.M.One problem: That delegation is split over how to negotiate, and even what to ask for. And Beijing has continued counterpunching.Your Xiaomi cribsheet: Much of its growth has come outside China, particularly in India. But the gross profit margins on its devices are just about 8.8 percent. (The latest iPhones\u2019 margins: an estimated 60 percent.)A deal open to any investors, rather than just wealthier, accredited ones, could open up the company\u2019s executives to more scrutiny, a timely concern given the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s recent focus on I.C.O.s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Thing Inside Your Cells That Might Determine How Long You Live", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou may have forgotten about the nucleolus since you took biology class, but scientists think this structure inside every cell in your body may play an important role in aging.Once there was a mutant worm in an experiment. It lived for 46 days. This was much longer than the oldest normal worm, which lived just 22. Under a microscope, it\u2019s hard to miss. Take just about any cell, find the nucleus, then look inside it for a dark, little blob. That\u2019s the nucleolus. If the cell were an eyeball, you\u2019d be looking at its pupil. You\u2019ve got one in every nucleus of every cell in your body, too. All animals do. So do plants, and yeast \u2014 and anything with a cell with a nucleus. And they\u2019ve become much more important in our understanding of how cells work.You may have forgotten this from biology class, but the nucleolus is the cell\u2019s ribosome factory. Ribosomes are like micro-machines that make proteins that cells then use for purposes like building walls, forming hairs, making memories, communicating and starting, stopping and slowing down reactions that help a cell stay functioning. It uses about 80 percent of a cell\u2019s energy for this work.But there\u2019s more to the nucleolus than just making ribosomes. If building a cell were like building a building, and the DNA contained the blueprint, the nucleolus would be the construction manager or engineer. \u201cIt knows the supply chain, coordinates all the jobs of building, does quality control checks and makes sure things continue to work well,\u201d said Dr. Antebi. How well it balances these tasks influences a cell\u2019s health and life span. And in certain cells, its size has something to do with it. The nucleolus can wax and wane in response to a body\u2019s available nutrients and growth signals.The more growth signals it intercepts, the more machines, or ribosomes, it makes. It gets bigger to contain them, but mysteriously this also shortens a cell\u2019s or organism\u2019s life. When food is restricted, or a metabolic pathway is silenced or slowed down, nucleoli shrink, making fewer ribosomes, and cells live longer. Dr. Antebi thinks that as the nucleolus gets smaller, it also starts remodeling the things it would create to make the best of available supplies. This is a highly coordinated process, he said. And life span can be thought of as how well the nucleolus balances the need to grow with the need to repair, correct mistakes and make sure everything works. You can see these kinds of effects in many different species. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing \u2014 even if genetically identical, some live a short life and some live a long life,\u201d said Dr. Antebi. More research is needed to see if the size of these structures are just markers for longevity or aging or if they actually cause it. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent lots of money on trying to find biomarkers of longevity or aging, and maybe it\u2019s just sitting under the microscope for us to see,\u201d said Dr. Antebi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Matt Marks, Cutting-Edge Composer and Musician, Dies at 38", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatt Marks, a composer and musician who was at the epicenter of a diverse community of open-minded artists as a founding member of the contemporary chamber orchestra Alarm Will Sound, died on May 11 in St. Louis. He was 38.The cause was heart failure, said Mary Kouyoumdjian, a composer and Mr. Marks\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.Mr. Marks, who lived in Brooklyn, had just performed in St. Louis with Alarm Will Sound, she said.As a performer, Mr. Marks was known best as a French horn player for Alarm Will Sound, of which he was an integral member. The ensemble has been critically praised and is known for its unusual stylistic breadth and commitment to innovation.When the group ventured further into theatrical concerts and multimedia events, he rose to the occasion as a singer, an actor and a keyboardist. He also contributed one of the group\u2019s signature pieces: an eerily accurate arrangement for live performers of \u201cRevolution 9,\u201d the notorious 1968 musique concr\u00e8te sound collage recorded by the Beatles.Alarm Will Sound\u2019s versatility and commitment to stylistic diversity ideally suited Mr. Marks, whose work as a composer showed similar range. In both concise concert pieces and sizable stage creations, like the operas \u201cThe Little Death, Vol. 1\u201d (2010) and \u201cMata Hari\u201d (2016), he demonstrated a knack for crafting works of substantial appeal and subversive cheek, generously endowed with sharp wit and relatable pathos.His compositions demonstrated his compatibility with pop music\u2019s stylistic palette, production effects and emotional affect.Mr. Marks was also known as a community organizer. In 2009, he was among the founders of New Music Bake Sale, a fund-raiser, concert and social mixer. The event proceeded from the notion that rather than competing for limited funds and audience, New York\u2019s independent new-music ensembles could band together to emphasize common bonds and goals, while increasing visibility for the entire scene.Motivated by similar notions of mutual regard and strength in numbers, Mr. Marks was among the founding organizers of New Music Gathering, a festival and conference that brings together performers, composers, academics, journalists and others from around the world for concerts, lectures, topical discussions and networking.In addition to matters of aesthetics and economics, the event was conceived to address social and political issues, such as access and inclusiveness. First presented in San Francisco in January 2015, the New Music Gathering has recurred annually in a new city each year; the 2018 event began on Thursday in Boston and ends on Saturday.Mr. Marks\u2019s death, announced by Ms. Kouyoumdjian on Facebook on Friday, touched off a flurry of social-media posts that continued throughout the weekend, attesting to the art he made, the organizations he helped to establish and the values he championed.The tide of posts was also a reflection of the oversize personality he cultivated online, particularly on Twitter: goofy, gregarious, provocative, self-deprecating and equally happy to discuss powerful musical experiences and trashy horror films.In his online commentary, Mr. Marks confronted instances of institutionalized discrimination or aesthetic snobbery with caustic wit; mostly, though, he espoused a worldview animated by optimism, generosity and boundless curiosity.Matthew Colin Marks was born on Jan. 23, 1980, in Downey, Calif., a small town in Los Angeles County. At age 9 he was found to have HHT, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, a genetic disorder that leads to abnormal blood-vessel formation. His condition forced him to avoid physical exertion \u2014 a limitation that sparked his intellectual curiosity, his sister, Suzanne Marques, a Los Angeles television journalist, said.A diligent musician from 9 years old onward, Mr. Marks excelled in high school bands. His passion for the Beatles, Ms. Marques said, bordered on fanatical.Mr. Marks pursued his formal education at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, the Royal Academy of Music in London and Stony Brook University on Long Island. He became a founding member of Alarm Will Sound in 2001, while he was at Eastman.Less than a year later, he was the featured soloist in the New York premiere of Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti\u2019s \u201cHamburg Concerto,\u201d performed by that ensemble in one of its numerous early appearances at Miller Theater, at Columbia University.Other ensembles with which Mr. Marks performed included the International Contemporary Ensemble, Wordless Music Orchestra, the Argento Chamber Ensemble and the Brooklyn Brass Quintet. He was featured as a soloist in the Los Angeles Philharmonic\u2019s 2013 presentation of Frank Zappa\u2019s \u201c200 Motels.\u201dWith Hotel Elefant, a group founded by Ms. Kouyoumdjian, he performed \u201cSongs of Love and Violence,\u201d a cycle of his pieces for voice and chamber ensemble.Beyond \u201cThe Little Death, Vol. 1,\u201d an exuberant showcase for Mr. Marks\u2019s longtime creative partnership with the soprano Mellissa Hughes, and \u201cMata Hari,\u201d a new production of which was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts grant last week, Mr. Marks\u2019s stage works include a setting of Berthold Brecht\u2019s \u201cMother Courage and Her Children\u201d; \u201cThe House of Von Macram\u00e9,\u201d a low-budget slasher musical; and \u201cHeadphone Splitter,\u201d a pop-horror theater work left incomplete.In addition to Ms. Kouyoumdjian and Ms. Marques, Mr. Marks is survived by his parents, Jerry and Henrietta Marks; an older brother, Jerry Marks Jr.; three nieces, and two nephews.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protesters Block Google Buses in San Francisco, Citing \u2018Techsploitation\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 They\u2019re back.Anti-Google protesters blocked at least a dozen private buses for tech industry workers on Thursday morning in their first significant demonstration here in several years.About 15 activists clad in white Tyvek coveralls dumped scooters in front of the buses at an intersection in the Mission District, a formerly low-income, mostly Latino neighborhood whose rents are now punishing.The scooters, owned by tech start-ups who see the ride-sharing company Uber as a role model, have become the latest flash point in the simmering anger against the tech industry in its hometown. The scooter companies want to use the sidewalks as a place to store their vehicles until the next customer comes along.To the activists, privileging the scooters over the homeless is another example of what they call \u201ctechsploitation.\u201d \u201cSweep tech not tents,\u201d was one of the rallying cries of the blockade. Another sign: \u201cThey call it \u2018Disruption.\u2019 We call it displacement.\u201dThe protests were generally small and nonviolent, although when the actions spread to Oakland a tire was slashed and a window broken. An episode in which a demonstrator vomited onto the windshield of a Yahoo bus in Oakland quickly entered the annals of famous Bay Area moments of street protest.On Thursday, someone sprayed a vulgar message on the side of one bus but otherwise the mood was largely respectful and inclusive. Aside from the buses, traffic continued to flow through the intersection. A microphone was passed around and people from the community spoke briefly.\u201cWe\u2019ve got lives and we don\u2019t got nowhere to go,\u201d one young man said. Another, addressing the workers in the buses, said, \u201cEach one of you has taken the space away from someone who belongs here.\u201d A third said the tech industry wanted \u201cmore money out of each square inch, and people are pushed out the sides.\u201dSome of the workers got off the buses and left. Others filmed the action on their phones. A half-dozen of the buses were Google\u2019s. At least one was for employees at YouTube, a division of Google. Other buses belonged to Facebook.Gina Scigliano, a spokeswoman for Google, said the company was a good corporate citizen.\u201cGoogle has contributed over $250 million to the Bay Area in the areas of homelessness, economic opportunity and education,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cAnd since 2014, specific to San Francisco, we have given $63 million to these causes.\u201dFacebook declined to comment.The blockade was not publicized beforehand, so only a handful of people were present. After an hour, there was a prayer and the blowing of a conch. The action disbanded, the scooters went back to the sidewalk and the buses were able to move on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "20 Wines Under $20: Plenty of Variety and Not One Chardonnay", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Pour21 PhotosAs I sit at my computer, I\u2019ve got half an eye on this year\u2019s nestlings, three little hawks that are now tiny white balls of down, too weak to sit up for long. By the beginning of summer, they will be nearly fully grown and strutting the ledge, impatient to fledge into the wilds of Greenwich Village.The hawks are a reminder that human behavior, too, is informed by the seasons. Just as many people gravitate to lighter foods as the weather warms, so do they seek out lighter wines as summer approaches. For this edition of 20 Under $20, whites and ros\u00e9s predominate, though reds will always have their place, accompanying the grilled steaks, ribs and burgers of summer.For some years now I have made the case that the greatest values in wine are in the vicinity of $20 a bottle. It\u2019s easy to find palatable wines for under $10, but very rarely will those bottles offer any sense of excitement or distinctiveness. Spend a little more, say, $15 to $20, and the number of distinctive, exciting bottles increases exponentially. Occasionally, such bottles can be found for less \u2014 one of my favorites here is just $12.99 \u2014 but the probability is low.What makes the following wines great values? Almost entirely, they are from regions of lesser status and made from grapes that have not been highly valued.Among these 20 bottles are no chardonnays or cabernet sauvignons, nothing from Napa Valley or Burgundy. I do include two pinot noirs, but they are both sparkling ros\u00e9s, one from Portugal, the other from Alsace, neither renowned for pinot noir (though those from Alsace may surprise you).Instead, these wines, from eight countries, are made from grapes that are practically unknown. Limniona, anybody? I\u2019ve had a few sensational bottles from Greece. How about encruzado from Portugal, or grillo from Sicily? Salamino from Emilia-Romagna, or trepat from Spain?Try them, and you may be surprised at how delicious they can be. For those less experimentally inclined, I have an awfully good sauvignon blanc, and delicious California ros\u00e9s, made from the gamay noir grape, which may be more familiar in its Beaujolais incarnation.These 20 great values are in no particular order. Many are from small producers, and, even if you live in New York City, you may not be able to find all of them. If you have access to a good wine shop, and it does not stock these bottles, ask for an approximate recommendation. In no time, I predict, you will be making your own seasonal discoveries.Greece has many little-known, ancient grapes like limniona, which could have disappeared entirely without the efforts of Christos Zafeirakis to resurrect it. From a vineyard in the Tyrnavos region, near Mount Olympus in Thessaly, he makes a wonderful red limniona and this ros\u00e9. It has a lightly fruity aroma, but on the palate it\u2019s savory and stony, a superb value. (Frederick Wildman & Sons, New York)Soave has had its critical ups and downs, but from a good producer like Pr\u00e0, the wines can be wonderful. Otto is Pr\u00e0\u2019s entry-level bottle, but it is exceptional nonetheless, made entirely out of garganega, the leading Soave grape, from the volcanic soils of the Classico subzone. It is floral and brisk, with flavors of almonds, pears and discernible minerality. (Vinifera, Ronkonkoma, N.Y.)Like Soave, Orvieto has had to overcome a reputation for characterless wines. Barberani is one of the better producers. The Castagnolo is crisp, lightly fruity, a touch savory and very refreshing. Drink with seafood pastas, with salads or all by itself. (Vinifera)Another gamay noir ros\u00e9? Well, you cannot have too many, though this is quite different from the Folk Machine. Aside from being a year older (age is fine in a good ros\u00e9), it is a more serious wine, with savory saline and mineral flavors, yet delicious nonetheless. Bone-Jolly \u2014 a play on Beaujolais, get it? \u2014 is a favorite year after year.In recent years, I have seen more dry whites made from grillo, a grape once known as the backbone of sweet Marsala or for making big, blousy dry wines. This one \u2014 from various coastal vineyards in eastern Sicily \u2014 is young, fresh, floral and refreshing, with lingering earthy notes. Delightful. (Polaner Selections, Mount Kisco, N.Y.)I don\u2019t know a lot about the encruzado grape, except that I see it occasionally in whites from the D\u00e3o region of Portugal. When I\u2019ve tried them, I\u2019ve found them delicious and unusual. This wine is extravagantly herbal, with pronounced minerality and a winning texture. A few years of age adds complexity. (Savio Soares Selections, Brooklyn, N.Y.)As you could guess, Teutonic Wine Company is dedicated to grapes associated with Germany. That list begins with riesling, and this one is superb. It\u2019s described as off dry. What does that mean? It is not specifically sweet, though the wine has just enough residual sugar to give the texture a bit of roundness. What does it smell like? Pure riesling. If you want to break it down further, go right ahead, but that\u2019s good enough from me.This red, from the Bourgueil region of the Loire Valley, is made with cabernet franc grown organically in soils of clay and sand. It\u2019s juicy and spicy, easy to drink, yet lovely, with clear personality and character. When wine writers talk of the Loire\u2019s great values, they mean wines like this. (Weygandt-Metzler, Unionville, Penn.)I often hear Chianti Classico maligned, and I wonder why. Are people jaded by Tuscany? Looking for more trendy Italian reds? Operating on old information? I love Chianti, and I love sangiovese, one of the world\u2019s great grapes. This is not to say Chianti does not have problems, but try a wine like this entry-level Retromarcia, made of 100 percent sangiovese. It\u2019s pure, dry and juicy, without the complexity of a more ambitious Chianti, perhaps, but absolutely delicious. (T. Edward Wines, New York)This translucent red is made of the trepat grape, which typically makes pale, airy reds. The Pomagrana, from the Conca de Barber\u00e0 region in northeastern Spain, is light, herbal and fruity, as in, yes, pomegranates. This refreshing bottle will especially benefit from a light chill. (Selections de la Vi\u00f1a/Fruit of the Vines, Long Island City, N.Y.)Sometimes dry German riesling can be so dry it\u2019s practically harsh. This one from Stein is gently dry, with just the barest bit of fruity roundness to give the wine depth and dimension, along with plenty of stony minerality. It is a wine to savor. (Vom Boden, Brooklyn, N.Y.)Godello is a grape with a lot of promise. Grown in regions of western Spain like Valdeorras, Bierzo and Ribeira Sacra, just to name a few, godello has the transparent ability to both display its terroir and adapt to a winemaker\u2019s style. In the capable hands of Valdesil, the Montenovo godello is fresh, creamy, herbal and spicy, reminiscent of chardonnay but with a Spanish accent. (Polaner Selections)The cr\u00e9mants of France are an excellent resource for good values in sparkling wine. The wines, which come from pretty much all over France except Champagne, are made using the same technique as Champagne, in which still wine is refermented in the bottle, trapping carbon dioxide and producing bubbles. This ros\u00e9 is made entirely of pinot noir. It\u2019s dry and refreshing, not complex or deep, but as easygoing as a holiday weekend. (Wilson Daniels, St. Helena, Calif.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eric Schneiderman, Consent and Domestic Violence", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen four women accused Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, of physical assault this week, he suggested that they were describing consensual sexual encounters.The allegations against him were new. That defense was not.Those accused of committing violence against their partners often seek to dismiss those claims, sometimes by arguing that the partners were willing participants in sexual role playing or \u201crough sex.\u201dHere\u2019s a look at the legal and other issues raised by such claims.\u201cIn the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.\u201dMany men before him have said the same when confronted by such accusations.In 2014, for example, several women accused Jian Ghomeshi, a well-known Canadian musician and former radio host, of biting, punching, choking and smothering.There is a bright line between pain caused by unwanted sexual or domestic violence and pain that can come during some kinds of consensual sexual activity among willing participants.\u201cIf it\u2019s not consensual, then it\u2019s not \u2018rough sex.\u2019 It\u2019s abuse,\u201d said Susan Wright, the founder of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, an advocacy organization for a diverse range of sexualities and sexual preferences.Consent should be given early and often, she said. Limits, risks and how to stop sexual activity should be discussed beforehand. And assumptions should never be made.\u201cI know some people think it\u2019s not sexy or spontaneous to actually talk about sex before you have it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely wrong, because it\u2019s the best foreplay in the world to talk about the things that turn you on and find out what things turn the other person on.\u201dEven with consent, if sexual activity causes serious harm, it crosses the line to assault, she said.In seeking to explain away their crimes, violent perpetrators have long claimed that victims \u201casked for it.\u201dThe trial revolved around the death by strangling of Jennifer Dawn Levin in the summer of 1986.The night before a bicyclist found her body behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Ms. Levin had met up with Robert E. Chambers Jr. at Dorrian\u2019s Red Hand, a bar on the Upper East Side. The pair left the bar together at about 4:30 a.m. before walking to Central Park.The New York Daily News highlighted his defense in the front-page headline the following day: \u201cGirl\u2019s slaying suspect: SEX PLAY \u2018GOT ROUGH.\u2019\u201dThe trial turned into a media sensation. In the end, Mr. Chambers spent more than a decade in prison.Two of the women told The New Yorker that Mr. Schneiderman had choked them. Choking is one of the most common forms of domestic violence, according to experts, and it can predict more serious violence to come.Jarringly in retrospect, when Mr. Schneiderman was a state senator from Manhattan in 2010, he introduced a bill to make intentional choking to the point of unconsciousness a violent felony. The measure was welcomed by law enforcement officials, and it is now New York state law.Advertisement"}

The company\u2019s Canadianization, detailed in Professor Thiessen\u2019s book, is a convoluted story involving a bitterly contested divorce, a bankruptcy and suggestions of Mafia influence through the Teamsters.Abnormally for the snack food world, Hawkins, which is still owned by W.T.\u2019s descendants, does not advertise. There isn\u2019t even a sign on the factory where it moved in 1956 after a fire destroyed the original Canadian plant in nearby Tweed, Ontario. Professor Thiessen, who was granted a rare tour, said she found the employees, some of whom have been around for more than four decades, a dedicated bunch. As for the general organization of the plant: \u201cI don\u2019t imagine it\u2019s a model that would be promoted at business schools.\u201dIt is actually a subsidiary of an American company of the same name, which is headquartered in Roseville, Minn., where it makes chips for the United States market. But unusually for an American company, the Canadian operations dominate, providing about 70 percent of its business. Old Dutch Canada mainly uses Canadian potatoes that are fried in Canadian canola oil in Canadian plants.Professor Thiessen said that Old Dutch\u2019s Canadian and American arms diverge when it comes to chip flavors. Canadians prefer anything involving vinegar as well as less conventional seasonings like dill pickle (one of her favorites). Sour cream and onion is more of a hit in the United States. Theories abound to explain the taste differences and include the Canadian habit of squirting vinegar on French fries and the differences in ethic backgrounds between immigrants to Canada\u2019s West (Eastern Europe) and Minnesota (Scandinavia).And what of the Canadian snacks that have vanished, including the Cuban Lunch chocolate bar that was made in Winnipeg? While Professor Thiessen devoted much time to researching its history, mystery surrounds the Cuban Lunch, starting with the origins of its name and when it was introduced. The Cuban Lunch eventually disappeared after its maker, Paulins, was sold and its Winnipeg factory closed in 1991. (At the time Paulins was owned by the same corporate parents as McCormick\u2019s, another defunct maker of candy, and sometimes Cuban Lunch, in London, Ontario.)\u201cThat\u2019s one of the mysteries that remains unsolved,\u201d said Professor Thiessen, who was unable to obtain the definitive recipe even from the last Paulins plant manager.Professor Thiessen\u2019s book is highly informative, filled with nostalgia and amusement. But it\u2019s an academic history, so you may find yourself skipping over some abstruse sections to get to the sweet and salty bits.Advertisement"}

Moody\u2019s currently gives Italy a Baa2 rating, its second lowest \u201cinvestment grade\u201d rating.Just the threat of a downgrade is likely to increase pressure on Italy\u2019s government.Moody\u2019s said two main concerns drove its decision. The ratings agency said there was a \u201csignificant risk of a material weakening in Italy\u2019s fiscal strength, given the fiscal plans of the new coalition government.\u201d Moody\u2019s also said there was a risk that overhauls aimed at making Italy\u2019s economy more efficient might now stall.- Peter EavisThe governing coalition\u2019s majority in the upper one \u2014 the Senate \u2014 is slim: six votes. In the course of a sharp increase in borrowing costs triggered by an irresponsible budget (or its anticipation), that majority may well erode quickly.But even if Italy\u2019s government backed away from its policies, the country\u2019s problems \u2014 a high debt load and a sluggish economy \u2013 would remain. It might thus only be a matter of time before Italy again attempts to stand up to the E.U. Some analysts might contend that Italy should soldier on with orthodox, fiscally responsible policies and become more like Spain, whose economy has done well in recent years. But, as Ben Chu, economics editor of The Independent, asserted on Twitter, Italy\u2019s governments in recent years have not been profligate.- Peter EavisUltimately, the incident wasn\u2019t as awkward as it might\u2019ve been \u2014 the couple was discussing hardwood flooring. But it raises questions about the accuracy of the A.I. assistants on these devices, what they do with your data, and how that might be regulated.Misidentification of a wake word by a device \u2014 on Amazon\u2019s, that\u2019s \u201cAlexa\u201d by default \u2014 automatically sends data to the company\u2019s servers. Why? Because the small speakers don\u2019t have the computing power required to make sense of entire sentences, so that must be done on the cloud.You can\u2019t turn off the always-listening feature of these devices, because, if you could, they wouldn\u2019t be able to respond to your voice, rendering them useless. But misidentification of words can, according to Amazon, set in motion a chain of events that are troubling from a privacy perspective.The question: What happens to that data? And what should these devices be able to do with it?Did you know all that? Maybe not. While companies like Amazon do explain in their terms of service that user data will be stored on servers and used to improve their products, it\u2019s perfectly possible to start using such a device in your home without being alerted to the fact. Data privacy is weakly regulated in the U.S., and there\u2019s no rule that demands Alexa tell you through its speaker what it will do with your data. So many people remain unaware of how their data is being used.Responding to a request for details about the ways in which Amazon is making its Echo devices G.D.P.R.-compliant, a spokesperson told DealBook:\u201cProtecting the privacy of customers has always been a top priority for Amazon. The Alexa privacy settings give customers insight and control over their data; they can use it to easily manage and delete their audio recordings, configure third-party skill permissions, and opt-out of having their voice data used to develop new Alexa features.\u201dSo, that\u2019s Europe. What about the U.S.? Big tech firms \u2014 in particular, Facebook \u2014 say they are responding to those new European rules with policies that will also apply in America. The same is likely to be true of smart speakers.But for now, the best way to control what\u2019s done with your data is to regularly delete the audio recorded by the devices, and opt out of any arrangement that allows the companies to use it to improve their services.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeIt\u2019s not surprising to hear that many C.E.O.s are handsomely paid \u2014 Doug McMillon of Walmart, for example, earned $22 million last year. (That said, the $102 million collected by Frank Bisignano of the credit card processor First Data is still eye-popping.)As part of a bail package negotiated in advance, Mr. Weinstein will have to put up $1 million in cash, surrender his passport and agree to wear an ankle-monitoring device. But the charges may not be the last against him, according to the NYT:An investigative grand jury, still convened, will look into other sexual assault allegations against Mr. Weinstein as well as possible financial crimes relating to how he paid women to stay silent, people familiar with the proceedings said.The auto maker warned owners not to use cruise control until the cars, S.U.V.s and trucks can be fixed with a software update.

Forget Uber versus Lyft. Forget Amazon versus \u2026 well, everybody.The technology world\u2019s most bruising battle for supremacy is taking place in China. And it could point to Big Tech\u2019s future everywhere else, too.Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group are ratcheting up their no-holds-barred contest to dominate the ways 770 million internet users communicate, shop, get around, entertain themselves and even invest their savings and visit the doctor.The two titans long ago branched out from their core businesses \u2014 games and social media for Tencent, e-commerce for Alibaba \u2014 to duke it out in ever more realms of Chinese life. They have competed in messaging, microblogging and delivering takeout. They go head-to-head in video streaming and cloud computing.But in the internet realm, China still offers a spooky potential vision of the future, one in which online behemoths like Tencent and Alibaba become the gatekeepers to the entire economy, wielding immense power over traditional industries and becoming very, very rich in the process.\u201cSometimes I think, \u2018Ah, we\u2019re competing in this now, too? All right then,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ma said, chuckling. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201d\u201cAs profitability reduces, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Now I need to monetize my customer base,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rajgopal said. \u201cThe innovation we\u2019re seeing in China could be seen in the U.S. in the next three to five years,\u201d he added. \u201cCustomers are demanding that.\u201d\u201cIf you can become so big, and so successful in so many areas, this in itself shows that you must have maintained very good, very friendly relations with the government,\u201d Mr. Hu said.Neither giant is done getting bigger.Each has a market capitalization of close to $500 billion, making them among the most highly valued technology firms on the planet. Google and Facebook still claim more users, but the Chinese heavyweights arguably do more \u2014 and more, and more \u2014 for theirs.They have both funded ventures that offer online education, make electric cars and rent out bicycles. For the giants, such initiatives represent new opportunities for people to use their digital wallets \u2014 Ant Financial\u2019s Alipay and Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay \u2014 and new ways to collect data on consumer behavior. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein counted 247 investment deals by Tencent in recent years and 156 by Alibaba, though given the pace of the companies\u2019 deal-making, they said their database was \u201clikely to be perennially incomplete.\u201dOnce the companies have locked people into their payment systems, they can become the enablers of commerce and financial services of even more kinds. In a sign of investors\u2019 excitement about the possibilities, Ant Financial is making plans to go public, in a blockbuster stock offering that could give the company a market value larger than Goldman Sachs\u2019s.China has become a model for tech\u2019s world-swallowing tendencies partly out of circumstance.With the country\u2019s high-speed churn of well-funded start-ups, planting flags on new turf is often the only way for large players not to be constantly losing ground.\u201cThe whole China internet market is way more competitive than the U.S. market,\u201d said Xiaoyan Wang, an analyst at 86Research in Shanghai. \u201cEveryone is trying to expand their presence in every sector.\u201dAlso, both Alibaba and Tencent have struggled to make much money outside their home market. That means their surest way to keep growing is to get more deeply involved in more areas of their Chinese users\u2019 lives.In a report this week, Morgan Stanley predicted that by 2027, the total market in China in which Alibaba could be making money will be worth $19 trillion \u2014 more than Amazon\u2019s potential market worldwide.At the moment, both Chinese giants are hustling to find more ways for people to transact using their wallet and not the other\u2019s. Alibaba\u2019s shopping sites and physical stores do not allow users to pay for stuff with WeChat. Tencent-backed companies, such as the retailer JD.com or the service platform Meituan-Dianping, either downplay Alipay as a payment option in their apps or do not accept it at all.Whether any of this will give either camp an enduring lead in payments is unclear. Eric Wen, the founder of Blue Lotus Research Institute, expects them to end up at roughly 50-50.The payments contest will at least propel both companies to keep expanding their kingdoms, including overseas. Alibaba is pouring billions of dollars into online shopping ventures in India and Southeast Asia. Tencent is backing start-ups around the world that have even a distant chance of enriching its ecosystem.George Favvas did not know too much about Tencent before it invested in his company in San Francisco, Circle Medical, whose app lets users summon doctors on demand. He also had no specific plans to take his business to China in the near future, if ever.\u201cMy first question was, \u2018Why are you interested in us?\u2019\u201d Mr. Favvas said.He gets it now, he says. \u201cThey\u2019re just such a big player, and health care is so broken,\u201d Mr. Favvas said. Tencent, he added, is interested in health care for the same reasons companies like Amazon and Apple are.\u201cIf anything, they\u2019re a couple of years ahead.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Irish Abortion Vote, Facebook Adds Tools to Curb Interference", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Facebook faced a wave of criticism for missing interference by Russian-based groups during the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States. Now, it is making Ireland an early test case for new policies meant to block such meddling in foreign elections.With a contentious May 25 referendum on Ireland\u2019s abortion ban approaching, Facebook said on Tuesday that it would block political advertising from groups based outside the country. The company also recently introduced a tool so users can see all the ads a group is posting on the social network, in a bid to increase transparency of political campaigning on its platform.Facebook has said similar tools will eventually be rolled out in other countries, with analysts and observers focused in particular on the 2018 midterm elections in the United States.The referendum on whether to end Ireland\u2019s constitutional ban on abortion, a vote that is expected to be tight, has drawn concerns that foreign groups will try to influence the debate through social media. Irish electoral law bans political donations from non-Irish citizens or residents, but online advertising was not envisioned when the law was written, and transparency activists and online monitors have reported a swelling number of online ads, many of unknown origin.Facebook said on Tuesday that groups working on both sides of the Irish referendum would be able to flag advertisements suspected of coming from foreign organizations. The advertisements will then be investigated by the social media platform. The company also said it would use artificial intelligence technology to spot potentially problematic material.Many countries, including the United States, prohibit foreign groups from advertising in domestic elections, but regulating the spending is difficult with more political activity moving online. Facebook\u2019s advertising system has become a favorite of political groups because it is largely automated, and makes it easy to target narrow segments of voters.Since the 2016 election, Facebook has made several policy changes to address concerns over the role it plays in elections and politics around the world. The company has changed its News Feed algorithm to de-emphasize political news, and has hired thousands of moderators globally to spot rumors and extremist content.The company is also changing its advertising policies, including allowing only authorized groups to buy political ads. A new verification process will eventually require advertisers to be based in the country where the election is taking place.In addition, Facebook is planning to introduce a searchable database to show how much an advertiser is spending, as well as the demographic details of the audience that a group is trying to reach.Padraic Ryan, projects coordinator for the social media verification service Storyful, said that Facebook\u2019s move was a welcome one. But he added that countries like Ireland needed to formulate their own rules, rather than rely on private companies.\u201cThis is about regulation and transparency,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Facebook.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen preroll ads on YouTube, display ads on any number of sites, suggested results on Google linking to pro- or anti- pages, and it\u2019s not at all clear who is behind these. It seems manifest now that there should have been rules regulated before the fact.\u201dGoogle and its video-sharing service, YouTube, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Europe in particular has become a testing ground for some of Facebook\u2019s changes to protect against political interference. Before the German election in September, for example, the company deleted thousands of fake accounts and worked with election officials to stop the spread of misinformation more quickly.Researchers are now focused on the referendum in Ireland, and the platform\u2019s role in the campaign.Last week, Gavin Sheridan, a former employee for Storyful, was able to trace one web page, ostensibly an information source for undecided voters but with no verifiable identification or contact details, to conservative Roman Catholic groups in the United States. The page seemed designed, Mr. Sheridan said, to draw in undecided voters, who would then be targeted with personalized ads for the campaign that seeks to maintain Ireland\u2019s conservative abortion laws.\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily underhanded to try and identify targets for advertising, but if you are not being transparent about who you are representing, then it\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said.Liz Carolan of the Transparent Referendum Initiative, a group set up to monitor online content during the campaign, said that Facebook\u2019s decision to ban foreign-sourced advertising was a step in the right direction, but that more needed to be done.Facebook\u2019s new Ad View tool, which allows people to see all the ads that a Facebook page is running \u2014 and not merely those targeted at them \u2014 is an improvement, she said. But it allows users to see only current ads, so it is impossible to gauge the totality of an organization\u2019s online activity. Nor is it clear what proportion of the total amount spent on Facebook ads is made up of foreign-sourced ads of the type now banned by the social media company.Adam Satariano reported from London, and Ed O\u2019Loughlin from Dublin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "High Jewelry on the Runway Draws Future Buyers (Hopefully)", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy would a jewelry house lend its museum-worthy archive pieces to a parade of ready-to-wear clothing?The Pucci show on Feb. 23 accommodated only about 500 guests, but the brand has 1.6 million followers on Instagram, where three short catwalk videos attracted a total of more than 35,000 views. Yet even those numbers were small in comparison with the social media reach of the critics and fashion insiders in the show audience. Brandwatch, a social media monitoring company based in Britain, calculated that during Milan Fashion Week, the @emiliopucci Twitter handle alone recorded more than nine million impressions, the term used for tweets added to a timeline or appearing in search results, certainly providing Bulgari with attention, too.\u201cWe have had an amazing response both from clients and the press who were very surprised to see our jewels used in such a positive way during the Pucci\u2019s catwalk,\u201d said Ms. Silvestri, adding that the jewelry house and the Florence-based Pucci brand began collaborating in 2003 for Nicole Kidman\u2019s red-carpet appearance at the Cannes Film Festival.Millennials react positively to such collaborations, according to the True-Luxury Global Consumer Insight report, a 2017 study of more than 12,000 consumers from 10 countries that was released in February by the Boston Consulting Group and the Altagamma Foundation. Also, for the first time, the report identified social media and influencers as the first source of information for luxury consumers to form opinions or make purchase decisions. (Social media, which was in ninth place in 2013, was still in second place as recently as 2016, with print and digital magazines at the top of the ranking.)\u201cWith millennials, it is all about raising awareness to drive current and future consideration; it is about making brands and products feel new and exciting,\u201d yet not intimidating, said Sarah Willersdorf, a partner and managing director at the consulting group.And, she added, \u201cOn the runway, fine and high jewelry brings an immediate association with fashion newness and suggest adaptability to any style.\u201dLady Kitty, who recently became a Bulgari brand ambassador for Britain, said such experiences had led her to wear jewelry more often and sometimes plan her outfits starting from a particular piece of jewelry.Deborah Nicodemus, chief executive at the online retailer Moda Operandi, emphasized that jewelry on the runway has had a positive effect on the site\u2019s sales. \u201cWhen clients come for the ready-to-wear, they\u2019re also looking for jewelry to complement their entire look,\u201d she said, adding that fashion week has been an effective \u201ccommunication tool\u201d to showcase jewelry.In this case, the jewelry was for sale: \u201cWe do not invite our clients to attend Giambattista Valli\u2019s show; however, Valli\u2019s haute couture clients share a similar sensibility in appreciating our creations,\u201d said Maria Cristina Buccellati, global communications and marketing director at Buccellati.\u201cHaute couture is followed not only by targeted clients,\u201d she added, \u201cbut also by people interested in fashion who can start approaching our brand through the main social media that cover all fashion shows.\u201d (And in this collaboration, Mr. Valli\u2019s Instagram account alone has more than two million followers.)As for targeted clients, the consensus of both high fashion and high jewelry brands is that Chinese millennials are of prime importance. China is expected to hold its position as the world\u2019s top luxury market and, the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s report showed, its millennials will be responsible for 65 percent of the country\u2019s luxury consumption by 2020. And, according to Ms. Willersdorf, those Chinese millennials are driven by social media and influencers even more strongly than their Western counterparts.So Buccellati\u2019s association with Mr. Valli, whose dreamlike dresses have loyal devotees in China, could support the growth of the stores it recently opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Macau. Yet the jewelry house says the relationship has been more of a friendship, not a strategic effort.\u201cThe project started when a client of mine showed me a sketch of her wedding dress by Guo Pei and asked me to design the jewelry to be paired with it,\u201d like jewelry designers used to work in the past, said Caroline Scheufele, co-president and creative director of Chopard.\u201cAfter this venture,\u201d she continued, \u201cGuo Pei and I decided to create a collection where jewelry and gowns would be designed together, inspired by fabrics, colors of the stones.\u201d The idea crystallized as an homage to the grand era of haute couture, in which Ms. Guo\u2019s opulent fabrics were matched with Chopard\u2019s gems.The event was streamed live to the more than 34 million Facebook followers of L\u2019Or\u00e9al, significantly magnifying Chopard\u2019s social media universe of two million followers, the total of its Facebook and Instagram accounts.And wasn\u2019t that the point after all?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Lava Flows in Hawaii, \u2018This Is Not the Time for Sightseeing,\u2019 Agency Warns", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe texts and calls to John Tarson, a tour operator in Hawaii who has taken thousands of visitors to see lava flowing from the Kilauea volcano over the years, began soon after last week\u2019s spectacular eruptions.There were expressions of concern for the residents on the island\u2019s eastern edge who were forced to flee their homes, and about his own safety. There were exclamations of fear and awe at the lava spreading across the land. And then, some version of the question: \u201cCan we go watch?\u201dTo those, Mr. Tarson, 37, had an easy response. He was as compelled as anyone by the sight of lava, which he captured on video Saturday night spurting 230 feet into the air. There was something inescapably primal about it, he liked to say, a thrilling reminder that civilization sits on the crust of a planet made of molten rock.But for now, business was closed, he replied to the avalanche of queries: \u201cAt this point our efforts are all going to be to help the community that is suffering losses.\u201dThe natural wonder that is the Kilauea volcano is the main attraction of Hawaii\u2019s Big Island, with nearly all of its two million annual visitors making a stop in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. But as the volcano and the surrounding area transformed into a natural disaster, leaving almost three dozen structures destroyed, residents, officials and tourists alike wrestled with its dual nature.\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime thing you\u2019re seeing in person,\u201d said Ryan Finlay, an island resident and the administrator of the Hawaii Tracker Facebook group. \u201cAnd then 10 minutes later, that lava is going into a person\u2019s yard and burning their house down.\u201d The Facebook group tracks lava flow and has been a home for videos taken by island residents in recent days.Twelve fissures have emerged, sending lava into the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions, where about 1,800 people live. Last week, Hawaii County ordered the subdivisions evacuated. Thirty-five structures have been destroyed, according to the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency. No deaths or injuries have been reported.The authorities began allowing residents of Leilani Estates to retrieve their belongings on Sunday, while Lanipuna Gardens remained closed because of dangerous volcanic gases. Several nonresidents were turned away at a checkpoint, according to Richard D. Rapoza, a spokesman for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\u201cPeople want to go down and get close it,\u201d Mr. Rapoza said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting experience standing next to red hot lava, to some people.\u201dIn several statements, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency stressed that outsiders should steer clear: \u201cThis is not the time for sightseeing.\u201d The agency added: \u201cThe residents of Leilani Estates are going through a very difficult time. We ask for your understanding.\u201dThe island has been hit by hundreds of earthquakes in recent days, including one Friday that had a magnitude of 6.9. More aftershocks from that earthquake were expected, officials said.Some residents who were able to return have found their homes in flames.Heath Dalton, who lives in Leilani Estates and was evacuated on Friday, returned to his home on Sunday morning. He drove a truck and trailer, planning to pick up boxes of his family\u2019s possessions that he had packed earlier. Instead, he found his home engulfed.He called two neighbors to tell them their houses were gone. \u201cI look at mine and I can see my house burning,\u201d said Mr. Dalton, who was unharmed, as was his wife, Denise, and their young children. \u201cAt that point I called my wife and said, \u2018There\u2019s no reason for you to come; there\u2019s nothing to get.\u2019\u201dKilauea, one of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes, has been in constant eruption for 35 years, according to the United States Geological Survey. Its lava flows have covered 48 square miles. Mr. Tarson, who started a touring business, Epic Lava Tours, three years ago, on Saturday performed what he described as a \u201crecon mission\u201d to help a friend retrieve a dog that had been left behind in the scramble to evacuate.Just as he was turning to leave, he said, the earth unzipped in front of him, as a new fissure, the eighth of ten, ripped open the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s like our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day, it moves and changes.\u201dMatt Stevens contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Populist Parties Agree on a Common Agenda to Govern", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 After more than two months of political deadlock, Italian populist parties announced on Friday that they had agreed on a common platform for governing that would allow them to push ahead with a potentially budget-breaking and anti-immigration agenda that seeks to adjust Italy\u2019s relationship with Europe.But it nonetheless preserved the core of the populist promises that won the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the hard-right League party 50 percent of the vote in inconclusive March elections.Both parties said they will now put the document before their bases for approval. But the most important vote will be that of President Sergio Mattarella, who has the authority to block the formation of the government if he believes it is unconstitutional.Mr. Mattarella has reportedly been concerned that the populist government could further unbalance Italy\u2019s budget and break its international treaties. The parties will next need to agree on a choice for prime minister, which is also subject to Mr. Mattarella\u2019s approval.With that clearly in mind, the document, titled \u201cContract for a Government of Change,\u201d seems intended to walk a fine line between appeasing Mr. Mattarella\u2019s concerns while throwing enough red meat of populist programs to the parties\u2019 supporters.Even so, there is no guarantee that, once in power, the parties will not revert to the anti-European agenda that seems closer to their heart.\u201cIt\u2019s not binding,\u201d said Michele Ainis, a professor of constitutional law at Roma Tre University. \u201cWhatever they do after can be different, can be more or less radical.\u201dIt was the prospect of a changed, and more adversarial, relationship between Italy and Europe that shook markets this week.In Friday\u2019s final agreement, the parties set aside a previous desire to return to status quo before the European Union treaty that set the stage for the euro.The final agreement instead emphasized that they wanted to \u201creview the structure of European economic governance\u201d and return to the original spirit of the union, which is now \u201casymmetric, based on the dominance of the market rather than the broader social and economic dimension.\u201dThe 57-page document covered areas from public water to defense and from sports to the safeguarding of animals, from countering the Mafia to boosting Italian fishermen and farmers.More innovatively, it included a promise that each party would support the priorities of the other in Parliament and called for the establishment of a reconciliation committee to iron out eventual differences.An earlier iteration of such a committee, which foresaw a mix of private citizens and lawmakers, struck many observers as unconstitutional. They believed that it created the potential of unelected power brokers operating in a shadow cabinet, an arrangement that for some critics evoked the Grand Council of Fascism during Mussolini\u2019s reign.Analysts also said the agreement\u2019s section on conflict of interest maintained the status quo, meaning that it was unlikely to worry Silvio Berlusconi, the media mogul and former prime minister, who is an ally of Mr. Salvini.The document also failed to address directly the role of Davide Casaleggio, a web consultant and Five Star power broker whose Milan office houses the web platform where the Five Star Movement\u2019s voting activity takes place.The agreement also reflected the Five Star Movement\u2019s disdain for members of Parliament switching parties out of personal convenience and ambition. It proposed \u201ca form\u201d of a requirement that lawmakers remain with the party with which they were elected \u201cto counteract the always growing phenomenon of party switching.\u201dCritics, while allowing that the party switching is often unsavory, have nevertheless called the proposal a grave threat to Italy\u2019s representative democracy. They argue that such a rule could lead to demands that lawmakers vote in sync with their party, and that it strips the lawmakers of the ability to vote their conscience, thus putting loyalty to the party above loyalty to the Republic.The Five Star Movement, which has little reverence for Italy\u2019s representative democracy and advocates for direct democracy through clicks on the web, currently seeks to impose a fine of more than 100,000 euros, about $118,000, on lawmakers who leave the party after election.On Friday, the leaders of the two parties did their best to put a smiling face, at times literally, on the document as they began reassuring their respective bases.\u201cDays and nights of work, many points from the program of the League and the center-right in this \u2018Government Contract,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Salvini wrote on Twitter, with a smiling emoticon.\u201cEnough of the lies from the newspapers and TV, here is the reality: Do you like it??\u201d he added.Mr. Salvini said that his party will set up \u201cgazebos\u201d in piazzas around the country where League members can vote on whether to approve the agreement.Five Star\u2019s Mr. Di Maio also put forward a happy face.\u201cI\u2019m really happy,\u201d he said in a Facebook video to his supporters on Friday morning. To inspirational music and footage from the campaign trail, Mr. Di Maio said that the contract \u201cbonds two political forces that are and will remain alternative\u201d and who would keep their promises.The program addressed the concerns of young people \u201cof my generation,\u201d the 31-year-old said, urging his party\u2019s members to \u201cread this document and feel part of the wave of change that\u2019s about to smash against the hopes of those who want things to stay as they are.\u201dFive Star campaigned heavily on a universal basic citizens\u2019 income, a pie-in-the-sky proposal that was nonetheless critical to its resounding success in the country\u2019s economically disadvantaged south.But on closer inspection, the proposal in the agreement seemed more like a traditional unemployment benefit tied to job searches and the means of the recipient.The program was not exactly the picture of fiscal conservatism.The Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan issued a budgetary assessment of the proposals, estimating their cost at as much as \u20ac125 billion. The parties, according to the university study, cut only \u20ac500 million in spending to cover those costs.Echoing Mr. Salvini\u2019s remarks a day earlier, Mr. Di Maio also took a disdainful tone toward the foreign news media (The Financial Times this week compared the new alliance to \u201cbarbarians\u201d inside Rome\u2019s gates).He mocked the potential repercussions of the alliance\u2019s plans, including on the spread between German and Italian bond yields. He said that if his party\u2019s members gave an online green light for him to sign the document, he would sign, \u201cdespite the spread.\u201dTo boost support for the agreement in the web-native party, Mr. Di Maio signed off by telling his membership that they should \u201cfeel proudly Italian today because a new era is about to start.\u201dCritics say Mr. Casaleggio\u2019s role is indicative of the party\u2019s secretive, top-down power structure and that Mr. Di Maio would not have gotten to this stage in the political negotiations if Mr. Casaleggio were not already on board, rendering any vote on the agreement a fait accompli.On Friday night, Mr. Di Maio announced on his party\u2019s blog that 94 percent of the 44,000 people who voted Friday chose to support the agreement.\u201cDoes it seem like a dream to you,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Strikes Fear Into Silicon Valley? Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s Antitrust Enforcer", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 At first blush, Margrethe Vestager\u2019s decision to investigate Apple\u2019s planned acquisition of the music-identification app Shazam seems fairly minor, at least by her standards. As Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager is known for aggressively pursuing big cases against Silicon Valley giants, and the Shazam deal is a smallish one, by most estimates valued at far less than $1 billion.\u201cWe\u2019re really making an effort to understand the different laws of data \u2014 how it works as an asset, how it influences the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an interview. \u201cWhat will happen when the data that Apple holds combines with the data from Shazam?\u201dWhile Ms. Vestager\u2019s global influence is ascendant, her political fate is murky. She has made it clear that she would like a second term as competition commissioner, but there is no guarantee that the Danish government will reappoint her to the commission next year. In fact, the new prime minister, who comes from a rival party, has said he will not do so.Her appeal partly speaks to a populist impulse from the political left, a David-versus-Goliath belief that it is high time someone stood up to giant corporations, particularly those that exert so much power. But not everyone views her as a heroic regulatory warrior.Critics also accuse her of grandstanding, and of displaying bias against American companies.\u201cI think she has this vision of what the law should be, and it seems to me that when this radically affects major companies that are headquartered in the U.S., you might want to have more of a dialogue with the U.S. regulators and the U.S. government about it,\u201d said Joe Kennedy, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington.For the moment, the attention is on data privacy, and whether it is possible to regulate how technology companies share and profit from users\u2019 personal information.\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating about her role is that in her mind, the new antitrust is about data, not about market power,\u201d said Randy Komisar, a veteran Silicon Valley executive and now a general partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.He added: \u201cI believe the European approach is more appropriate than the U.S. laissez-faire approach. The U.S. economy sort of lives or dies by the notion of free markets, and I think what we\u2019re seeing is a perversion of free market economics that is very difficult to counter without regulation.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s what my generation looks for in a politician,\u201d said Corina Stoenescu, a Harvard Business School student who helped organize a conference in March where Ms. Vestager was the keynote speaker. She added: \u201cThe moment tech giants come into question, then Vestager comes into question. She\u2019s the only person on the planet who has a voice about it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good if we can inspire each other globally,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in a recent interview in Copenhagen.She was juggling interviews and preparing for a speech, as a bag of knitting rested nearby. She likes to knit in meetings, and has recently been making elephants, after moving on from socks. (She also sometimes sews her own clothes.)Trained as an economist, she grew up in Glostrup, a suburb of Copenhagen, the daughter of two Lutheran ministers. (She\u2019s not a fan of organized religion, she said, and follows a \u201cBelieve in God, fear the church\u201d philosophy.)She entered politics at 21, joining the tiny centrist Danish Social Liberal Party, which was founded by her great-grandfather. Elected to Parliament in 2001, she rose to become the party\u2019s parliamentary leader six years later \u2014 she was already national chairwoman \u2014 and was blamed as being too young, too boring and female when the Social Liberals lost half their seats in the subsequent election.\u201cShe was very, very young, but if she had been a man, people would not have complained in the same way,\u201d said her biographer, Elisabet Svane.As for the boring part: \u201cShe has a lot of humor, but she is a little boring sometimes,\u201d Ms. Svane said in an interview. \u201cThe party is boring. They are technocrats and teachers, and they always know what is best for society.\u201dMs. Vestager brought in a media consultant, Henrik Kjerrumgaard, who advised her to drop the dull platitudes, simplify her message and stick to her beliefs \u2014 even if they made her unpopular. She rethought how to present herself.\u201cAll of us have multiple selves,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing a public figure is not about changing yourself, but maybe bringing out some other side of yourself.\u201d She learned to smile more, she said, \u201cto be more direct, less detailed, not like an economist lecturing.\u201dHer party rebounded in the 2011 elections and joined a three-party governing coalition led by the Social Democrats under Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Appointed to the new post of economics and interior minister, Ms. Vestager pushed through deeply unpopular cuts in retirement and unemployment benefits \u2014 forcing Ms. Thorning-Schmidt to renege on her own campaign promises \u2014 while helping enact more liberal immigration policies.She made a fair share of enemies, among them a group of long-term unemployed workers angry about reductions in their benefits. She still keeps the sculpture they gave her, of a middle-finger-brandishing hand, in her office in Brussels, saying it was \u201ca reminder that you will make mistakes, and people will have a different point of view, and that should be part of your understanding of yourself.\u201dIn 2014, Denmark made her the country\u2019s appointee to the European Commission, and she took charge of the competition portfolio.Ms. Vestager appears to have found that rare thing, a decent work-life balance. (By comparison, the fictional character she and Ms. Thorning-Schmidt are collectively said to have inspired, Birgitte Nyborg, the central figure of the Danish political drama \u201cBorgen,\u201d struggles unsuccessfully to hang onto her marriage.) Ms. Vestager\u2019s husband, Thomas Jensen, a math and philosophy teacher, lives in Copenhagen with their youngest daughter, 15. Their two older daughters are in college.\u201cHere, it\u2019s more the rule than the exception to be a working mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI have sometimes been asked if I\u2019m a bad mother to my daughters, and I say, \u2018They don\u2019t know any different \u2014 this is the mother they\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d\u201cPower is not something you own,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s only something you\u2019re borrowing.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels, and Ben Berke from Boston.Advertisement"}

What if the surprise biggest star \u2014 the Pippa Middleton, if you will \u2014 of this royal wedding was a sermon about love?Michael Bruce Curry, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States, delivered a searing, soaring 13-minute speech, imploring Christians to put love at the center of their spiritual and political lives. Until that moment, the ceremony had been quite staid, stuffy even, with only the mention of \u201csexual union\u201d to keep us on our toes. \u201cWe must discover the power of love, the power, the redemptive power of love,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when we discover that we will be able to make of this old world a new world.\u201d\u201cImagine governments and nations where love is the way,\u201d Most Rev. Curry said. \u201cImagine this tired old world when love is the way \u2014 when love is the way, unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive! \u2026 When love is the way, poverty will become history.\u201d He cited Martin Luther King, Jr. explicitly several times, and alluded to the same passages in Amos \u2014 \u201clet justice roll down like a mighty stream and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream\u201d \u2014 that King famously cited.Bishop Curry, 65, said Christianity was \u201ca movement grounded in the unconditional love of God for the world and a movement mandating people to live that love and in so doing to change not only their lives but the very life of the world itself,\u201d he said. He spoke about the power of love and faith, even to comfort those in captivity, referring explicitly to the psalms sung by slaves in the American south.He said: \u201cI'll never forget my daddy told me when I was fairly new as a priest. He said just always be who you really are. Don't pretend to be someone else.\u201dAnd now in the name of our loving liberating and life giving God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, amen. From the Song of Solomon in the Bible: Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is as strong as death, passion as fierce as the grave, its flashes of flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it outThe late Dr. Martin Luther King once said, and I quote: we must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love, and when we do that we will make of this old world a new world. For love is the only way. There\u2019s power in love. Don\u2019t underestimate it. Don\u2019t even oversentimentalize it. There\u2019s power, power in love. If you don\u2019t believe me, think about a time when you first fell in love. The whole world seemed to center around you and your beloved. There\u2019s power, power in love. Not just in its romantic forms but any form, any shape of love. There\u2019s a certain sense in which when you are loved and you know it, when someone cares for you and you know it, when you love and you show it, it actually feels right. There\u2019s something right about it. And there\u2019s a reason for it. The reason has to do with the source. We were made by a power of love. And our lives were meant and are meant to be lived in that love. That\u2019s why we are here. Ultimately the source of love is God himself, the source of all of our lives. There\u2019s an old medieval poem that says, \u201cwhere true love is found, God himself is there.\u201dThe New Testament says it this way, \u201cbeloved, let us love one another because love is of God and those who love are born of God and know God, those who do not love do not know God. Why? For God is love. There\u2019s power in love. There\u2019s power in love to help and heal when nothing else can. There\u2019s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will. There\u2019s power in love to show us the way to live. Set me as a seal on your heart. A seal on your arm. For love it\u2019s strong as death. But love is not only about a young couple. Now the power of love is demonstrated by the fact that we are all here. Two young people fell in love and we all showed up. But it\u2019s not just for and about a young couple who we rejoice with. It\u2019s more than that. Jesus of Nazareth on one occasion was asked by a lawyer to sum up the essence of the teachings of Moses. He went back and reached back into the Hebrew scriptures, to Deuteronomy and Leviticus, and Jesus said you shall love the lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind and all your strength. This is the first and great commandment and the second is like it: love your neighbor as yourself. And then in Matthew\u2019s version, he added, he said, on these two Love of God and Love of Neighbor, hang all the law, all the prophets, everything that Moses wrote, everything in the holy prophets, everything in the scriptures, everything that God has been trying to tell the world. Love God, love your neighbors, and while you\u2019re at it, love yourself. Now someone once said that Jesus began the most revolutionary movement in all of human history, a movement grounded in the unconditional love of God for the world. A movement mandating people to live that love. And in so doing, to change not only their lives but the very life of the world itself. I\u2019m talking about some power, real power. Power to change the world. If you don\u2019t believe me, well, there were some old slaves in America\u2019s antebellum south who explained the dynamic power of love and why it has the power to transform. They explained it this way. They sang a spiritual, even in the midst of their captivity, it\u2019s one that says there\u2019s a balm in Gilead. A healing balm, something that can makes things right. There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole. There is a balm in Gilead to heal the sin-sick soul. One of the stanzas actually explains why: they said, If you cannot preach like Peter and you cannot pray like Paul, you just tell the love of Jesus how he died to save us all. Oh that\u2019s the balm in Gilead. This way of love is the way of life. They got it, he died to save us all. He didn\u2019t die for anything he could get out of it. Jesus did not get an honorary doctorate for dying. He wasn\u2019t getting anything out of it. He gave up his life, he sacrificed his life for the good of the others, for the good of the other, for the well-being of the world. For us, that\u2019s what love is. Love is not selfish and self-centered. Love can be sacrificial. And in so doing, becomes redemptive, and that way of unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive love, changes lives. And it can change this world. If you don\u2019t believe me, just stop and think or imagine. Think and imagine, well, think and imagine a world where love is the way. Imagine our homes and families when love is the way. Imagine neighborhoods and communities where love is the way. Imagine governments and nations where love is the way. Imagine business and commerce when love is the way. Imagine this tired old world when love is the way, unselfish, sacrificial redemptive. When love is the way, then no child will go to bed hungry in this world ever again. When love is the way, we will let justice roll down like a mighty stream and righteousness like an ever-flowing brook. When love is the way, poverty will become history. When love is the way, the earth will be a sanctuary. When love is the way, we will lay down our swords and shields down, down by the riverside to study war no more. When love is the way, there\u2019s plenty good room, plenty good room, for all of God\u2019s children. Because when love is the way, we actually treat each other, well, like we are actually family. When love is the way, we know that God is the source of us all and we are brothers and sisters, children of God. My brothers and sisters, that\u2019s a new heaven, a new earth, a new world, a new human family. And let me tell you something, old Solomon was right in the Old Testament, that\u2019s fire. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and with this, I will sit you down. We\u2019ve got to get you all married. French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was arguably one of the great minds, one of the great spirits of the 20th century. A Jesuit, Roman Catholic priest, scientist, a scholar, a mystic. In some of his writings, he said from his scientific background as well as his theological one. In some of his writings, he said as others have, that the discovery or invention or harnessing of fire was one of the great scientific and technological discoveries in all of human history. Fire to a great extent made human civilization possible. Fire made it possible to cook food and to provide sanitary ways of eating which reduced the spread of disease in its time. Fire made it possible to heat warm environments and thereby made human migration around the world a possibility, even into colder climates. Fire made it possible, there was no Bronze Age without fire, no Iron Age without fire, no industrial revolution without fire. The advances of science and technology are greatly dependent on the human ability and capacity to take fire and use it for human good. Anybody get here in a car today? An automobile? Nod your heads if you did, I\u2019m guessing, I know there were some carriages. But those of us who came in cars, the controlled harnessed fire made that possible. I know that the Bible says, and I believe it, that Jesus walked on the water, but I have to tell you I didn\u2019t walk across the Atlantic Ocean to get here. Controlled fire in that plane got me here. Fire makes it possible for us to text and tweet and email and Instagram and Facebook and socially be dysfunctional with each other. Fire makes all of that possible and de Chardin said that fire was one of the greatest discoveries in all of human history. And he then went on to say that if humanity every harnesses the energy of fire again, if humanity ever captures the energy of love, it will be the second time in history that we have discovered fire. Dr. King was right, we must discover love. The redemptive power of love. And when we do that, we will make of this old world a new world. My brother, my sister, God love you. God bless you. And may God hold us all in those almighty hands of love. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Instagram (Finally) Adds a Mute Feature", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo desperately needed.Instagram announced Tuesday that it would add a mute feature to its service, allowing users to ignore certain accounts without unfollowing (and potentially alienating) friends who take the same picture of their breakfast every day. (We like avocado toast too, but enough is enough!)The platform had previously allowed users to mute stories, the photos and videos that appear at the top of their feeds and disappear within 24 hours. But before Tuesday, it was impossible to avoid the photos of frequent posters unless you stopped following their accounts.The feature, familiar from platforms like Twitter, had long been requested by Instagram\u2019s users. It will become available to users \u201cover the coming weeks,\u201d the statement said.A spokeswoman for Instagram, Seine Kim, declined to provide specifics about the new feature, saying only that it was part of a larger effort to give users more control over their feeds.Some power users \u2014 including those for whom Instagram is a source of income \u2014 have complained that the platform is not responsive enough to their feedback. A sticking point for many of those users is the algorithm introduced in 2016: It scrambles the order in which posts appear in user feeds. \u201cOf course, we use data to inform product decisions, but we also get feedback in more low-tech ways,\u201d Ms. Kim said. \u201cWe do some qualitative research and keep our ear on the ground for feedback from our community.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s something people wanted for a very long time,\u201d Natalie Franke, a power user with about 60,000 followers, said of the feature. \u201cBecause there are apps that allow people to see who has unfollowed them, there is this fear that by unfollowing someone you could upset them and create an uncomfortable situation, whether that is personal or professional.\u201d\u201cI think this puts an emphasis on creating content that truly resonates with your audience because its easier than ever for them to block you out,\u201d she said. Maintaining a captive audience is particularly important for users who make money from the platform. Tyler McCall, an independent consultant who advises entrepreneurs and small businesses on their Instagram strategy, said that for influencers especially, the mute feature would be \u201ca huge deal.\u201d \u201cYou really don\u2019t want people as followers who aren\u2019t seeing and engaging with your content,\u201d he said, explaining that even an account with a large following would not have a way to show advertisers that the content they are creating is valuable.In response to Instagram\u2019s announcement, Mr. McCall has told all of his clients the same thing: \u201cThe content you\u2019re creating needs to be even more strategic now because people can literally just ignore you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then around 2014 and 2015, researchers found skeletons and soft tissue of haramiyids in China, sparking a debate about where the group belongs on the evolutionary tree. Some argue that its place is within the mammal family, while others have said that it exists just outside that classification. If haramiyids are mammals, then the group pushes back the birth of mammals to about 220 million years ago. But if they are not, mammals date to only about 185 million years ago. Dr. Luo said he and his colleagues place the haramiyids at the doorstep of mammals \u2014 close but just outside. Scientists think haramiyids were diverse and possibly occupied similar ecological niches, eating insects, plants or meat. There is evidence that some of the creatures could glide like flying squirrels and others could swim. \u201cThat tooth is now largely responsible for extending the geographic range of the group to an entire new continent \u2014 North America \u2014 and to a significantly later time than is typical for haramiyidans,\u201d said Dr. Krause.Dr. Hoffmann added that despite the new finding, she is undecided on whether haramiyids belong inside or outside of the mammal group.\u201cWe still need more fossils to tell that,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a paleontologist.

{"Headline": "Kilauea Volcano Erupts, Spewing Lava and Gases Near Homes in Hawaii", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPAHOA, Hawaii \u2014 Fresh volcanic eruptions on the southern end of the island of Hawaii after a series of tremors left residents displaced and frightened as the authorities evacuated the state\u2019s largest park on Friday and worked to keep people out of two subdivisions that had been evacuated.That earthquake, which set off rock slides on park trails, forced park officials to close down and evacuate Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which encompasses 333,000 acres \u2014 13 percent of the Big Island\u2019s total area. Closing the park is a rare occurrence, Jessica Ferracane, a spokeswoman for the park, said on Friday afternoon.Officials said that there had been no reports of injuries or death, but by Friday afternoon, two homes had been surrounded by lava and officials were warning of dangerous gases.Lava began bubbling up through a new crack in the Kilauea volcano on Thursday evening, but the lava flows, at least as of Friday morning in Hawaii, had been small, said Dr. Charles Mandeville, coordinator of the Volcano Hazards Program at the United States Geological Survey headquarters in Reston, Va.In all, the volcano had at least three new fissures as of Friday afternoon, but Dr. Mandeville cautioned that the detected increase in earthquakes, most of which had been small, meant more eruptions were likely.\u201cIt\u2019s far from over,\u201d Dr. Mandeville said in an earlier interview.When a volcano erupts, gases often shoot out, including sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, which can be poisonous, and carbon dioxide, which can cause asphyxiation.Chris Elliott Rodrigues, 40, who was sheltering at Pahoa Community Center after fleeing from his neighborhood, Hawaiian Acres, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been watching what\u2019s going on, the sulfur smell at my place was so strong.\u201d\u201cI hope the lava activity keeps up,\u201d said Mr. Rodrigues, who worked at Lava Ocean Adventures. \u201cI want to go back to work.\u201dSeveral schools were closed on Friday, and temporary flight restrictions were put in place for most of the lower Puna District, where the evacuated communities were located, according to a spokesman from the state\u2019s Emergency Management Agency.There are approximately 1,500 homes in the area, the spokesman said. The Red Cross reported 66 people in two shelters overnight, he added.\u201cI never thought I\u2019d ever be faced with this, I\u2019m just shellshocked,\u201d said Carl Yoshimoto, 69. He was sheltering at Pahoa Community Center with his two dogs, Sako and Suki, and his partner since Thursday afternoon. Their house is in Leilani Estates.\u201cAs soon as I heard the order to evacuate, I grabbed important paperwork, medications, my wallet \u2014 we were out of the house within a half an hour.\u201dMaddy Welch, 19, who works at Kalapana Bike rentals and lives in Leilani Estates with her mother, had set up a tent and a space at Pahoa Community Center with her two dogs, a goose and her friend, Taylor. \u201cI woke up around 1:30 in the morning to earthquakes,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom didn\u2019t want to leave. I told her there are two vehicles leaving this driveway \u2014 I hope you\u2019ll be in one of them because we can\u2019t come back.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty,\u201d she went on. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201dKilauea is the youngest of five volcanoes that make up the island of Hawaii, and lies on the island\u2019s south. Dr. Mandeville said the signal that there might be more activity was the little earthquakes, which happen when magma moves against rock, in this case, two miles under the earth\u2019s surface. \u201cThat\u2019s where the plumbing system is,\u201d he said.It remained to be seen how much damage the structures in the evacuation areas have sustained from the eruptions and the earthquakes.Dan Jacobs, 47, who has spent the last six months building his house in Leilani Estates, was standing behind Pahoa Village Museum, a downtown hangout. \u201cI invested all my money here, and I probably won\u2019t have anything to show for it in about a month\u2019s time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should see the floors I built, they\u2019re so beautiful, it\u2019s about halfway done.\u201dPast volcanic eruptions, some that occurred decades ago, have caused lasting damage to parts of the region.An eruption from Kilauea in 2014 flowed down the surface of the volcano and burned a house in Pahoa. Now residents worry that more structures could be threatened in the area, which is one of the fastest-growing in the state.\u201cLiving on a volcano, everybody has got pretty thick skin. They know the risk,\u201d said Ryan Finlay, who lives in Pahoa and runs an online trade school. \u201cLava for the most part has flown to the ocean the last 30 years. Everybody gets in a comfort zone. The last couple weeks, everything changed.\u201dMeghan Miner Murray reported from Pahoa, Hawaii; Sabrina Tavernise from Washington; and Maya Salam from New York.

{"Headline": "How I Voted in Venezuela\u2019s (Non) Election", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Hern\u00e1ndez is a Venezuelan who has been watching his country\u2019s collapse.I\u2019ve never liked that trumpet; it seems much too militaristic for an occasion that should be just civilian. But the military pretty much rules Venezuela now.I don\u2019t want to vote. I really don\u2019t. At the same time, I\u2019m tired of not doing anything, so maybe I should vote. There aren\u2019t many protests against the government these days, and the opposition didn\u2019t actively organize to prevent the election.Two candidates are running against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, but the system is so rigged that they don\u2019t have a chance. Anyway, one is an evangelical (Javier Bertucci), and the other is an ex-supporter of our late former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez (Henri Falc\u00f3n). The main opposition coalition, Frente Amplio Venezuela Libre, the Broad Front for a Free Venezuela, just wants people like me to stay home. I wish no one but Maduro was participating at all, and that the entire opposition had rallied to call for a proper boycott.Six o\u2019clock, still no trumpet. I think: \u201cSee? These aren\u2019t real elections.\u201d I\u2019m still trying to convince myself that it\u2019s O.K. to not participate in this thing.So, I have a mission this Sunday: I want to find someone who truly cares about this election. Schools are used as voting centers, and my plan is to visit four within walking distance of my home.I live in a sprawling middle-class neighborhood of three-story buildings, mostly residential with some small businesses. Although the anti-Chavistas usually win here, it\u2019s always a close call.I go out at about 9 a.m., and the streets are empty. No cars \u2014 sure; after all, the streets are closed off. But there are no pedestrians either. And no flags.I get to the Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez high school. There are \u201cVote for Falc\u00f3n\u201d graffiti on a wall outside. Two soldiers with assault rifles are talking at the entrance. But that\u2019s about it, as far as human life goes. You can\u2019t see the voting station from the outside, and before being allowed in I\u2019d have to decide to vote. The only car parked in front is a military car.Normally, especially in a presidential election, you\u2019d see the line of voters stretch to the corner and then across the street. And you\u2019d see street vendors fighting for space on the sidewalk to sell cigarettes, coffee, chips, lollipops, ice cream and cakes. I know because this is my polling station, and though I\u2019m just 25 years old, I\u2019ve already voted here four times.There should also be loud music coming from houses, the national flag hanging from windows and people dressed in Venezuela\u2019s colors, inviting others to vote and taking pictures to post on Facebook. But today the street is empty \u2014 well, aside from the handful of people in the distance gathered around a truck selling plantains.Red Spots should be illegal, but our electoral council doesn\u2019t care too much about enforcing electoral rules these days.The next polling center seems even more deserted. I see no voter there, and just one guard, not two, at the entrance, who when he notices me pull out my phone, cautions me against taking a picture of the empty entrance.My next, and now last, stop is a kindergarten, and the biggest polling station in the area. This will be my final destination: I\u2019ve decided to skip the third on my itinerary because since this center always is the most crowded one in the neighborhood, if it\u2019s empty, then they all are.When I arrive there, I see one man getting out as another man is getting in. There is also a member of the Bolivarian militia, a volunteer civilian force created by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to protect the homeland, talking to two men on the street corner. There were a few cars, civilian cars, parked close to the school, and even someone selling coffee.A lady comes out of the voting center \u2014 my first voter of the day. I approach her.\u201cSo, how was it?\u201dShe is short and has a big black purse. \u201cIt was fast. The machines are working fine.\u201d\u201cAnd who did you vote for?\u201d\u201cThe vote is secret.\u201d She walks off.Now I see a man checking the fence on which hang the lists that tell you at which table you need to vote.\u201cWho are you voting for?\u201d I ask.\u201cFor that Bertucci guy. And you?\u201d\u201cMe? I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m voting.\u201d\u201cWe cannot gift them the election. At least let\u2019s make them steal it.\u201dI\u2019m starting to get looks from the Bolivarian militia guy on the corner, so I stop talking to this man; I\u2019m not taking any risks for a non-election.I go to the Red Spot. Five attendants. Two people signing papers.I approach the one government employee, a woman, who\u2019s standing up: \u201cHow\u2019s the day been? How\u2019s attendance?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s calm right now.\u201d At this point, it\u2019s 11 a.m.\u201cAnd earlier?\u201d\u201cEarlier there were more. And people will start arriving again when the voting center is about to close. You\u2019ll see.\u201dAccording to her, I\u2019m both too late and too early. All I know is that after a few hours of walking my neighborhood looking for voters, I haven\u2019t encountered one who actually seemed to care about the election. My mission has been failure.On my way home, I walk through the municipal market, and there, there is life. It\u2019s loud, and busy with people. Some are selling plantains, yuccas and onions, or cheese, or homemade corn dough, or deodorant and toothpaste, which you can\u2019t find in the supermarkets anymore. Others are counting stack after stack of worthless bank notes.There\u2019s one guy selling coffee; he grinds the beans right in front of you. I count. He has a line of 43 people \u2014 more than all the voting centers I visited this morning combined.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Visionaries With the Courage to Change the World", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "Over centuries, these people have shared some important attributes: courage, daring, confidence and a stubborn devotion to an idea.Supported byCall them what you will: change makers, innovators, thought leaders, visionaries.In ways large and small, they fight. They disrupt. They take risks. They push boundaries to change the way we see the world, or live in it. Some create new enterprises, while others develop their groundbreaking ideas within an existing one.Although centuries stretch between them, experts who have studied the nature of innovators across all areas of expertise largely agree that they have important attributes in common, from innovative thinking to an ability to build trust among those who follow them to utter confidence and a stubborn devotion to their dream.Despite the shared characteristics with their predecessors, however, today\u2019s innovators face their own set of challenges. The world around them is changing at warp speed and they need to be able to move with it.\u201cThe one characteristic that I\u2019m very comfortable saying that all remarkable leaders in big business, small business, not-for-profit, military, government and the arts, have to have is courage,\u201d Mr. Sinek said.\u201cThese people are driven by some cause that compels them to find the courage and take certain risks and work damn hard at it,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the choice is lonely, which is another reason it takes courage. You have to have the courage to do the right thing. Elon Musk is the perfect example of someone with tremendous courage and conviction. He invested nearly everything he had in SpaceX and Tesla.\u201d\u201cHe has a devotion to a vision that very few people do,\u201d Mr. Sinek said.\u201cThings aren\u2019t linear anymore. We are living in an ecosystem world. It is more complex.\u201d\u201cThe mechanical model of organizations in the past has produced hierarchies, static positions and rigid organizational charts, and has produced leaders who, however charismatic they may be, rule from the top and rule unequivocally. They control and direct and others follow. That model doesn\u2019t really work anymore.\u201dThe emerging game-changers appreciate that creating fundamental change is a process, a marathon, not a sprint, and they are comfortable operating at the edge of chaos and ambiguity. They also have an ability to ask questions, rather than feeling they must know the answers and to think in nonlinear and nonbinary ways, according to Ms. Blandin. These attributes stand in stark contrast to the attributes typically associated with strong leaders in the past.They must also be tough enough to bear up under intense public scrutiny on social media and to withstand or adhere to an underlying peer pressure for social do-gooderism.Travis Kalanick, 41, founder of the ride-share app, Uber, introduced a pioneering concept, but was unable to navigate a sequence of scandals surrounding a macho company culture and allegations of sexual harassment that presumably stemmed from his leadership style, forcing him to resign.And time will tell how well Mr. Zuckerberg, 34, who founded Facebook in his college dorm room, will withstand the hot seat that has resulted from revelations that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica gathered data of millions of the social network\u2019s users and might have influenced the 2016 election. It has brought the question of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s societal stewardship front and center.Acting as a guardian for not only people but also the planet is a concern that\u2019s inextricably woven into the fabric of this new generation of leaders. It\u2019s nonnegotiable. \u201cThey are deeply aware of the context in which their organization is operating, and it is beyond the marketplace \u2014 politics, globally, society. It\u2019s a long game and one where doing good is good business,\u201d Ms. Siang said.In the past, leaders had to think almost exclusively about what was good for their organization. \u201cToday, they also have to bear the responsibility of societal stewardship.\u201d Ms. Siang said. \u201cThe society has ramifications for what is happening in our organization, and our organization has ramifications for what is happening in society. There is this interdependence.\u201dThose who become successful leaders today also must deliver a sense of \u201cpsychological safety\u201d to those who follow them, Mr. Pink said. They create an environment \u201cwhere people are safe to express themselves, to take risks, safe to be who they really are \u2014 whether it\u2019s a business, museum, dance troupe, whether it\u2019s a high school newspaper. That quality gives people the freedom to connect and innovate.\u201dLin-Manuel Miranda, creator of \u201cHamilton,\u201d re-envisioned the Broadway musical to tell a slice of American history via his passion for rapid-fire hip-hop lyrics, a language that bridges generations. It took Mr. Miranda seven years after reading Ron Chernow\u2019s biography \u201cAlexander Hamilton\u201d to bring his masterpiece to Broadway. And for a year, Mr. Miranda starred in his creation.For today\u2019s influencers, what\u2019s different is that, like Mr. Miranda, \u201cyou have to continually show motivation yourself,\u201d Ms. Siang said. \u201cYour followers have to see it in you on a day-to-day basis. You have to demonstrate an emotional investment.\u201dIn fact, they might take a page from the playbook of Mr. Krzyzewski, 71. \u201cNext play\u201d is his mantra.\u201cWhether it is a success, or a failure, it is next play,\u201d Ms. Siang said. \u201cWhat Coach K. means by that is, don\u2019t rest on your laurels, but also don\u2019t be dragged down by your failures. Learn from both of them. Keep going forward, keep learning.\u201dSounds like the perfect prep for the next swell of change makers poised to mastermind a world that is moving like greased lightning.Advertisement"}

As noted in \u201cHow Young is Too Young for Protest? A National Gun Violence Protest Tests Schools,\u201d even Utah\u2019s Wood Cross Elementary School staged a protest in the school gym to allow the students to experience \u201ca little civil disobedience.\u201dLike Wood Cross, the administration at my school staged our protest. The day before the walkout, a minute-by-minute schedule and list of guidelines \u2014 including the only two doors we could exit from \u2014 were uploaded onto Facebook. The next day, our obedient student body shuffled into the fenced area between our school buildings only to witness teachers\u2019 comments about how \u201ccute\u201d we were and their apologies for being 60 seconds behind schedule. By 10:05, the end of the designated \u201cshouting time,\u201d my friends and I lowered our posters in defeat.Although I am thankful that my school supports the walkout, nobody needed to be hand-held through this protest. Protesting is fighting and risking consequences, risking falling. Protesting is true civil disobedience. Yet Henry David Thoreau is rolling in his grave thinking about our \u201cprotest.\u201d In \u201cCivil Disobedience,\u201d Thoreau does not \u201clend [himself] to the wrong which [he condemns].\u201d Instead, he fights against it, because he has the right \u201cto do at any time what [he thinks is] right.\u201d We have the same right. Why prevent us from using it?Maybe the elementary schoolers play along, but I cannot. We already have mock organizations: mock trial, model U.N., and now this walkout. The school coddles us. Highlighted in a New York Times article, the students who excelled after high school were the ones who fell and got up afterward. But if schools are going to cushion each one of our falls, how will we grow up?I understand schools\u2019 concern: safety first. Parents may be uncomfortable with their children protesting. But the goal of civil disobedience is to make others uncomfortable. Discomfort brings change. Change from our parents\u2019 generation to ours.We need adults to accept the discomfort of us taking the reins of the gun violence movement and us growing up. Otherwise, if fearful adults keep holding us back, how can we grow up to become fearless leaders?Works CitedThoreau, Henry David, 1817-1862.

{"Headline": "Your Next Lesson: Aligot\u00e9", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolThe leading white grape in Burgundy is, of course, chardonnay. However, another white grape is also grown there, though it is not nearly so highly regarded.That would be aligot\u00e9, a grape struggling to shake its bad reputation \u2014 pervasively believed to be thin, acidic and good for little else beyond serving as a base for kir, an aperitif in which white wine is blended with cr\u00e8me de cassis. This month, I hope, we will instead see the greater potential of the grape is by drinking some very good aligot\u00e9s.Why do they stick with it? It\u2019s part of Burgundian tradition. Many producers see continuing to produce aligot\u00e9 as a way of honoring their heritage. That, and they like it.In either case, it is another expression of Burgundy, and quite a bit more economical than, say, Meursault. Here are the three bottles I recommend:As usual, these wines may be in short supply, but many other good producers are available and equally worth drinking. If you can find Sylvain Pataille, snap it up. Pierre Morey, Jean-Philippe Fichet, Domaine Arlaud, Domaine Roulot, Henri Prudhon, Antoine Jobard, Claire Naudin, Alice et Olivier de Moor, Paul Pillot, Domaine d\u2019Angerville and Sextant-Julien Altaber are all worth trying. And if you see aligot\u00e9 from any other big-name Burgundy producers, try them as well.Don\u2019t worry about vintage. For aligot\u00e9, I happen to love the 2014s, but others will do nicely.As I said, aligot\u00e9 goes brilliantly with seafood, especially shellfish and lighter, white-fleshed fish. It\u2019s also great with pastas (with white clam sauce or pesto), salads and any number of vegetable preparations.Serve chilled but not ice-cold. And please do not add cr\u00e8me de cassis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Woman Trafficked by Cult Is Awarded $8 Million: \u2018They Took My Childhood\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKendra Ross\u2019s human trafficking story started in 2002, when she was 11 and forced to cook, clean and provide child care for the United Nation of Islam Inc., a cult in Kansas, court documents say.At 12, she was moved from her mother\u2019s home into a household of female members of the cult. At 15, she was taken out of school and assigned to work in a diner. By 16 she was shipped off to Georgia and served in a home used by Royall Jenkins, the group\u2019s founder, the documents say.Over the years, Ms. Ross was shuttled, sometimes in the back of a delivery truck, to jobs in Newark; New York; Kansas City, Kan.; and Dayton, Ohio. She was physically and emotionally abused, the documents say. After she was forced by a \u201cpsychic doctor\u201d in the group to \u201cmarry\u201d a polygamist, Ms. Ross summoned the courage to finally escape in 2012. She was 21.On Wednesday, a federal court in Kansas awarded Ms. Ross, now 26, about $8 million in damages and restitution. The amount is believed to be the largest awarded to a single plaintiff in a case of coerced labor, and it highlights the scourge of human trafficking in the United States, which mostly affects young women and girls.In his 57-page judgment, Judge Daniel D. Crabtree, of the United States District Court in Kansas, said Ms. Ross was subjected to grueling work and fear of reprisals if she disobeyed the defendants, which include Mr. Jenkins and the Value Creators, the name he gave to the United Nation of Islam in 2015.\u201cThey yelled at her, and generally humiliated, shamed and embarrassed her on a regular basis,\u201d Judge Crabtree wrote. \u201cShe was young, vulnerable and alone during this 10-year period.\u201dMs. Ross said in a statement through her lawyer that she felt as if justice had been served. But she added, \u201cI\u2019ll always live with the memories of what\u2019s been done to me.\u201dMartina E. Vandenberg, the president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center in Washington, D.C., called the judgment \u201cremarkable.\u201d\u201cIt is the largest single victim judgment that we are aware of,\u201d she said.Ms. Ross\u2019s case is also unusual because it involves forced labor in a cult. More than a third of the civil cases in trafficking are filed by domestic workers against their employers or by people with grievances against labor recruiters, Ms. Vandenberg said.Three attempts to call Mr. Jenkins on Thursday at the Value Creators were not successful. A woman who answered the phone said that she was familiar with Ms. Ross\u2019s case but that neither Mr. Jenkins nor the organization would comment. \u201cI am pretty sure no one will be calling you,\u201d she said.Asked if there was a lawyer, she said there would be no comment.The judgment offered a glimpse into the evolution of the cult. Mr. Jenkins, its spiritual leader, belonged to the Nation of Islam until he split with it in 1978. He said he was abducted by \u201cangels and/or scientists\u201d and returned to earth to create the United Nation of Islam.He formed communities and businesses in Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Ohio, and named his community in Kansas City \u201cHeaven.\u201dThe United Nation of Islam controlled every aspect of its followers\u2019 lives, including women\u2019s weight and marriages in which men bid on women. It punished followers by shunning. It created an education system using Mr. Jenkins\u2019s teachings and dispensed medical care, the judgment says.In 2015, the group was renamed the Value Creators, promoting restaurants, health products, agriculture and life coaching.The default judgment was made after Mr. Jenkins and the other defendants failed to appear for hearings or send lawyers. At a hearing in February, lawyers for Ms. Ross said hers was a \u201cstolen childhood.\u201dHer mother joined the United Nation of Islam on a partial membership in Atlanta when Ms. Ross was 2, the hearing transcript said. Ms. Ross did odd jobs when she was 9, but after they moved to Kansas City, she began to work full time at 11.While she was shuttled to other states to work, some members said she did not have a \u201cproper attitude\u201d or the \u201cright spirit.\u201d During one period in Dayton, after she was shunned from the group and kept from her mother, she tried to rejoin, the complaint said.\u201cThere was just a fear of being in danger if I was to leave because of just the things Royall would say about people who left,\u201d Ms. Ross told the court in February. \u201cEspecially people who left and talked bad about him or his organization, that they were all killed in various ways.\u201dIn 2012, Ms. Ross asked for help from people who were not members of the group. She was given support at shelters for women and trafficking victims, Elizabeth A. Hutson, a lawyer on Ms. Ross\u2019s legal team, said.She is now working in a restaurant and studying at a community college in an undisclosed location, Ms. Hutson said.She is struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder. Asked in the February hearing why she was pursuing the lawsuit, Ms. Ross said: \u201cI mean, they took my childhood, my life and, I mean, I can\u2019t get that back. So I want them to pay for that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Surely not even tomato\u2019s botanical status as a fruit could disqualify it from the title of Greatest Summer Vegetable. A tomato is summer: gorged with sun, ridiculously voluptuous, drunk on stillness and time.Its heft in the hand is a promise. It has grown fat from a life of leisure; maybe you could, too. Its skin catches the light like a balloon\u2019s. Cut it open, and there\u2019s a sigh. Inside are shadowy crevices, hoards of juice. You half eat, half drink it.But \u2014 it feels like sacrilege to confess \u2014 I like tomatoes best in winter, whole San Marzanos from Italy in a can, their stores of sunshine breaking down into warm rag\u00f9. They bring a memory of brightness to the long dark.Corn I eat only in summer. I have to wait for it, which makes me want it more. It is a communal waiting, family and friends scanning the farmers\u2019 market and reporting back, \u201cNot yet.\u201d Then the first ears appear, plucked golden from the pot, followed by contemplative crunching and a slight shaking of heads. Not yet.Patience is required, a surrender to the season. As the days pass, each haul is a little less stiff, a little juicier. And finally there is the corn I dream of all year, tasting of earth and sun as if the two could never be parted. Eating it is an animal business, all hands and teeth, mowing down the kernels row by row.But there\u2019s more to it than the devouring. One night as I debated with my husband (a tomato partisan), my 9-year-old daughter held up her hand. \u201cCorn,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cBecause it\u2019s something you do together.\u201dI had forgotten the ceremony of shucking, husks falling to the floor like shrugged-off coats, strands of silk everywhere. Ice chimes in glasses, and smoke storms off the grill. No one is in a hurry for dinner, and when it comes, some of the most sophisticated people I know lunge across the table to roll their corn right through the stick of butter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Champions League Final Is a Tight Fit in Kiev. So How About New York?", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerMaria Garcia-Mella Cid did not even know if Real Madrid, the team she calls her lifelong \u201cobsession,\u201d would be playing in the Champions League final in Kiev when she began planning her trip from Miami to Ukraine.She had booked the final leg of her journey \u2014 a flight from Madrid to Kiev \u2014 before the semifinal matchups had been revealed, and identified a place to stay in Kiev before the second leg of Madrid\u2019s semifinal against Bayern Munich was even played. She instructed her cousin to confirm the reservation the moment the final whistle confirmed Madrid\u2019s place, but in the excitement of Real\u2019s nail-biting victory, the cousin promptly forgot.The next day, Garcia-Mella Cid took charge. She found an apartment in Kiev, paying for an extra night to make sure of the booking, and paid for the rest of her flights: Miami to Stockholm, Stockholm to Madrid.She did not know for sure she had a ticket \u2014 that would only be secured later through South Florida Pe\u00f1a, an official Real fan club \u2014 but she knew she had to be there. She had made the trip to Cardiff last year, where Real beat Juventus to retain the Champions League trophy, and had every intention of seeing the team try to raise it for the third year in a row.\u201cNothing compares to seeing your team in a final,\u201d she said.Everything was in place \u2014 a reward for Maria\u2019s being \u201csuper proactive\u201d \u2014 until it wasn\u2019t. The next day, Maria saw reports on Twitter of fans\u2019 having reservations canceled. She called Hotels.com, the online company through which she had made her booking and was assured everything was fine. The reservation had been paid, but if she wanted peace of mind, she was told, she could check with the apartment rental company in Ukraine. She sent an email. A few hours later, one came back, informing her the reservation had been canceled because of an error in the booking.The apartment was now back on the market, she said, but for five times the price.Hotels.com offered to pay the difference, but it was too late: the apartment, in the meantime, had been leased at the inflated rate to someone else.Maria had flights, and a match ticket, but nowhere to stay. And Kiev was, by that stage, pretty much fully booked.\u201cI had this feeling of impending doom,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took all of the joy out of going to see my team in a final.\u201dHers was not an isolated case. In the two weeks since it was confirmed that Real would face Liverpool in Saturday\u2019s Champions League final, countless stories have emerged of the difficulties fans of both clubs are facing in making it to the game.Hotels, of course, are always a problem. Prices skyrocket, driven not only by demand from ordinary fans \u2014 each club was given a little more than 16,000 tickets, and will bring many more supporters to the city \u2014 but because UEFA, the competition\u2019s organizer, reserves vast blocks of accommodations for its officials and sponsors.That price inflation has happened in Kiev \u2014 some rooms were listed at 10 times their usual value \u2014 but worse still, as Garcia-Mella Cid experienced, were those who were told that their reservations had vanished, but were available to rebook at significantly higher prices.That kindness has been noted, of course, but just as difficult has been finding a way to the city at all. Real is subsidizing the travel of 1,000 members of its La Grada fan group, but, as Garcia-Mella Cid put it, \u201ceveryone else is on their own.\u201dRegular flights into Borispol, Kiev\u2019s international airport, are fully booked, and have been for some time.Dozens of aircraft have been chartered in both Liverpool and Madrid, but that has not solved the problem. Borispol\u2019s limited capacity means all the available charter slots are taken. So many fans are expected to pass through the airport that some have been warned to expect, on their way home from Kiev, a policy of \u201cfree boarding,\u201d in which fans are simply placed on the first available flight back as they arrive at the airport.Fans, of course, try to find a way: some are flying in through Minsk, in Belarus, and then traveling overland, or even coming through Donetsk, in the east of Ukraine, in territory still afflicted by sporadic fighting between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian separatists.Many, though, have had no choice but to admit defeat. Real received only 25,000 applications for tickets from club members \u2014 down from more than 40,000 for Cardiff \u2014 wanting to go to Kiev, and reports in Spain over the weekend said that some 2,000 who were successful have had no choice but to hand their tickets back: The logistics were just too complicated. Privately, Liverpool fears some of its ticket holders will simply not be able to make it, either.UEFA, the competition\u2019s organizer, has applied pressure to the authorities in Kiev to try to ameliorate the situation, but remains deeply frustrated.In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Stampa last week, UEFA\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin, pointed out that it was precisely to avoid situations like the brewing one in Kiev that he made it a priority to change the way the host of the Champions League final, UEFA\u2019s showpiece event, is chosen.Kiev \u2014 like Cardiff last year \u2014 did not have to go through a bidding process when it was selected two years ago: until Ceferin\u2019s reforms were instituted in 2017, cities simply lobbied to be awarded a final; often, the winner was chosen for political convenience as much as suitability. Sometimes that was not an issue \u2014 Milan in 2016, Berlin in 2015, Lisbon in 2014 and London in 2013 all were well-equipped to host the event \u2014 but Cardiff, like Kiev, seemed to struggle with the sheer scale of the final, and the influx of fans into a comparatively small city. Last year, for example, many fans had to stay in Bristol, an hour away in England, or catch special trains from Wales back to London.Ceferin is eager to make sure that does not happen again. Madrid, which beat out Baku, Azerbaijan, for the 2019 final \u2014 had to submit a full dossier, including details of its hotel infrastructure. Lisbon and Istanbul, which are vying to hold the 2020 final, have been required to do the same.\u201cBefore, an executive simply said, \u2018I want to give you the game,\u2019\u201d Ceferin said. \u201cNow you present a dossier and the most complete wins. Kiev is beautiful, yet you cannot even get a room under the stairs for hundreds of euros. I will propose in the future that hotel infrastructure is central to the decision, and that places where fans have to sleep in a garage are not chosen.\u201dThat, however, gives UEFA another problem. The organization has been conscious for some time that only a dozen cities in Europe, at most, have both a stadium of the size required and the necessary logistical capacity to host the final smoothly. UEFA does not, however, want to find itself simply cycling between the same places every few years, further reinforcing the impression that the Champions League is a competition available to only a handful of countries.To alleviate that pressure, UEFA has privately discussed the idea of moving the final away from Europe occasionally: to New York, to Miami, to Doha. It even contemplated taking the annual Super Cup final outside of the continent as a trial run as early as 2020, but stepped back after objections from the organization\u2019s smaller member nations, who see that game as their only chance of hosting one of soccer\u2019s grandest occasions.The two great hurdles of taking the Champions League final to the Americas or Asia would, of course, be the time difference \u2014 Beijing and Tokyo most likely would be ruled out for that reason \u2014 and the costs for traveling fans.Those concerns have been powerful enough to see the conversation moved on to the back burner, but what has happened in Kiev this month may force it back onto the table. If fans are going to have to spend thousands of dollars supporting their team either way, does where they spend it matter?Garcia-Mella Cid, to her relief, has found a place to stay in Kiev: her story was eventually picked up by the Kyiv Post, a local newspaper, and a journalist there has offered her and her friends lodging, free of charge. For her, a Real Madrid win on Saturday would make all of the stress worth it. What she and thousands of others have been through, though, has made it just a little bit more likely that there will one day be a Champions League final much closer to her home in Miami.Advertisement"}

His Family Blames Uber\u2019s Influence.", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "A series of suicides in New York has drawn attention to the economic desperation of drivers competing with ride-hailing apps.Supported byHelen Ochisor drove the yellow taxi in the morning. Her husband Nicanor took it in the afternoon.They rarely saw each other during the week. She was asleep when he got home after a long night of driving. They exchanged a quick hello while handing off the taxi.Immigrants from Romania, the couple had bought their New York City taxi medallion nearly three decades ago. Lately, it had been difficult to find fares. Her husband worked 12-hour shifts, but brought home less money. He was worried about the plunging value of their once-lucrative medallion and frustrated about Uber\u2019s takeover of the industry.On a cold day in March, Mr. Ochisor hanged himself in his garage in Queens. His family blames the growing hopelessness he felt over his fortunes as a taxi driver.\u201cIt depressed him, it irritated him, it probably angered him \u2014 maybe all three,\u201d his son Gabriel Ochisor said in an interview at the family\u2019s home. \u201cIt was definitely a factor. Otherwise, we can\u2019t piece together any other factor.\u201d\u201cWe have a 7-month-old over there,\u201d he said pointing to his infant son \u2014 his father\u2019s first grandchild, who lived upstairs. \u201cWhy would you want to leave?\u201dNicanor Ochisor, 64, was one of four professional drivers to take their lives in the last five months. Another driver, Doug Schifter, killed himself with a shotgun in front of City Hall in February after sharing a Facebook post about the financial turmoil he was facing.Suicide is a deeply intimate decision, and there is no way to know for certain what confluence of factors might lead someone to make such a choice. But the recent series of deaths has drawn attention to the economic desperation that many taxi and livery drivers are grappling with, and has renewed calls to rein in Uber and other ride-hailing services.After Mayor Bill de Blasio suffered a bruising political defeat when he tried \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to cap Uber in 2015, there has been a growing sense that something has to be done. In a first step, the City Council held a hearing on Monday for several bills that could change the rules for car service apps.Mr. de Blasio has said he may try again to limit the number of for-hire vehicles.\u201cI think the caps are the kind of thing we need to talk about again,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in a recent radio interview, \u201cbecause the situation has gotten worse since then, both in terms of the pressure that\u2019s been put on the medallion owners, everyday taxi drivers, but also because of congestion.\u201dUber has transformed how Americans get around and has upended the transportation network in community after community. In New York City \u2014 Uber\u2019s largest United States market \u2014 the app has siphoned commuters from the sputtering subway and bus system, but more significantly it has all but vanquished the iconic yellow cab, plunging it into an existential crisis.Uber is the biggest player, with about 410,000 trips per day in February, but Lyft and Via, two other ride-hailing apps, have made inroads. (Lyft provided about 112,000 trips per day in February, and Via about 33,000, according to the city\u2019s taxi commission.) The influx of vehicles has contributed to gridlock on the streets of Manhattan, where traffic has slowed to a crawl and city buses travel at just 5.7 miles per hour on average.Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said new regulations on for-hire vehicles were back in the conversation.\u201cThe mayor has been clear about the need to re-evaluate our options in the face of explosive growth we\u2019re seeing in the industry,\u201d Mr. Finan said in a statement.Councilman Stephen Levin, a Democrat who represents Brooklyn and has sponsored a bill to restrict the number of for-hire vehicles, believes a cap would have a better chance this time.\u201cNew Yorkers see the congestion issue much more apparently \u2014 it\u2019s clear now,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cI also think empirically we\u2019re seeing it\u2019s much harder to make a living driving a cab.\u201dBut Alix Anfang, a spokeswoman for Uber, defended Uber\u2019s growth in New York, arguing that drivers keep up with a demand in the boroughs outside Manhattan for a reliable transportation option.\u201cCapping the number of Ubers would only hurt the millions of outer borough riders who have long been ignored by yellow taxis and who don\u2019t have access to reliable public transit,\u201d Ms. Anfang said.Less than two weeks after his father\u2019s death, Gabriel Ochisor stood outside City Hall at a protest calling on Mr. de Blasio to strengthen regulations. Four coffins were covered in white flowers, one for each driver.His father had attended a taxi protest at City Hall shortly before his death. It was unusual for him. He was quiet. He usually didn\u2019t go to protests.\u201cHe was mad at the politicians,\u201d said Gabriel, the couple\u2019s only child. \u201cHe was mad at Silicon Valley and all these big shots that have billions of dollars. You\u2019re trampling over the little guys that invested in something and wanted to have some exclusivity, as they were told when they bought the medallion.\u201dHelen and Nicanor met at an electronics factory in Romania. They married and moved to New York, purchasing the medallion for $180,000 in 1989. As its value rose, hitting a record of $1.05 million in 2013, they hoped it would fund their retirement.But the price of a medallion has dropped dramatically with the rise of ride-hailing apps. The city has not held an auction since 2014 because of fears that the medallions would not sell for a good price, and owners who sell medallions privately have not commanded large sums.When Helen Ochisor drives the taxi in Manhattan during the morning, business is virtually nonexistent.\u201cAfter 10 o\u2019clock, I cannot pick up nobody,\u201d Ms. Ochisor said. \u201cFor one hour or two hours, I was going downtown, uptown, and nothing.\u201dThe family has not found a suicide note.\u201cWe checked up and down, left and right,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cComputers, phones.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t find anything yet,\u201d Ms. Ochisor said.Gabriel Ochisor wants the problems that troubled his father to be addressed. He has sent letters to Mr. de Blasio and to a list of other elected officials, pleading for them to level the playing field between taxi and Uber drivers. He met recently with Meera Joshi, the city\u2019s taxi commissioner, but has not heard from the mayor\u2019s office.In a statement, Ms. Joshi said she admired \u201chis resolve to make his father\u2019s situation, concerns and beliefs heard.\u201d\u201cRight now, there is a sense of, \u2018We\u2019re not going to let our friend\u2019s death go in vain,\u2019\u201d Ms. Desai said.Still, it is easy to see how Uber has found a foothold in New York City. The Ochisor family lives in the Maspeth neighborhood of Queens, far from the nearest subway line. A reporter visiting the home asked for advice about the quickest way back to Manhattan.Gabriel Ochisor had to admit that the best option was Uber.Advertisement"}

You want a great Russia? Here she is.\u201d\u201cWhen I got older, maybe 14 years old, I finally got to see a computer for first time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYouTube was everything. I get to see how Wayne Gretzky plays, how Red Machine play. I get to see how Alexei Kovalev, Ilya Kovalchuk and Ovi play.\u201d (Ovi is a nickname for Ovechkin.)I watched a clip from the Canadian writer Dave Bidini\u2019s film, \u201cThe Hockey Nomad Goes to Russia,\u201d where he happened to visit a 12-year-old Kuznetsov in the Siberian city of Omsk, where his family had moved for his hockey career. It was a \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d sort of situation, an impossible and even pathetic dream. Kuznetsov was just a kid, and burdened with so much hope. And yet he actually made it. This year he leads all playoff players in points (goals plus assists) scored.And then the news came that Babchenko had been killed. I spent the afternoon reading about him and taking in the social media reaction. The head of the state-sponsored Russian broadcaster RT calmly explained on her Telegram channel that \u201ceveryone knows\u201d that if you\u2019re in danger for defying the Kremlin, you shouldn\u2019t go to Kiev! \u201cBut may he rest in peace anyway,\u201d she said. Another poster was more direct: \u201cBye,\u201d he wrote, adding a homophobic slur.The Russian-American hockey writer Slava Malamud, who has long criticized Ovechkin for his poor leadership, his selfishness and for his politics \u2014 Ovechkin announced on Instagram that he was heading up a social movement to back Putin\u2019s re-election \u2014 took to Twitter to put two and two together. Babchenko had been killed, he said, and people like Ovechkin who supported this murderous regime had made it possible: \u201cThis, #Caps fans, is your boy\u2019s idol,\u201d he wrote. Before too long, Malamud, who lives in Maryland, was receiving death threats himself.I spent the evening reading Babchenko\u2019s book about Chechnya. Malamud was right, of course: Hockey is just a game; to enjoy Ovechkin\u2019s prowess on the ice \u2014 he is not my favorite player, but the sheer force and exuberance of his game is something to behold \u2014 is to support, however obliquely, the continuation of a terrible regime.The next morning I woke up to learn that Babchenko\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d had been a sting operation carried out by the Ukrainian security services. As officials proceeded to claim at a news conference attended by Babchenko, they had learned that a former Ukrainian fighter had been hired to assassinate Babchenko. But the fighter decided to cooperate with the authorities; the news of the killing had been meant to entrap the person who had hired the assassin. That person was now in custody, the Ukrainians announced.Babchenko was not dead. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give them the satisfaction,\u201d he told reporters.This was good news! Babchenko was alive. Though announcing his death wasn\u2019t, maybe, the best way of going about catching his would-be assassin \u2014 from now on, news of another Kremlin opponent killed is going to be treated with justified skepticism. Already some people believe that these events are staged \u2014 the Russians, for example, have been implausibly insisting for years that it was a Ukrainian fighter jet, not a Russian missile, that took down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in August 2014. In that case, the evidence that it wasn\u2019t the Ukrainians is overwhelming. But here was a literal fake operation.I believe that Putin does not \u201cgive the order\u201d for these things. It was widely reported, for example, that the president was angry after the killing of the politician Boris Nemtsov, a vocal opponent of Putin\u2019s, in Moscow in 2015. But while some of the foot soldiers who carry out these killings have gone to jail, none of the higher-ups who may in fact have given the order \u2014 most notably, Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic \u2014 have suffered any consequences.At this point, saying that Putin does not actually order these murders is a distinction without a difference. He may not order them. But he is the president of Russia. He has created an atmosphere, legal and ideological, where they go unpunished. He is therefore encouraging them. And in some cases he may be ordering them, too.So where does this leave the Stanley Cup finals? I have never turned to hockey for moral or political instruction. Mostly I like the way the puck goes back and forth, the skill required to corral it, the speed with which decisions are made, the way the best players seem to anticipate where the play is going before anyone else does. Ovechkin\u2019s cheerleading for Putin strikes me as unfortunate, but less offensive than, say, the Boston Bruins goalie Tim Thomas\u2019s refusal to visit Barack Obama\u2019s White House in 2012 after the Bruins won the Stanley Cup.Ovechkin is well within the mainstream of Russian political life, and furthermore he has to go back there eventually; most Russian hockey players return to Russia after their playing careers are over in the West. It would require a bit of courage for him to stay out of politics entirely, and a lot of courage for him to speak up about his country\u2019s problems \u2014 whereas Thomas was perfectly free not to be a jerk.And anyway I am rooting for the delightful Golden Knights of Las Vegas \u2014 a team founded only last year, a group of outcasts \u201cunprotected\u201d by their previous teams during the expansion draft who started their season just days after the terrible mass shooting in Las Vegas and expressed grief and solidarity with their new hometown. They are fearsome and relentless forecheckers, unselfish with the puck and before our eyes discovering new possibilities within themselves; the former enforcer Ryan Reaves, for example, has scored two goals in the last three games. Their games are exciting and edifying to watch.Maybe I do look for moral and political instruction in hockey, at least during the playoffs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As D.I.Y. Gene Editing Gains Popularity, \u2018Someone Is Going to Get Hurt\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "After a virus was created from mail-order DNA, scientists are sounding the alarm about the genetic tinkering carried out in garages and living rooms.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As a teenager, Keoni Gandall already was operating a cutting-edge research laboratory in his bedroom in Huntington Beach, Calif. While his friends were buying video games, he acquired more than a dozen pieces of equipment \u2014 a transilluminator, a centrifuge, two thermocyclers \u2014 in pursuit of a hobby that once was the province of white-coated Ph.D.\u2019s in institutional labs.\u201cI just wanted to clone DNA using my automated lab robot and feasibly make full genomes at home,\u201d he said.Mr. Gandall was far from alone. In the past few years, so-called biohackers across the country have taken gene editing into their own hands. As the equipment becomes cheaper and the expertise in gene-editing techniques, mostly Crispr-Cas9, more widely shared, citizen-scientists are attempting to re-engineer DNA in surprising ways.Until now, the work has amounted to little more than D.I.Y. misfires. A year ago, a biohacker famously injected himself at a conference with modified DNA that he hoped would make him more muscular. (It did not.)Earlier this year, at Body Hacking Con in Austin, Tex., a biotech executive injected himself with what he hoped would be a herpes treatment. (Verdict: No.) His company already had live-streamed a man injecting himself with a home-brewed treatment for H.I.V. (His viral load increased.)In a recent interview, Mr. Gandall, now 18 and a research fellow at Stanford, said he only wants to ensure open access to gene-editing technology, believing future biotech discoveries may come from the least expected minds.But he is quick to acknowledge that the do-it-yourself genetics revolution one day may go catastrophically wrong.\u201cEven I would tell you, the level of DNA synthesis regulation, it simply isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Mr. Gandall said. \u201cThese regulations aren\u2019t going to work when everything is decentralized \u2014 when everybody has a DNA synthesizer on their smartphone.\u201dThe most pressing worry is that someone somewhere will use the spreading technology to create a bioweapon.The team purchased overlapping DNA fragments from a commercial company. Once the researchers glued the full genome together and introduced it into cells infected by another type of poxvirus, the cells began to produce infectious particles.To some experts, the experiment nullified a decades-long debate over whether to destroy the world\u2019s two remaining smallpox remnants \u2014 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and at a research center in Russia \u2014 since it proved that scientists who want to experiment with the virus can now create it themselves.The study\u2019s publication in the journal PLOS One included an in-depth description of the methods used and \u2014 most alarming to Gregory D. Koblentz, the director of the biodefense graduate program at George Mason University \u2014 a series of new tips and tricks for bypassing roadblocks.\u201cSure, we\u2019ve known this could be possible,\u201d Dr. Koblentz said. \u201cWe also knew North Korea could someday build a thermonuclear weapon, but we\u2019re still horrified when they actually do it.\u201dExperts urged the journal to cancel publication of the article, one calling it \u201cunwise, unjustified, and dangerous.\u201d Even before publication, a report from a World Health Organization meeting noted that the endeavor \u201cdid not require exceptional biochemical knowledge or skills, significant funds or significant time.\u201dBut the study\u2019s lead researcher, David Evans, a virologist at the University of Alberta, said he had alerted several Canadian government authorities to his poxvirus venture, and none had raised an objection.Many experts agree that it would be very difficult for amateur biologists of any stripe to design a killer virus on their own. But as more hackers trade computer code for the genetic kind, and as their skills become increasingly sophisticated, health security experts fear that the potential for abuse may be growing.\u201cTo unleash something deadly, that could really happen any day now \u2014 today,\u201d said Dr. George Church, a researcher at Harvard and a leading synthetic biologist. \u201cThe pragmatic people would just engineer drug-resistant anthrax or highly transmissible influenza. Some recipes are online.\u201d\u201cIf they\u2019re willing to inject themselves with hormones to make their muscles bigger, you can imagine they\u2019d be willing to test more powerful things,\u201d he added. \u201cAnyone who does synthetic biology should be under surveillance, and anyone who does it without a license should be suspect.\u201dAuthorities in the United States have been hesitant to undertake actions that could squelch innovation or impinge on intellectual property. The laws that cover biotechnology have not been significantly updated in decades, forcing regulators to rely on outdated frameworks to govern new technologies.The cobbled-together regulatory system, with multiple agencies overseeing various types of research, has left gaps that will only widen as the technologies advance.Academic researchers undergo strict scrutiny when they seek federal funding for \u201cdual-use research of concern\u201d: experiments that, in theory, could be used for good or ill. But more than half of the nation\u2019s scientific research and development is funded by nongovernmental sources.In 2013, a quest to create a glowing plant via genetic engineering drew almost half a million dollars through Kickstarter, the crowdfunding website.\u201cThere really isn\u2019t a national governance per se for those who are not federally or government funded,\u201d said Dr. William So, a biological countermeasures specialist at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Instead, he said, the agency relies on biohackers themselves to sound the alarm regarding suspicious behavior.\u201cI do believe the F.B.I. is doing their best with what they have,\u201d said Dr. Thomas V. Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore.\u201cBut if you really want to do this, there isn\u2019t a whole lot stopping you.\u201dThe F.B.I. has befriended many white-hat biohacking labs, among them Genspace in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Behind an inconspicuous steel door on a gritty, graffiti-lined street, biohackers-in-training \u2014 musicians, engineers, retirees \u2014 routinely gather for crash courses in genetic engineering.Participants in \u201cBiohacker Boot Camp\u201d learn basic technical skills to use in homegrown genetics projects, like concocting algae that glows.\u201cThe double helix is the most iconic image of the 20th century, perhaps rivaled only by the mushroom cloud,\u201d the bootcamp\u2019s leader, Michael Flanagan, said to a recent class.Genspace\u2019s entryway resembles a college dorm room, complete with sagging couch, microwave, mini-fridge. But the lab itself is palatial: two stories of white brick walls, industrial kitchen counters marked with dry-erase notes, shelves towering with glassware and reagents.It\u2019s a significant upgrade for Genspace. Daniel Grushkin, the co-founder, used to host bacterial experiments in his living room over pizza and beer.\u201cPeople might be calling you because we are nonscientists doing science in a busted-up old building,\u201d he recalled telling bureau agents. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t a meth lab, and we aren\u2019t bioterrorists.\u201dMr. Grushkin has become a trailblazer in biohacking risk management, in part because he recognizes that letting neophytes manipulate live organisms is \u201cless like a \u2018hackerspace,\u2019 more like a pet store.\u201dHe has posted community guidelines, forbidden infectious agents in the lab, and accepted a grant of almost $500,000 to design security practices for some four dozen similar labs across the country.Most of them report not having heard so much as a greeting from the F.B.I. At many, the consequence for breaking safety guidelines is simply the loss of membership \u2014 leaving the perpetrator to experiment in isolation, but still among thousands of enthusiasts huddled online in Facebook groups, email listservs and Reddit pages.Many find their inspiration in Josiah Zayner, a NASA scientist turned celebrity biohacker who straps a GoPro camera to his forehead and streams experiments on himself from his garage. He\u2019s the man who tried to make his muscles bigger.In an interview, Mr. Zayner conceded that among his biohacking followers, an accident \u2014 not a premeditated offense \u2014 was conceivable.\u201cI guess I can see why they don\u2019t let the entire public have access to Ebola,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk is, if they\u2019re working with Ebola and their house burns down, the Ebola could somehow get out.\u201dEven Mr. Zayner is apprehensive of the movement he helped begin; he plans to include live frogs in The Odin\u2019s D.I.Y.-Crispr kits to encourage his followers to experiment on animals instead of themselves \u2014 or others.\u201cI have no doubt that someone is going to get hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are trying to one-up each other, and it\u2019s moving faster than any one of us could have ever imagined \u2014 it\u2019s almost uncontrollable. It\u2019s scary.\u201dIf nefarious biohackers were to create a biological weapon from scratch \u2014 a killer that would bounce from host to host to host, capable of reaching millions of people, unrestrained by time or distance \u2014 they would probably begin with some online shopping.Mr. Gandall, the Stanford fellow, often buys such fragments \u2014 benign ones. But the workarounds for someone with ill intent, he said, might not be hard to figure out.Biohackers will soon be able to forgo these companies altogether with an all-in-one desktop genome printer: a device much like an inkjet printer that employs the letters AGTC \u2014 genetic base pairs \u2014 instead of the color model CMYK.A similar device already exists for institutional labs, called BioXp 3200, which sells for about $65,000. But at-home biohackers can start with DNA Playground from Amino Labs, an Easy Bake genetic oven that costs less than an iPad, or The Odin\u2019s Crispr gene-editing kit for $159.Tools like these may be threatening in the wrong hands, but they also helped Mr. Gandall start a promising career.At age 11, he picked up a virology textbook at a church book fair. Before he was old enough for a driver\u2019s permit, he was urging his mother to shuttle him to a research job at the University of California, Irvine.He began dressing exclusively in red polo shirts to avoid the distraction of choosing outfits. He doodled through high school \u2014 correcting biology teachers \u2014 and was kicked out of a local science fair for what was deemed reckless home-brew genetic engineering.Mr. Gandall barely earned a high-school diploma, he said, and was rebuffed by almost every college he applied to \u2014 but later gained a bioengineering position at Stanford University.\u201cPretty ironic, after they rejected me as a student,\u201d he said.He moved to East Palo Alto \u2014 with 14 red polo shirts \u2014 into a house with three nonbiologists, who don\u2019t much notice that DNA is cloned in the corner of his bedroom.His mission at Stanford is to build a body of genetic material for public use. To his fellow biohackers, it\u2019s a noble endeavor.To biosecurity experts, it\u2019s tossing ammunition into trigger-happy hands.\u201cThere are really only two things that could wipe 30 million people off of the planet: a nuclear weapon, or a biological one,\u201d said Lawrence O. Gostin, an adviser on pandemic influenza preparedness to the World Health Organization.\u201cSomehow, the U.S. government fears and prepares for the former, but not remotely for the latter. It baffles me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Gift of a Box Full of Darkness", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVoicesA year ago Christmas I received a beautiful double amaryllis, a check for $125 and a Kiehl\u2019s anti-aging kit. The amaryllis, scarlet red, came from my mother, who died less than two weeks later. The check had my father\u2019s shaky signature on it; he passed away before the daffodils returned last spring. And all those moisturizers and night creams? They came from my husband, who left our dog, our home and me, right between the deaths of my parents.Apparently there had been one more gift under that nine-foot Fraser fir that I hadn\u2019t been aware of at the time: A box full of darkness.The line comes from a poem by Mary Oliver called \u201cThe Uses of Sorrow\u201d:\u201cSomeone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift.\u201dIt would take me time, too, to understand that gift. But during those difficult months I learned more about loss, bitterness and grief than I had imagined possible. And that box of darkness turned out to contain surprises of a wondrous kind.\u201cHow many lessons do I need?\u201d I asked myself rhetorically soon after my father died in April. I tried to keep self-pity to a minimum; I already knew that life was unfair. I also understood that death is integral to life \u2014 just as loss and grief are the flip side of love.But I struggled with the fuller meaning of what was happening.Sensing I might not have a plan for my 60th birthday last summer, two couples in my small town planned a blowout fete, including a rewrite of the lyrics to \u201cHello Dolly\u201d (now \u201cHello Petrow\u201d), which a dozen friends sang to a happily weeping birthday boy. In a short speech I confessed to my friends that my marital separation had left me fearful of two things: What to do on this birthday (check) and finding a friend to drive me to my decennial colonoscopy (a not-so-intimate friend raised his hand).One afternoon later in the summer, a day when I was feeling particularly draggy from the humidity and depression, a Prius stealthed up on me from behind. In a spontaneous act of kindness, Jill, the driver and a friend who writes novels and raises goats, clasped my hands through the open window and then pulled me in for a hug. Just as quickly she released me, and, quietly, the Prius disappeared. Jill\u2019s hug remained on my skin.In November, a woman I\u2019ve never met but with whom I\u2019ve worked remotely sent me a handwritten sympathy note. \u201cThis is a long delayed, but no less heartfelt, note with the messages that have multiplied during the year,\u201d Julia began. \u201cWhat an overwhelming year this must have been for you,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see that you seem to be moving forward with grace and a sense of peace.\u201dBut it was my sister\u2019s birthday present that iced the cake. She had inherited our mother\u2019s jewelry, including a stunning pair of earrings made from malachite, the stone of transformation, surrounded by a gold braided wreath. With a jeweler\u2019s magic the earrings became cuff links \u2014 and they became mine.I had a flashback to my late mother wearing those earrings to the Emmy Awards in the 1970s, the same year, I believe, my father took home a statuette for a Bill Moyers documentary he had produced. Mom was (almost) lithe and (definitely) happy, decked out in a little black dress and those earrings, which drew the light to her face.Throughout those months, I blindly stumbled into a routine of expressing gratitude. Almost daily I\u2019d started to take photographs \u2014 of the morning sky or a lightning strike, an abandoned car or the old church near my house. My goal was simple: to see the beauty around me. Sometimes, it meant taking a step to the right or left, looking up or down. Spontaneously, I started to use \u201c#gratitude\u201d when posting. Friends and followers were quick to \u201clike\u201d them, and some even followed suit by tagging their own pictures #gratitude.On New Year\u2019s Eve I donned the cuff links from my sister for the first time. Before putting on my tuxedo, I pulled from my shelf the Mary Oliver book and reread her lines:\u201cSomeone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this, too, was a gift.\u201dNow I could more fully understand that gift born of darkness. One dreadful year produced a deepened love of \u2014 and for \u2014 my siblings, their spouses and my dear friends.I posted some of these thoughts on Facebook on New Year\u2019s Day, and to my surprise many friends revealed the dark contents of their own boxes \u2014 a child who had died, a financial catastrophe, a recent cancer diagnosis \u2014 and the unexpected gifts that had come their way. Not easy. Never fair. But I was certainly not alone.At the bottom of my box \u2014 after two deaths and a divorce \u2014 I had found the gift of gratitude. Day in and day out I\u2019ve witnessed its magic, its ability to transform a dark heart into a brighter one. It\u2019s free. It\u2019s real. And as long as you let it inhabit you, it will stay with you and become yours to share.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Starbucks\u2019s Bias Training, Despite Skepticism, Is an Important Start", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookStarbucks will temporarily shut 8,000 stores for four hours Tuesday afternoon to conduct racial bias training for its employees. It follows an incident in Philadelphia last month in which two black men were arrested simply for waiting in a store.What would seem like a positive step forward is already, perhaps predictably, being criticized.There is undoubtedly a public relations aspect to this. Starbucks wants to polish its image as an inclusive, progressive company.But what other American company do you know that is spending tens of millions of dollars to try to begin a discussion about race at such a scale and in such a public way?Having spoken with senior executives at many large American companies, I found it hard to find one that has taken on the issue of race so directly, with so many employees. Other corporations have programs to improve race relations and have spent money on diversity programs, especially for those in the senior ranks. Some, including Facebook and Google, have included implicit bias training. But few, if any, have taken as sweeping an approach as Starbucks will on Tuesday.The National Football League, for example, took the opposite approach: It set rules last week aimed at keeping any conversation about race or social justice far from its fields.They\u2019re right. But that\u2019s not the way to measure it.The training program, if it is effective, will start a dialogue among some 175,000 employees. The hope is that they will continue the conversation in stores, at home and among their family and friends for days, weeks and months, multiplying the impact.That\u2019s called a start. And if the program is well received, it could give license to other companies to wade into a historically sensitive issue.The incident clearly rattled Starbucks\u2019 leadership. If nothing else, it was an ugly public image for a company that prides itself on showcasing its inclusive values.The seminars will involve groups of about four employees being guided by an interactive iPad workbook, featuring videos from Mr. Johnson, Mr. Schultz and the rapper Common. Staff will also watch a documentary short by Stanley Nelson Jr., the Emmy-winning filmmaker. A series of conversation-starters are included in separate worksheets.Of course, it is possible that Starbuck\u2019s training program could lead to bruised feelings, tears and fighting among employees.But whatever happens, someone always has to go first.In 1953, a year before Brown v. Board of Education, I.B.M.\u2019s chief executive, Thomas Watson Jr., wrote a letter describing a commitment to nondiscrimination.

{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s President Proposes Caretaker Government Amid Stalemate", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpeaking at the Quirinal Palace on Monday night after a third, and apparently final, round of fruitless consultations with party leaders, the mild-mannered Mr. Mattarella seemed a bit vexed as he called the situation \u201canomalous\u201d and admonished the politicians for their lack of progress.\u201cIt would be the first time in the history of the republic,\u201d he said, that the Parliament elected by Italians was dissolved before it even went to work and selected a cabinet and prime minister.Mr. Mattarella, 76, with fluffy white hair and discretion honed during his years as a Christian Democratic politician, is motivated most by a search for stability. A Sicilian, he entered politics after a Mafia gunman in 1980 shot and killed his brother, then the region\u2019s president, at point-blank range.\u201cThe unwillingness of all of them was confirmed this morning,\u201d he said, adding that there wasn\u2019t \u201cany possibility to form a majority government.\u201dMr. Mattarella, who usually has a ceremonial role but is imbued by the Italian Constitution with great power during moments of political chaos, said the government led until this point by Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appreciated, but no longer viable. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to give life to a new government,\u201d he said. \u201cOne can no longer wait.\u201dMore than half of Italians gave their support to the League and the Five Star Movement on March 4, but neither won enough votes to win a majority in Parliament. Mr. Mattarella argued that the parties would have more time to work out their disagreements while a \u201cneutral\u201d government did the actual governing.Mr. Mattarella, a former member of Parliament, a defense and education minister and a judge on Italy\u2019s constitutional court, became president in 2015 and since then has sought to stay above the political fray.In keeping with his trademark aversion to drama, Mr. Mattarella sought to avoid a return to the polls in the summer or fall, which could produce the same impasse. He said he hoped the parties could reach an agreement by the end of December, when his caretaker government would expire. If not, he said, elections should be held in the new year.Italy\u2019s leading politicians did not want to wait that long.\u201cJuly 8 is the first possible date to vote, and Di Maio also agrees,\u201d Mr. Salvini told reporters.Mr. Salvini then rejected the president\u2019s offer on Monday evening.\u201cMattarella wants a \u2018neutral government\u2019? Please,\u201d Mr. Salvini, a gifted campaigner, wrote on Twitter, adding that Italy needed a government \u201cthat defends in Europe the principle ITALIANS FIRST.\u201dMr. Salvini seemed to anticipate the president\u2019s decision, taking to Facebook earlier to prepare his base for coming elections. He told them that more migrants were already coming and that if the negotiations failed, \u201cwe will come to ask you for that 2, 3, 4 percent more votes which would give us the chance to govern alone for five years, without asking permission of anyone.\u201dEarly in the morning, the president met with Mr. Di Maio, 31, who, to reinforce his anti-establishment appeal, drove to the meeting in a small white Citro\u00ebn.Speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. Di Maio said, \u201cWe are not willing to support a confidence vote for a technical government.\u201d Arguing that he was not to blame for the stalemate, he said, \u201cI was never the impediment.\u201d\u201cNow I want to say it officially,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cFor me, any talks with the League end here. It is clear that a government with the center-right is no longer a pursuable hypothesis.\u201dBut on Monday, with the president\u2019s decision only hours away, he scrambled to reopen the door to talks.In what he called a \u201cnew phase\u201d of the talks, Mr. Di Maio said he was still willing to find an agreement with Mr. Salvini on a prime minister they could both support and who would push their priorities, including a universal basic income, anti-corruption laws and a rollback of pension reforms.After the president\u2019s remarks, Mr. Di Maio reiterated on Twitter that he would vote \u201cNo confidence in a \u2018neutral\u2019 government.\u201dA failure of Mr. Mattarella\u2019s temporary, technocratic government to win a confidence vote in Parliament would lead to new elections and, European leaders fear, upset the markets.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there are two political realities competing to lead the country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Italians will decide.\u201dAgain.Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And with the internet\u2019s borderless nature, the regulations are set to have an outsize impact far beyond Europe.Brazil, Japan and South Korea are set to follow Europe\u2019s lead, with some having already passed similar data protection laws. European officials are encouraging copycats by tying data protection to some trade deals and arguing that a unified global approach is the only way to crimp Silicon Valley\u2019s power.\u201cWe want to achieve the same level of restrictions that you have in Europe,\u201d said Luiz Fernando Martins Castro, a lawyer based in S\u00e3o Paulo who advises the Brazilian government on internet policy. Mr. Castro said Europe was \u201cpushing the matter and making people realize that we have to go forward.\u201dEurope is determined to cement its role as the world\u2019s foremost tech watchdog \u2014 and the region is only getting started. Authorities in Brussels and in the European Union\u2019s 28 member countries are also setting the bar for stricter enforcement of antitrust laws against tech behemoths and are paving the way for tougher tax policies on the companies.\u201cThe E.U. is more advanced than the U.S. in protecting consumer privacy, and what happens there could be a harbinger of the future,\u201d said Michael Kearns, a computer science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who has studied the data collection techniques of companies including Facebook and Google.Businesses must also more clearly detail how someone\u2019s data is being handled, while clearing a higher bar to target advertising using personal information. Companies face fines if they do not comply, with tech giants risking penalties greater than $1 billion. Privacy groups preparing class action-style complaints under the new law may put even more legal pressure on companies.European authorities have actively encouraged other countries to adopt similar laws to G.D.P.R. Officials have been dispatched around the world to preach the tougher rules. Data protections are becoming part of trade deals, with the region ready to limit access to its market of 500 million consumers if countries do not rise to meet Europe\u2019s standards.\u201cIf we can export this to the world, I will be happy,\u201d said Vera Jourova, the European commissioner in charge of consumer protection and privacy who helped draft G.D.P.R. She said she planned to travel to Japan and South Korea in the next few weeks for talks about data protection. Regulating technology, she added, is a \u201cglobal challenge.\u201dBrazil has an incentive to draft tougher privacy laws: One provision of G.D.P.R. limits the data that companies can transfer outside the European Union unless that data goes to a country that meets Europe\u2019s standards.\u201cMany countries are interested in signing a trade agreement with the European Union, and then privacy becomes an important precondition,\u201d said Mr. Buttarelli.Europe\u2019s fingerprints can be seen elsewhere in the world, too. Japan last year passed a data protection law creating a new independent online privacy board, and Tokyo and Brussels are finalizing the details of a data transfer deal. South Korea is considering new privacy rules, while Israel has adopted updated requirements for disclosures of data breaches \u2014 both share elements with the European rules.Europe\u2019s influence is not going unnoticed by America\u2019s tech giants, which have long complained that Brussels unfairly focuses on them.The new privacy rules are part of a \u201cstrong European tradition\u201d of policing industries to protect the environment or public health, even if it does \u201cconstrain business,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top antitrust official.To meet G.D.P.R.\u2019s requirements, Facebook and Google have deployed large teams to overhaul how they give users access to their own privacy settings and to redesign certain products that may have sucked up too much user data. Facebook said it had roughly 1,000 people working on the initiative globally, including engineers, product managers and lawyers.\u201cIn the absence of another approach, it\u2019s easier for other markets to follow what Europe has done,\u201d said Mr. Garfield.Whether Europe\u2019s tough approach is actually crimping the global tech giants is unclear. The region\u2019s regulators have hit American companies with hefty fines over antitrust violations, the mishandling of user data and the payment of taxes, but Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook have continued to grow and add customers.Challenges remain over how G.D.P.R. will be enforced. National regulators across Europe will be charged with policing the regulations, but many have woefully fewer resources than the companies they will be overseeing.Even if Europe persuades other countries to adopt its policies, it will be hard to ensure the laws work, said Omer Tene, a vice president at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a trade group that tracks global privacy regulation.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have rules on the books,\u201d said Mr. Tene. \u201cIt\u2019s quite another thing to implement these rules on the ground.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We\u2019ve recovered her,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cSadly, she was not recovered as we and her family had hoped and prayed these last nine years.\u201dIn September, a group of hunters in a remote area of Eastern Washington discovered the remains, which were sent to the F.B.I. for analysis, Mr. Scott said. This week the F.B.I. notified the authorities in Washington that the DNA of the remains matched that of Lindsey.Lindsey was last seen leaving a friend\u2019s house a few blocks from where she and her family lived in McCleary, a town of about 2,000 people in Western Washington, about 80 miles from Seattle. It was around 9:15 p.m. on June 26, 2009, less than two weeks before her 11th birthday. She never made it home. A $35,000 reward was offered for any information leading to an arrest, but as the years passed, the case remained cold and no suspects were identified.The announcement about Lindsey\u2019s remains provided a devastating resolution to residents of McCleary, where posters of Lindsey\u2019s face are still hanging.Kaytlyn Reed, a childhood friend of Lindsey\u2019s who was also interviewed by KOMO, described the news as \u201csoul-crushing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to think about it,\u201d she said.\u201cWhile we are experiencing profound grief and mourning the loss of \u2018OUR ANGEL\u2019 Lindsey at this time, we respectfully ask for your understanding of our need for privacy,\u201d the message said. \u201cSilent prayers of support are always welcome.\u201dShe added: \u201cIt destroyed us,\u201d especially Lindsey\u2019s older brother, Joshua. \u201cHe didn\u2019t just lose his sister; he lost the mom he knew.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Blocking of Twitter Users Is Unconstitutional, Judge Says", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut on Wednesday, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter habits \u2014 his practice of blocking critics on the service, preventing them from engaging with his account \u2014 was declared unconstitutional by a federal judge in Manhattan.If the principle undergirding Wednesday\u2019s ruling in Federal District Court stands, it is likely to have implications far beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s feed and its 52 million followers, said Jameel Jaffer, the Knight First Amendment Institute\u2019s executive director and the counsel for the plaintiffs. Public officials throughout the country, from local politicians to governors and members of Congress, regularly use social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to interact with the public about government business.\u201cThis ruling should put them on notice, and if they censor critics from social media accounts used for official purposes, they run the risk that someone will sue them and win,\u201d he said of public officials.Asked whether the administration would unblock the users or appeal the ruling, Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, demurred from making any specific pronouncement. \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the court\u2019s decision and are considering our next steps,\u201d she said.But she did not issue an injunction ordering Mr. Trump or Mr. Scavino to unblock the users, a nod to the separation-of-powers sensitivities of a judge\u2019s ordering a president to do something. Rather, her ruling simply declared what the Constitution requires, with the expectation that the White House would comply.\u201cBecause no government official is above the law and because all government officials are presumed to follow the law once the judiciary has said what the law is, we must assume that the president and Scavino will remedy the blocking we have held to be unconstitutional,\u201d she wrote in her ruling.The plaintiffs had argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed is an official government account and that blocking users from following it is a violation of their First Amendment rights.Their complaint argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s feed amounted to a \u201cdigital town hall\u201d where not only did the president and his aides communicate information but members of the public \u2014 by replying to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets and others who responded to him \u2014 exchanged views with one another. By blocking particular people from viewing or replying to message chains because they had expressed views he did not like, it argued, Mr. Trump had violated their First Amendment rights.Judge Buchwald, who was appointed to the federal bench in 1999 by President Bill Clinton, agreed.\u201cThe viewpoint-based exclusion of the individual plaintiffs from that designated public forum is proscribed by the First Amendment and cannot be justified by the president\u2019s personal First Amendment interests,\u201d she wrote.The ruling also rejected the government\u2019s claim that Mr. Trump operates the account merely in a personal capacity, concluding that he \u201cuses the account to take actions that can be taken only by the president as president.\u201dJudge Buchwald, however, did dismiss Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, and Hope Hicks, the former communications director, as defendants because Ms. Sanders does not have access to the account and Ms. Hicks no longer works in the administration.Mr. Jaffer said Mr. Trump or Mr. Scavino should simply unblock the users. If they do not, the next step could be to seek an injunction. (Judge Buchwald mentioned that possibility, writing that \u201cinjunctive relief directed at Scavino\u201d was one of the options that \u201cremain available.\u201d)There have been other legal cases involving public officials and their social media activity. In April, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland settled a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland and several other plaintiffs who accused him of censorship on government-operated Facebook pages. A similar federal lawsuit filed against Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine is awaiting a ruling.In a March hearing, Judge Buchwald had suggested that Mr. Trump has the right to ignore whomever he pleases on Twitter, and that the \u201cMute\u201d feature is a constitutional option for doing so. Using that feature would hide selected users\u2019 posts from Mr. Trump\u2019s view.She urged the two parties to consider that possibility as a way to settle the matter. But the president\u2019s preference for blocking \u2014 which renders Twitter users unable to interact directly with his posts, or with other users in the space beneath those posts \u2014 amounts to barring Americans from a public forum, in the judge\u2019s view.Indeed, many of the tweets for which users were blocked were attempts to join the sprawling conversations that take place around the president\u2019s feed.Another plaintiff, Rebecca Buckwalter, who is now an editor for the left-leaning website The Daily Kos, was blocked for replying to a June tweet from Mr. Trump that read, \u201cSorry folks, but if I would have relied on the Fake News of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, washpost or nytimes, I would have had ZERO chance winning WH.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, they are barely past 20 years old, housemates in Berkeley, Calif., the headquarters for their start-up RoBhat Labs, fighting the scourges of our digital political reality.In May, the men used some of the methods they had picked up in machine learning classes to help develop a NewsBot for Facebook Messenger: Drop a link of a news article into the chat window and the bot judges whether the report has right or left bias. Last summer, they started working on an algorithm to identify the bots on Twitter pushing inflamed political discussion.RoBhat Labs introduced Botcheck.me, a browser extension that lets Twitter users test whether a Twitter account is run by a human or is automated. The associated website also shows what bot networks are tweeting about in real time. The Democratic National Committee took notice, commissioning RoBhat Labs to write a report on the spread of disinformation on social media.\u201cI\u2019m excited about them stepping up and applying public pressure\u201d on the tech companies, said Raffi Krikorian, the committee\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cWe frankly think the administration and Congress are not doing enough, so we\u2019re filling in this gap.\u201dMr. Bhat and Mr. Phadte left school this spring to work with the committee and are seeking funding for their start-up. They\u2019re on a deadline to develop their next product, which will be a tool that tests whether news has been altered as it gets passed around the web, warding against doctored photos and altered videos. They hope to market the tool to news media companies and political candidates this summer, in time for the run-up to the midterms.When Nancy Lublin started Crisis Text Line in 2013, she thought of her New York City nonprofit as a tech start-up \u2014 and not simply because they text to counsel people in distress. Ms. Lublin wanted to use analytics to be smarter at it.\u201cI\u2019d consider myself a tech C.E.O.,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first thing I ask is, \u2018What does the data say?\u2019\u201dFive years after the site began, 4,000 volunteer counselors across the country \u2014 the site is always recruiting more \u2014 can work on their computers wherever there is internet. The nonprofit said it handled nearly a million chats last year, mostly with people under 25 who would rather text than talk about their problems.The platform the volunteers log into is honed with a machine learning algorithm, which has analyzed past chats for actionable information. For example, the system automatically moves distressed people who write words like \u201cgun,\u201d \u201cmilitary,\u201d \u201cfentanyl,\u201d or a crying emoji to the front of the line, colored orange. Data shows those are the most likely indicators that the person will need an active rescue from 911, and counselors start chats with them first, responding within an average of 38 seconds.The data also helps people on the ground who are fighting crises. In 2016, Ohio started a state-specific keyword with the Crisis Text Line \u2014 4HOPE \u2014 and advertised it in schools. The nonprofit\u2019s data crunchers noticed that use of the keyword fell in the summer. Their Ohio partners were alerted and placed advertising in movie theaters. The texts surged once more.In 2005, Eileen Richardson started volunteering at a soup kitchen in Silicon Valley. She was chief executive of the music-file sharing platform Napster during the first tech boom, and she brought the same rigor to her volunteer position. She figured \u2014 in retrospect, with an embarrassing amount of hubris \u2014 that she could solve homelessness in six months and move on to her next project.\u201cThat\u2019s how tech people are,\u201d she said. Instead, \u201cHere I am all these years later. We\u2019re onto something.\u201dHer solution is the Downtown Streets Team. Each weekday morning in nine California cities, team members sweep the streets for a four-hour shift. Led by other team members who have been promoted to managers, the daily shift teaches job skills and accountability, and boosts the team members\u2019 self-esteem.\u201cYou go from being a bad guy to now one of the great guys,\u201d Ms. Richardson said of the members. \u201cThe chief of police and mayor are patting your back, and people are slipping you 20 bucks here and there.\u201d The brigade of sweepers in yellow T-shirts acts as its own recruitment device: Other homeless people notice and ask to join.In exchange for sweeping, team members receive stipends \u2014 gift cards for groceries, vouchers for housing, bus passes and prescription refills. They set goals with a case manager for housing and employment, and attend weekly team meetings that take on a nearly ecclesiastical fervor as everyone cheers each other\u2019s successes. \u201cThis is not a program,\u201d Ms. Richardson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a team. They start seeing other people doing great and are like, \u2018I want to get a car or housing, so it\u2019s self-motivating.\u2019\u201dThirteen years after Ms. Richardson\u2019s experiment \u2014 with California in a housing crisis and a homeless epidemic \u2014 team members average four months to get housing and six months until they get a job. In a recent survey, 96 percent said they had more hope, 84 percent had health insurance and 73 percent said they were using less drugs and alcohol. Ms. Richardson is now looking to scale up with an affiliate program nationwide.Five years ago, Prukalpa Sankar was studying business at a university in Singapore and interning at Goldman Sachs, the beginning of what she thought would be a decade of studying and working abroad before moving back to her native India. That all changed in a late-night dorm brainstorm, when she and another Indian classmate, Varun Banka, who was interning at Barclays, wondered why the same amount of big data they saw informing financial decisions were not being applied to the gnarlier problems in their home country. \u201cWe thought, wouldn\u2019t it be so cool to use data to allocate where money gets spent in Indian cities?\u201d Ms. Sankar said.They raised some seed capital through business plan competitions ($25,000, enough to get started), and moved to New Delhi after graduation in 2013 to test a few pilots with a data science start-up they named SocialCops.They discovered that much of the data in the world\u2019s second most populous country was still gathered by pencil and paper, in local languages, and never converted digitally \u2014 making any sort of big-picture analysis impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to reach data you can use, people often give up in the process,\u201d said Ms. Sankar, 26. \u201cYet when you can give people insights off the data, they will make decisions off of it.\u201dIn 2016, India\u2019s federal government enlisted their help to get propane tanks to women living in villages who had been using smoke-billowing indoor fires to cook. The government wanted to install gas cylinders in 50 million homes in three years and have public oil companies open thousands more centers nearby to sell them refills.SocialCops went to work, asking 17,000 oil distributors to submit their GPS coordinates using the company\u2019s app. They then incorporated data like populations, affluence and distance from existing sales centers, and made all the information easy to analyze to pinpoint the best locations for new centers and track the rollout of the connections in homes. The company said the effort hooked up about 22 million homes in its first year, seven million more than the goal.Alloysius Attah grew up with his aunt, a farmer who grew corn, cassava and yams in rural Ghana. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the hardest working and resilient people I\u2019ve known,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a reluctant kid helping.\u201d Mr. Attah said farmers were more than half the country\u2019s labor force and many tended to two to four acres. Their access to information is limited, coming from local agriculture ministry offices or radio.Mr. Attah, now 28, wants to give farmers the tools to become informed entrepreneurs, increasing their crop yields and marketability to the lucrative export business. Ghana is one of the world\u2019s top exporters of cocoa, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a billions of dollar industry, but when you look at the money that comes down to farmers \u2014 they don\u2019t get enough. That\u2019s why we help them to tap into the global market.\u201dIn 2013, he started Farmerline with his co-founder, Emmanuel Owusu Addai, which is based in Ghana and has grown into a company of 32 employees. Farmers nearly universally own basic cellphones, so Farmerline delivers them prerecorded voice messages in their local language with localized weather forecasts and market prices for crops. (\u201cIt\u2019s like a podcast on a \u2018dumb phone,\u2019\u201d Mr. Attah wrote in an email.)The messages also share farming tips \u2014 like how to get certified as fair trade farmers, or increase crop yields by, say, pruning cacao trees to increase the growth of pods, or how to meet the crop specifications for export markets.Farmerline uses machine learning to predict the local demand for farming supplies like fertilizer and equipment to then negotiate better prices for good quality goods from distributors. They also are using artificial intelligence to create a credit score, so farmers can take out loans to grow their business.Over all, it puts farmers \u201cin a position of power,\u201d Mr. Attah said. \u201cThey move from a position of let me take what everybody gives me, to let me choose because I have options now. You and I have that.\u201dPeople love lists.We want to check out the best places to travel, catch up with the best inventions of the last 100 years, be in the know about the best-dressed people, the best books, the best schools. And on and on.Of course, there is a risk to listmaking. Maybe your choices won\u2019t hold up over the years. Maybe the best book of decades ago seems not so great today.With the listmaking fervor and its risks in mind, we searched for people who would fit our criteria for visionaries. They had to be people who are forward-looking, working on exciting projects, helping others or taking a new direction. We wanted diversity in gender, race and ethnic background.We assigned writers who are knowledgeable about the subjects we deemed most important. And we limited the list to 30.Narrowing down the numbers was a huge challenge. And that\u2019s a good problem to have. It means there are a lot of people out there who are following their visions.We hope this inspires you to follow yours.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Spotted Pig Restaurant Empire Is Fracturing", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe once-robust empire that the restaurateur Ken Friedman and the chef April Bloomfield built together is showing signs of breaking apart, five months after Mr. Friedman was accused of sexually harassing employees and retaliating against those who complained.Mr. Friedman has disputed the accuracy of those accounts, but apologized for behavior that can be \u201cdescribed at times as abrasive, rude and frankly wrong.\u201d He was immediately removed from the restaurant group\u2019s daily operations, and negotiations have since begun to split the business.In response to several questions from The Times, Mr. Friedman\u2019s lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, released a statement on Thursday: \u201cIt has been a complex and protracted process, but Mr. Friedman hopes and expects the separation will be completed shortly. Given ongoing discussions we don\u2019t believe it would be appropriate to say more at this time.\u201dMs. Bloomfield issued a one-sentence statement the same day: \u201cAs I finalize ending my current business partnership, my future plans will not involve Ken Friedman.\u201dThe separation of Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield is more complicated; they are slicing up an empire, not surrendering one. Their remaining restaurants are operated by the partners\u2019 company, Biergarten LLC. As the company is being broken up for parts, the future of those restaurants is unclear.A \u201c60 Minutes\u201d segment about the scandal, broadcast on Sunday, only made the separation more complicated. The Spotted Pig was identified as the location of the alleged sexual assault under investigation by the New York police, making it a possible crime scene.Mr. Friedman has been accused not only of harassing his own employees, but also of knowingly allowing Mr. Batali to do the same.On Thursday, Mr. Friedman said through a spokesman that he had told Mr. Batali about five years ago that he could no longer host or attend parties on the third floor, because his behavior there had become intolerable.

{"Headline": "Where to Start Looking in the Symantec Mystery: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Some red flags to watch at Symantec\u2022 David Tepper close to an agreement to purchase Carolina Panthers.\u2022 AT&T\u2019s C.E.O. said he regretted hiring Michael Cohen.\u2022 Symantec\u2019s stock plunges on news of an internal investigation.\u2022 What China\u2019s crackdown on debt means.\u2022 The latest on potential economic warning signs.Symantec, the cybersecurity software company, late Thursday said its audit committee had started an internal investigation related to concerns raised by a former employeeThe company provided no details about what those concerns were and did not hold a question and answer session with analysts on its conference call following the release of its earnings late Thursday. It did warn that its financial results may be affected, depending on the outcome of the investigation.The announcement helped drive Symantec\u2019s shares down by a third in Friday\u2019s trading.The fact that the audit committee is involved and that Symantec said its annual financial filing might now be delayed, suggests the company\u2019s book-keeping is under the spotlight. The issue may, of course, end up being minor. But until Symantec, which declined to comment, provides details, outsiders will look for red flags. Here are some:\u2014 Peter EavisThe deal could come as early as next week, Bloomberg reports. The N.F.L. owners would have to approve the transaction, and Mr. Tepper would have to sell his stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers.Add Randall Stephenson, the telecom giant\u2019s C.E.O., as another corporate chieftain who regretted getting involved with President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.Mr. Stephenson sent out a memo to employees about the company\u2019s $600,000 contract with Essential Consultants, the shell company that Mr. Cohen had created (and which was also used to pay $130,000 to Stormy Daniels).In the memo, the AT&T C.E.O. said, \u201cThere is no other way to say it \u2013 AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake,\u201d though he added that the company followed the law.Yet it also said that its legislative affairs team would now report to the telecom\u2019s general counsel, David McAtee. The team\u2019s senior executive vice president, Bob Quinn, will be \u201cretiring.\u201dHere\u2019s the full text of the memo, which was obtained by DealBook:Our company has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons these last few days and our reputation has been damaged. There is no other way to say it \u2013 AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake.To be clear, everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate. But the fact is, our past association with Cohen was a serious misjudgment. In this instance, our Washington D.C. team\u2019s vetting process clearly failed, and I take responsibility for that. Here is more information on this issue, if you\u2019re interested.For the foreseeable future, the External & Legislative Affairs (E&LA) group will report to our General Counsel David McAtee. Bob Quinn, Senior Executive Vice President - E&LA, will be retiring.David\u2019s number one priority is to ensure every one of the individuals and firms we use in the political arena are people who share our high standards and who we would be proud to have associated with AT&T.To all of you who work tirelessly every day to serve customers and represent the brand proudly, thank you. My personal commitment to you is \u2013 we will do better.RandallIn a separate document, the company discussed several other points about the hiring of Essential Consultants\u2014 including the fact that Mr. Cohen approached AT&T:Michael Cohen approached our External Affairs organization during the post-election transition period and said he was going to leave the Trump Organization and do consulting for a select few companies that wanted his opinion on the new President and his administration \u2013 the key players, their priorities, and how they think.The company also noted that it had hired \u201cpolitical consultants\u201d in the past, especially at the beginning of new administrations.\u2014 Michael de la MercedSymantec said the investigation was in its early stages and warned its \u201cfinancial results and guidance may be subject to change based on the outcome.\u201dIf Symantec\u2019s stock closes at its current levels, it would mark its worst single-day decline in 17 years and second worst fall in its history.First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final regulatory approvals, we will be offering free rides to the public in a few months.Super huge thanks to everyone that helped with this project. Strong support from public, elected officials & regulators is critical to success.As mentioned in prior posts, once fully operational (demo system rides will be free), the system will always give priority to pods for pedestrians & cyclists for less than the cost of a bus ticket.\u201cSome financial risks are longstanding, lurking sources of infection that are concealed very deep but may erupt in a flash. The United States subprime crisis erupted in a night. If we\u2019re going to have big trouble in the future, it could well be in this area, and this demands high vigilance.\u201d(Another of his worries: losing a tech race to the West.)But reducing debt will be difficult, as Christopher Lee of S.&P. Global told the NYT: \u201cLike any deleveraging campaign, it is not painless.\u201dThe push into credit cards is fraught for Goldman, whose track record in consumer finance is scarcely two years old. Credit cards are a cutthroat business dominated by larger rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Yields are falling. And Goldman lacks much of the infrastructure to be able to issue credit cards and process payments to merchants.An earlier version of this briefing incorrectly said China\u2019s debt was 256 times the country\u2019s gross domestic product.

{"Headline": "Quebec Mosque Shooter Was Consumed by Refugees, Trump and Far Right", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese details surfaced during a three-week sentencing hearing that ended late last month. Mr. Bissonnette faces up to 150 years in prison after pleading guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and is expected to be sentenced in the coming months.The hearing was a grim reminder that more than a year after the Jan. 29, 2017, rampage, Canada is still grappling with Mr. Bissonnette\u2019s crime. It shocked the nation and underlined the perils of Islamophobia and the far right in a country that prides itself on its multiculturalism and tolerance.\u201cCanada sees itself as a nation of immigrants, and people thought that such a thing was impossible here,\u201d Mr. Deparice-Okomba said. \u201cBissonnette\u2019s crime wasn\u2019t just against a community. It was against Canada\u2019s collective vision of itself. We are all wounded.\u201dActing alone, Mr. Bissonnette also raised a difficult question: How did a mousy and soft-spoken chess-obsessed student from a middle class family become a killer?In the month before his rampage, he trawled the internet 819 times for posts related to Mr. Trump, reading his Twitter feed daily and homing in on the American president\u2019s travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries. He kept a cache of guns underneath his bed at his parents\u2019 house. Among his only friends was his twin brother, Mathieu.Mr. Bissonnette told investigators he wished he had killed more people, and had wanted to protect his family from Islamic terrorists.\u201cI was, like, sure that they were going to come and kill my parents also, and my family,\u201d he said in a video of a prison interrogation played in court.During the hearing, Mr. Bissonnette was handcuffed and his tiny frame was covered in a baggy sweatshirt. He fluctuated between stony silence and tears from inside a glass enclosure, flanked by two police officers.But when the judge called his parents \u201ccollateral victims\u201d of the attack, he sobbed.\u201cI\u2019m sick of this,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve never hurt anyone.\u201dExperts on radicalization said that in Quebec, a French-speaking province surrounded by an English-speaking majority, the anti-immigrant far right offered fertile and perilous ground for psychologically unstable youths like Mr. Bissonnette seeking a sense of identity and a scapegoat.When he started the center in 2015, he said it dealt with 17 cases of youths in the province radicalized by the far right. Last year, the center had 154 such cases, he noted, compared with 126 cases of youths radicalized by Muslim extremism.\u201cYouths here typically don\u2019t get radicalized because they feel discriminated against since Canada is such an inclusive society,\u201d he said. \u201cRather, they get radicalized due to ideological convictions. They feel they must do something to prevent catastrophe.\u201dThe internet also appears to have provided Mr. Bissonnette with both a forum and a pretext to vent his rage.Fran\u00e7ois Deschamps, who ran a web page raising money for Syrian refugees, said Mr. Bissonnette had spent months trolling the group\u2019s Facebook page.\u201cHe liked to express views that were ultraconservative, racist and anti-Muslim,\u201d he said, \u201cHe would also go to event pages of feminist groups and write \u2018FemiNazis.\u2019 \u201dMr. Bissonnette also browsed websites linked to the white nationalist Richard Spencer, the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, and Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine African-Americans at a South Carolina church.The hearing raised the thorny question of whether bullying \u2014 and society\u2019s failure to prevent it \u2014 had pushed Mr. Bissonnette on his deadly course.\u201cAlexandre developed nervous reflexes, reflexes of fear,\u201d she said. \u201cAlexandre was not a monster.\u201d\u00c9ric Debroise, who led a political discussion group at the left-leaning Universit\u00e9 Laval, recalled that Mr. Bissonnette arrived for the first get-together at a bar wearing a shirt and tie when everyone else was in T-shirts and jeans.When he immediately brought up the National Front and Marine Le Pen\u2019s immigration policies, Mr. Debroise said he cut him off, and he sulked in silence.Consumed by anxiety and depression, Mr. Bissonnette told police he contemplated suicide at 16. He developed an alcohol problem. He wanted to become a pilot but got a job at a call center instead.Six weeks before the mosque attack, Mr. Bissonnette told Mr. Lamontagne he went to a Quebec City shopping center to kill people and himself, but couldn\u2019t go through with it.\u201cHe had fantasies to do something big so that people would not laugh at him after his death, so that people would remember him,\u201d Mr. Lamontagne said.At the Quebec mosque, its windows still pocked with bullet holes, the Muslim community is still struggling to come to terms with the attack and their fear and grief.He blamed far-right groups and anti-immigrant \u201ctrash radio\u201d hosts for creating a \u201ctoxic climate.\u201dAmir Belkacemi, the son of Khaled Belkacemi, said his father had come to Canada from Algeria in the 1990s to escape terrorism, only to become ensnared by violence here. Still, he said he had no intention of leaving the place he calls home.\u201cQuebec didn\u2019t create the monster Alexandre Bissonnette,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Islamophobia here gave him his motive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Google Feeds Cats, Owl Lovers Cry Foul ", "Date": "2018-05-26", "News": "Supported byDeath strikes hard at Shoreline. The remains of an owl \u2014 a leg, a wing, a few scattered feathers \u2014 were found here in 2015, shortly after a feral cat was seen stalking it. Another owl was discovered dead near its burrow, and a third disappeared that year and was presumed killed. That was fully half the owls nesting in the park.Environmentalists have been alarmed for a long time about the number of cats at Shoreline, but they could not determine where they were coming from. Gradually, public records requests and old-fashioned snooping uncovered a trail. It led southwest from the sun-burnished slopes of the park, up Permanente Creek and into the ever-expanding empire of Google.Google never set out to threaten biodiversity in its front yard, of course. Like so many stories these days about Big Tech, this is a tale about how attempts to do good often produce unexpected consequences, and how even smart people (especially, perhaps, smart people) can be reluctant to rethink their convictions.Google is famous for feeding its employees well, and the cats are no different. Every night, all night, dinner is served from cat-feeding stations. The cat community calls this approach \u201ccolony care.\u201d\u201cNeutering and colony care,\u201d GCat Rescue maintains, \u201calso stop nuisance behaviors like fighting, screaming, spraying, roaming, hunting, etc.\u201d The cats that are released are implanted with tracking chips, and an ear is notched so they can be identified. GCat\u2019s website says it has placed 148 cats for adoption. It does not say how many have been released around the company\u2019s campus.\u201cCats that are fed still hunt,\u201d said Mr. Longcore, assistant professor of architecture, spatial sciences and biological sciences at the University of Southern California. \u201cEven neutered cats and spayed cats hunt.\u201d He added, \u201cIf you have an outdoor cat sanctuary, you can expect there to be consequences to the native wildlife.\u201dEmails to GCat Rescue at meow@google.com were not answered. A Google spokeswoman said the GCat group was fewer than 10 people but otherwise declined to discuss it.Environmental groups said Google was generally an excellent partner and had made aggressive efforts to support the burrowing owls at Moffett Field, its leased property a few miles south of the Googleplex, but was consistently unhelpful on the cat issue.\u201cThey told us it was something their employees were doing and they couldn\u2019t interfere,\u201d said Eileen McLaughlin, a board member with a group trying to protect and expand the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. She and the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society asked Google to remove the cat feeding stations in 2012.Cats have stalked birds forever, but in Shoreline Park a final victory is at hand. The number of cat sightings there last year was 318, according to the City of Mountain View\u2019s official count. And 2017 was the first time in 20 years of record-keeping that no owl fledglings were observed in the park. As recently as 2011, there were 10.\u201cWe lose the owls, we lose something else next, and then something else,\u201d Ms. McLaughlin said. \u201cWe need biodiversity.\u201dGoogle is far from the only company with a cat colony. If employees are not providing the food, cat lovers from the community take up the task.\u201cIt\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Shani Kleinhaus, an environmental advocate with the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society. \u201cMany of the avian species around the Bay breed on or close to the ground, and the cats prey on them at their most vulnerable moments \u2014 sitting on their eggs or caring for their young.\u201dSome tech companies have changed their approach. Facebook, whose nearby campus abuts a marsh with endangered species, stopped allowing cat feeding several years ago. Intuit, which like Google borders Shoreline, said it has no employee cat programs.Johanna van de Woestijne, a retired medical researcher, began taking a midmorning spin through Shoreline Park a decade ago, first on foot and then on her bicycle. \u201cWhen I see something worth photographing, usually birds, I jump off and grab my camera,\u201d she said. Soon Ms. van de Woestijne was seeing a lot of cats, and photographed those, too. She became passionate about the issue and filed a documents request from the city, but it didn\u2019t reveal much.Ms. McLaughlin recently offered a tour of the sprawling Google campus from a cat\u2019s point of view. In a patch of trash-strewn woods next to a parking lot, there was a worn but elaborate feeding station, with straw beds for sleepy cats. A sign identified it as a GCat venture.A feeding station on the other side of campus was on the edge of Shoreline, next to a designated owl nesting area. A third station, hidden in the underbrush, was mere feet from a park entrance for walkers and bikers. A fourth station was in a parking lot.Late last year, Ms. McLaughlin submitted a public records request to Mountain View. Unlike earlier requests, this one was revelatory.It showed city employees discussing how they were trapping Google-chipped cats in the park. The city\u2019s wildlife preservation biologist said he was worried about the cats\u2019 \u201csignificant impacts\u201d on protected species, \u201cespecially burrowing owls.\u201d One of the cats was trapped, turned over to the Silicon Valley Animal Control Authority, released to Google, trapped again in the park and released again to Google. Last August, it was found dead in the park.Janet Alexander, a spokeswoman for the animal control group, said, \u201cGoogle understands the cats are not supposed to cross the line into the park.\u201dThe cats seem to have a different understanding.One recent evening, as dusk yielded to darkness, a cat came up the path from Google. It was heading straight into the owls\u2019 domain.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where Did Ireland Go? Abortion Vote Stuns Those on Both Sides", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBLIN \u2014 Some were joyous. Others were devastated. But most of all, in the hours after Irish voters swept away a ban on abortion, many were simply astonished.However they felt about the result of the referendum, they were witnessing, they knew, the culmination of a fundamental shift in Irish society \u2014 and one that has come about with stunning speed.In a remarkably compact span of time, the country has gone from being a bastion of social conservatism in the West to a place that wholeheartedly embraces positions that would have been unthinkable just a generation ago.The culture of silence and deference to religious authority that long dominated Ireland is gone. The country that has emerged is an unlikely leader of liberal values.\u201cIreland has changed 180 degrees on everything,\u201d said Adam Tyrrell, 24, struggling to take it all in as he smoked a cigarette outside a pub and watched the street fill up with crowds of cheering yes supporters after the results were announced.The nation of 4.8 million people has experienced some of the fastest social and economic change in the world. In a matter of 30 years, Ireland has gone from being a poor and deeply Roman Catholic country to one that is seeing high growth rates and has installed a gay man as prime minister.Long associated with exporting cheap labor, it has accepted a sizable number of immigrants and is home to foreign tech companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook.In 2015, in another popular vote, Ireland approved same-sex marriage by a landslide.\u201cIreland has gone from criminalizing gays, having just one television channel and priests running the show, to now a liberal, European society,\u201d said Mark Neiland, a business owner in his 60s.When he was growing up, Mr. Neiland recalled, Irish families had to decide between cooking dinner on the stove or watching television because electricity was scarce. \u201cIreland was a really poor country,\u201d he said.When Mr. Neiland graduated from high school, he said, every classmate, including him, left for the United States, Canada or Australia.\u201cI would never think of leaving this place for America now,\u201d he said.While the landslide result of the abortion referendum may have surprised much of the world, many Irish were less shocked. They have seen the changes in the country building over time.Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who is half Indian, spoke of a \u201cquiet revolution that has been taking place in Ireland over the last couple of decades.\u201dIreland\u2019s impoverished past, as well as the outsize role of the Catholic Church, had set it apart from much of the rest of Europe. Many saw the referendum as the final step in aligning the country with the rest of the continent.The vote, said Mr. Tyrrell, \u201ccements us as a progressive nation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to change the optics of how people view us after these two landslide victories,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of Ireland.\u201dAlan Barrett, director of the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin, said the results of the abortion referendum indicated a \u201cconvergence with European norms.\u201d\u201cIf you take the standard mainstream views in continental Europe, Ireland was the outlier, and it was always economically behind Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the Catholic Church being moved aside, you\u2019ve got the Irish accumulating their values and views the same way that the French, the Germans or the British get theirs.\u201dThere are many factors behind Ireland\u2019s dramatic makeover. The most dominant reason is the collapse of the Catholic Church\u2019s influence in most spheres of Irish life. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to know that Ireland has been secularizing for a long time,\u201d said Diane Negra, a professor of cultural studies at University College Dublin.The credibility of the church has been battered by a string of scandals, some involving pedophile priests and the cover-up of their crimes.Another major factor driving the change: an economic transformation.As recently as the 1980s, Ireland was a very different place.With a weak economy in that decade, many young Irish left the country to look for jobs abroad, leaving behind an older, more conservative population that was loyal to the church. It was during this period that Ireland voted for restrictive rules on abortion and marriage.In 1983, Ireland voted in favor of the Eighth Amendment in the Constitution, which effectively banned abortion \u2014 the amendment that the Irish voted to repeal on Friday. Three years later, the Irish rejected a proposed amendment to remove a ban on divorce.Attitudes shifted notably in the 1990s with the first revelations of the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, and the beginning of an economic boom.From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, Ireland was proclaimed the \u201cCeltic Tiger.\u201d The decade of prosperity attracted multinationals, increased living standards and brought back Irish expatriates who carried with them new ideas and values.The economy soured for a few years, but then recovered. Last year, Ireland posted a 7.8 percent growth rate, the highest in the European Union \u2014 though many Irish say that inequality has also risen.Ireland\u2019s decision to make secondary schools free improved education, and the introduction of contraception significantly reduced the number of children per family. That helped more women enter the paid work force.Anthony Fannin, 70, a retired engineer, said the economic boom \u201cgave self-confidence to the Irish that they had lacked.\u201d\u201cThey felt equal to the rest of the world, that they could get a share of the luxuries of life,\u201d he said.Pointing to the church sex abuse scandals, he said, Ireland\u2019s changing fortunes also meant that \u201cinstead of people bowing their heads whenever a priest passed by, they could actually stand up and say, \u2018Hang on, Father, what happened back then?\u2019\u201dLuke Hussey, 25, who comes from a working-class family, said his family had jumped into the middle class almost overnight during the boom, buying a car and going on vacations to Spain.\u201cIt was weird, almost perverse that we were now a middle-class family,\u201d he said.It was during the boom years, in 1993, that Ireland decriminalized homosexuality. Two years later, the country finally voted to allow divorce.The referendum on abortion, many Irish said, was the final crack in the foundation of the old Ireland.The debate in the days and months before the referendum released, for some, decades of pent-up emotions and anger against the church. Mr. Barrett described it as \u201cnational therapy.\u201d The referendum also forced a national debate on subjects that were long taboo, especially around sex.\u201cIreland had a culture of silence and that\u2019s broken now,\u201d Mr. Tyrrell said.\u201cTo be Irish now means to be open,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re sick of being quiet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The governor strongly endorsed proposals to expand and strengthen training for school officials, create threat assessment and mental intervention programs, and evaluate entrances and exits to make schools more secure.

Tuesday\u2019s session, which also featured experts in school safety and threat assessment, focused on how to make schools safer.Wednesday\u2019s meeting will feature the Texas State Rifle Association, a nearly century-old organization that is the state affiliate of the National Rifle Association, and a representative from Texas Gun Sense, a gun legislation reform group. It is rare, in Texas, for gun-rights groups and gun-control organizations to sit at the same table together and have a conversation about guns. Usually, the only time their members get close to one another is when they are testifying for or against gun-related legislation at the Capitol.Alice Tripp, legislative director for the Texas State Rifle Association, said she planned to do \u201ca lot of listening\u201d at Wednesday\u2019s session.\u201cI\u2019m listening for what\u2019s missing,\u201d she said, defending Texas\u2019 pro-gun environment. \u201cNo matter what it is, it\u2019s got to work. It can\u2019t be something that sounds good politically.\u201dThursday\u2019s session will include discussions with survivors of the shootings in Santa Fe and Sutherland Springs.\u201cWe want to know first hand from these victims what it is they desire in the form of solutions by the State of Texas,\u201d Mr. Abbott said.Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, one of the participants, has called for arming teachers and possibly retrofitting schools to limit exits and entrances.Mr. Patrick joined Mr. Abbott on Tuesday in celebrating the round-table talks, saying \u201cthere was agreement on almost everything anyone said.\u201d\u201cWhatever it is, protecting our students, protecting the families of Texas is always the No. 1 priority for us,\u201d he added.Democrats have accused the Republican leadership of talking about what to do rather than moving swiftly to pass gun restrictions and new school-safety measures. And they have criticized the fact that this week\u2019s round tables are being held behind closed doors.\u201cEven Donald Trump kept a town hall at the White House open to press following the Parkland shootings,\u201d Manny Garcia, deputy executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, said in a statement, referring to the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead.The mayor and the police chief in Houston, the state\u2019s largest city, have been outspoken in recent days, criticizing the failure of elected officials to act swiftly. The mayor and the chief have not been invited to any of Mr. Abbott\u2019s round tables.The Houston police chief, Art Acevedo, who is also the first vice-president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, posted a comment on Facebook that was praised by gun control advocates, writing that the proper response to the latest mass shooting was not prayers, study and inaction, but \u201cprayers, action and the asking of God\u2019s forgiveness for our inaction.\u201dThe Houston mayor, Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, called on state lawmakers to enact gun-control laws and finance the installation of metal detectors in public schools.Dave Montgomery reported from Austin, and Manny Fernandez reported from Santa Fe, Tex.Advertisement"}

That capped a remarkable 10-month run for the cryptocurrency, which traded below $1,150 on Feb. 22, 2017.Since mid-December, the price of bitcoin has retreated. It bottomed out below $6,000 in early February and is currently down more 50 percent from its high.The researchers write:\u201cThe advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics.\u201d\u201cThis one-sided speculative demand came to an end when the futures for bitcoin started trading on the CME on December 17. Although the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) had opened a futures market a week earlier on December 10, trading was thin until the CME joined the market. Indeed, the average daily trading volume the month after the CME issued futures was approximately six times larger than when only the CBOE offered these derivatives.\u201dShares of Apple have risen nearly 16 percent, including a 1.9 percent gain on Monday, the past six sessions.

The activist hedge fund led by Paul Singer also said it may be \u201cable to substantially improve the proposed price with additional, private diligence.\u201dIn Monday\u2019s letter, Elliott said: \u201cAthenahealth\u2019s potential will never be realized without the kind of operational change that the company seems unable to deliver.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, we are faced now with the stark reality that Athenahealth as a public-company investment, despite all of its promise, has not worked for many years, is not working today and will not work in the future. Given Athenahealth\u2019s potential, this reality is deeply frustrating, but the fact remains that Athenahealth as a public company has not made the changes necessary to enable it to grow as it should and to create the kind of value its shareholders deserve.\u201dElliott said it approached Athenahealth about the company going private in November.Citigroup has a market value of $175 billion, so ValueAct owns about 0.7 percent of Citigroup.\u201cThe letter doesn\u2019t call for any significant strategic changes, though it does suggest the bank could increase its plan to return cash to shareholders to about $50 billion from $40 billion,\u201d The WSJ reports, citing ValueAct\u2019s letter to its investors.Saturday was the day for the \u201cWoodstock of capitalism\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting, and a celebration of Warren Buffett \u2014 and Andrew joined shareholders, analysts and other journalists seeking to ask the Oracle of Omaha about virtually anything.Andrew has more from the meeting: Shareholders applauded a question \u2014 which they rarely do \u2014 that was critical of Berkshire\u2019s ownership of Wells Fargo.

{"Headline": "Hot Grapes and Liver: Outtakes From an Australian Restaurant Critic", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany spots don\u2019t make the cut \u2014 but some are still worth visiting.The restaurants I cover should ideally reveal something greater about Australia: a story that has not been told, an unexamined angle. These are restaurant reviews, but they are also cultural essays, culinary investigations \u2014 snapshots of this country and the people in it. I eat many great meals that don\u2019t quite encapsulate a particular Australian experience or phenomenon enough to warrant a full column. (I\u2019ve had some pretty mediocre food as well, but that\u2019s for another day.) Yet weeks or months later, I find myself thinking about a dish, a meal, a place. It seems a waste to keep these to myself, the fantastic dishes and wonderful little finds. Here are four of those experiences that have stuck with me.Victoria Parade, in Melbourne, is known for its pho houses, but another noodle lured me to this part of town. Oneyada Thai Cafe is an adorably colorful little shopfront, serving Thai breakfast and lunch. It opened in 2016 as an offshoot of the nearby and well-known Jinda Thai, owned by the Tanapat family. The breakfast dishes here are great, but it is their khao soi gai that haunts me. The northern Thai egg noodle curry soup is one of those dishes that can easily become an obsession, and it is hard to find in Australia at all, let alone a version this good. Oneyada\u2019s is just about perfect: creamy coconut curry with a warming spice kick, chewy egg noodles, hunks of on-the-bone chicken pieces, fistfuls of chopped scallions and cilantro and red onion and fried shallots. The fresh crunch of all those different kinds of oniony bits and herbs cuts through the rich broth so beautifully it makes me a little emotional. 239 Victoria Street (Ferguson Street); Abbotsford, Victoria; 03 9041 1525This restaurant reminded me of lots of places, none of them having much in common with its home in Gold Coast, Queensland.Lupo\u2019s location, in the crook of a strip mall behind a building on a highway, conjures Los Angeles. Its design has the feeling of a European cafe dropped into the middle of the tropics: lace curtains, burnished walls, copper bar, fans rotating warm ocean air. The soundtrack was awesome: Otis Redding leading into \u201cSandinista!\u201d by the Clash. The menu looked like a lot of menus at a lot of new Australian restaurants these days \u2014 everyone seems to have a kingfish ceviche and a steak (or lamb, or emu) tartare.But Lupo excels at turning those tropes on their head, particularly the steak tartare. Here it is served as a steak sandwich, but the bread is in the form of thin, intensely crispy crostini, which is then doused in very good Spanish paprika.I\u2019m not talking about a sprinkle here, I mean a literal pile of paprika. It sounds concerning, but it is an overkill that works \u2014 and that I\u2019m still thinking about months later. All of it, that is, except one dish: a jumble of chicken livers cooked simply and perfectly in a piquant vinegar molasses combination and tossed with fat green and red grapes.The grapes had obviously seen a hint of the hot pan, but not so much that they lost their structural, juicy integrity. The richness of the pink livers with the bawdy fruit is one of those combinations that seems so elemental I am surprised this is my first grape-liver encounter. Perhaps \u201chot grapes and liver\u201d doesn\u2019t sound particularly appealing. But believe me, hot grapes and liver is awesome. Recently opened in Sydney, Rey\u2019s Place is an instantly likable restaurant, for many reasons. It\u2019s simply a nice place to eat and drink, wedged into a very old, very narrow brick building with a tiny bar, a tiny kitchen and a few tables on two levels.The owner, Jonathan Bayad, works the floor \u2014 usually by himself \u2014 and is an immensely friendly host. The modern Filipino food being served is exciting for Sydney and Australia. The genre \u201cmodern Filipino\u201d did not exist here before Rey\u2019s Place opened. But what stayed with me following my visit to Rey\u2019s Place was the cocktails. This is perhaps unsurprising, given Mr. Bayad\u2019s history as a bar manager. (To handle the food, he has brought on the chef Shaun Oligo.)But Mr. Bayad can also build a tropical dream in a glass with gin (the Thrilla in Manila is like a dairy-less grown-up orange Creamsicle) or tequila (which, paired with apple and fennel for the Fresh Like Baguio City, is refreshing and subtle). Go for the fried chicken wings stuffed with adobo mousse. Stay \u2014 and come back again \u2014 for the cocktails. An earlier version of this article misstated the address for Rey's Place. It is 163 Crown Street, not 123 Crown Street.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fake News Crosses the Rio Grande", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterMEXICO CITY \u2014 Have you heard the \u201cnews\u201d? The Mexican presidential hopeful Ricardo Anaya wants to help the United States build a wall on the Rio Grande. And the campaign of his leftist rival Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is being organized out of authoritarian Venezuela. Meanwhile, Mexico\u2019s first lady, Ang\u00e9lica Rivera, has called Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador a \u201cpobreton,\u201d or pauper.All of those stories are totally false.This flurry of misinformation illustrates the ways in which, in the age of social media, fake news has become a global problem that can affect any political election in any country on the planet.So far, it is hard to discern whether the sea of misinformation is having a significant impact on the Mexican race \u2014 or whether dark forces have aligned to support a particular candidate, as they appeared to in the United States presidential election. The fake news could be coming from several angles.Whatever the impact on polls, the spread of lies stains public debate and causes stress and confusion. A recent false message circulating on the messaging service WhatsApp said public health clinics had run out of medicine. Another fake story claimed that certain people won\u2019t be allowed to vote, so they shouldn\u2019t bother turning out.\u201cThese efforts are doing a good job of showing people what is fake and what is real, which gives some hope,\u201d said the journalist Esteban Illades, author of a book about the spread of fake news. \u201cBut we also need to educate people about news and the media from a young age. We need to undertake a major social effort.\u201dA result is distrust in the government and the news media, while many Mexicans choose to believe what their emotions tell them. In such conditions, it is less that Mexico is entering a post-truth era as it is staying stuck in one. Fake news is yet another obstacle in the way of the many here who are struggling to build an honest and open society.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Industrial Revolutions Are Political Wrecking Balls", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before.Compared with previous industrial revolutions, Schwab continued,the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.First Schwab looked at the bright side:The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.Schwab then turned his attention to the downside. Many \u201cworkers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate,\u201d he said, and the \u201cmiddle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.\u201dIn this modern migration, smartphone maps, global positioning apps, social media and WhatsApp have become essential tools. Migrants depend on them to post real-time updates about routes, arrests, border guard movements and transport, as well as places to stay and prices, all the while keeping in touch with family and friends.Long before this, Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, described the link between immigration and technology in a 2003 paper, \u201cPatterns and Processes of International Migration in the 21st Century\u201d:The same processes of economic globalization that create mobile populations in developing regions, and which generate a demand for their services in global cities, also create links of transportation, communication, as well as politics and culture, to make the international movement of people cheaper, quicker, and easier.There are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses. In politics, however, the emphasis has often been on the negative.With remarkable understatement, Schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences:As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor.The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second. The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations \u2014 a factor of about 200,000 difference \u2014 and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second.In point of fact, the use of robots \u2014 and of other methods of replacing workers with machines \u2014 has been growing in every advanced economy, particularly in Europe.The authors note that \u201cboth technology and trade seem to drive structural changes which are consequential for voting behavior.\u201d\u201cJob losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., said by email:In fact, some of the places where Trump made the biggest gains relative to McCain or Romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs.Hostile voter reaction to automation, according to three scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University \u2014 Carl Benedikt Frey, Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen \u2014 was crucial to Trump\u2019s victory.Support for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. Other things equal, a counterfactual analysis shows that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the Hillary Clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College.Along similar lines, Frank Levy, also an economist at M.I.T., wrote in a December 2017 paper:AI (artificial intelligence) is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical (\u2018mid-skilled\u2019) jobs into lower wage work. The result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off-shored services.On balance, near-term AI will have the greatest effect on blue collar work, clerical work and other mid-skilled occupations. Given globalization\u2019s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term AI and globalization replace many of the same jobs.Take the case of truck drivers. Driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines, and, according to Levy, \u201cthere should be a sizable number of fully automated U.S. port facilities, mines and other industrial facilities\u201d by 2024. With these developments, he estimated, there will be 76,000 fewer truck driving jobs in 2024 than the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently projects.Assessing the full range of employment, West observes thatRobots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drones and the Internet of Things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods. For millions who work in occupations like food service, retail sales and truck driving, machines are replacing their jobs.Levy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace,the stock of robots in the U.S. would be 105,000 higher in 2024 than in 2014. If I conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators, the 105,000 additional robots would result in 210,000 fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in 2024 than otherwise would have been the case.Where do these displaced workers look for a way to make a living? Levy\u2019s answer is: farther down the ladder:AI\u2019s near-term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in a slowly growing number of persons moving from mid-skilled jobs into lower wage workinto such fields as food preparation and serving, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services.For many men, moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to a job in a fast-food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow. (Not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women\u2019s and reproductive rights movements.)Levy points out that the cuts resulting from A.I. and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term, but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers:Job losses will appear as accelerating trends. Over time, trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories. Increased numbers of people will be working side-by-side with robots. When a media story describes an AI-induced layoff in occupation, other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk. These developments will occur against a backdrop of monopoly-like firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook.What is the political significance of the A.I.-driven changes in the work force? They are the grist for the populist mill.Levy writes:A populist politician who campaigned on AI-induced job loss would start with ready-made definitions of the \"people\u201d and the \u201celite\u201d based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the 2016 presidential election. This politician also would have a ready-made example of disrespect: the set of highly educated coastal \u201celites\u201d who make a very good living developing robots to put \u201cthe people\u201d out of work.IT-driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising. Because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth, IT advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial.The favorable view, according to Kurz, masks thedark side: by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power, IT innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth.While operating legally \u2014 indeed with the full support of the legal system \u2014 contemporary corporate technology leaders, including Brin, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs (who died in 2011) and Mark Zuckerberg, accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth. According to Kurz:Once an IT monopoly is established, it endows the company with the advantage of first mover. A combination of associated factors \u2014 additional patents, intellectual-property rights, trade secrets, falling computing and storage costs, and decreasing network user costs \u2014 then enable the company to consolidate market power, raise barriers to competition, and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power. IT networks endow a market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly. Using their market power, such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position, often by purchasing competing firms.According to Kurz, the concentration of economic power, and with it political power, in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences:Monopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades, from near zero in the early 1980s to $2.1 trillion \u2014 equivalent to 23 percent of total US corporate income \u2014 in 2015. During the same period, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by 23 percentage points.The result is a cascading effect causedboth by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor. It has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers, workers, and suppliers. And it has had a profoundly negative impact on lower-skill workers, in particular.The history of automation \u2014 and how the U.S. economy has handled it over the last several decades \u2014 suggests that even if AI is similar to previous waves of automation, that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation.Furman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs:The concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable. The traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience.Instead, Furman contends that the problem lies in \u201cthe process of turnover,\u201d which \u201ccould lead to sustained periods of time with a large fraction of people not working.\u201d In the short run,not all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by AI. Moreover, this \u201cshort run\u201d could last for decades and, in fact, the economy could be in a series of \u201cshort runs\u201d for even longer.A short run that lasts for decades \u2014 or a series of short runs that last even longer \u2014 would seem to warrant grave alarm.Of all the jobs in the UK, a greater proportion of those held by women compared to men are likely to be technically automatable, and women make up a smaller proportion of people in high-skill occupations that are resilient to automation or complemented by technology.Among liberal-leaning economists and public policy experts, there is a loose consensus on what should be done to manage the adverse consequences of both automation and trade.Furman lists some initiatives:expanding education and training so more people have skills that complement and benefit from innovations, increasing the progressivity of the tax system to make sure that everyone shares in the overall benefits of the economy, and expanding institutional support for higher wages, including a higher minimum wage and stronger collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice.Other related proposals include a major increase in the earned-income tax credit, a focus on job-specific training at community colleges, portable pensions, liberalization of occupational licensing and, more controversially, the creation of a universal basic income.These proposals \u2014 some underwhelming or undoable \u2014 find strong support among Democratic elected officials.Still, opposition from Republicans is adamant \u2014 not only do they oppose increased domestic spending, but it appears to be in the political interests of the party to exacerbate the negative consequences of automation and free trade.David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., examined the political consequences in congressional districts hurt by increased trade with China and found a significant increase in the election of very conservative Republicans.Using the same techniques to examine the 2016 election, Autor calculated that if the post-2000 increase in China trade had been half as large as it in fact was, Hillary Clinton would have won majorities in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That would have been enough to make her the victor in the Electoral College, as the accompanying graphic shows. There is also a dose effect.Rather than directly opposing free trade policies, individuals in import-exposed communities tend to target scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities. This drives support for right-wing candidates, as they compete electorally by targeting out-groups.The authors conclude that in areas affected by trade, the scapegoating of immigrants \u201ctakes place across the board and is not limited to manufacturing workers.\u201dIn other words, job losses and plant closings are a political gold mine for the Republican Party, crucial to their victories in House and presidential races and almost certainly in Senate, gubernatorial and state legislative races as well.The determination of the Trump wing of the Republican Party to profiteer on technologically driven economic and cultural upheaval \u2014 and the success of this strategy to date \u2014 suggests that the party will continue on its path. For this reason and many others, it is critically important that Democrats develop a more far-reaching understanding of the disruptive, technologically fueled economic and cultural forces that are now shaping American politics \u2014 if they intend to steer the country in a more constructive direction, that is.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Killed the Kiev Protesters? A 3-D Model Holds the Clues", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "At WarA team of civilian investigators used cellphone videos, autopsy reports and surveillance footage to reconstruct a virtual crime scene.Supported byThe killings took place within a few blocks of Kiev\u2019s Maidan Nezalezhnosti, or \u201cindependence square,\u201d the center of the nationwide protests. Nefertari began collecting and synchronizing snippets of video from the internet and from news broadcasts. The task seemed impossible given that the videos were shot in different places from different angles and filled with irrelevant noise. Only with great patience, by picking out sounds and landmarks, could she begin to assign them time stamps and coordinates and figure out how each related to the others. The most crucial videos showed civilian protesters in helmets and winter jackets facing off against masked riflemen who had taken up barricaded shooting positions. The protesters cowered in groups of five or six behind makeshift shields; one would suddenly tumble to the ground and be carried off by comrades on a stretcher. On the first anniversary of the killings, Nefertari released a 164-minute real-time video on YouTube showing the standoff from up to nine simultaneous points of view. Within the first month of being posted, it was watched more than 270,000 times.By the third week of February, protesters had spent months living in a tent city in the heart of Kiev. They built kitchens and brought portable toilets to the encampment on the central square. Their purpose was to challenge Yanukovych\u2019s rule and to demand reforms: new elections, more freedom to protest and closer ties with the European Union.The violence came to a head on Feb. 20, during one of the bloodiest and most controversial hours of European conflict since the end of the Cold War. Police officers massed around the protesters, who set their barricades on fire and tried to march on Ukraine\u2019s Parliament. Protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails; the police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. A wave of people pushed out of the square and down Instytutska Street. Defending themselves with helmets and homemade shields, the protesters were met by barricaded riflemen from the Berkut, an elite police force loyal to Yanukovych. By the end of the day, dozens of bodies lay in the streets.Almost immediately, a disinformation campaign began on social media to try to reframe the violence. Reporting by The Washington Post has attributed the effort to the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military-intelligence agency. On Facebook and the Russian social-media site VKontakte, G.R.U. operatives created fake accounts, which characterized the Maidan uprising as a \u201ccoup\u201d by \u201carmed nationalists.\u201d The G.R.U. also set up online groups that promoted Crimea\u2019s secession from Ukraine. The effort, which also used paid Facebook ads, presaged Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election in the United States.Two days after the shootings, Yanukovych fled to Russia. Over the next few weeks, Ukraine\u2019s Parliament held new elections. Pro-Western parties won at the polls and would later enter into a trade agreement with the European Union. President Vladimir Putin of Russia claimed that what had just taken place amounted to a coup. He seized Crimea and made inroads into Ukraine\u2019s eastern provinces. In April, prosecutors in Kiev opened an investigation into the Feb. 20 killings, searching for someone to hold responsible for the protesters\u2019 deaths. Prosecutors hoped to bring charges against the unit of the Berkut that appeared to have taken up shooting positions behind a barricade on Instytutska Street. Most of the unit\u2019s members had fled to Russia. Ukrainian prosecutors tried to extradite them; the Russian government ignored the request.The remaining five members of the Berkut unit awaited trial in a Kiev prison. Their Kalashnikov assault rifles and pump-action shotguns were discovered at the bottom of a nearby lake, sawed into pieces. In addition to murder, the officers were accused of terrorism: using violence to intimidate the population. Because the officers worked as an organized unit, it wasn\u2019t necessary to prove which of them fired the lethal shots. \u201cWe defend the government elected by the people,\u201d one officer told a German TV station. \u201cNone of our commands were illegal,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe just did our job.\u201d All five pleaded not guilty. The bullets that killed many of the protesters had long since disappeared, and without them it would be impossible to work backward from the bodies to the individual rifles. The prosecutors would have to find another way.\u201cThe problem was how to take multiple vantage points and put them together into a coherent analysis,\u201d he said. \u201cMaidan was the same problem set, but on steroids.\u201dThe quantity of raw footage amassed by Nefertari was overwhelming, running into the thousands of hours. The problem was how to fuse it into a whole that would persuade the judges and stand up to cross-examination. Prosecutors would have to do more than cherry-pick a few convincing moments. Their theory of the case would have to be strong enough to survive every alternative scenario, from the mysterious rooftop snipers to the possibility that protesters were killed by friendly fire. Samuels worked out the basics of a collaboration with Dykan and Yatsenko over a picnic table. He planned to copy their data onto his laptop but wound up having to buy an external hard drive when he saw how much they had.Multiple cameras recorded the deaths of three protesters whose families Dykan and Yatsenko were representing, who were selected for the video presentation. One of the dead was Ihor Dmytriv, a 30-year-old lawyer who arrived at the protest on Feb. 19. He was crouching behind a makeshift shield when a bullet pierced it and entered his chest. He fell to the ground, rolling on his back and clutching his knee. A tall construction worker in camouflage fatigues rushed forward to help Dmytriv. He was Andriy Dyhdalovych, a 40-year-old longtime protester who had marched with Ukrainian veterans of the Afghanistan campaign. He was shot in the shoulder and died that day in the street. The third victim was Yuriy Parashchuk, who was 47. He was shot about 15 minutes later on the same street, in the front of the head. None of the three men were armed.When a bullet breaks the sound barrier, it produces a small sonic boom that registers as an audible crack. For people positioned downrange, the crack arrives a fraction of a second before the thump or blast of the weapon actually firing. In the Maidan case, SITU enlisted a ballistics expert to measure the time that elapsed between the cracks and the thumps. The time difference yielded a maximum and minimum distance between the shooter and the camera, which SITU rendered as a doughnut-shaped \u201carea of interest.\u201dUsing the video archive, SITU positioned the victims\u2019 bodies within the virtual space of the point cloud. Autopsy reports noted the locations of entry and exit wounds, which were joined by thin red lines and extended, with a five-degree margin of error, forward into space. Viewed from overhead, these five-degree cones trim the doughnut-shaped area of interest down into a narrow segment. In the first two cases, the segments overlapped with a position that the Berkut were defending behind a barricade; in the third, the segment overlapped with a position behind a line of supply trucks. A crucial piece of additional footage obtained by Nefertari arrived in SITU\u2019s office more than a year into the case. Taken from a surveillance camera at the Ukrainian National Bank, it clearly shows the Berkut positioned behind their front line. In all three cases, individual officers can be seen aiming and firing their rifles during the moments leading to the victims\u2019 deaths.\u201cThe criminal court has never admitted evidence of such technological complexity,\u201d Yatsenko told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a milestone.\u201d There are more than 100 witnesses left to interview in the Feb. 20 case. It could be more than a year before the court reaches a verdict. Nefertari, meanwhile, continues to work on her own project, an even more ambitious reconstruction of the entire Maidan uprising, with all the victims included. \u201cI want people in the future to know the truth,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want rumor turned into facts.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included an erroneous detail about the laser scanning of Instytutska Street. The scanning was independently organized by Evelyn Nefertari; it was not done by Nefertari at the behest of SITU.Mattathias Schwartz is a contributing writer for the magazine who lives in Washington. He last wrote about email theft as a political weapon.videoAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 What will Apple do with all that cash?\u2022 What happens after the imported metal tariff delay?\u2022 Why C.E.O.s might need to be more outspoken on social issues.\u2022 How the T-Mobile C.E.O.\u2019s success might be a mixed blessing.That\u2019s the sum Apple intends to spend on buying back its own stock. It sounds like a lot, but Apple has a huge stock market value and investors have grown accustomed to it repurchasing a large portion of its stock.Here\u2019s how it stacks up.If Apple spent $100 billion on its shares at the current stock price, it would buy back 571 million shares, equivalent to 11 percent of the company\u2019s total shares outstanding.Would investors be impressed with an 11 percent reduction? It depends on how quickly Apple carries it out. In the last five years, Apple\u2019s shares outstanding have fallen by 24 percent. In theory, then, if Apple completed the latest program in two years, it would be more or less on track with that five-year period.But Apple may move more quickly. In the three months through the end of March, Apple bought back $23.5 billion of shares, an unusually large sum by the company\u2019s standards. Executives are sometimes reluctant to repurchase shares if they look overvalued. And Apple\u2019s C.F.O., Luca Maestri, said on a conference call Tuesday that Apple wanted its buybacks to be \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201cefficient.\u201d But he also said he wanted them to be \u201cfast.\u201d- Peter EavisInvestors expected Apple to announce a large share repurchase program heading into this quarter\u2019s earnings, and the iPhone maker didn\u2019t disappoint. Apple announced a new $100 billion buyback program.The coffers of corporate America are straining under the weight of spare cash. And none more than Apple. Apple was forced to pay taxes on more than $250 billion held overseas as part of the tax overhaul President Trump signed into law late last year.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Apple reported a net income of $13.82 billion for its fiscal second quarter, up 25 percent from a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $2.73, above analysts expectations of $2.67 per share.\u2022 Revenue increased 16 percent to $61.1 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected sales of 60.82 billion.\u2022 Revenue from its services business hit a record of $9.2 billion.\u2022 Apple sold 52.2 million iPhones in the quarter, up 2.9 percent from a year ago.\u2022 Revenue from iPhone sales increased 14 percent from a year ago to $38.03 billion.\u2022 Apple\u2019s cash pile shrank to $267.2 billion from $285.1 billion at the end of its fiscal first quarter.Snap\u2019s recent redesign of its Snapchat app didn\u2019t go over well with its users. Now it is impacting its results.Nellie Bowles of the NYT writes:Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, cited Snapchat\u2019s redesign as a major factor for the disappointing performance.\u201cA change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,\u201d he said, referring later to \u201cheadwinds from the redesign.\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s decision on Monday to hold off on imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on a number of countries came as the United States is engaged in a separate trade battle with China and is negotiating changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.From the time the tariffs on steel and aluminum were announced in late February, they seemed the least promising part of Mr. Trump\u2019s combative trade policy. Not only were the measures directed in part at allies, the European Union and Canada among them, the administration convinced few with their argument that imports of the two metals were threatening national security.And when announcing the tariffs, the Trump administration immediately granted temporary exemptions to certain countries. The move suggested loopholes and concessions might be available, an impression that will likely persist after Mr. Trump on Monday extended negotiations with Mexico, Canada and the European Union for 30 days.The new deadline may help push along Nafta negotiations with Mexico and Canada, but the European Union is becoming a big problem for Mr. Trump\u2019s trade agenda. The bloc has gained another reprieve from the steel and aluminum tariffs and apparently has given up nothing.And the European Union\u2019s stance has hurt Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs strategy in another crucial way. The tariffs were said to be a cudgel to persuade allies to back the United States in its trade actions against China. The European Union, which shares some of the United States\u2019 frustrations with China\u2019s trade practices, may eventually back Mr. Trump against China. But the longer the tensions between the European Union and the United States persist, the less likely it is that they align.\u2014 Peter EavisAnd the delay poses a risk, per Ana Swanson of the NYT:It could fuel criticism that Mr. Trump is more bark than bite and increase the pressure on the White House to squeeze concessions from other nations.\u201cThis is an example of the kind of control we think you should have,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s something privacy advocates have been asking for \u2014 and we will work with them to make sure we get it right.\u201dWaiting to be interviewed for the British channel ITV News, Mr. Coupe, presumably unaware that the cameras were rolling, undercut the official line with an impromptu performance.\u201cWe\u2019re in the money. The sky is sunny. Let\u2019s lend it, spend it, send it rolling along.\u201dThe reaction on Twitter was predictably acerbic.Company chiefs increasingly wade into political issues like gun control and climate change. But a poll suggests they may not be moving fast enough.\u2022 64 percent say C.E.O.s should lead change rather than waiting for government action.\u2022 56 percent \u201chave no respect for C.E.O.s who remain silent on important issues.\u201d\u2022 All age groups expect C.E.O. to be personally visible in explaining a company\u2019s purpose and vision.The independence and protection of its users\u2019 data is a core tenet of WhatsApp that Koum and his co-founder, Brian Acton, promised to preserve when they sold their tiny start-up to Facebook. It doubled down on its pledge by adding encryption in 2016.Before joining the Trump administration as communications director, he quit the investment firm, having struck a deal to sell it to HNA of China. But the White House job lasted 10 days, and now the deal with HNA is off, too, so he\u2019ll come back as co-managing partner.More from Brooks Barnes of the NYT:Jeannie Suk Gersen, a professor at Harvard Law School who specializes in gender and sexual harassment issues, said Ms. Judd\u2019s complaint is notable because it \u201cspeaks to the fact that this is not just a sexual issue \u2014 that, beyond physical and emotional harm, it also involves economic harm.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Populists Get a Green Light to Govern, in New Threat to Europe", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 The populist parties that won Italy\u2019s elections two months ago by demonizing the political establishment, the European Union and illegal migrants in often vulgar terms were granted the go-ahead on Wednesday to form a government, crystallizing some of the biggest fears of Europe\u2019s leaders, who were already bracing for turbulence.The rapid ascent of populists in Italy \u2014 the birthplace of Fascism, a founding member of the European Union, and the bloc\u2019s fourth-largest economy \u2014 shattered the nation\u2019s decades-old party system.It also gave fresh energy to the nationalist impulses tugging at the Continent and moved the greatest threat to the European Union\u2019s cohesion from newer member states on the periphery, such as Hungary and Poland, to its very core.Critics assert that he will be but a pawn of the populist parties behind him: the Five Star Movement, a web-based protest party untested at a national level; and the League, a hard-right party that campaigned on a stridently Italians-first platform.Mr. Conte promised \u201ca government of change\u201d that would \u201csafeguard the interests of Italians\u201d after emerging from a nearly two-hour meeting with the president at the Quirinal Palace and greeting a throng of reporters.Some analysts agreed, but less ebulliently. \u201cThe wave of populists and anti-establishment forces is still on, and this will continue for the foreseeable future across Europe,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, a political analyst and co-president of Teneo Intelligence.Yet in Italy the sudden ascent of the populists to power was all but unforeseen even four years ago, when Europe looked to the country as a bastion of liberal values and center-left politics.Mr. Conte will now present his cabinet choices to Mr. Mattarella, who has the power to reject individual ministers and is wary of empowering antagonists to the euro. But such a step is rare, and it is likely that Mr. Mattarella will approve the new government in the coming days.Most worrying to many is the threat the new government\u2019s agenda could pose to Italy\u2019s finances: Analysts said the governing agreement announced last week was a potential budget-buster.Matteo Salvini, 45, leader of the League, wasted no time after Mr. Conte\u2019s remarks to promote a eurosceptic, Paolo Savona, as economy minister.Italy, one of Europe\u2019s largest manufacturers, is also among its slowest growing economies. Italy\u2019s enormous government debt \u2014 about 130 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 makes it too big to bail out. If the Italian economy crashed, the European economy could tank, too.\u201cOur political message is very clear,\u201d said Valdis Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm. \u201cItaly needs to continue to reduce its public debt, which is indeed second highest in the E.U. after Greece.\u201dBut the populist leaders stuck with him, saying the alternative to Mr. Conte was new elections.As Mr. Conte met with the president, Mr. Salvini told reporters on the street that the incoming prime minister would have \u201cfull\u201d autonomy. He also said that for Mr. Conte, like for him, \u201cthe well being of Italian citizens\u201d came before European considerations.Five Star leaders applied pressure to the president to give them a chance at the helm, warning Mr. Mattarella against blocking the will of the people.\u201cItaly has voted the first anti-European, no-Europe government among the countries that founded the European Union,\u201d said Sergio Fabbrini, the director of the School of Government at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. \u201cI see instability, not stability, ahead.\u201dThe document jolted the markets and, perhaps even more important, made Mr. Mattarella nervous. It was quickly amended, and the party leaders moved to assure international observers that things would be fine.Often the populist leaders seemed to be performing for an audience of one. But Mr. Mattarella\u2019s power, absolute during the crisis, would transfer to the new government once its leaders took office.Mr. Fabbrini said that government could move Italy beyond its traditional West European partners and closer to countries like the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland that are increasingly challenging the European Union.\u201cThis is a group that would rather hollow it out from the inside, demanding more power over immigration, control of the border, a more loose stability and growth pact,\u201d Mr. Fabbrini said. \u201cIt\u2019s a more insidious coalition.\u201dUnder a Five Star and League government, Italy would be by far the largest voice of such a group, an unwelcome development for officials in Brussels. But the cold shoulder those leaders gave to Italy\u2019s outgoing center-left government on migration only fueled anti-migrant anger that benefited the populists.As the migrants kept coming, the anti-migrant League grew stronger. The Five Star Movement also took a harder line, though its core message addressed the economic frustration of young Italians, especially those in the economically depressed south.Despite its difficulty governing cities, such as Rome, Five Star has gained electoral strength, in part because its studied vagueness on controversial issues has avoided alienating voters on the left and right.Many Italians are unclear where it stands. Its leaders have questioned the country\u2019s membership in the eurozone, supported it, and recently questioned it again. They say they want Italy to be more balanced in its foreign policy, but have grown closer to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Their position on the dangers of vaccines keeps changing.The alliance\u2019s governing contract was ratified in recent days by the parties\u2019 bases. It includes proposals that critics say have the potential to erode Italy\u2019s representative democracy, such as banning members of Parliament from switching parties, or from dissenting from the party line.The League, a more traditional right-wing party with formal associations with France\u2019s National Front and Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia United Party, started as a northern separatist movement.Sofia Ventura, a professor of political science at the University of Bologna, said the new coalition was a \u201cmixture between ideology and incompetence.\u201dBut Europe\u2019s populists welcomed the new alliance warmly.In an article published on Wednesday in the newspaper Corriere della Sera, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front in France, said that the \u201cEurope of nations is close at hand\u201d and heralded the new government as a harbinger for the collapse of the European Union.Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party who helped lead the campaign for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, has relished the prospect of the Italians giving the Germans a headache.\u201cFirst anti-establishment government in Europe,\u201d he said in an interview, saying more would come. \u201cFirst government built on populism and nationalism as its foundation.\u201dOn Wednesday night, Mr. Conte said he was eager to represent that government at home and abroad. \u201cI offer myself as the defense lawyer of the Italian people,\u201d he said.Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

We will present all the mothers at the table with small gifts. My brother-in-law has a young daughter from his second marriage (he\u2019s on his third). Should we give his new wife a gift? She is stepmother to our niece, but the girl is cared for by her mother. (Full disclosure: We\u2019re still bristling at this wife entering our family through prolonged and secret infidelity.) But we don\u2019t want to make her feel awkward. We\u2019re stumped.ANONYMOUSI\u2019m stumped, too. What started as a sweet dinner invitation turned, on a dime, into meanspirited judgment of other people\u2019s marriages, with (if I am not mistaken) a misogynistic streak of blame placed on your sister-in-law for the infidelity. Maybe give her a light cashmere twin set with a scarlet \u201cA\u201d sewn onto the chest?But if your aim is to celebrate the mothers at the table, we can stop with the acknowledgment that your sister-in-law is stepmother to your niece \u2014 regardless of primary caretaking. If you intend to present gifts to the mothers, include her too. Personally, I\u2019d encourage her in that role. Your niece (and brother-in-law) will be well served by having as many loving adults in their lives as possible.You and I both know, firsthand, that marriage is hard. Sometimes, we even fall down on the job. It\u2019s a crying shame but practically inevitable. Let\u2019s keep our own failures in mind before we pounce on others for theirs. Better to make a supportive call to the second wife, if that\u2019s possible, than to demean the third. There are enough trinkets (and respect) for everyone.I was hanging out at my girlfriend\u2019s apartment when I overheard her new roommate telling someone on the phone that she is having trouble reaching orgasm with her new boyfriend. My girlfriend and I had a similar problem early in our relationship, and the fix was pretty easy. Do you think there\u2019s a not-creepy way for me to speak to the roommate about this \u2014 to help out?JIMSadly, I do not. (But it must be cool hanging out with DJ Khaled\u2019s wife!) When we overhear harmless conversations that we were clearly not meant to hear, the kindest thing is to pretend we didn\u2019t. Here, what you learned about the new roommate might embarrass her. It\u2019s pretty intimate, even on the off chance that you\u2019re becoming fast friends.But I hereby grant an exception for you to report the conversation to your girlfriend. That way, if the roommates get to be tight, or if your girlfriend sees a nonthreatening way to broach the subject, she can jump on it. I appreciate your motives: Good sex is a great thing. But the nicer thing would be to warn the roommate about the apartment\u2019s acoustics the next time you hear her on the phone.My neighbors are home for a few more weeks before they leave for the summer, so I invited them and two other neighbors to a Cinco de Mayo dinner party. A few days after they accepted, and before the party, these occasional neighbors said they couldn\u2019t come, after all, because they were going to have their own dinner for friends of theirs at their place. I feel hurt and dejected, but I have not called them back because I don\u2019t know what to say. Any ideas?ANNYour neighbors may have been raised by wolves. Most people I know have backed out of invitations when something much better came along (and the odds of discovery were low). A friend once canceled on me at the last minute, \u201cfeeling unwell,\u201d only to have her face appear in a crowd shot at a Madonna concert the next day. I get it! I\u2019d rather see Madonna than eat my chicken tagine, too.But to make their own party, on the same night as yours, right next door, is ridiculous. If you are close to these people, say: \u201cI\u2019m sorry you behaved this way. You\u2019ve hurt my feelings.\u201d (It\u2019s hard to imagine reasonable people not reaching this conclusion independently.) But if these are just random folks who live next door part time, take their behavior as a sign of who they are and act accordingly \u2014 with an occasional smile and wave from across the street.Now that I\u2019m in my 20s, my mother and I have grown much closer than we ever were when I was a child. (Weird, right?) I\u2019d like to do something special with her for Mother\u2019s Day. Thoughts?MARY, BROOKLYNNot weird at all! Pretty common, in fact. Get your hands on two tickets to \u201cThree Tall Women,\u201d the Edward Albee play that\u2019s being revived on Broadway. It\u2019s about how we change over time and become almost different people. It\u2019s also the best thing I\u2019ve seen this year. I\u2019ll bet it makes for great dinner conversation, too. Advertisement"}

Convention", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe annual event in Dallas drew about 75,000 members.DALLAS \u2014 The objects themselves \u2014 machined steel barrels, lathed brass casings, cast lead slugs \u2014 are functional and practical, designed for maximum efficiency, be it in shooting targets, animals or human beings. They are more than that though. The guns and weapons parts on display at the N.R.A. convention in Dallas last weekend represent ingrained ideals of this country\u2019s identity, a nation forged an hardened by wars. Firearms were not the most common accessory among the 75,000-odd attendees. That honor went to Old Glory. The flag was emblazoned on T-shirts and caps, incorporated into outfits, printed on backpacks and purses, pinned through lapels, tattooed in skin, and painted on walls, signs and guns. The portion of the country that demands strict gun control often just sees the gun. Another portion sees firearms as indivisible from its very sense of self.\u201cIf you don\u2019t own enough guns to arm a small army, you\u2019re not really a Texan,\u201d said Dean Seiser, who was taking pictures of his companion, Debi Vanover, as she looked down the iron sights of a .50-caliber machine gun replica in the exhibition hall floor.\u201cLet\u2019s get one of these for our front porch!\u201d Mrs. Vanover, 61, said, howling with laughter.There were planned protests outside the convention center that garnered hundreds of R.S.V.P.s on Facebook, but in a state where guns are welcomed virtually anywhere, from churches to colleges, the numbers didn\u2019t meet expectations.In the midday sun on Saturday, a handful of protesters demanding stricter regulation were countered by hundreds of open-carry activists, some with assault rifles slung over their shoulders.

{"Headline": "As Nicaragua Death Toll Grows, Support for Ortega Slips", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANAGUA, Nicaragua \u2014 It has been two weeks since lethal clashes between protesters and pro-government forces erupted in Nicaragua, and the number of deaths is still not clear. But this much is: It keeps climbing.By Friday, the toll of students, counterprotesters, bystanders and police officers who died in five days of student-led demonstrations against President Daniel Ortega\u2019s government had risen to at least 45 and was expected to climb further. In this Central American country of six million people, that tally makes this the deadliest unrest by far since nearly three decades of war ended in 1990.Government agencies tightly controlled by Mr. Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, have vowed to set up truth commissions and investigations. The question of whether anyone ordered the killings is poised to become a major issue in coming peace talks between the government, the Catholic Church, the business sector and the university students. The challenge is the most critical threat to Mr. Ortega\u2019s presidency since he was re-elected in 2007.\u201cHe has two options: dead or alive,\u201d Rosa D\u00edaz said of Mr. Ortega after her 29-year-old son\u2019s dead body turned up at a hospital following a particularly brutal night of protests in the capital, Managua. \u201cBut he has to leave office.\u201dMs. D\u00edaz said the police pressured her to waive the right to an autopsy on her son, Jos\u00e9 Ad\u00e1n Bones, and she agreed because she was grieving and thought she would not be able to afford the forensic exam.The uprising began on April 19, led by university students in Managua protesting against an unpopular social security decree that would have forced workers to pay more and retirees to receive less. The students were already worked up over a fire at a nature reserve that the government had failed to control.The response to the crackdown was intense, and the protests quickly broadened to encompass a much wider set of grievances with the Ortega couple\u2019s rule and the steadily increasing concentration of power in their hands. Even government concessions, including the rescinding of the social security reform, did not quell the unrest.Protesters turned out around the country, blasting the president\u2019s control of the Supreme Court, the National Assembly and the elections council. The violence escalated when the student protests were met not just by the riot police, but also by swarms of young men in white and pink T-shirts declaring their membership in the Sandinista Youth \u2014 a pro-government organization that has been harassing demonstrators and sometimes throwing stones at them. Videos showed the police handing the young men rocks.The vice president\u2019s office, which controls news media access, did not respond to repeated messages seeking comment. But Bayardo Arce, one of the original Sandinista commanders and a top adviser to Mr. Ortega, acknowledged in an interview with Univision that the police \u201clost control\u201d during the protests.Vilma N\u00fa\u00f1ez, formerly a Sandinista, founded the center, which has chronicled abuses by Mr. Ortega\u2019s government. By her tally, 45 people have died so far in the unrest \u2014 24 students, two police officers, a reporter and 18 others.\u201cThey didn\u2019t just use the police here,\u201d she said. \u201cThey used strike forces.\u201d\u201cThe order was definitely to kill,\u201d Ms. N\u00fa\u00f1ez added, \u201cnot to stop the protest.\u201dMs. Murillo, who is also vice president, blamed the students for the bloodshed. She said some people were killed by shotguns fired from inside the Polytechnic University, a focal point for the protesters, and accused the opposition of disseminating \u201cfake news\u201d by exaggerating the number of killings.\u201cThose tiny, petty, mediocre beings, those beings full of hate, still have the nerve to invent dead,\u201d Ms. Murillo said in an address shortly after the unrest erupted, referring to the protesters. \u201cFor those crimes, we demand punishment,\u201d she said.Mr. Ortega was president during the 1980s, when the United States financed a war aimed at ousting him. He agreed to elections in 1990 and lost, but then returned to office in 2007 after he maneuvered changes to an election law that allowed him to take office with less than 50 percent of the vote.Since then, he has faced international condemnation for chipping away at democracy. In 2008, he was accused of orchestrating rampant voter fraud in municipal elections, which gave him control of cities around the country. He stacked the Supreme Court and used that majority to get rid of the constitutional ban on term limits. He used legal ploys to eliminate opposition parties, and took control of most of the country\u2019s television stations. All of this fed the resentment that boiled over into the current uprising.Mr. Ortega\u2019s socialist Sandinista Front party said several members of the Sandinista Youth had died in the unrest. The party defended the police, saying they acted prudently because \u201cthe destruction of the country could not be allowed.\u201dOpposition members fear the killings will become another example of impunity in Central America, where a number of governments have never been held to account for crimes over the past several decades.Now the families of the dead must rely on the police, prosecutors and the judiciary \u2014 all firmly under Mr. Ortega\u2019s control \u2014 to investigate.In an annual report, the Permanent Committee on Human Rights showed photos of prominent law enforcement authorities, including the chief of the Supreme Court, waving the black-and-red Sandinista flag.That, said the group\u2019s leader, Marco Carmona, does not exactly inspire confidence.\u201cWe cannot trust that there will be an objective investigation, a professional investigation, nor can we trust that the judicial authorities are going to be faithful in their application of the law,\u201d said Denis Darce, who runs training projects at Mr. Carmona\u2019s group. \u201cCitizens will be practically defenseless.\u201dMr. Bones, the young man who was killed, lived outside Managua and was visiting relatives in the capital when he went missing for several days. His bullet-riddled body suddenly appeared at a hospital morgue near one of the protest sites, where he apparently got caught in the cross-fire.\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask us any questions about him because they already knew how he died. They knew those shots came from them,\u201d his sister, Migdalia Bones, said of the police. \u201cThen a man at the hospital came up to me and whispered: \u2018Go to the human rights office.\u2019\u201dBecause his body did not appear for days after the protests and his family has not made the trek to Managua to file official complaints with human rights agencies, Mr. Bones\u2019s name does not appear on the official list of the dead that rights groups have compiled.Even as bodies were buried without autopsies, the attorney general\u2019s office held a news conference asking families to file written complaints and present any evidence they had.\u201cThis has been handled in a way that is cruel and perverse,\u201d said Ms. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, the founder of the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights. Next, she said, the government will start rounding up innocent people so authorities can appear to be working on the cases.\u201cNow comes the witch hunt,\u201d she said.The National Assembly, which is controlled by the Sandinista Front party, said it had formed a truth commission. The government Office for the Defense of Human Rights has also created a \u201cvictims committee\u201d to record complaints.On Monday, the government held a \u201cpeace and dialogue\u201d rally to prove it has supporters, too, using the motto of the Sandinista Party to promote peace talks led by the Catholic Church.\u201cWhere are these 63 dead? I have seen like 12 or 15. Let\u2019s say there were 20; I haven\u2019t seen them,\u201d said Leonardo Lo\u00e1isiga, 50, an attendee, referring to one widely cited, unconfirmed death toll. \u201cShow me those 63 dead.\u201dBut the killings have also soured some loyal Sandinistas like Ms. D\u00edaz and the family of 16-year-old Jesner Josu\u00e9 Rivas, who died in the turmoil.\u201cNicaragua is being left without university students because the government of Nicaragua is killing them,\u201d said Norlan Rodr\u00edguez, whose nephew Jesner died a few blocks from a store that was being looted. \u201cI am a Sandinista, and have been so since I was a little kid. But they killed my boy and I will never give those people my vote again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scholars Have Data on Millions of Facebook Users. Who\u2019s Guarding It?", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In July 2014, a team of four Swedish and Polish researchers began using an automated program to better understand what people posted on Facebook.The program, known as a \u201cscraper,\u201d let the researchers log every comment and interaction from 160 public Facebook pages for nearly two years. By May 2016, they had amassed enough information to track how 368 million Facebook members behaved on the social network. It is one of the largest known sets of user data ever assembled from Facebook.For more than a decade, professors, doctoral candidates and researchers from academic institutions around the world have harvested information from Facebook using techniques similar to those of Dr. Erlandsson and his team. They have compiled hundreds of Facebook data sets that captured the behavior of a few thousand to hundreds of millions of individuals, according to interviews with more than a dozen scholars.But while what happened with Mr. Kogan\u2019s Facebook data set is now known, the fate of other information hoards is murkier. In many cases, the data was used for research or scholarly articles. The information was then sometimes left unsecured and stored on open servers that offered access to anyone. Some academics said the data could have been easily copied and sold to marketers or political consulting firms.The potential result is more leakage of Facebook users\u2019 information through academic circles, said Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, a professor of political communication at the University of Oxford who has studied data collection from Facebook.\u201cThe academic world is highly decentralized, and each individual, each institution, has a different way of securing their data,\u201d Dr. Nielsen said. \u201cEven if almost everyone in the academic community is careful and protects the data, you still can end up in a situation where someone is careless or acts in bad faith and sells access. It\u2019s hard to imagine how Facebook stops that from happening.\u201dThe Danish research team did not respond to a request for comment. Petter Bae Brandtzaeg, one of the Norwegian researchers, said he understood concerns about data gathering.The Facebook data was typically amassed through scraper programs that crawled the social network to document what was posted, or through quiz apps that requested access to people\u2019s profiles. The results included users\u2019 locations, interests, political affiliations, Facebook interactions and even music preferences.Once people are identified and their interests and interactions known, they can be targeted with advertising and mobilized for political campaigns or other causes.For years, Facebook had no specific policies about academics\u2019 access to user data, though it had guidelines on working with third parties. While the company has a rule that forbids the use of scrapers, it has not enforced that policy against scholars. And at times, it has assisted researchers with studies.In 2014, though, Facebook began limiting third-party apps, like quizzes, from obtaining users\u2019 information.\u201cWe are taking a hard look at the information apps can use when you connect them to Facebook, as well as other data practices,\u201d Susan Glick, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cThese other data practices include academic research.\u201dBefore social media existed, researchers hoping to study human behavior had to painstakingly seek out groups of people to examine. Social media has let them easily find masses of subjects \u2014 as well as information like their date of birth, gender and interests \u2014 and observe some of their online behavior in real time.\u201cIt was unprecedented,\u201d said Christian Rudder, a founder of OkCupid, a dating and social media site, who published the book \u201cDataclysm\u201d in 2014 on how much people revealed through their online lives.One of the academic community\u2019s earliest known Facebook data sets was collected in 2006 by Harvard University professors. It covered 1,700 people who agreed to have their Facebook information anonymously analyzed. The data was later easily traced back by other academics to Harvard freshmen.In Britain, researchers were doing similar work through different means. In 2007, Michal Kosinski, then deputy director at the Psychometrics Center at the University of Cambridge, worked with a colleague, David Stillwell, to create My Personality, a quiz app that offered to assess people\u2019s personalities in exchange for data about them. It was one of the first times a quiz app had been used for obtaining Facebook members\u2019 information.My Personality has now collected details on more than six million Facebook users, according to the academics who have gathered the data. Many researchers have since copied the quiz app method, including Mr. Kogan.In interviews with The Times, Dr. Kosinski and Dr. Stillwell said they took great care to keep the data they procured anonymous. Dr. Stillwell added that the information had been widely shared with other researchers, but any academic who wished to use it was vetted.Dr. Kosinski acknowledged that data is not a physical item that is easy to control. Once a data set is created, it can be copied and shared until its original source is unknown. He said collection of information from Facebook had become widespread over the years, not only by academics but also by developers, marketers, data analytics companies and others.\u201cWhat Kogan did was wrong. But what Kogan did, many others do on a much larger scale,\u201d Dr. Kosinski said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t get caught.\u201dIn 2014, after Facebook announced it would restrict third-party apps from gaining access to user data, the reach of quiz apps became limited. But scrapers continued to improve and more speedily compile information from the social network.Some scholars said Facebook\u2019s recent privacy changes may have gone too far by also cutting off academics who behaved responsibly.\u201cAcademics would argue that we need access to primary data,\u201d said Dr. Nielsen of Oxford. He said the changes might lead to an asymmetry, with internal Facebook researchers accumulating mounds of data while outside academics would not.\u201cIf that happens, only Facebook will really know very much about how Facebook actually operates and how people act on Facebook,\u201d he said.Dr. Erlandsson said the paper he and his colleagues published last December initially made little splash. But since the Cambridge Analytica revelations, he has seen renewed interest. He said he had been contacted by companies \u2014 he declined to name them \u2014 interested in buying the data on 368 million Facebook members.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in selling,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the truth is, anyone could easily do this themselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Another was filmed on Feb. 11. A third was apparently made the day of the attack. \u201cToday is the day,\u201d he declared.The videos, found on the accused gunman\u2019s cellphone, will bolster prosecutors\u2019 efforts to show that the killings were premeditated. The recordings show a laughing and sometimes giddy young man with what appears to be a cast on his arm and wearing a baseball cap, bragging about the horrific crime he said he was about to commit. Although he also discussed profound loneliness and feelings of worthlessness, the videos showed that he took the time to think out the violence, and was hoping to send his classmates running for their lives.\u201cAll the kids in school will run in fear and hide,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the wrath of my power, they will know who I am.\u201dFred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime, 14, died in the massacre, posted on Facebook that he had read the transcript but had no intention of watching the video.\u201cHe will not achieve his goals,\u201d Mr. Guttenberg wrote. \u201cHe will simply rot and die in prison and even that is too good an outcome.\u201dIn the recordings, the Parkland suspect starts by introducing himself and announcing: \u201cI am going to be the next school shooter of 2018.

(The students were shot inside.)In another recording, the only one in which he sounded as if he were reading from a prepared statement, he reflected on his own life, saying he lived in \u201cseclusion and solitude.\u201d\u201cI am nothing. I am no one, my life is nothing and meaningless,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the power of the A.R., you will know who I am.\u201d He added that he had had enough of being told what to do, and was tired of being called \u201can idiot.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is this is very calculated, premeditated, with no obvious signs of emotion except excitement,\u201d Dr. Langman said. \u201cHe shows no emotional distress.

The outbreak has made dog owners across the city anxious about socializing their dogs and has led some to consider vaccination.We asked veterinarians and experts around town about the flu, and what you can do to prevent it.How worried should I be?What happens when a dog is infected?What should I do if my dog becomes ill?Call your vet. Sick dogs should be given fluids, rest and a proper diet, Dr. de Jong said. As a precaution, if your dog is infected or ill, keep it away from other dogs for at least three weeks.Where did this flu come from?Can dog flu affect humans?No. There have been no known cases of it infecting humans, although H3N2 has occasionally been diagnosed in cats.How can I prevent my dog from getting the flu?There is a vaccine that costs around $80 to $120, but pet owners should discuss with their veterinarian whether it\u2019s necessary, Dr. Slade said. \u201cIf possible, you may wish to forgo exposure to large dog populations \u2014 not getting it groomed until this blows over, or speaking to your dog walker, kennel or day care to see what safeguards they\u2019ve instated.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Our weather is on the mend.Take an extra-long walk with your pup today.

His son, Washington, filled his shoes as project engineer, and when Washington fell ill, his wife, Emily, took the lead.Tens of thousands of people traveled to New York by train or boat for the opening ceremony, the streets teemed with merrymakers and enough American flags went up to make it feel like a holiday.\u201cThe housetops and upper windows of the buildings almost as far as the eye could reach were black with eager sightseers, many of whom made use of opera-glasses and small telescopes to aid in getting a good view of the parade.\u201dOn opening day, Ms. Roebling became the first person to cross the Brooklyn Bridge \u2014 rooster in hand, as the story goes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Ancient Horse Is Unearthed in a Utah Backyard", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPaleontologists recently determined that a skeleton discovered during a landscaping project belonged to a horse from the Pleistocene Era.The horse had arthritis when it died. It is possible, too, that it had bone cancer in one ankle.That can happen to any horse once it gets to be a certain age. This one is nearly 16,000 years old.Laura Hill said she and her husband, Bridger, uncovered the skeleton last September, but didn\u2019t think much of it at first. They wondered if it was a cow; Lehi is about 15 miles from Provo and was once mostly farmland that hugged the edges of nearby Utah Lake. She consulted a neighbor, a geology professor at Brigham Young University, who examined the bones, and guessed they were from a horse from the Pleistocene Era.\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cThis is something we did not expect.\u201d\u201cShe came in and said, \u201cI found a skeleton in the backyard and I don\u2019t know what to do,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hunter recalled. \u201cI replied, \u2018I do.\u2019\u201d Last week he and a team from the museum\u2019s lab, where they study dinosaur fossils, went to her home.The skeleton was missing its head, but was otherwise intact. Mr. Hunter estimated the horse to be the size of a Shetland pony; it was found lying on its left side, with all four legs tucked near its torso. Parts of the skeleton were damaged from exposure to weather. Curious onlookers had picked at the ribs and other bones.Mr. Hunter said he and his team visited the site at the Hill home for two days last week to excavate the remains. The bones were uncovered in a sandbank seven feet below the surface. \u201cThis is not uncommon,\u201d the paleontologist said. Still, there was the question of what happened to the head.He broadened the search to 50 feet beyond the original site. In the expanded area the group found bone fragments, molars and small pieces of the skull. Mystery solved: The skull had been shattered and moved when the landscaper cleared the land.Mr. Hunter also hopes to pin down the horse\u2019s age with greater precision. The current estimate of 14,000 to 16,000 years is the team\u2019s best guess until it can be studied further. Once the skeleton is reassembled, Mr. Hunter said, he would like it to become a permanent exhibit at the Museum of Ancient Life. Mr. MacPhee of the American Museum of Natural History concurred.\u201cIt\u2019s important that it ends up in an institution somewhere,\u201d he said.Ms. Hill said she and her husband were not sure what they were going to do yet. She said neighbors had flocked to the backyard to see the oddity before it was removed, and family members were advising the couple to have the skeleton appraised. (They are hoping to get a tax deduction if they donate it.) \u201cIt would be nice to have it here at the museum,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cMr. Hunter does want us to donate it.\u201dWhen Mr. Hunter visited last week he brought a volunteer who talked to the neighborhood children about Lake Bonneville, ancient animals and, of course, the horse in the backyard. Mr. Hunter said he would name it \u201cHill Horse\u201d in honor of the family that found it.Ms. Hill was pleased. \u201cNow all these little kids want to be paleontologists,\u201d she said with a laugh.______Advertisement"}

(I am, to be clear, a man in my 30s. I got my first driver\u2019s license a few months ago and do not own a car.)The Quantcast spokesman added that the company responded to data access requests under European law. So sending me any data at all had been an error \u2014 because consumers in the United States do not have a comprehensive right to obtain copies of the data held by American companies.Order history.Amazon sent lists of the items my wife and I had bought through the site, the credit cards we used to buy them, the addresses the items were shipped to and the devices we had used to access Amazon services.But we had expected to receive a more substantial data trove from Amazon. So I wrote back to Amazon asking again for all of the details the company had on me, including our household\u2019s video-viewing data.The company said it was \u201cinvestigating\u201d and would send the missing data when it was ready. There is still no sign of it. An Amazon spokesman added that the company was committed to complying with the new European privacy law.But I wanted the complete history of my account, such as my Amazon searches.Amazon responded to my email request by telling me to call the company \u2014 because it was \u201cnot safe to get account details via email due to security reasons.\u201d Then I called Amazon customer service and was put on hold for 15 minutes while an agent scrambled to figure out a response.Finally, the agent came back on the line only to tell me that Amazon was keeping records on me for business purposes \u2014 but would not share them with me. \u201cIt\u2019s all private,\u201d the agent said. \u201cI don\u2019t have access to that information to provide you, unfortunately.\u201dThe standard public information, but not everything I asked for.The standard public information, but not everything I asked for.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, recently testified in a Senate hearing that his company\u2019s download tool contains \u201call of the information\u201d that users have \u201cput into Facebook or that Facebook knows about them.\u201dWe were unable to obtain that kind of information, however.None provided us with copies of that raw information.Instead, from LinkedIn, we each received emails directing us to use the company\u2019s self-service tool.

The incomplete responses from tech companies do not bode well for such research efforts.Nor does it seem to bode well for the companies, which will soon be facing the new European privacy regulations.After we wrote to our cellphone carriers to ask for our records, for instance, Natasha at least heard back from T-Mobile, who told her that it would release her phone records only if the company received a subpoena compelling it to do so.Prashant did not hear back at all from Three, his mobile phone service.

Butterfly,\u201d Ms. Tesori for \u201cFun Home\u201d). Joining the pair is Leigh Silverman, who has directed several of Mr. Hwang\u2019s plays, including \u201cYellow Face\u201d and \u201cChinglish,\u201d and who received a Tony nomination for her work on Ms. Tesori\u2019s \u201cViolet\u201d in 2014.The play is a homecoming of sorts for the Brooklyn-based Mr. Hwang, who was born and raised in the Los Angeles suburb of San Gabriel, and whose Tony-nominated reimagining of \u201cFlower Drum Song\u201d had its premiere at the nearby Mark Taper Forum in 2001. About a half mile east of the Ahmanson is the David Henry Hwang Theater, home of the East West Players, the nation\u2019s longest-running Asian-American repertory company, which partnered with the Center Theater Group on the premiere of \u201cSoft Power.\u201dIn the play, Xue (Conrad Ricamora), a Chinese producer doing business in the United States, hires DHH \u2014 a thinly disguised Mr. Hwang, played by the actor Francis Jue \u2014 to create an American TV series set in Shanghai. The two go to a 2016 campaign fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton, where Xue meets the presidential hopeful, played by Alyse Alan Louis. Later, the scene shifts from downtown Los Angeles to a Shanghai airport, from \u201creal life\u201d to the fantasy of a hit Chinese musical, one in which Xue falls in love with Mrs. Clinton and helps bring America back from the brink of war.On a recent afternoon, in an interview at the Ahmanson, Mr. Hwang spoke of his deep love for Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, the play\u2019s themes of cultural appropriation and artistic homage, and why we never hear the word \u201cTrump\u201d in a play about the 2016 election. (\u201cLooking back at this moment 50 years in the future, maybe the Chinese won\u2019t even remember the name of the guy who was president.\u201d)Work on the play began in 2014, when Michael Ritchie, the artistic director of the Center Theater Group, gave Mr. Hwang free rein to create a show for the 50th anniversary season of the group\u2019s Mark Taper Forum in 2018.Mr. Hwang knew he wanted to do something about \u201cThe King and I,\u201d a play that had captivated and rankled him for years. But he was equally intrigued by China\u2019s increasing desire for \u201csoft power.\u201d \u201cIf hard power is your economic and military strength, soft power is your cultural and intellectual influence,\u201d he said.Mr. Hwang had seen that desire firsthand. As the only Asian-American playwright in history to win a Tony, he had become the target of Chinese producers hoping he could help them stage a play set in China that would become a Broadway hit.\u201cI happen to be the only nominally Chinese person who\u2019s ever written a Broadway show, so I end up going to a lot of these meetings\u201d with Chinese producers, he said.In 2015, Mr. Hwang enlisted the help of Ms. Silverman and Ms. Tesori. They met up at Columbia University, where all three of them were teaching, to bounce ideas back and forth. \u201cThe triangular mind meld on this one was very deep,\u201d Ms. Silverman said.Later that year, Mr. Hwang pitched his still-evolving play to Mr. Ritchie, along with a heads-up that it might turn out a bit bigger than what he had initially thought, what with all the music and Broadway-style numbers and narrative leaps into the future. Would that be O.K.? \u201cI\u2019ve worked with him before, so yeah, I totally trusted him,\u201d Mr. Ritchie said.Two weeks after that meeting, on Nov. 29, 2015, Mr. Hwang was stabbed in the neck as he walked home from the grocery store in his Fort Greene neighborhood, severing his vertebral artery. The crime, part of a rise in attacks on Asian-Americans in New York City at that time, made international news.\u201cIn typical David fashion, I learned about it on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Jue said. \u201cHe posted this very funny post about: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m in the hospital, I got stabbed.\u2019 And then I started seeing the news reports, and there was a tremendous amount of blood on the sidewalk.\u201dMr. Hwang found a way to work the stabbing into the show. Within the Ahmanson\u2019s auditorium, Mr. Jue, as DHH, rehearsed that pivotal scene. As he slowly loses consciousness after the attack, DHH imagines \u201ca beloved Chinese musical,\u201d and just like that, dancers appear, and a Chinese jumbo jet descends from the sky.\u201cI give David a lot of credit for translating that incident into this brilliant idea,\u201d Mr. Jue said, \u201cwhere maybe there\u2019s happy endings, and maybe there\u2019s romance, and maybe there\u2019s a 23-piece orchestra following you around, helping you express your feelings.\u201dA lot of those transcendent moments come courtesy of Ms. Tesori\u2019s compositions, which range from \u201cIt Just Takes Time,\u201d an ode to budding love in which Mrs. Clinton learns to speak Mandarin, sort of, and \u201cGood Guy With a Gun,\u201d a hootenanny-style paean to concealed carry gun laws and the joys of shooting \u201csex molesters\u201d dead.In September 2016, the company had their first reading of the play. By then, the character of Mrs. Clinton, as the newly elected leader of the country and the object of Xue\u2019s affection, was established in the script. And then, Trump won. \u201cAt 3 in the morning, when my daughter was sobbing, I just felt really out of control in a deep way,\u201d Ms. Tesori said. \u201cBut I realized we needed to stay in the conversation, that times like this call for a strong response.\u201dMr. Hwang saw it in a slightly different light: \u201cI guess I felt like, oh, the election is terrible for the country, but maybe it\u2019ll be good for the show. Because it sort of shows the Chinese point of view is right. Democracy isn\u2019t a good system. It doesn\u2019t always elect competent people. It creates chaos.\u201dFor the play, Mr. Hwang assembled a cast of 17, nearly all of them Asian-American. Many of them had fallen in love with the stage in productions of \u201cThe King and I,\u201d as well as other problematic Asian-themed standards, including \u201cPacific Overtures\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon.\u201d\u201cOne of the women in the company told me it\u2019s so extraordinary to be in a show where I don\u2019t have to bow to anybody,\u201d Ms. Silverman said.Ms. Louis, who was reading Mrs. Clinton\u2019s memoir \u201cWhat Happened\u201d between rehearsals, is hoping that the former first lady will see the play. \u201cI would love that,\u201d she said.Mr. Ricamora, who recalled the \u201cicky feeling\u201d of playing one of the two Asian characters in a summer stock production of the 1934 musical \u201cAnything Goes,\u201d likes being on this side of things for once. \u201cI remember doing \u2018Miss Saigon\u2019 and \u2018The King and I,\u2019 and having that feeling that we\u2019re telling a story through a white person\u2019s lens,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we get to feel empowered through telling our own story through our own lens.\u201dAdvertisement"}

About one in four of those charged in Pennsylvania, where we took a close look at the data, was under 25 years old.Here are some things those defendants probably wish they had known:Legally speaking, it can be. If you supplied the drugs or helped obtain them, you could be considered a drug dealer, held responsible for the death and go to prison.Unlike child endangerment or \u201csocial host\u201d laws that hold parents responsible for underage drinking or drug use, these cases can make you criminally liable for the actions of your peers or people older than you.State laws vary, but drug \u201cdistribution\u201d or \u201cdelivery\u201d is generally not limited to selling. It can include sharing drugs, giving them away, or having a friend pay you back for drugs you bought.It depends on the circumstances. Our article takes a close look at Nick Klamer and Chase Thistle, two friends in rural, blue-collar Wisconsin. Nick asked his dad if he could borrow $200, claiming it was needed for an emergency car repair, but the two friends used the money to buy drugs. Nick, 26, died and Chase, now 29, was prosecuted.Chase may not have touched the money, but he used Facebook Messenger to arrange the deal, making him a \u201cparty to a crime,\u201d which legally speaking is the same as actually committing the crime. He is serving three years for reckless homicide.Prosecutors often see overdoses from the point of view of the victims\u2019 families, some of whom say that even if no one meant for anyone to die, without the drugs their loved ones would still be alive.\u201cSome family has lost an innocent life,\u201d said Peter Kilmartin, the attorney general of Rhode Island, who proposed a mandatory life sentence in drug homicide cases. \u201cThat victim no longer has a voice.\u201dProviding or helping someone get a drug illegally puts you on shaky ground for everything that happens later. Legally, there is a difference between that and, say, a store selling alcohol to a 21-year-old who drank too much and died, because the sale itself was not unlawful.It\u2019s an important question, and one we don\u2019t have an answer to yet.There is no grand spreadsheet that shows the race of people arrested in drug homicides. We got some statistics from the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing that showed that while most of those convicted were white, the black defendants were more likely to get tougher sentences. The sample pool \u2014 29 defendants \u2014 was too small to draw conclusions, and without a much deeper dive into each case, we could not explain the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the outcomes.Because the number of these cases is on the rise, examining racial disparity would be a good avenue for future reporting.Advertisement"}

While they hope to enlarge their database of photographers ready to take on editorial assignments, Natives Photograph\u2019s founders have had difficulty locating potential members in North America.

{"Headline": "Germany Acts to Tame Facebook, Learning From Its Own History of Hate", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "A country taps its past as it leads the way on one of the most pressing issues facing modern democracies: how to regulate the world\u2019s biggest social network.Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Security is tight at this brick building on the western edge of Berlin. Inside, a sign warns: \u201cEverybody without a badge is a potential spy!\u201dSpread over five floors, hundreds of men and women sit in rows of six scanning their computer screens. All have signed nondisclosure agreements. Four trauma specialists are at their disposal seven days a week.They are the agents of Facebook. And they have the power to decide what is free speech and what is hate speech.Germany, home to a tough new online hate speech law, has become a laboratory for one of the most pressing issues for governments today: how and whether to regulate the world\u2019s biggest social network.Around the world, Facebook and other social networking platforms are facing a backlash over their failures to safeguard privacy, disinformation campaigns and the digital reach of hate groups.As the world confronts these rising forces, Europe, and Germany in particular, have emerged as the de facto regulators of the industry, exerting influence beyond their own borders. Berlin\u2019s digital crackdown on hate speech, which took effect on Jan. 1, is being closely watched by other countries. And German officials are playing a major role behind one of Europe\u2019s most aggressive moves to rein in technology companies, strict data privacy rules that take effect across the European Union on May 25 and are prompting global changes.\u201cFor them, data is the raw material that makes them money,\u201d said Gerd Billen, secretary of state in Germany\u2019s Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection. \u201cFor us, data protection is a fundamental right that underpins our democratic institutions.\u201dGermany\u2019s troubled history has placed it on the front line of a modern tug-of-war between democracies and digital platforms.But banned posts, pictures and videos have routinely lingered on Facebook and other social media platforms. Now companies that systematically fail to remove \u201cobviously illegal\u201d content within 24 hours face fines of up to 50 million euros.The deletion center predates the legislation, but its efforts have taken on new urgency. Every day content moderators in Berlin, hired by a third-party firm and working exclusively on Facebook, pore over thousands of posts flagged by users as upsetting or potentially illegal and make a judgment: Ignore, delete or, in particularly tricky cases, \u201cescalate\u201d to a global team of Facebook lawyers with expertise in German regulation.Some decisions to delete are easy. Posts about Holocaust denial and genocidal rants against particular groups like refugees are obvious ones for taking down.Others are less so. On Dec. 31, the day before the new law took effect, a far-right lawmaker reacted to an Arabic New Year\u2019s tweet from the Cologne police, accusing them of appeasing \u201cbarbaric, Muslim, gang-raping groups of men.\u201dThe request to block a screenshot of the lawmaker\u2019s post wound up in the queue of Nils, a 35-year-old agent in the Berlin deletion center. His judgment was to let it stand. A colleague thought it should come down. Ultimately, the post was sent to lawyers in Dublin, London, Silicon Valley and Hamburg. By the afternoon it had been deleted, prompting a storm of criticism about the new legislation, known here as the \u201cFacebook Law.\u201d\u201cA lot of stuff is clear-cut,\u201d Nils said. Facebook, citing his safety, did not allow him to give his surname. \u201cBut then there is the borderline stuff.\u201dComplicated cases have raised concerns that the threat of the new rules\u2019 steep fines and 24-hour window for making decisions encourage \u201cover-blocking\u201d by companies, a sort of defensive censorship of content that is not actually illegal.Other people argue that the law simply gives a private company too much authority to decide what constitutes illegal hate speech in a democracy, an argument that Facebook, which favored voluntary guidelines, made against the law.\u201cIt is perfectly appropriate for the German government to set standards,\u201d said Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of communications and public policy. \u201cBut we think it\u2019s a bad idea for the German government to outsource the decision of what is lawful and what is not.\u201dRichard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for public policy in Europe and the leader of the company\u2019s lobbying effort against the German legislation, put it more simply: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the arbiters of free speech.\u201dGerman officials counter that social media platforms are the arbiters anyway.It all boils down to one question, said Mr. Billen, who helped draw up the new legislation: \u201cWho is sovereign? Parliament or Facebook?\u201dWhen Nils applied for a job at the deletion center, the first question the recruiter asked him was: \u201cDo you know what you will see here?\u201dNils has seen it all. Child torture. Mutilations. Suicides. Even murder: He once saw a video of a man cutting a heart out of a living human being.And then there is hate.\u201cYou see all the ugliness of the world here,\u201d Nils said. \u201cEveryone is against everyone else. Everyone is complaining about that other group. And everyone is saying the same horrible things.\u201dThe issue is deeply personal for Nils. He has a 4-year-old daughter. \u201cI\u2019m also doing this for her,\u201d he said.The center here is run by Arvato, a German service provider owned by the conglomerate Bertelsmann. The agents have a broad purview, reviewing content from a half-dozen countries. Those with a focus on Germany must know Facebook\u2019s community standards and, as of January, the basics of German hate speech and defamation law.\u201cTwo agents looking at the same post should come up with the same decision,\u201d says Karsten K\u00f6nig, who manages Arvato\u2019s partnership with Facebook.The Berlin center opened with 200 employees in 2015, as Germany was opening its doors to hundreds of thousands of migrants.That year a selfie went viral.Anas Modamani, a Syrian refugee, posed with Chancellor Angela Merkel and posted the image on Facebook. It instantly became a symbol of her decision to allowing in hundreds of thousands of migrants.Soon it also became a symbol of the backlash.The arrival of nearly 1.4 million migrants in Germany has tested the country\u2019s resolve to keep a tight lid on hate speech. The law on illegal speech was long-established but enforcement in the digital realm was scattershot before the new legislation.\u201cThey knew that they were a platform for criminal behavior and for calls to commit criminal acts, but they presented themselves to us as a wolf in sheep skin,\u201d said Mr. Billen, a poker-faced civil servant with stern black frames on his glasses.By March 2017, the German government had lost patience and started drafting legislation. The Network Enforcement Law was born, setting out 21 types of content that are \u201cmanifestly illegal\u201d and requiring social media platforms to act quickly.Officials say early indications suggest the rules have served their purpose. Facebook\u2019s performance on removing illegal hate speech in Germany rose to 100 percent over the past year, according to the latest spot check of the European Union.Platforms must publish biannual reports on their efforts. The first is expected in July.At Facebook\u2019s Berlin offices, Mr. Allan acknowledged that under the earlier voluntary agreement, the company had not acted decisively enough at first.\u201cIt was too little and it was too slow,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cthat has changed.\u201dHe cited another independent report for the European Commission from last summer that showed Facebook was by then removing 80 percent of hate speech posts in Germany.The reason for the improvement was not German legislation, he said, but a voluntary code of conduct with the European Union. Facebook\u2019s results have improved in all European countries, not just in Germany, Mr. Allan said.\u201cThere was no need for legislation,\u201d he said.Mr. Billen disagrees.\u201cThey could have prevented the law,\u201d he said. YouTube scored 90 percent in last year\u2019s monitoring exercise. If other platforms had done the same, there would be no law today, he said.Germany\u2019s hard-line approach to hate speech and data privacy once made it an outlier in Europe. The country\u2019s stance is now more mainstream, an evolution seen in the justice commissioner in Brussels.Vera Jourova, the justice commissioner, deleted her Facebook account in 2015 because she could not stand the hate anymore.\u201cIt felt good,\u201d she said about pressing the button. She added: \u201cIt felt like taking back control.\u201dBut Ms. Jourova, who grew up behind the Iron Curtain in what is now the Czech Republic, had long been skeptical about governments legislating any aspect of free speech, including hate speech. Her father lost his job after making a disparaging comment about the Soviet invasion in 1968, barring her from going to university until she married and took her husband\u2019s name.\u201cI lived half my life in the atmosphere driven by Soviet propaganda,\u201d she said. \u201cThe golden principle was: If you repeat a lie a hundred times it becomes the truth.\u201dWhen Germany started considering a law, she instead preferred a voluntary code of conduct. In 2016, platforms like Facebook promised European users easy reporting tools and committed to removing most illegal posts brought to their attention within 24 hours.The approach worked well enough, Ms. Jourova said. It was also the quickest way to act because the 28 member states in the European Union differed so much about whether and how to legislate.But the stance of many governments toward Facebook has hardened since it emerged that the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of up to 87 million users. Representatives of the European Parliament have asked Mr. Zuckerberg to come to Brussels to \u201cclarify issues related to the use of personal data\u201d and he has agreed to come as soon as next week.Ms. Jourova, whose job is to protect the data of over 500 million Europeans, has hardened her stance as well.\u201cOur current system relies on trust and this did nothing to improve trust,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question now is how do we continue?\u201dThe European Commission is considering German-style legislation for online content related to terrorism, violent extremism and child pornography, including a provision that would include fines for platforms that did not remove illegal content within an hour of being alerted to it.Several countries \u2014 France, Israel, Italy, and Canada among them \u2014 have sent queries to the German government about the impact of the new hate speech law.Inspired in part by German data protection laws written in the 1980s, the regulation has been shaped by a number of prominent Germans. Ms. Jourova\u2019s chief of staff, Renate Nikolay, is German, as is her predecessor\u2019s chief of staff, Martin Selmayr, now the European Commission\u2019s secretary general. The lawmaker in charge of the regulation in the European Parliament is German, too.\u201cWe have built on the German tradition of data protection as a constitutional right and created the most modern piece of regulation of the digital economy,\u201d Ms. Nikolay said.\u201cTo succeed in the long-term companies needs the trust of customers,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the latest since Cambridge Analytica it has become clear that data protection is not just some nutty European idea, but a matter of competitiveness.\u201dOn March 26, Ms. Jourova wrote a letter \u2014 by post, not email \u2014 to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer.\u201cIs there a need for stricter rules for platforms like those that exist for traditional media?\u201d she asked.\u201cIs the data of Europeans affected by the current scandal?\u201d she added, referring to the Cambridge Analytica episode. And, if so, \u201cHow do you plan to inform the user about this?\u201dShe demanded a reply within two weeks, and she got one. Some 2.7 million Europeans were affected, Ms. Sandberg wrote.But she never answered Ms. Jourova\u2019s question on regulation.\u201cThere is now a sense of urgency and the conviction that we are dealing with something very dangerous that may threaten the development of free democracies,\u201d said Ms. Jourova, who is also trying to find ways to clamp down on fake news and disinformation campaigns.\u201cWe want the tech giants to respect and follow our legislation,\u201d she added. \u201cWe want them to show social responsibility both on data protection and on hate speech.\u201dSo do many Facebook employees, Mr. Allan, the company executive, said.\u201cWe employ very thoughtful and principled people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey work here because they want to make the world a better place, so when an assumption is made that the product they work on is harming people it is impactful.\u201d\u201cPeople have felt this criticism very deeply,\u201d he said.Nils works eight-hour shifts. On busy days, 1,500 user reports are in his queue. Other days, there are only 300. Some of his colleagues have nightmares about what they see.Every so often someone breaks down. A mother recently left her desk in tears after watching a video of a child being sexually abused. A young man felt physically sick after seeing a video of a dog being tortured. The agents watch teenagers self-mutilating and girls recounting rape.They have weekly group sessions with a psychologist and the trauma specialists on standby. In more serious cases, the center teams up with clinics in Berlin.In the office, which is adorned with Facebook logos, fresh fruit is at the agents\u2019 disposal in a small room where subdued colors and decorative moss growing on the walls are meant to calm fraying nerves.To decompress, the agents sometimes report each other\u2019s posts, not because they are controversial, but \u201cjust for a laugh,\u201d said another agent, the son of a Lebanese refugee and an Arabic-speaker who has had to deal with content related to terrorism generally and the Islamic State specifically. By now, he said, images of \u201cweird skin diseases\u201d affected him more than those of a beheading. Nils finds sports injuries like breaking bones particularly disturbing.There is a camaraderie in the office and a real sense of mission: Nils said the agents were proud to \u201chelp clean up the hate.\u201dThe definition of hate is constantly evolving.The agents, who initially take a three-week training course, get frequent refreshers. Their guidelines are revised to reflect hate speech culture. Events change the meaning of words. New hashtags and online trends must be put in context.\u201cSlurs can become socialized,\u201d Mr. Allan of Facebook explained.Nils and his colleagues must determine whether hateful content is singling out an ethnic group or individuals.That was the challenge with a message on Twitter that was later posted to Facebook as a screenshot by Beatrix von Storch, deputy floor leader of the far-right party, AfD.\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with this country?\u201d Ms. von Storch wrote on Dec. 31. \u201cWhy is an official police account tweeting in Arabic?\u201d\u201cDo you think that will appease the barbaric murdering Muslim group-raping gangs of men?\u201d she continued.A user reported the post as a violation of German law, and it landed in Nils\u2019s queue. He initially decided to ignore the request because he felt Ms. von Storch was directing her insults at the men who had sexually assaulted women two years earlier.Separately, a user reported the post as a violation of community standards. Another agent leaned toward deleting it, taking it as directed at Muslims in general.They conferred with their \u201csubject matter expert,\u201d who escalated it to a team in Dublin.For 24 hours, the post kept Facebook lawyers from Silicon Valley to Hamburg busy. The Dublin team decided that the post did not violate community standards but sent it on for legal assessment by outside lawyers hired by Facebook in Germany.Within hours of news that the German police were opening a criminal investigation into Ms. von Storch over her comments, Facebook restricted access to the post. The user who reported the content was notified that it had been blocked for a violation of section 130 of the German criminal code, incitement to hatred. Ms. von Storch was also notified too.In the first few days of the year, it looked like the platforms were erring on the side of censorship. On Jan. 2, a day after Ms. von Storch\u2019s post was deleted, the satirical magazine Titanic quipped that she would be its new guest tweeter. Two of the magazine\u2019s subsequent Twitter posts mocking her were deleted. When Titanic published them again, its account was temporarily suspended.Since then, things have calmed down. And even Mr. Allan conceded: \u201cThe law has not materially changed the amount of content that is deleted.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a prolific right-wing user of Facebook in Germany. It is Alternative for Germany, not Alternative of Germany.Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The man, Yu Mein Chow, had taken out a loan seven years ago to buy a $700,000 medallion that gave him the right to operate a cab.On Sunday, Richard Chow, Mr. Chow\u2019s older brother, went to the street where the police found the taxi as part of a vigil that drew dozens of the driver\u2019s friends and fellow cabbies on a bleak afternoon. He climbed the stone steps of nearby Carl Schurz Park and headed toward the iron fence on an esplanade that overlooks the river. \u201cI loved my brother. He was very hard working.

{"Headline": "Discussion Questions for \u2018Educated\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Read ThisBelow are questions to help guide your discussions as you read the book over the next month. The questions are broken into three parts, to match the three parts of the book. (Spoiler alert on questions further down, which mention specific scenes in the book.)Part 1:1. \u201cEducated\u201d starts with an epigraph from Virginia Woolf: \u201cThe past is beautiful because one never realizes an emotion at the time. It expands later, and thus we don\u2019t have complete emotions about the present, only the past.\u201d What do you think Woolf meant by this? Why do you think Tara Westover chose to begin her memoir this way?2. In the first pages of \u201cEducated,\u201d we are introduced to the mountain in rural Idaho where the Westover family lives, described as a dark, beautiful and commanding form in a \u201cjagged little patch of Idaho.\u201d How does this setting inform the family\u2019s experience?3. We are also introduced early in the book to the standoff at Ruby Ridge, a 1992 gunfight between F.B.I. agents and United States marshals and a heavily armed family on an isolated homestead. How does this incident cast a shadow over the Westover parents and children, and the survivalism that characterizes their upbringing?4. In Chapter 5, Westover\u2019s brother Tyler announces that he\u2019s going to college, something none of her other siblings have done. (The two brothers who have left the mountain drive semis and weld scrap.) Why does Westover\u2019s father, Gene, object to formalized education? How does Tyler\u2019s leaving have an impact on Westover?5. In the Author\u2019s Note, Westover cautions that this memoir is not about Mormonism or \u201cany form of religious belief,\u201d and that she rejects a negative or positive correlation between believing or not believing and being kind or not being kind. But her father Gene\u2019s faith informs how he sees the world. What did you make of Chapter 8, \u201cTiny Harlots,\u201d which moves from Gene\u2019s distrust of Westover\u2019s dance recital uniform to his pride over her singing in church?Part 2:7. By part two of \u201cEducated,\u201d Westover has decided she wants to get an education, has found a way to take the ACT, and has left the mountain to go to college at Brigham Young University, despite her father\u2019s objections. In her first class at college, Westover recounts not knowing what the word \u201cholocaust\u201d means. Why is this moment significant?8. Over the course of this book, the Westover family deals with a number of accidents: Westover\u2019s brother Tyler falling asleep and driving off the road, Westover\u2019s brother Luke catching on fire, and later, a very serious accident for their father. Early on, Westover writes about \u201call the decisions that go into making a life \u2014 the choices people make, together and on their own, that combine to produce any single event.\u201d What do you think she meant by this? How does this insight apply to your own life?9. Throughout the book, Westover refers back to journals she kept while growing up. Sometimes, she recorded events as they really felt, but many times, she says she presented events as less traumatic than they really were, or used \u201cvague, shadowy language\u201d to obscure how she\u2019d been hurt. How do these journals inform the book?10. By Chapter 22, Westover writes that her life was often \u201cnarrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.\u201d What is the significance of this realization? Do you identify at all with this?11. At Brigham Young, Tara recounts going to a professor for moral advice, and instead being encouraged to apply for a very competitive study abroad program at Cambridge University, which she\u2019d never imagined she could qualify to do. \u201cHe\u2019d seemed to say, \u2018First find out what you are capable of, then decide who you are,\u2019\u201d she writes. Has anyone ever given you advice to do something beyond what you thought you were capable? Did you follow it?12. Westover\u2019s mother is a midwife and herbalist. How does her perception of these kinds of healing change over the course of her life? How does working change her?Part 3:13. Westover writes that her father looked slumped when she left for Cambridge, an expression of \u201clove and fear and loss\u201d because when she\u2019s across the ocean he can\u2019t keep her safe. How did you view her relationship with her father, and did your perception of that relationship change throughout the book?14. After Westover decides to continue her education, she finds it increasingly difficult to reconcile her life on the mountain with her new life as a student of history. She writes that she had a \u201cfractured mind.\u201d Does it seem to you that she must lose one life to gain another?15. One of the most difficult scenes in the book comes near the end, when Westover realizes that Shawn has killed his dog Diego after coming to her parents\u2019 house with a knife in hand. How does this moment change things for Westover?16. One professor describes Westover as \u201cPygmalion,\u201d while Westover herself at one point says she believed she could \u201cbe remade, my mind recast\u201d at her university. And in the end, she writes that she is a \u201cchanged person\u201d from the person she was as her father\u2019s daughter, and from her 16-year-old self. \u201cYou could call this selfhood many things,\u201d she writes. \u201cTransformation. Metaphorosis. Falsity. Betrayal. I call it an education.\u201d What do you make of these final lines?17. Looking back over the book, what did you learn about family and forgiveness and trauma? What did you learn about education?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kentucky Math Teacher, Riding Wave of Public Anger, Defeats State House Majority Leader", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past six years, Travis Brenda voted like nearly everyone else in his part of rural central Kentucky. In 2012, 2014 and 2016, he helped send Jonathan Shell to the State House of Representatives, re-electing him again and again as he eventually rose to House majority leader.Suddenly, years of bubbling anger among state employees and teachers in Kentucky erupted in protests and chants at the Capitol, fueling a sustained backlash that helped lift Mr. Brenda to an unlikely victory on Tuesday night. Mr. Brenda, a first-time candidate and a math teacher, knocked off Mr. Shell, who had both name recognition and fund-raising prowess, by 123 votes in the Republican primary for House District 71.\u201cWe trust those we elected to do the right thing,\u201d Mr. Brenda, 43, who teaches at Rockcastle County High School in Mount Vernon, Ky., said in an interview on Wednesday morning. \u201cWhat we are seeing is that they are not doing the right thing.\u201dIn November, he will face Mary J. Renfro, a Democrat who serves on a local school board, in the general election in a part of Kentucky that President Trump easily won in 2016.For Mr. Brenda, his campaign started, unofficially at least, at a back-to-school prayer service last August. He had thought about running for office, but he worried about losing his privacy and the potential toll on his family.But at the prayer service, he said he had a moment of clarity about his future.\u201cI felt like it was a word from God,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really pointed the direction.\u201dHe spoke to his wife, Judy, and their two children, Ashley and Benjamin, who all expressed support for his political ambitions. On Jan. 17, he filed as a Republican in District 71, which includes parts of Madison County and all of Garrard and Rockcastle Counties. He announced his candidacy on Facebook, and received little attention beyond his campaign page.The odds were stacked against him. Leading up to Tuesday\u2019s primary, Mr. Shell had a huge financial advantage. His campaign had raised $131,200, while Mr. Brenda had $16,100, according to state records.Then, as Mr. Brenda puts it, there was an awakening.On March 29, Mr. Shell gave Kentucky teachers reason to pay attention. He helped write legislation to rework the state\u2019s struggling pension system, which would affect educators and other public employees. It was introduced and approved in the State House on the same day \u2014 leaving no time for a public reading or to receive public input.For current teachers, the pension bill placed a limit on the number of sick days that could be saved and used to increase retirement benefits. The most significant changes affect future teachers, whose pensions would be part of a new retirement plan and require them to work longer before receiving payments. Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, signed it into law on April 10.Mr. Shell did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. In an interview two weeks ago, he played down the outrage over the pension law.It was clear Mr. Shell had miscalculated, Mr. Brenda said on Wednesday. About one-fifth of workers in District 71 are public employees, according to census figures, and Mr. Brenda said many of them are educators.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find someone in Garrard, Rockcastle and western Madison Counties that do not have some connection to a state employee,\u201d he said. \u201cThat made the difference.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ella Watson: The Empowered Woman of Gordon Parks's 'American Gothic' ", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGordon Parks's photograph \u201cAmerican Gothic\u201d afforded rare attention to a black female subject who was not a celebrity or entertainer, but a mother and a worker. I wanted to hold fast to the memory of that image of Ella Watson even as the professor moved to the next photo. Her polka-dot dress with puffed sleeves and two missing buttons, her wire-rimmed glasses half in shadow. The inverted tools of her trade, the straw curve of the worn broom and the curl of cotton mop, made me curious.Parks met Ella Watson in 1942, when he had a Rosenwald fellowship with the Farm Security Administration in Washington, D.C. She was a cleaning woman in the offices there, and he went on to photograph her at work, at home with her family, in her neighborhood, and at St. Martin\u2019s Spiritual Church. \u201cAmerican Gothic\u201d \u2014 a reference to the famous Grant Wood painting \u2014 is a construction that afforded rare attention to a black female subject who was not a celebrity or entertainer, but a mother and a worker. In this photograph, Parks formed an image of Mrs. Watson at work, her loosely fitted work dress pinned closed, allowing the viewer to link the necessity of her role as a family provider with the harshness of her existence. The American flag that hangs behind her frames her with the tools of her labor.This week I had the opportunity to chat with Ella Watson\u2019s great-granddaughter Rosslyn Samuels. She was a child when her great-grandmother came to live in her family\u2019s home in Washington, and they shared a bedroom. Ms. Samuels\u2019s mother, granddaughter to Ella Watson, and her father had asked her to stay with them after Mrs. Watson\u2019s last daughter had moved out of the family home. Ms. Samuels said Mrs. Watson spent her life taking care of family \u2014 her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren \u2014 and caring about others\u2019 welfare and comfort. Ms. Samuels also told me that she had never seen her great-grandmother at work outside the home nor heard her speak of \u201cAmerican Gothic.\u201d She was about 12 or 13 when Mrs. Watson died, but her grandmother Lauretta talked about the photograph, which Ms. Samuels saw for the first time when she was 18. In looking again at Parks\u2019s photographs of Ella Watson \u2014 he made at least 90 \u2014 I am reminded of other people\u2019s readings of the images over the years, ones that stressed the struggles in her life, her long working hours, and I searched for those readings in the various portraits of her. But Ms. Samuels offered another way of seeing Mrs. Watson \u2014 she explained that her great-grandmother often spoke of the delight she took in caring for the family\u2019s children. She loved cooking, and Ms. Samuels recalled a story about a meal that she tried to avoid eating by poking a hole in a bag of black-eyed peas. When the peas spilled onto the floor, she was certain that she would not have to eat peas that night. She was surprised when her great-grandmother said: \u201cOh, this is a great opportunity. We can pick these up, wash them and cook them for dinner.\u201d Curious about her Saturday nights and Sunday mornings, I asked Ms. Samuels about Ella Watson\u2019s clothing, her sense of style. Ms. Samuels described her as neat and meticulous, a modest and humble woman who wore house dresses at home during the week and her best clothes on Sunday. She never wore pants and would stay in her bedclothes as she prepared for church. She wore monochrome dresses and kitten-heeled shoes that she polished weekly, and she never allowed her great-granddaughter to style her hair for church. She had her style for Sunday! In my quest to confirm my perception of the personality I had imagined for this stoic black woman in the photograph, I asked Ms. Samuels a final question. How would you describe your great-grandmother to someone today? Ms. Samuels responded immediately that she was a \u201cProverbs 31 woman!\u201d As that Old Testament passage says: \u201cShe watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness \u2026 Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.\u201d Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 CBS continues its insurrection against its controlling shareholder.\u2022 The chief executive of Campbell Soup retired abruptly.\u2022 Is Qualcomm\u2019s purchase of NXP more likely now?\u2022 Why to be skeptical of China\u2019s reported trade concession.\u2022 The issues behind a bailout of 666 Fifth Ave.The details\u2022 Mr. Blankfein\u2019s exit will likely take place in conjunction with the firm\u2019s annual dinner for retired partners in December. Mr. Solomon would step in shortly after that.That said, there are some ways to assess whether the current mortgage rate might be a bit high or low for the current conditions in the markets and the economy. One way to put the nominal mortgage rate in context is to adjust for inflation. Subtracting April\u2019s inflation rate of 2.5 percent from the current mortgage rate gives a \u201creal\u201d mortgage rate of around 2.1 percent. That compares with the average real rate of 2.25 percent for the past seven years. The mortgage rate would need to rise 0.15 percentage point to reach that level.Another exercise is to compare the current mortgage with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The difference between the two interest rates on Thursday was 1.5 percentage points, which is smaller than the seven-year average of 1.72 percentage points. Trading at that \u201cspread\u201d would push the current mortgage rate 0.22 percentage point higher to 4.83 percent.Economists expect the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to keep rising, to 3.24 percent in December, according to estimates compiled by The Wall Street Journal.Adding the average seven-year spread of 1.72 percentage points to that forecast gets the mortgage rate within spitting distance of 5 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisBoth sides claimed a victory of sorts, but only one thing was clear: They will all be spending a lot of time in court.Ms. Brennan has resisted doing so, pointing out that the rate the Postal Service charges Amazon and others is bound by contracts, the Washington Post writes.ContextMany have pushed back against Mr. Trump\u2019s comments. They point out that Amazon, the largest single shipper of packages, has been a boon for the agency at a time when it has experienced a steady decline in the amount of mail it ships.Denise M. Morrison, the chief executive of Campbell Soup Co., retired abruptly on Friday after nearly seven years in the job. Keith R. McLoughlin, a member of the Campbell board since 2016, was named to succeed Ms. Morrison on an interim basis.\u2022 Campbell has struggled on Ms. Morrison\u2019s watch to reverse a slide in sales tied to shifting food trends. Campbell reported $393 million loss for the third quarter on Friday, compared with a $176 million profit in the same period a year earlier. The company also expects its earnings per share for the year to slump 5 to 6 percent after previously projecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent.\u2022 With Ms. Morrison\u2019s departure, there are now 23 women leading Fortune 500 companies, or 4.6 percent of the total. They include Mary Barra at General Motors, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo and Marillyn Hewson at Lockheed Martin.\u2022 Campbell\u2019s share price dropped more than 12 percent, to $34.50, after the company\u2019s morning announcement that Ms. Morrison had resigned. It had bounced back a bit by midday. From the start of her tenure as chief executive in August 2011 through Thursday, Campbell\u2019s share price was up 19 percent, although it had tumbled around 30 percent in the past year.\u2014 Tiffany HsuContext\u2022 Chinese antitrust regulators had long delayed Qualcomm\u2019s $44 billion deal for NXP as well as Bain Capital\u2019s $18 billion purchase of Toshiba.\u2022 On Thursday, China approved Bain Capital's acquisitions of Toshiba.Even if the Chinese stopped buying other foreign products, like Airbus airplanes from the European Union or soybeans from Brazil, and purchased solely American products, it would add up to only a small fraction of the $200 billion total they are promising to purchase.Representatives for Brookfield and Qatar said the emirate wasn\u2019t involved, and Brookfield is an established real-estate name in its own right.

{"Headline": "Review: Bar Patr\u00f3n by Rockpool in Sydney, Australia", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare7 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.As I sat at the bar facing this twinkling wonder, drinking an obligatory but one-note margarita, I pondered how much money I\u2019d be willing to spend on a proper Los Angeles street taco. In that moment, the price I settled on was $120. Give or take.I\u2019d been driven to this valuation by Bar Patr\u00f3n\u2019s al pastor tacos. They are better than most Australian tacos in that the tortillas are freshly made and pleasantly pliant, but are nonetheless wildly disappointing thanks to bland, dry meat and salsa that tastes of cumin and water.\u201cTasteless\u201d is a word often used hyperbolically, but it applied to many dishes at Bar Patr\u00f3n.Mexican food in Australia is an easy target for those of us who have eaten widely in Mexico or California or almost anywhere else in the Americas. Australia\u2019s proliferation of terrible burritos \u2014 usually imbued with some kind of fruity salsa and mayonnaise or aioli \u2014 is a lesson in what can happen to a cuisine when it is taken completely out of its cultural context. The Mexican population here is relatively tiny. The types of restaurants that usually pop up to give a community a taste of home \u2014 and provide the basis for a cuisine to grow naturally in a new location \u2014 have not had the chance to develop here.With a few welcome exceptions, most of the Mexican food here is still a wan imitation \u2014 blander, sweeter, and more mayonnaise-y than the real thing.As with any celebrity chef who acts as the public face of a large restaurant group, it is hard to know how much involvement Mr. Perry has in any one of Rockpool Group\u2019s long list of endeavors.According to company spokeswoman, Mr. Perry \u201cplays a fundamental role\u201d in the creation of new restaurants, and works on menu and recipe development. She said that he is a constant presence at their restaurants in the opening months, and that Bar Patr\u00f3n is currently one of Mr. Perry\u2019s \u201ckey focal points.\u201dI have eaten at a number of restaurants in the Rockpool Group\u2019s portfolio; some do justice to Mr. Perry\u2019s reputation, while others do not. It is hard to fathom how any chef, no matter how talented, could hope to guarantee quality across so many venues.The Rockpool reputation is not borne out at Bar Patr\u00f3n, though the place looks and feels the part. The windows are framed in white, lacy woodwork, and the blond wood and brown leather accents in the dining room provide an attractive setting for the restaurant\u2019s stylish clientele.You can get a \u201cmillionaire\u2019s margarita\u201d for $100, made tableside (with gold leaf), and a selection of special and aged tequilas, all of them Patr\u00f3n. I did not try the millionaire\u2019s margarita because I am no millionaire, but the classic versions (which ring in at $20, $30 or $40, depending on what kind of Patr\u00f3n you request) are perfectly enjoyable. The Tommy\u2019s margarita, made with only agave and lime, was watery and dull.The head chef, Pamela Valdes, is from Xalapa, Mexico, and moved to Australia in 2017. She took on the role after a short period working at other Rockpool restaurants.You can taste Ms. Valdes\u2019s talent here and there: in a dark and subtle mole drizzled over otherwise uninspiring enmoladas con carnitas; in a pozole soup that had more soul in its porky broth than the rest of the menu combined. I\u2019m not sure where or why her cooking gets lost, but so much of the food here tastes as though the lifeblood has been drained from it.That is the overwhelming characteristic of so many dishes: the aguachile in a bright green sauce that tasted faintly of lime and not much else; the zucchini flower enchiladas that were subtle to the point of forgettability; the tuna tostada; the immensely mediocre tacos.And so, I daydreamed about tacos on Los Angeles street corners, and all the thrilling modern Mexican cooking I\u2019ve enjoyed. My dining companions spoke longingly about the delights they had encountered while living in Mexico City, and wondered at the trick Bar Patr\u00f3n inadvertently manages.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d one of them said. \u201cHow do you put so many ingredients on a plate and have it taste like nothing?\u201dShould it be all that shocking that a corporate takeover by private equity, aggressive expansion and a restaurant-as-marketing for a big liquor brand might result in lackluster food? Probably not.But the dearth of quality Mexican cooking in Australia means that the public is even more reliant on its trusted chefs to provide worthy examples. The food at Bar Patr\u00f3n is not awful; it\u2019s just boring. It is just one example of an industry bolstered by celebrity and coasting on the good will of a dining public hungry for something new.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}

After he paid for the mints and placed them in his left jacket pocket, an off-duty police officer behind him pulled out his handgun, pointed it at his feet and accused him of stealing them.\u201cIt made me angry,\u201d Mr. Arreola, 49, said on Monday. \u201cI felt this fear and thought of my wife. My wife might become a widow tonight.\u201dThe night started when Mr. Arreola, who was on his way to a club with his wife, pulled into a Chevron station in Buena Park in Orange County, Calif. He got $60 out of an A.T.M., then remembered that his wife had asked for mints.Standing in front of the cashier, Mr. Arreola scanned a row of candy bars, sweets and gum before reaching for a roll of Mentos. \u201cHow much are these?\u201d Mr. Arreola asked the man behind the counter. The cashier told him they were $1.19.The transaction on March 16, which was recorded by the gas station\u2019s security camera, was entirely uneventful until the off-duty officer, who works for the Buena Park Police Department, entered the store. He missed the part when Mr. Arreola handed over $20 for the Mentos.\u201cHey, put that back,\u201d the officer said as he lifted his sweatshirt and pulled a handgun from his waistband. \u201cPut it back. Police officer.\u201d\u201cI just paid for this,\u201d Mr. Arreola responded.The misunderstanding was resolved in about 35 seconds \u2014 the officer put away his gun and apologized \u2014 but it was long enough to taint Mr. Arreola\u2019s perception of the police and to land the officer in an internal investigation.Mr. Arreola said that after the encounter, he filed a complaint with the Police Department against the officer, who has not been identified. The department offered last week to settle the dispute, Mr. Arreola said, but he declined the deal because the amount would have only covered his legal fees.Across the United States, police departments have come under intense scrutiny in recent years over the use of force and treatment of minorities. The worst actions by police officers are sometimes captured on cellphone video and quickly shared on social media, fueling a distrust toward law enforcement.John DeCarlo, a former police chief and an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven, said that he reminds police officers to treat everyone they encounter with respect, from mundane interactions to very intense ones.Everyday encounters, like seeing an officer in a gas station, shape people\u2019s overall perceptions of the police, he said. \u201cWe have an innate fear of police to begin with,\u201d Mr. DeCarlo said. \u201cIt\u2019s about treating people how you want to be treated.\u201dMr. DeCarlo was startled as he watched the security footage of the off-duty Buena Park police officer. \u201cOh my goodness,\u201d he said as he watched the officer retrieve his gun. \u201cHoly mackerel.\u201dHe said that the officer violated the most basic rules governing the use of force by the police. No matter the situation, officers should issue verbal commands first. Pulling out a gun should be a last resort.\u201cWhat the officer did was incredibly inappropriate,\u201d he said.Chief Sianez said that the actions by the officer were under review. He did not respond to an email on Monday asking whether the officer was still on active duty or if he had been placed on leave during the investigation.\u201cI can definitely assure you that our investigation will be thorough,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the officer is found to be in violation of any policies and procedures, he will be held accountable.\u201dMichael Scott, a former police officer who teaches criminal justice at Arizona State University, said the encounter was troubling on many levels.The officer, who was wearing athletic clothes, was not easily identifiable as the police, and he pulled out his gun and accused Mr. Arreola of stealing before he knew whether a crime had been committed.\u201cI can sympathize with a young officer\u2019s instincts to want to intervene off duty in what he perceives to be a crime,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cBut good judgment, combined with restrictive policies and training in those policies, are needed precisely to prevent the problems depicted in this incident.\u201dSusan C.

She checked into the neoclassical Federal Trade Commission Building in the nation\u2019s capital, with Pippa in tow, as one of the country\u2019s top business regulators \u2014 and the first to do the job with a baby in the office.For the next several weeks, until Pippa goes to day care as a slightly older baby, she will join Ms. Slaughter on the fifth floor, either in a gray bouncy seat behind a desk or nestled in a wrap attached to her mother\u2019s chest. It was the imperfect but best solution for Ms. Slaughter, whose appointment in March to serve as an F.T.C. commissioner just happened to coincide with the birth of her third child.\u201cI am tired,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said as she put on a nursing cover for a late morning feeding. \u201cI don\u2019t feel superhuman. I feel like a mom who has a career about which she cares very much and a family about which she cares very much. And I\u2019m trying to navigate the two.\u201dMs. Slaughter, a longtime legal adviser to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, didn\u2019t think about turning down the job offer. She did have some doubts about how she could pull off the schedule of raising three children and taking a senior position in government, but the opportunity was too good to pass up.The work culture for families has been stubbornly slow to change in Washington. To take a position of leadership in federal agencies, on Capitol Hill or in the White House requires long and unpredictable hours. Modest pay, demanding travel and meager family leave benefits also deter many women from rising in the government ranks.Such considerations have held back female representation in every corner of government. Women comprise 20 percent of Congress. They hold a quarter of the cabinet posts in the Trump administration.But recently, there have been signs of change. The federal government has slowly reconfigured buildings to accommodate new moms, with lactation rooms at most agencies and in Congress. In April, Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, became the first member of the Senate to deliver a baby during her tenure. Shortly after, lawmakers changed the rules to allow children on the Senate floor.But Ms. Slaughter does have an office that allows her to nurse the baby and pump in private, and for Pippa to nap in quiet. She divides most household duties with her husband, Justin Slaughter, a political and business consultant.\u201cBringing a baby to work is not the right choice for every mom or dad, nor do many have that option,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said.Three months ago, Ms. Slaughter, who goes by Becca, was working as the top lawyer for Mr. Schumer. After a decade working in his office, she was asked to consider filling an empty Democratic slot at the trade commission.Pippa was born on April 2. Ideally, Ms. Slaughter would have had a longer maternity leave, like she did with her two older children when working for Mr. Schumer. Each day since her nomination in April has felt like a \u201cconfluence of high-intensity events\u201d that she approaches day by day, she said.As part of her nomination, she testified before senators nine days after giving birth to Pippa. She made sure to feed the baby minutes before the hearing in case it ran extra long. Her husband held Pippa in the carrier during the hearing.\u201cI kept telling myself the only way out is through. I have to get through it if I want to be on the other side of this,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said of the two-hour hearing. \u201cIf I want to have this amazing baby and job then I need to put my head down and get through it.\u201dBefore her first day, she informed the four other F.T.C. commissioners about her plan to bring Pippa to the office and received their unanimous support. She organizes her days accordingly, only accepting meetings and speaking engagements where she can take the baby. Two weeks ago, she appeared onstage at a privacy conference hosted by the Future of Privacy Forum for a question-and-answer session. Pippa shared the stage, asleep in her carrier.\u201cBoth Becca and Pippa are wonderful additions to the F.T.C. family,\u201d the agency\u2019s chairman, Joe Simons, a Republican, said in an email. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that Becca made the decision to begin her tenure as a commissioner so soon after the birth of her daughter.\u201dThe work itself is right in her sweet spot. Ms. Slaughter spent much of her time in Mr. Schumer\u2019s office working on consumer protection and antitrust issues, and is now on the F.T.C. amid an uproar of the practices of Silicon Valley giants. The agency is investigating Facebook\u2019s privacy practices and Equifax\u2019s massive data breach. Consumer groups and smaller tech rivals have called on the F.T.C. to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon amid growing antitrust concerns.It is unclear whether Ms. Slaughter\u2019s decision to bring Pippa to the F.T.C. will pave the way for other high-level government officials to combine work and motherhood. Some \u2014 but not all \u2014 agencies have day care on-site, and government employees aren\u2019t guaranteed spots for their children.But Ms. Slaughter\u2019s male colleagues say her decision helps all working parents. Noah Phillips, a Republican commissioner and parent of young children, said it was important for the F.T.C. staff to know that Pippa would be a daily fixture.\u201cIt sends good signals in a lot of different ways,\u201d he said.Three weeks into the job at the F.T.C., some of the adrenaline has begun to wear off. Sleep deprivation was setting in.Ms. Slaughter is trying to spend more time with her older children as they adjust to her job change and their new younger sibling. She\u2019s determined to attend a baby and me yoga class at least once a week during the lunch hour. For now, she isn\u2019t planning to attend out-of-town speeches and conferences or the dinners and cocktail parties that typically attract government officials.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help anyone when you try to make it look easy,\u201d said Stephanie Martz, a former chief counsel for Mr. Schumer who is also a mother of three children and a close confidant of Ms. Slaughter\u2019s. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go on that trip to Europe. And you need to conquer your doubts.\u201dOn the recent Monday morning, Ms. Slaughter walked with Pippa in the carrier to a nearby restaurant for a business lunch. Then mother and baby were back in the office for several meetings and a block of time to go over papers on cases pending before the F.T.C. She kept her promise to leave the office by 5 p.m. to have dinner with family at home. But she was online again after the two older children were asleep around 8 p.m.By 10 p.m., she was in bed.\u201cIt\u2019s like a marathon,\u201d she said of her day. The race would begin again in about four hours.An earlier version of this article misidentified Senator Tammy Duckworth as the first member of Congress to deliver a baby during her tenure. She was the first senator to do so.Advertisement"}

Minh Uong, a visual editor for The Times\u2019s business section, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.Can you explain your creative process for making and planning illustrations for The Times?Being the visual editor for the business section, I\u2019m responsible for providing artwork that illuminates stories that are hard to photograph. It\u2019s a challenging task at times, since our section features articles with topics that are difficult to visualize. Try to think of images that relate to private equity, net neutrality or the trade deficit.I doodled my first thought in my sketchbook using a black Paper Mate pen showing people stealing and running away with images of Mark and Sheryl. Then I sketched a different concept showing a group of scammers hiding behind Mark and Sheryl masks.My second sketch got approved. To finish the illustration would require some time to draw the masks of Mark and Sheryl. I was planning to use Adobe\u2019s drawing program, Illustrator, and my old 10-inch Wacom tablet. But with only a few hours before our print deadline, I decided to pursue creating the art with photography instead, and needed to create props for people to hold during a photo shoot.So I printed out 10 full-size faces of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg on our color Canon copier-printer combo. I trimmed them with my X-Acto knife. Luckily, I had saved disposable chopsticks from my Chinese takeout orders, and they made perfect handles for the masks. I proceeded to Scotch tape all the chopsticks to the back of each mask.After I finished with the props, I wrangled eight colleagues to be in our photo shoot. We went to our in-house photo studio in the basement, where our staff photographer tried several lighting techniques to capture the moody and surreal picture.You also hire illustrators for The Times. Have tech tools like the iPad and Apple Pencil, or Microsoft\u2019s Surface tablets, made it easier for people to draw things and lowered the barrier to entry for becoming a professional illustrator?But I believe you still need certain artistic skills to become an illustrator. You need to have a discerning eye and to be able to communicate by creating a visual vocabulary that\u2019s uniquely your own. As an illustrator, you have to establish your point of view to solve problems and to go beyond just tracing a picture.Are the works by illustrators you commission created by pen and paper or on the computer?Time is of the essence when dealing with editorial illustration. Today, most artists are tech savvy. Some will start their project using traditional techniques like drawing in ink or painting with acrylics. Then they finalize it in Photoshop or a graphics program. This ultimately will save a lot of time.Working digitally makes it even easier to send in the final artwork. Before, I used to wait for overnight packages from FedEx or U.P.S. Now artists can take work right until the deadline and then just send their projects by email.The beauty of that is the artists get to keep their original work. And since The Times buys only the first-time printing rights, original artwork has to be sent back to its creators. I don\u2019t miss having to repackage artwork to send back to people in the mail.Have you tried doing your entire workflow on a tech product such as the iPad or a drawing tablet? Is there anything that tech companies could do to improve their products to get you to adopt a completely digital workflow?I wish there were a better tablet out there that could convert my sketches into editable vector images while I am drawing. There could be one out there that I\u2019m not aware of.Outside of work, what tech products do you and your family use heavily? As for me, I stare at my monitor at work all day. When I\u2019m home, I try to limit my time playing with other devices. But I\u2019m perfectly content with my iPhone. Every day, I enjoy using the usual apps, such as YouTube, Google Maps, Words With Friends, Pinterest \u2014 and of course The Times\u2019s app!Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Uncertainty Lingers, Italy\u2019s Populists May Give Talks Another Shot", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNor was the fact that Mr. Mattarella had only days ago called on Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund official and spending hawk, to form a technical government to guide Italy to a new election.Mr. Cottarelli, who is unlikely to win a confidence vote in Parliament, had informal morning and afternoon meetings with Mr. Mattarella in the Quirinal Palace. But instead of presenting a list of cabinet picks, he apparently decided to hold off to see if the parties that won a majority of the votes in elections in March could find a way out of their impasse, according to the Italian news agency ANSA late Tuesday night.The developments for which Mr. Cottarelli was waiting were still developing Wednesday afternoon, but they seemed to reflect a significant shift of power within the populist alliance.Nevertheless, he met with Mr. Mattarella, the president he had only days earlier called responsible for the darkest night in Italian democracy.In one of his now regularly scheduled Facebook Live video streams after the meeting, Mr. Di Maio proposed that Paolo Savona, the eurosceptic economist whom Mr. Mattarella found objectionable as finance minister, take on another position in the cabinet and that an unidentified new choice \u201cof the same caliber\u201d take the position of finance minister.He said that his party was on board with this solution, and \u201cnow it depends on the other political force,\u201d meaning the League. \u201cIf they are O.K. with it,\u201d he said, the alliance would ask Mr. Mattarella to allow their alliance\u2019s original choice for prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, to try to form a government.With his support skyrocketing over the course of the more than 85 days of negotiations, he continued to call for new elections as he hit the campaign trail in Pisa, Genoa and other Italian cities on Wednesday, assuring his supporters that one way or another, the League would end up in the government.But simultaneous negotiations with the Five Star Movement seemed to center on a top official in his party, Giancarlo Giorgetti, taking the position of prime minister. Some analysts speculated that Mr. Salvini coveted the position himself, and that he had the leverage of Mr. Savona, and his own popularity, to force the Five Star leadership to accept.The Five Star Movement, reluctant to give up its primacy in the alliance, after winning nearly a third of the Italian vote, is resisting, according to reports in the Italian press. And Mr. Mattarella, who is very much an audience of one for all of the political performances, would also have to sign off.The very notion of a government taking power in Italy seemed to assure the markets after Italian bonds, especially short-term ones, plummeted in the markets. The fears of new elections leading to an exit from the euro prompted the most significant dip in two-year yields in more than 20 years.Central to the populists\u2019 case for receiving a mandate from Mr. Mattarella is their assertion that they never wanted to leave the euro. \u201cIf the markets fear that Italy leave the euro, it\u2019s because someone put around that rumor that this government wanted to leave the euro, but our will was never that,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said Tuesday night. \u201cWe have never conspired to leave the euro, never!\u201d he said in his Facebook post.But the internet is rife with examples of Mr. Di Maio, his party\u2019s co-founder Beppe Grillo, and other top Five Star officials calling either for a referendum on the euro or for leaving the currency outright.In one video, a dejected young Italian looks sadly at the euro in his hand and tosses it into a fountain. He then imagines all the buying power he\u2019d have with a 1,000 lire bill. Then the camera focuses on high-heeled boots moving toward him on the cobblestones, and scans up to reveal a top Five Star official, Paola Taverna, appearing like a fairy godmother. She turns the euro in his hand into that 1,000 lire bill, and tells him that the Five Star Movement can make his dreams come true and it is \u201cpossible to leave the euro.\u201d A thousand lira would be valued at a fraction of a euro.Mr. Salvini said this week that neither he, nor his pick for finance minister, wanted to leave the euro. But in prior interviews, Mr. Salvini has clearly stated he wanted Italy out of the euro and has even failed to rule out leaving the European Union.In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Salvini said: \u201cLeave the euro? Surely yes. Tomorrow morning. Once the monetary sovereignty is retaken, one can make a last attempt to renegotiate all of the treaties, Maastricht, Schengen, Dublin and Lisbon.\u201d Those treaties are the lifeblood of the European Union.Amid a remarkably fluid and high-stakes situation, Italian analysts contemplated a variety of outcomes. Anything seemed possible for the moment, and if Mr. Mattarella decided that the country should go to new elections, either this summer or in early fall, it was not clear what the alliances would be.If Five Star and the League entered into new elections as an alliance and vowed not to leave the euro, which is still relatively popular in Italy, they were nearly assured a landslide victory.The League would also have the flexibility to reunite with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in the center-right coalition with which it ran in March, but this time its nearly 30 percent of the vote, according to recent polls, would make it the undisputed leader of that alliance.Speaking at one of his many campaign events across Italy on Wednesday, Mr. Salvini told an adoring crowd, \u201cMy patience is at the limit.\u201d He was not alone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In India, Journalists Face Slut-Shaming and Rape Threats", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Ayyub is an\u00a0Indian journalist.Like many of my colleagues, I regularly write and speak about the violence against India\u2019s minorities and lower-caste groups and have called out Mr. Modi\u2019s silence on the violence and his dog-whistle politics.Yet nothing had prepared me for what was thrown at me in the past month. On April 22, I was alarmed to find a quotation supporting child rapists falsely attributed to me and going viral on Twitter. A parody account of Republic TV, India\u2019s leading right-wing television network, had posted the quotation.I tweeted a clarification about the falsehood to no avail: My social media accounts and my phone were inundated with WhatsApp messages urging others to gang-rape me. Various leaders of Mr. Modi\u2019s party, who promoted the lie, refused to delete their tweets despite my pointing it out.The following day, on April 23, another tweet was generated using Photoshop and attributed to me. \u201cI hate India and Indians,\u201d it said. The online mob asked me to pack my bags and leave for Pakistan, some threatened to tear my clothes and drag me out of the country while invoking the genocidal violence between Hindus and Muslims during the partition of India in 1947.In the evening, an activist from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Hindu nationalist mother ship, alerted me to a scurrilous pornographic video being shared on various WhatsApp groups. He had received it from a group with many Bharatiya Janata Party members: a two-minute, 20-second pornographic video of a sex act with my face morphed onto another woman.Despite our political differences, he was upset at this new low. He urged me to take legal action to keep it from spreading further.A minute later, he shared the video with me. I was with a friend in a cafe in New Delhi. I saw the first two frames and froze. I wanted to vomit and fought tears. My friend got me a glass of water. \u201cHow could they?\u201d I threw up and burst into tears.I called a friend who worked in tech forensics. He said it was a clear fake, probably produced with a new app called Deepfake. His words did not console me. The video was on my phone and on numerous others across the country.Minutes later, my social media timelines and notifications were filled with screenshots of the video. Some commented on how prostitution was my forte. I went into a frenzy blocking them, but they were everywhere, on my Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts. Some commenters asked what I charged for sex, others described my body. Many claiming to be nationalist Hindus sent pictures of themselves naked.I started getting screenshots from friends of a Twitter account created in my name. I was doxxed. A tweet with my name, picture, phone number and address was being circulated. \u201cI am available,\u201d it said. Someone sent my father a screenshot of the video. He was silent on the phone while I cried. After a while he spoke in a sad, heavy voice. \u201cI am surprised this did not happen earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to break you. The choice is yours.\u201dI asked a friend to take charge of my Facebook account and send me screenshots and links of every message posted to my inbox. The reporter in me wanted the digital record, but I shuddered every time my phone beeped.I have no way of finding out who produced the video. What I do know is this: Most of the Twitter handles and Facebook accounts that posted the pornographic video and screenshots identify themselves as fans of Mr. Modi and his party, and argue for turning India into a \u201cHindu rashtra\u201d \u2014 a country for Hindus only, where religious minorities have almost no rights. I reported several of those accounts to the cybercrime section of the Delhi Police.That night the administrator of a Facebook page called Varah Sena wrote, \u201cSee, Rana, what we spread about you; this is what happens when you write lies about Modi and Hindus in India.\u201d The comment was posted along with the concocted video on Facebook and Twitter. (The page was deleted after I filed the police complaint.)The slut-shaming and hatred felt like being punished by a mob for my work as a journalist, an attempt to silence me. It was aimed at humiliating me, breaking me by trying to define me as a \u201cpromiscuous,\u201d \u201cimmoral\u201d woman.Mr. Modi has repeatedly talked about changing Indian lives through technology. Four years into his term, his followers have indeed found a vigorous use for technology: curtailing criticism and normalizing hatred and misogyny.Rana Ayyub is the author of \u201cGujarat Files: Anatomy of a Cover Up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bernstein.\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Mr. Musk responded, according to a Bloomberg transcript of the call. \u201cNext. Boring bonehead questions are not cool. Next?\u201dTesla\u2019s stock price fell 5.6 percent the next day.On May 11, a Tesla sedan with a semiautonomous Autopilot feature rear-ended a truck at 60 miles per hour, leaving the driver with a broken right ankle and a totaled car.In a tweet that would foreshadow his complaints to come, Mr. Musk said: \u201cIt\u2019s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage.\u201dMr. Musk has been on something of a Twitter rampage the last few days as well.On Wednesday afternoon, the news website Electrek published an article that appears to have perfectly captured Mr. Musk\u2019s mounting frustration with the media.The article pointed out that \u201cthe media has been having a field day with Tesla crashes and Model 3 delays lately, which has affected the company\u2019s stock,\u201d and it highlighted a note put out by an auto analyst for the financial services firm Baird.The note argued that all the negative reports are \u201cincreasingly immaterial\u201d and that because \u201cwe have hit a peak in negative coverage/sentiment,\u201d the company\u2019s stock could rally as that sentiment improves.Mr. Musk retweeted a link to the article and commented: \u201cThe holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them.\u201dBy about 8:42 p.m., Mr. Musk had sent more than two dozen tweets and was still going.

{"Headline": "Why Traditional TV Is in Trouble", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTelevision networks will draw hordes of advertisers to New York City this week for their annual bonanza of presentations and parties, a decades-old tradition known as the upfronts that is meant to dazzle marketers and loosen their purse strings.But beneath the sparkle and the canap\u00e9s, the networks are also navigating a serious advertising upheaval. Ratings are on the decline, especially among young people, some of whom don\u2019t even own televisions. It\u2019s hard to keep up with the many devices and apps people now use to watch shows. And there is a host of material from Silicon Valley that is competing for viewers\u2019 attention, including Google\u2019s YouTube, Facebook and Netflix. It all adds up to a precarious situation for broadcast TV.Advertising on TV has long been the best way for marketers to reach a large number of people at one time. And it is still a formidable medium. But cracks are showing.National TV ad sales peaked in 2016, when they exceeded $43 billion, according to data from Magna, the ad-buying and media intelligence arm of IPG Mediabrands. Sales fell 2.2 percent last year, and the firm estimates that they will fall at least 2 percent each year through 2022.Some of the decline could be mitigated through new business with platforms like Hulu, but \u201cit\u2019s not yet enough to upset the decrease of traditional sales,\u201d said Vincent Letang, Magna\u2019s executive vice president of global market intelligence. At the same time, he said, while networks have raised the cost of advertising on their airwaves in recent years, ratings have declined sharply, including some in unexpected areas like the National Football League.TV is still a good value for plenty of advertisers. Mr. Letang said pharmaceuticals and personal care products were increasing their presences on TV. But the combination of rising prices and falling viewership is giving some big brands pause.As TV ad spending has begun to drop, marketers have been diverting more money to tech giants like Google and Facebook, which have increasingly focused on expanding their video \u2014 and video ad \u2014 business.Old Navy has long been a prominent TV advertiser, and television remains crucial to the company\u2019s marketing. But the way Old Navy defines TV advertising has evolved, said Jamie Gersch, its chief marketing officer.Those opting out of traditional TV packages are watching Netflix and videos on Amazon Prime, and to a lesser extent, paying for services like Dish Network\u2019s Sling TV, according to Kagan, a media research group within S&P Global Market Intelligence.As networks navigate these changes, they are moving to reduce the number of ads they show. Ads, after all, make money, but they also annoy viewers. Last year, the average number of commercial minutes during an hour of broadcast TV was 13.6, according to Nielsen data.So if there are fewer commercials, how do companies market their products?Ralph Heim, vice president of media and sponsorships at Sonic Drive-In, said he was intrigued by several of the new data targeting products for television ads. But he remains concerned about how the announcements on limited ads fit with a declining audience.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to create a more premium advertising experience for advertisers, and they\u2019re hoping that people will pay more,\u201d even though the audience is smaller, Mr. Heim said.He added, \u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re following the eyeballs, right?\u201dAdvertisement"}

One reason may be to assuage lawmakers who do not favor making concessions on ZTE to China. As Shawn Donnan of the FT wrote:Another possible reason for re-introducing the $50 billion of tariffs: China is not giving as much ground as the Trump administration wants on a wide range of trade issues. By rolling out the threat again, the U.S. may hope to extract more concessions in negotiations before they wrap up.This appears to be the first time the administration has set itself some sort of deadline for imposing the tariffs against China.Imagine it is the second half of June and China has not agreed to significant, concrete concessions. Mr. Trump could choose to impose the tariffs, an unmistakably hostile act that would mark the beginnings of a trade war with China, which has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs.So far, the public has not been able to tell what the Trump administration really wants. In two weeks, that may be possible.\u2014 Peter EavisThe $66 billion union of the two can move forward, after the department imposed what it called the biggest-ever divestiture of assets for a merger approval.What\u2019s notable about the announcements is that they fall in line with the antitrust philosophy of Makan Delrahim, the department\u2019s antitrust chief. They emphasize \u201cstructural\u201d changes to the company \u2014 as in sales of businesses \u2014 rather than \u201cbehavioral\u201d remedies, in which companies agree to change their conduct.To Mr. Delrahim\u2019s mind, the behavioral approach, which was used in Comcast\u2019s takeover of NBCUniversal, makes the Justice Department an ongoing regulator. That\u2019s something that he has said the department would not do.What Mr. Delrahim said of Tuesday\u2019s agreement:\u201cThis comprehensive structural solution to significant horizontal and vertical competition concerns\u2014the largest merger divestiture ever required by the United States\u2014preserves competition in the sale of these critical agricultural products and protects American farmers and consumers,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. \u201cWe commend the parties for working with the Antitrust Division to resolve our concerns on behalf of American consumers.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedHis suggested fix for the refugee crisis: no defined quotas for the numbers of immigrants that nations should accept, and an E.U.-led \u201cMarshall Plan for Africa\u201d that would help African governments to provide education and employment for citizens so as to reduce emigration.But that runs counter to the E.U.\u2019s current austerity drive, so Mr. Soros also suggests a way to help it spend more:Without going into the details, I want to point out that the proposal contains an ingenious device, a special-purpose vehicle, that would enable the E.U. to tap financial markets at a very advantageous rate without incurring a direct obligation for itself or for its member states; it also offers considerable accounting benefits. Moreover, although it is an innovative idea, it has already been used successfully in other contexts, namely general-revenue municipal bonds in the US and so-called surge funding to combat infectious diseases.Finally, to keep nations like Britain from leaving the E.U., Soros argues that the bloc must restyle itself as a club that it\u2019s attractive to belong to:Such a Europe would differ from the current arrangements in two key respects. First, it would clearly distinguish between the EU and the eurozone. Second, it would recognize that the euro has many unsolved problems, which must not be allowed to destroy the European project.All this, Mr. Soros argues, could create a union where countries are both able to assert their sovereignty while also collaborating on joint goals more effectively.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation\u2019s government says it may ban the social network for an entire month, and authorities around the world will be watching to see how the experiment plays out.But with governments in America, Europe, and the rest of the world all struggling to work out how to police the social network, the results could prove fascinating \u2014 and postnatally influential \u2014 around the world.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeMaking smartphones that do more might not necessarily encourage people to buy a new one. But it could nevertheless help Apple become the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar company.People already use their iPhone to download new apps, pay for things, subscribe to music and video services, and more \u2014 and Apple takes a small but important slice of those software purchases, payments and subscriptions (though, in the final case, only if they're bought through the app store.)The company also makes a healthy revenue from its own services, such as Apple Music and iCloud. In total, the FT notes, Apple\u2019s revenue from these kinds of services has doubled in four years, and Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, hopes that the company will generate $50 billion per year from them by the end of 2020.Fast forward to the next iPhone, due out later this year. We don\u2019t yet know what it will do, but it sounds like it could help you swipe your way into the office. It might have extra augmented reality features, which could, for instance, power new kinds of online shopping. Improved processors could help it perform more complicated artificial intelligence tasks that new apps could make use of to automate your workday tasks. Some of those advances would likely also give rise to new software features that might trickle down into current top-of-the-range iPhones.Would those features make people head out to upgrade their phone? Perhaps. Would they allow both in-house and third-party developers to build new services that Apple can skim money off of? Certainly.\u2014 Jamie Condliffe\u201cWith more than 10,000 customers and 6,000 employees, BMC is a global leader in managing digital and I.T. infrastructure with a broad portfolio of software solutions,\u201d Herald Chen, the head of KKR\u2019s technology, media and telecom team, and John Park, another KKR executive, said in a statement.In this case, KKR is buying BMC from Bain Capital, Golden Gate Capital, Singapore\u2019s G.I.C. sovereign wealth fund, Insight Venture Partners and Elliott Management.The advisers on the deal: For BMC: Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.For KKR: Macquarie Capital and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.Financing will come from Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, Macquarie and Mizuho.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedCTRL-Labs, a three-year-old start-up whose co-founders include the creator of Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer browser, has a vision of how humans could one day interact with computers: It\u2019s making an armband that reads electrical impulses sent from users\u2019 brains to their fingers.\u201cIf we can recreate virtually what the hand is doing, then we\u2019ve captured all the information that\u2019s coming out of the muscles themselves,\u201d Thomas Reardon, a CTRL-Labs co-founder and the Internet Explorer creator, told me in an interview. (Mr. Reardon argued that smartphones actually represented a step backward, introducing an imperfect way to control computers even as it let consumers gobble up more information.)And the start-up has signed up some heavyweight investors. In this round: Lux Capital and Google\u2019s GV venture arm, as well as Paul Allen\u2019s Vulcan Capital, Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, and Amazon\u2019s Alexa Fund.Josh Wolfe of Lux Capital told me, \u201cThe gap between sci-fi and sci-fact keeps shrinking.\u201dThe big questionI saw a demo of the device, where Patrick Kaifosh, another CTRL-Labs co-founder played Asteroids by just thinking. And another employee sent a somewhat creepy-looking spider robot across a table without moving a finger.But brain-computer interfaces are notoriously hard to push out of prototype. Can CTRL-Labs do it? And will developers and consumers buy in if they can?\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe coffee shop giant will close 8,000 stores for four hours this afternoon. Why? To put employees through racial bias training. The move has drawn jeers, but Andrew argues it\u2019s a laudable effort \u2014 if only because so few American corporations have been willing to tackle race issues.Having spoken with senior executives at many large American companies, I found it hard to find one that has taken on the issue of race so directly, with so many employees. Other corporations have programs to improve race relations and have spent money on diversity programs, especially for those in the senior ranks. Some, including Facebook and Google, have included implicit bias training. But few, if any, have taken as sweeping an approach as Starbucks will on Tuesday.All eyes have been on the E.U.\u2019s sweeping new digital privacy rules. But an even stricter set of laws known as ePrivacy \u2014 meant to come in at the same time as the General Data Protection Regulation, but slowed down by disagreements among officials \u2014 could give tech companies still larger headaches.The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users\u2019 electronic communications: obtaining consumers\u2019 explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.Unsurprisingly, companies and trade associations are trying to derail those rules.C.E.O.

By tradition, the finished couscous, heaped with whole chickpeas and great logs of carrots, is scooped from a communal plate and rolled between the thumb and the first two fingers, to make a ready mouthful.Here there are spoons but the same seemingly bottomless dish. And the same generosity of spirit: When I arrived for lunch on a recent Friday, the grate was still half pulled down, but a cook peeked her head out, waved me inside and brought me couscous.Ismail Bourrich and his wife, Bouchra Salmi, natives of Morocco \u2014 he from Casablanca, she from Essaouira, both along the coast \u2014 opened Bab Marrakech last June in what was once a Chinese-Mexican spot. The restaurant\u2019s name honors one of the gateways to Casablanca\u2019s old medina; guests pass through an arched wooden door into the dining room.The chef, Malika Hakmoun, grew up in Marrakesh. Hers is an art of expansive comfort, materializing in great plates of meat. A treble clef of lamb shank, the flesh easily tugged off the bone, is long braised with giant fattened prunes and slivered almonds strewn like petals. There are whiffs of cinnamon and jam, along with a hot-sweet streak of ginger.Half a chicken, breast and leg, comes perfumed with rounds of preserved lemon, salted in-house and steeped in their own juices for six months, until what\u2019s left is just the bloom of sun and a gentle, tamed sourness. Green olives add brine and Moroccan saffron an enveloping musk.(Note that the menu repeats itself: Mr. Bourrich explained that chicken m\u2019kelli and chicken tagine, listed separately, were the same dish; likewise lamb shank and lamb tagine. \u201cThe difference is the plate,\u201d he said: The distinctive terra-cotta tagine has a broad, shallow base and a lid rising to a funnel, allowing the steam to condense and feed back into the food below.)Elsewhere on the table you will want zaalouk, eggplant grilled until its pores leak smoke, then mashed with tomato and garlic; and house-made merguez, compact links of ground beef ticking with harissa, the Moroccan chile paste whose heat starts off slow and radiates.Ms. Hakmoun offers two versions of bastilla, a meat pie made in Morocco with sheer, flexible sheets of dough called ouarka \u2014 literally, paper. Here she uses similarly delicate phyllo, tucking it around a velvety mix of shredded chicken and scrambled eggs. The pastry arrives in a snowfall of icing sugar, crosshatched with cinnamon and crowned by almonds, their bitter edge smoothed by orange-blossom water.The other bastilla shares only the outer form, with no trace of sweetness. Inside is a hash of shrimp and whatever white fish is fresh that day, along with curling vermicelli noodles, mushrooms turned meaty and a thick reduction of tomatoes. Harissa, olives and preserved lemons make it hot, salty and sour at once. A yolk, broken on top, gives it a burnish in the oven.The restaurant\u2019s hours shift during the holy month of Ramadan, which begins on May 15 this year. Doors open at 2 p.m., but for takeout only; meals are served from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. \u2014 the time for nourishment after one day\u2019s fast, before the start of another.Whenever the meal, it\u2019s brought to a close with Chinese gunpowder tea, brewed first alone and then again with bright mint leaves crowded into the pot. It\u2019s meant to be poured from on high, so it foams in the glass; the air it catches on the way down is said to enhance the flavor, and the height is a gesture of respect. (Attendants to Morocco\u2019s royal court have been said to pour tea while standing on a ladder.)With tea may appear an unexpected plate of cookies, a gift from Ms. Salmi, including chebakia, strips of dough interlaced to suggest a rose and deep-fried, or twice-baked fekkas, crumbly and akin to biscotti. Better yet is m\u2019smen, a square of flatbread made of wheat flour with semolina kneaded in, stretched by hand and folded repeatedly, each layer painted with butter.The bread is thin but dense, its corners lovely to gnaw on. It\u2019s as good eaten plain during the meal as after, with a shimmer of honey.An earlier version of this article, using information from the restaurant\u2019s owner, misspelled the surname of the chef. She is Malika Hakmoun, not Hakmoune.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Metrics Are Everywhere in Media. Here\u2019s How They Help.", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Kathy Zhang, a newsroom and product analytics manager, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.Your team helps Times reporters analyze data about stories and readers. What kind of tech do you use to do that, and what information do you review? The Times uses a few different technologies to measure readership and behavior within our website and apps. The primary tool we use is an internal analytics system that powers the bulk of our analysis and dashboards. This system also underpins a newsroom tool called Stela, which provides story- and department-level analytics snapshots.We also use tools like Chartbeat and Google Analytics for the same purposes, because they have user interfaces that non-analysts can also use to inform their work. Editors use Chartbeat to understand real-time readership of our stories and Google Analytics to pull trends and reports over a longer period of time.What do you like about the tools, and what could be better?All of these tools hold essentially the same information, so it really comes down to personal preference and familiarity with the data and functions. Some of these tools may be better to use, depending on the questions I\u2019m trying to answer.I run Google Analytics training sessions for the newsroom, and something I try to make clear is that learning how to use the tool \u2014 in terms of which buttons to click and which settings to modify \u2014 is going to get us only so far. Understanding the underlying data and which pieces of it will answer your question will always be more important. Simply figuring out the number of pageviews any story received is easy. Trying to place that metric in context of what we might expect for that story is more difficult, because many factors play into the pageviews and reach of what any one story achieves.We need to consider the promotion strategy behind the story. Did we give the story prominent placement on the home screen? Did our social media team post it to Facebook? Did we share it in any newsletters? We also need to consider the kind of story it is. Is it breaking news? Is it an investigative story? Is it a movie review? The timeliness of the story is another consideration. Is the story pegged to a news event where we would expect nearly all of the traffic to come in on the first day? Or is it a story we would expect more of a long tail for because it\u2019s service journalism or a piece that would sustain steady search traffic?The tools we use all have their pros and cons. As frustrated as I sometimes get navigating suboptimal user interfaces, they\u2019re all solid tools for the work we do and serve different (although often overlapping) purposes.Do analytics help the Times better serve readers, or do they just make us obsessed with pageviews?Several of the masthead editors like to say that The Times strives to be data informed rather than data driven, which I think is an important distinction. We don\u2019t let pageviews dictate our coverage or approach, but we do use data to understand reader engagement and the reach of our stories. Our reporters\u2019 and editors\u2019 news judgment remains the driving force behind the decisions we make for story promotion and distribution. If the story is important, we get it out in front of our readers through prominent home screen placement, push alerts, social media posts and more.But analytics allow us to serve our audience better. Seeing our online readership shift from a predominantly desktop audience to a much larger smartphone audience underscored the need for our product and technology teams to prioritize mobile-first story forms. Looking at page speed allows us to prioritize making our pages load faster so people don\u2019t need to wait to read our stories.Editors are some of our best analytics consumers. They constantly monitor our dashboards to make real-time judgments about how best to engage our readers. News desk editors modify headlines and packaging to draw attention to stories. Search specialists take advantage of trending search terms to expose our stories to a wider audience. Social media editors follow the conversation and find the best moments to showcase our journalism. Analytics are crucial to the full life cycle of our coverage.Though many lament that access to analytics can make a publication hyper-focused on pageview volume to the detriment of reader engagement, at The Times we\u2019re cognizant of those pitfalls, and we structure our analyses to avoid them. The close partnership our newsroom editors have with the analytics team makes both our editors and our analysts think smarter about what our data tells us and how we can best deliver our journalism.Outside of work, what tech product are you using a lot?I was very late to the e-reader wave, but I purchased a Kindle at the beginning of the year and I absolutely love it. After a bit of research, I settled on the Paperwhite and find it incredibly convenient. I can use it one-handed, so it\u2019s easier to read on the train than a physical book. It\u2019s small enough to fit in my coat pocket, so I can get a bit of reading in when I\u2019m standing in line at the grocery store.One of the best things about the Kindle and e-readers in general is their integration with public libraries. Nearly all libraries give their patrons the ability to borrow e-books through an app like Overdrive, Libby or Hoopla. Before I bought my Kindle, I would borrow books from the New York Public Library\u2019s digital library to read on my phone. It\u2019s even better with a dedicated e-reader, because the screen is easier on my eyes and I don\u2019t have other apps to distract me.I credit the Kindle for getting me to read more than I used to. For pre-Kindle me, selecting the next book seemed like such a commitment. If I chose something heavy and serious but I wasn\u2019t in the mood for it, I would carry the book around in my bag for weeks, avoiding it like an email from an ex I had assured we\u2019d stay friends. But now I can carry several books at once and choose something lighthearted or somber or anywhere in between.Advertisement"}

They had dated them, lived with them, married them. Then they had left them, an offense for which the exes punished them for life. A splash of acid and their faces and future were changed forever. Viviana Hernandez, 32, was attacked in 2007 by a drug addict her former husband paid to drench her in acid because she wanted to leave him. Consuelo Cordoba, 56, was asleep when her former partner attacked her in 2002 because he was jealous of her wanting to move to Europe. The acid melted off most of her face, including her nose.The women Ms. Zapata photographed in full color endure physical pain, a lifetime of medical care, lack of independence \u2014 many can\u2019t find work \u2014 and bills. Worst is the lack of freedom to move around in the world without scrutiny, pity or scorn. \u201cI had some experiences while I was in the streets with these women,\u201d Ms. Zapata said. \u201cThere are many people who just stare at them without trying to hide it.\u201d Allowing themselves to be photographed, without control of their image or who might see it, could be seen as an act of courage. \u201cThey are all amazing women, who have struggled a lot already after the attacks,\u201d Ms. Zapata said.In recent years, after relentless efforts by attack victims and advocacy groups, Colombia has toughened penalties for acid attackers. In 2016, it imposed mandatory minimum prison sentences of 12 to 50 years, depending on the severity of the attack. Such laws are working in Pakistan and Bangladesh, where acid attacks have decreased. It is too soon to tell whether Colombia\u2019s justice system will vigorously prosecute attackers and effect change.Ms. Zapata, a former print journalist who earned a master\u2019s degree in photojournalism and documentary photography from the London College of Communication, plans to keep the story current.

{"Headline": "CBS Tries to Sell Its TV Dramas as Its Own Battle Heats Up in Court", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen he took the stage at Carnegie Hall during CBS\u2019s annual presentation to advertisers on Wednesday, Stephen Colbert did not shy away from the topic on the minds of everyone in the audience.\u201cOf course, this year, CBS has the most exciting legal dramas,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso \u2014 some great TV shows.\u201dNot long before the host of CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d appeared onstage, a court chancellor in Delaware offered a ruling on the legal battle between the network and its corporate parent, National Amusements, one that has ensnared the longtime CBS chief executive, Leslie Moonves, and his boss, Shari Redstone, the daughter of the ailing 94-year-old entertainment mogul Sumner M. Redstone.But if executives at CBS and National Amusements believed they would come away from the hastily called hearing with clear answers on which party was in the right, they were sadly mistaken.The Delaware judge effectively declared a cease-fire in the war between the network and its controlling shareholder, Ms. Redstone. The ruling from the bench \u2014 in effect, the judicial version of buying time \u2014 followed a flurry of legal volleys by each side concerning the fate of CBS, which Ms. Redstone hopes to merge with its fellow National Amusements media company, Viacom.CBS had been resisting the attempt by Ms. Redstone to orchestrate the merger. But what had been a cold war started to burn hot on Monday, when a lawyer representing the network and its key board members filed a lawsuit against National Amusements and Ms. Redstone, seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent her from interfering with a special meeting of the CBS board scheduled for Thursday.The board planned to vote on a special stock dividend that would drastically water down the Redstone family\u2019s voting stake at CBS to 17 percent from 79 percent \u2014 a move that would give Mr. Moonves more freedom to reject a merger with Viacom. In its lawsuit, CBS claimed that Ms. Redstone would seek to prevent the meeting and perhaps even replace the members of the board with her allies \u2014 something Ms. Redstone, the vice chairwoman of CBS, has denied.\u201cN.A.I. does not have, and has never had, any intention of replacing the CBS board or taking other action to force a merger,\u201d lawyers for National Amusements said in a filing on Wednesday.Chancellor Andre G. Bouchard of Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery put a temporary halt to the legal wrangling in his decision. Technically, he granted CBS\u2019s request for the temporary restraining order, but with modifications. The judge is expected to issue a more expansive ruling on Thursday concerning whether the result of the CBS board\u2019s planned vote will be allowed to go into effect.Less than an hour before the hearing, Ms. Redstone, 64, issued a change to the CBS bylaws that would grant her more control of the network\u2019s board. That change, too, is now delayed: The judge said that he would issue his legal opinion on Ms. Redstone\u2019s change to the bylaws in his decision on Thursday.The hearing in Delaware took place on a day when CBS was making its annual presentation to advertisers at Carnegie Hall. Mr. Moonves was absent from a press breakfast in New York on Wednesday morning, during which the network unveiled its fall lineup. It was the first time in 22 years that he had been a no-show at the morning gathering of reporters and CBS executives.\u201cLeslie sends his regrets,\u201d Kelly Kahl, the president of CBS\u2019s entertainment division, told the group of reporters.Given the corporate intrigue surrounding the network, Mr. Kahl added that the number of questions he could not answer far exceeded the number of questions he could.At 4:15 p.m., moments after the judge issued the decision to delay the legal battle, Mr. Moonves, 68, took the Carnegie Hall stage to huge roars from the advertisers, who were all too aware of the tensions between one of the industry\u2019s most successful executives and his boss.\u201cGood afternoon, everybody,\u201d Mr. Moonves began.More roars rained down on the stage, before the ad buyers in the room rose from their seats in a standing ovation, a rarity at the annual upfront presentations.Big laughs followed.\u201cAnyway,\u201d he added, \u201cfor years I\u2019ve told you I\u2019m only out here for a few minutes \u2014 and this year, perhaps for the first time, I actually mean it.\u201dThe latest attempt by Ms. Redstone to merge CBS and Viacom started innocently enough, or so it seemed. On Feb. 1, the two companies jointly announced that they would \u201cevaluate a potential combination,\u201d reigniting talks that had fizzled a year earlier.The plan seemed to make sense. In the past year, the Walt Disney Company has agreed to buy most of 21st Century Fox in a deal that would form an entertainment colossus for the age of streaming, and AT&T is pursuing an $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. At the same time, traditional media companies are contending with technology companies like Apple and Facebook that have moved into the entertainment business. And CBS and Viacom had coexisted, in relative peace, as a united company within National Amusements from 2000 to 2006.Cut to little more than three months later: CBS and National Amusements were tussling as lawyers working under the direction of their headstrong leaders filed motions against each other. With the legal decision that is expected to be issued on Thursday, Ms. Redstone and Mr. Moonves are very likely to have a clearer idea of what the future holds for them and their companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveA relationship between a young man and woman with similar illnesses presents unusual challenges. For starters, he can\u2019t speak. This is our reality. I can\u2019t talk to Shannon about anything \u2014 not the weather or her day or how beautiful she is. Worst of all, I can\u2019t tell her I love her.This was never a problem in my previous relationships with women I thought I loved or perhaps didn\u2019t love at all. These women knew my voice; they heard it every day. But they never knew what I was actually thinking.They never knew how miserable my body felt because, back then, I was able to function at a relatively normal level and hide my illness well enough to seem healthy. I could go on dates, talk on the phone and even drive to my girlfriend\u2019s house to spend the night.But over time my condition worsened. Lyme disease had exacerbated my existing case of myalgic encephalomyelitis, an inflammatory multisystem disease that can leave patients unable to speak or eat for years at a time.I\u2019m now 29 and have been sick for eight years, the last three of which I have spent bedridden, mostly speechless and unable to eat solid food. I used to be a bodybuilder who worked out for hours every day, and I was blindsided by the rapid deterioration of my health. I couldn\u2019t care for myself. I had to delay love and many other things while I waited for my health to stabilize.That\u2019s when Shannon came into my life.She lives in Ottawa, about 2,000 miles from my house in California. We met online, which is common, but otherwise our relationship has no precedent or guide. We are two people very much in love but also very sick.Shannon has the same condition I do. She has been sick longer, since adolescence, but thankfully has never lost her ability to speak. Instead, she struggles with unrelenting nausea and has trouble digesting food. She is often malnourished and her weight drops below 100 pounds \u2014 too thin for someone 5 foot 5 inches tall.We both have low blood volume, which makes it difficult for her to walk without fainting and impossible for me to sit up in bed without intense pain and weakness.Since I am bedridden, the only way we can be together is for her to travel across the continent to see me. But even with her willingness to jeopardize her health by traveling so far, we are often away from each other for months at a time.When we are together, we spend weeks in bed, mostly holding each other, our bodies aligned like two pieces of a broken plate glued back together. Because I can\u2019t speak, we often resort to communicating by text messages while cuddling in bed.It\u2019s like a monthlong sleepover and feels surreal, being stuck in a situation so miserable that it could make your skin crawl, but finding comfort knowing that your soul mate is next to you going through something similar. But our experiences differ. Shannon can briefly get up to use the toilet, bathe and, on a good day, make herself a meal. I, on the other hand, have to do everything in bed \u2014 brush my teeth, bathe and use the \u201cbathroom\u201d \u2014 a plastic bag for bowel movements and, for urinating, a dubious-looking plastic container attached to a tube feeding into a bucket on the floor. These are not sexy things but are part of life \u2014 my life and ours together.I was embarrassed at first to ask Shannon to avert her eyes and try not to think of me urinating inches from where we had been kissing just seconds earlier. But I have since come to realize that it\u2019s all part of sharing our lives. It may be far from the bedroom romps we each had experienced before getting sick, but knowing that nothing about my bedridden life makes Shannon uncomfortable endears her to me.In contrast, I have had relationships with women who became upset at the first sign of anything inconvenient \u2014 one girlfriend who threatened to break up with me because she thought my beard trimmings were clogging the bathroom sink, and another who blamed our problems on my insomnia. These failed romances remind me of the baffling incompatibilities two people can have, but also how love can transcend even the most insurmountable obstacles when you find the right person.Before we started our relationship, when we were just two friends with the same illness texting for hours, I asked Shannon, \u201cDo you think two sick people can be together?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cI think when you\u2019re both sick it makes it easier and harder at the same time.\u201d\u201cI guess the downside,\u201d I said, \u201cis there\u2019s no healthy person to take care of you.\u201d\u201cBut when you\u2019re alone there\u2019s no healthy person to take care of you either,\u201d she said.I had never thought about it like that \u2014 the possibility of two sick people being in a successful relationship together. I have always assumed that one person in the couple would need to be healthy. Two sick people can\u2019t take care of each other.But Shannon and I take care of each other in ways I never thought possible. I may not be able to make a meal for her, but I can have takeout delivered. And she may not be able to be my caregiver, but she can post an ad looking for one. We have done these things and many others for each other, from opposite ends of North America.We share an empathy that only two people with the same condition can feel. We know what the other person is going through on bad days; we know how exasperating it is to explain invisible symptoms to doctors only to face skepticism. And we know all too well what it\u2019s like to be immobile in an ever-moving world.Even so, we don\u2019t know everything about each other. We don\u2019t know what we were like as healthy people. We don\u2019t know what differences lie between our current selves and the people we were before getting sick \u2014 what maturation and emotional hardening have occurred during that transformation. Most fundamentally, we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have a vocal conversation with each other. Shannon has never heard my voice. She has never heard me berate a telemarketer or mumble to myself after making a typo. She has never heard me mess up a dinner toast or tell a corny joke. She has never heard me whisper into her ear or come up with a witty reply. She has never heard me ask a question or speak my mind, to anyone.And she may never get to hear me do any of these things, but that\u2019s O.K. Here is this lovely woman, devoid of judgment, who loves me for the words I type to her on my phone.I never loved any of my previous girlfriends the way I love Shannon. I wanted to tell her how much her companionship means to me. I had tried before, many times, without success. Still, I felt I had to try again. Somehow I had to convey, without typing, what I was feeling. My text messages were inadequate, and I thought about using hand signals, but the heart-shaped hand gesture felt far too clich\u00e9d.So I tried to use my voice. To my surprise, for the first time in months, I heard actual sounds coming from my mouth. With my jaw locked, I whispered through clenched teeth, \u201cI \u2026 love \u2026 you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, startled.I took a deep breath and fought back the nearly unbearable pain in my throat and jaw. Tears began to well up in my eyes. I whispered again, this time using all the strength I had: \u201cI \u2026 love \u2026 you.\u201d\u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201dI wasn\u2019t sure what was worse: the emotional torment of not being able to speak or the physical pain of trying. After everything I had been through \u2014 the months of struggling to stay alive in my sickbed \u2014 and finally finding the love of my life, I couldn\u2019t tell Shannon that I loved her.Lucky for me, I didn\u2019t have to. As if straight from a heart-wrenching scene in \u201cLove Story,\u201d Shannon took my hand, gave me a soft kiss and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything. I love you!\u201dNow, months later, it still holds true: For us, love means never having to say anything.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lawyer for Payday Lenders Is Confirmed for F.T.C. Job", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The new director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s consumer protection unit, a watchdog with broad investigative powers over private companies, stands out even in an administration prone to turning over regulatory authority to pro-industry players.And in 2012, Mr. Smith was also part of the legal team that defended AMG Services, the payday lender founded by the convicted racketeer Scott Tucker, whose predatory practices against impoverished borrowers eventually led to a $1.3 billion court-ordered settlement, the biggest in the commission\u2019s history.\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous the F.T.C. would pick the lawyer for a criminally convicted racketeer\u2019s payday loan company as consumer protection chief,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who opposed Mr. Smith\u2019s selection. \u201cThe agency should pick someone with a track record of protecting consumers, not companies that cheat people.\u201dMr. Smith was confirmed by the commission on Wednesday, with the agency\u2019s three Republican commissioners voting in favor of and the two Democratic commissioners voting against his appointment.Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner, said she voted against Mr. Smith because requiring him to step aside from the consumer protection bureau\u2019s most high-profile investigations \u201cundermines the public\u2019s confidence in the commission\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission.\u201dBut the commission\u2019s chairman, Joseph J. Simons, a Republican, said he was \u201cdisappointed that two of my new colleagues have chosen to turn Mr. Smith\u2019s appointment into a source of unnecessary controversy.\u201dMr. Smith, regarded as a hard-working and knowledgeable lawyer even by critics, worked as a lawyer for the commission in the early 2000s, drafting many of its regulations on credit reports and identity theft. In private practice for much of the last decade, he has represented industry groups, including payday lenders. He has also appeared before Congress to argue for loosening regulations and scaling back aggressive enforcement of existing laws.Mr. Smith \u201chas defended the worst of the worst,\u201d said Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress, a progressive advocacy group based in Washington that opposed the appointment.Mr. Smith, in an interview on Wednesday, pointed to his previous work at the commission and said he would continue the mission at the Bureau of Consumer Protection.\u201cI look forward to working with all the commissioners to do what\u2019s best for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cI obviously don\u2019t think I\u2019m disqualified because of prior client relationships. I have a long history of service to consumers, to the industry and the profession.\u201dAs a lawyer with Covington & Burling, Mr. Smith has represented dozens of companies over the past two years, including many banks, lenders, credit-reporting agencies and technology companies, which will force him to recuse himself from any potential investigations or enforcements against those organizations, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.But Mr. Smith\u2019s work for AMG raised new questions about his fitness to run a division that polices payday lenders among many other industries accused of fleecing consumers.In early 2012, the Federal Trade Commission filed a court case against AMG, arguing that the firm \u2014 a complex web of companies overseen by Mr. Tucker \u2014 had engaged in an array of deceptive and fraudulent business practices, including the illegal use of threats against borrowers who were unable to pay back high-interest loans.Mr. Smith, then a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster, met with the agency\u2019s lawyers and other defense counsel on at least one occasion, a group that included Mr. Tucker\u2019s personal lawyer, Timothy Muir. Mr. Muir would later be charged and convicted of helping Mr. Tucker run what prosecutors described as a $3.5 billion criminal enterprise.Mr. Smith said his work had been limited to advising his client, technically a company overseen by an Indian tribal council, on the commission law. He said the Morrison & Foerster team worked on the case for about six months.Mr. Muir, his lawyer, received a seven-year sentence.Mr. Smith declined to say whether he had spoken with Mr. Tucker, saying he was unsure whether answering would violate confidentiality agreements with his former clients.\u201cAnd does it matter?\u201d he said.Asked whether he had second thoughts about representing companies that had helped Mr. Tucker bilk vulnerable people out of millions of dollars, he said: \u201cI think all lawyers think about that. I was a part of a team at MoFo, and I think that everyone deserves a good defense.\u201d He said the Native American firms he represented believed they were helping people.Mr. Smith also declined to name other companies on his recusal list. He said many we re banks, and were thus typically not regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. He added that he would still stay busy at the agency because there were many companies that were not on his list. \u201cIt\u2019s a big world and the F.T.C. has very broad jurisdiction,\u201d he said.Mr. Smith\u2019s selection comes at a time of drastic deregulation of financial services \u2014 especially enforcement of laws meant to protect poor people \u2014 led by Mick Mulvaney, the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In recent weeks, Mr. Mulvaney has scaled back the bureau\u2019s investigations into student loan abuses and payday lenders while calling for the elimination of an online database of complaints against banks.Glenn Thrush reported from Washington, and Jack Nicas from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Blockchain Building in Bushwick", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom the outside, 304 Troutman Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, looks fairly ordinary. In most ways, it is. But this nondescript three-story, five-unit rental building is part of an experiment in using the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin to transform the New York housing market.\u201cThis is going to be a paradigm shift,\u201d said Mo Shaikh, a founder of Meridio, a Brooklyn-based company looking to introduce blockchain technology to real estate.As a secure, decentralized way to register and store payments and transactions online through \u201csmart contracts,\u201d blockchain technology will give each of the eight investors who currently own the building cryptocurrency tokens that can be traded and secure access to a crypto-protected database that stores individual transaction data. In theory, the technology will make it nearly impossible for hackers to do widespread damage and will protect against the kind of identity theft that conventional investors might be vulnerable to.\u201cBlockchain is just an efficient way of asset exchange: The assets can be cryptocurrency, stocks, bonds, art or real estate,\u201d said Corbin Page, Mr. Shaikh\u2019s partner in Meridio, an offshoot of a larger company called Consensys.Blockchain is best known as the technology behind Bitcoin, but instead of tracking who owns a digital currency, Meridio\u2019s Troutman Street pilot project aims to demonstrate that blockchain can enable online sales of fractional shares of residential or commercial real estate properties.The experiment at Troutman Street is one of many across the country attempting to move real estate records onto blockchain, and it is part of a larger movement in corporate America to transfer all kinds of records onto blockchain. Many of these experiments promise to fundamentally change industries, but many have also been plagued by delays and questions about whether and how they will actually be an improvement on the existing systems.If words like cryptocurrency and blockchain make your eyes glaze over, blockchain boosters point out that a user-friendly system can mean you don\u2019t need to fully understand the technology any more than you understand the programming code that allows you to order from Amazon or follow politics on Facebook. You can buy or sell \u201ctokens\u201d \u2014 which, in this case, represent shares of a building in cryptocurrency \u2014 the same way you would trade online stocks.Meridio\u2019s website will be as easy to use as eTrade and Zillow, Mr. Page said: \u201cWe want it to be for everybody. We will have blockchain in the background, giving the efficiency without it being in your face.\u201dIn real estate deals, he said, blockchain can reduce paperwork and the need for lawyers and other third parties by allowing people to buy and sell portions of buildings more efficiently than by crowdfunding or creating LLCs.Blockchain proselytizers also say that the technology can reduce fraud, speed transactions, lower costs and help democratize real estate.\u201cReal estate has been slow to adopt new technology, and this is bringing energy and excitement, which is welcome in a staid industry,\u201d said Jamie Wiseman, a founder of Cayuga Capital Management, a developer and property manager in Brooklyn and Queens whose holdings include 304 Troutman Street.Doubters, however, point out that fraud cannot be eliminated so easily and that the primitive title recording system in the United States will thwart modernization efforts. They also raise questions about the effect on neighborhood development and gentrification.\u201cI am skeptical of some of the claims about the impact of blockchain\u201d on real estate, said Aaron Wright, a professor who created the Blockchain Project at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and coauthored \u201cBlockchain and the Law: The Rule of Code.\u201dMr. Wright said that the lack of regulation could lead to volatility in trading and cause rapid changes in neighborhoods. And claims that blockchain can dramatically reduce the hundreds of millions of dollars in annual real estate fraud, he added, may be overblown. While blockchain will make information much less vulnerable to hacks and its instantaneous transaction confirmation could cut down on scams, he said, if fraudulent information enters the system, blockchain is not designed to stop it.The revolution, if it comes, will likely be gradual.Mr. Shaikh said they are still teaching Blockchain 101 to most in the real estate industry, through conferences, blog posts and marketing campaigns. And after partnering with the brokerage Cushman & Wakefield, Mr. Page said, it took \u201c20 different conversations to find Cayuga, with executives who understood blockchain\u2019s potential and were willing to act.\u201dCayuga bought 304 Troutman in 2005, and the eight initial investors in the building are now getting cryptocurrency tokens. Starting this summer, they will be able to trade with one another and sell to the tenants there. Meridio is already prepping more properties in New York and beyond, and expects to have them available for trading among accredited investors on their website this summer as well.\u201cWe think blockchain gives us the killer app to make that model work,\u201d Mr. Page said. There are no minimums and trading can be done immediately, with lower costs and possibly without a lawyer.Mr. Shaikh and Mr. Page believe that blockchain will gain traction by allowing people to invest relatively small amounts of money in real estate \u2014 unlike crowdfunding and LLCs, which often require a large minimum investment and have \u201clockup periods\u201d before a property can be flipped. A long with large transfer costs, that has created a high bar for entry to the real estate investment market.Natalia Karayaneva, the chief executive and founder of Propy, another blockchain company, said this fractionalization of properties could allow investors to buy a piece of high-end homes in Manhattan that are often owned by ultra-wealthy foreign oligarchs.But Mr. Wright, the Cardozo professor, offered another perspective: The lack of regulation, he said, could mean that foreigners looking to move money out of their home countries and people with \u201cill-gotten gains\u201d could use the technology to spread their dollars around multiple properties.Ms. Karayaneva and Meridio\u2019s founders, however, believe the fractionalization will bring a bigger and broader pool of capital into real estate. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the money to buy your house or apartment, you can buy a piece of it, allowing you to build wealth,\u201d Mr. Shaikh said. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting for middle-class Americans.\u201dThere are potential pitfalls, of course \u2014 among them, that cryptocurrency has proved quite volatile, and if the value of a home, apartment or retail building were to skyrocket or plummet the way Bitcoin has, the impact could ripple out through an entire neighborhood.\u201cIt depends on how the law plays out with the product, but if there\u2019s massive trading without sensible guardrails there\u2019ll be potential problems with volatility,\u201d Mr. Wright said.Mr. Page argued that the large scale and tangible nature of real estate should make it less volatile than Bitcoin, and Mr. Shaikh said they would consider implementing rules, like one that allows only a certain number of trades on a property per day, to ease concerns.But Mr. Wright pointed out that while more capital pouring in from around the world sounded good, if all those people decided New York was the place to invest and that helped drive prices up for local residents, it would \u201clead to issues on the ground and change the character of a neighborhood.\u201dMr. Wiseman agreed. \u201cBlockchain may bring costs down,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it will accelerate gentrification.\u201dThere is also the possibility that fractionalization could allow communities to band together to battle gentrification, Mr. Page suggested. Community groups or immigrant-centered organizations, he said, could help coordinate neighbors\u2019 efforts to buy up small chunks of apartments or houses, or even commercial real estate.\u201cMaybe that is a solution,\u201d Mr. Wright said, noting that this would have multiple benefits in strengthening a sense of community, although it would take years before it could be widespread.The effects on individual transactions, however, would be more immediate. Mr. Wright recently ran a demonstration in Australia that showed how smart contracts on blockchain could reduce the \u201ccumbersome half-day process\u201d of a transaction to a matter of minutes.\u201cIt was super exciting,\u201d he said, although it would be difficult to implement these changes in the United States, he added, because real estate records here are \u201cvery, very fractured\u201d and governed on a county-by-county basis. \u201cEfforts to even digitize records that started in the 1980s haven\u2019t fully happened yet.\u201dThat is sadly true, said John Mirkovic, deputy recorder of deeds for Cook County, Ill., which ran a pilot program in Chicago that successfully demonstrated how blockchain technology could be used to more safely and efficiently record real estate transactions.But many counties around the country still use paper for record-keeping, Mr. Mirkovic said, while more technologically advanced ones may have upgraded to Windows 95.\u201cGetting people to do something new is not easy,\u201d he said. Still, he added, citizens and politicians should push for blockchain as a \u201cgood government\u201d issue, making it \u201ca populist technology.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

Mr. Hale had thought he would be able to pack up his tools, dishes and camping gear. But as he and his companions started choking on the hazardous fumes released by volcanic activity, he realized they needed to get out.The group drove away, leaving his dead car, a banged-up 2004 Ford Mustang that he sometimes rented to tourists, parked next to his mailbox on the side of the road.By the time Mr. Hale tried to get back the next day, both would be gone. But their fate had been captured in video footage that would spread across television news and social media.Recorded by a videographer who travels the world to capture extreme weather events, the footage showed an insatiable mound of lava marching across the road. The lava engulfed the car and the mailbox, which Mr. Hale\u2019s daughter had fashioned into a facsimile of R2-D2, the \u201cStar Wars\u201d droid.The videographer, Brendan Clement, had the footage, including a time-lapse video that was widely seen, shared in posts on his Facebook page of weather videos. The footage gave viewers around the world an up-close glimpse of the molten threat posed to two communities on the island\u2019s eastern edge.By Wednesday morning in Hawaii, the eruptions at Leilani Estates appeared to have paused for the time being except for some gas emissions and spattering lava, said Tina Neal, a scientist of the United States Geological Survey\u2019s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.Since Thursday, 15 fissures have erupted in the area, with lava spreading across 116 acres, according to the authorities, who have also warned of dangerous sulfur dioxide gases.The observatory said that a large rockfall into a lava lake in the volcano\u2019s crater on Wednesday triggered an explosion that created a column of ash.In the evacuated communities to the northeast of the crater, 36 structures had been destroyed and at least 26 of those were homes, said Talmadge Magno, the civil defense administrator for the County of Hawaii.Reached by phone on Tuesday, Mr. Hale, 48, said he was camping in an empty lot he owns in Pahoa, a neighborhood nearby. The mailbox was a bigger loss than the car, he said. It had been a Christmas gift from his 26-year-old daughter, Brittany, a few years ago \u2014 a memento of their shared love for the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies. People would drive by his home, see the mailbox, stop and back up to take pictures.The lava flow captured on video was blocking his path home when he tried to get back on Sunday. Mr. Hale, who runs a car rental business on the island and owns a rental residence, said it was traumatic to watch plumes of smoke, which he assumed were coming from his home, rise from the other side of the lava wall. He kicked himself for not coming back earlier. Perhaps he could have rescued more \u2014 maybe even the collection of \u201cStar Wars\u201d mugs from his kitchen.But watching the video of the time-lapse later, he said, gave him an odd kind of peace.\u201cI have respect for the lava and for Pele,\u201d he said, invoking the name of the Hawaiian fire goddess. \u201cShe just wanted to come onto the property. I guess it\u2019s just kind of surrendering to nature. Seeing it, I felt like \u2018O.K., you have what you have, it\u2019s done.\u2019\u201dJacey Fortin and Matt Stevens contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Blocks a Memorial Service to Sichuan Earthquake Victims", "Date": "2018-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 On the 10th anniversary of China\u2019s deadliest earthquake in decades, the police on Saturday detained an outspoken pastor and blocked a planned service to mourn the 70,000 or more people killed when whole towns and villagers were crushed.On Friday night, the police detained Wang Yi, a Protestant pastor whose independent church planned to hold a memorial service on Saturday morning in Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan, his wife, Jiang Rong, said.He was released on Saturday night after about 24 hours in detention, she said later.The police in Chengdu did not answer calls, or said they did not know about the case.Mr. Wang has bluntly criticized Chinese state controls on religion and has had multiple run-ins with officials before. But this time looked more serious for him and his church, Ms. Jiang said by telephone.An official from the religious affairs bureau told him that \u201cthe church assembly was unlawful and banned,\u201d Ms. Jiang said, \u201cand then the police read out another notice that accused Wang Yi of provoking trouble.\u201dMr. Wang, 44, has argued that churches should not be answerable to the state. His church is one of a number in China that have resisted government oversight, opting for a tenuous independence, often moving premises and risking closure.This year, Mr. Wang was among the few prominent Chinese voices to condemn the elimination of presidential term limits.Despite Mr. Wang\u2019s release, the size of the police operation highlighted how raw memories of the 2008 earthquake remain in Sichuan.Soon after the 2008 earthquake struck, charities, religious groups and spontaneously organized groups of students and citizens rushed to offer food, shelter and medical care. Soldiers who tramped into remote valleys and dug tirelessly to search for survivors were hailed as heroes in a nationwide surge of unity.But soon after, the government imposed tighter controls on the area. Officials were disconcerted after grieving parents, journalists and activists, like the artist Ai Weiwei, said that shoddy building standards and corruption seemed to have contributed to the destruction, especially of schools.Ever since 2008, Chinese commemorations of the disaster have been shadowed by tensions between the official ceremonies \u2014 dwelling on the heroism of the soldier-rescuers and the speed of reconstruction \u2014 and unofficial efforts to mourn the dead and renew calls for an official reckoning with why so many died in building collapses, especially students in schools.Mr. Wang was a law academic who converted to Christianity after he began representing unregistered churches resisting official pressure. After the 2008 earthquake, his budding church in Chengdu supported Christian groups and others bringing in help for survivors. In recent years, the church has attracted hundreds of regular worshipers, despite difficulties finding a permanent home. It has also opened a school.Before Mr. Wang was taken away by the police, he told church members that they should appeal for their legal rights in the face of police pressure.\u201cWe will also face this following faith and conscience,\u201d he said in the message to church members on Thursday. \u201cWe will not obey any unjust and unlawful demands, and are willing to pay the price.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I almost died at 24 of a heart attack caused by a rare autoimmune disorder.It had been a long time since my mom brushed my hair.But after my first shower in nearly a week in the hospital last spring, I couldn\u2019t muster the strength to untangle my matted curls.As my mom worked her way through the bird\u2019s nest, I secretly cried. About six days earlier, at 10:20 a.m. on March 31, I had been lying on my back under my desk in the newsroom, crying in agony. I first noticed the aches and pains as I was getting dressed that morning but I ignored the warning signs, figuring the discomfort would subside. The pain intensified after I climbed the stairs of the subway at Times Square and then became intolerable once I settled in at my desk. Two editors and a friend were by my side as I slid off my chair and onto the floor. It felt as if someone was stacking bricks on my heart. Both arms grew numb and became slick with sweat, my black jeans and white blouse were damp and my vision went in and out as I struggled to make myself believe that the pain was going away. But this was something both undeniable and baffling: Heart attacks happen to old men, not young women like me, I thought.I tried to convince them that I didn\u2019t need to go to a hospital, but they wisely ignored me and insisted on calling for an ambulance.Within minutes I was on the stretcher, rolling out of the newsroom in full view of curious journalists. The emergency medical crew took me outside where rain pounded down on Eighth Avenue and felt surprisingly refreshing, a reprieve from my hot flashes and sweats.In the waiting ambulance, an E.M.T. hooked up an EKG. I writhed in pain, my arms so weak and sore that I could barely hold them up. I could feel them slip off my belly and hang off the side of the stretcher. I pleaded for the E.M.T. to make the pain stop. \u201cYou are having a heart attack,\u201d he responded. Before I could fully comprehend the news, I was rushed into the NYU Langone Medical Center emergency room where at least five doctors and nurses were waiting to take me to the cath lab to put in a stent to relieve a clot that was causing my pain. But then my heart went into an abnormal rhythm, and they shocked me without warning. I screamed like I never had before. It felt as if my insides clung to the top of my body and then moments later slowly made their way back to their rightful places. But it reset the rhythm of my heart and allowed the team to proceed with putting in the stent.\u201cWhen this is over, Jaclyn, you need to live your best life,\u201d Nurse Theresa said.But when it was over \u2014 when the stent was in and the pain was gone \u2014 I was consumed with worries that my life would never be the same. For days I secretly panicked, holding in my fears of how I would get through this and saving my tears for when my friends and family left for the night and I was alone in my hospital bed.Weeks later I was frustrated that I was still unable to walk more than three city blocks. I couldn\u2019t grocery shop, walk to the pharmacy, have brunch with my friends, take the subway to work.And in every new meaningful relationship or catch-up dinner with an old friend, I had to explain this traumatic experience and watch the reactions wash over his or her face. Would it be pity? Shock? Sadness? I always feel obligated to make the other person feel better. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say. But I\u2019m not fine. I almost died at 24. I would have to add six medications to my daily routine, pay attention to my bruises, monitor my blood clotting levels through repeated blood tests and avoid foods high in vitamin K like leafy greens. One bonus: to avoid the risk of cutting myself shaving, I had laser hair removal and don\u2019t have to shave anymore.I\u2019d like to say I took each challenge in stride and faced it with grace and optimism. But the reality was that my independence and youth had been taken without my consent and I was angry. I admit I indulged in some self-pity.I try to focus on being thankful. I often run through how lucky I was for all the things that went right that day: that it happened at work where there were people to help get me to the hospital, that the ambulance took me to N.Y.U., that traffic was somehow not bad that rainy morning and that I have health insurance. I\u2019d like to be able to tie this story up in a bow and say that I have a newfound appreciation for life. But at 24, I had never lost that appreciation. I was only just beginning my life as an adult. If anything, I\u2019m thankful that I have been able to return to the same attitude I had before. I am relieved that my youth didn\u2019t disappear forever, that it returned months later in full force, helping me keep my sense of humor. I have gradually gone back to some of the routines that marked my pre-heart-attack life: extra hours at work, late nights with friends, long walks in the park and endless conversations fantasizing about my future. So as my 25th birthday approached, I smirked and typed a Facebook event title that I felt would best represent my attitude: \u201c25 and Still Alive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Battle for Control of CBS, With Far-Reaching Consequences", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIt\u2019s no secret that the proposed reunion of CBS and Viacom hasn\u2019t been a Hollywood romance. But simmering tensions erupted into open warfare this week, with far more at stake than control of two legendary entertainment companies.No matter who emerges the victor in what promises to be a prolonged series of courtroom showdowns, both companies will be profoundly affected, and the broader media landscape fundamentally transformed.The CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves and the company\u2019s board launched the opening salvo on Monday, filing suit to prevent Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of both CBS and Viacom, from firing CBS directors before they could dilute her voting rights and strip her of control \u2014 a step they plan to take Thursday, provided that a judge in Delaware allows it.Although the two sides had been negotiating over how much CBS should pay for Viacom, and who should be in charge after the merger, control is the real issue. The CBS board and management \u201chave simply become uncomfortable with the reality that CBS has a controlling stockholder,\u201d Ms. Redstone asserted in a response to the suit.For its part, CBS said it\u2019s simply adhering to the principle that the company \u201cshould be and would be governed for the benefit of the company and all its shareholders, not just the controlling stockholder.\u201d It is a principle CBS said had been endorsed by Sumner Redstone, Shari\u2019s 94-year-old father, who long controlled both CBS and Viacom.The interests of CBS shareholders other than Ms. Redstone might well include considering a takeover offer, especially in light of a rapidly consolidating media and communications landscape. Since talk of reuniting Viacom and CBS first surfaced two years ago, AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner (a deal awaiting a court ruling on an antitrust challenge), Disney has reached a deal to buy much of 21st Century Fox, and Netflix and Amazon have emerged as fully integrated distributors and content producers.CBS executives were incensed that Ms. Redstone rebuffed an approach from Lloyd C. McAdam, chairman and chief executive of Verizon Communications, roughly a year ago, thereby \u201cdepriving CBS stockholders of a potentially value-enhancing opportunity,\u201d CBS said in its complaint.While the exact nature of that conversation remains in dispute, the Redstone entity that controls CBS, National Amusements, has made clear its categorical opposition to any takeover. As said in a 2016 letter to the boards of both CBS and Viacom, \u201cTo avoid any doubt, National Amusements is not willing to accept or support (i) any acquisition by a third party of either company or (ii) any transaction that would result in National Amusements surrendering its controlling position in either company or not controlling the combined company.\u201dThe issue of control often looms large at companies with dual-class share systems. Controlling shareholders often want to maintain managerial control \u2014 that\u2019s often why they establish the dual-class structure in the first place \u2014 while public shareholders often hope to sell to the highest bidder.Although dual-class share structures are controversial and have long been opposed by shareholder-rights advocates, they have been growing in popularity, especially in Silicon Valley. Entrepreneurial founders are often reluctant to cede control; Facebook, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet and Snap are all dual-class share companies. But so are Berkshire Hathaway, Ford Motor, Comcast and The New York Times Company.Should CBS ultimately prevail in what would be a highly unusual attempt to dilute a controlling shareholder, a bevy of dual-class companies will no doubt be scrambling to rewrite their bylaws.The conflict is magnified in this instance because Ms. Redstone is the controlling shareholder in both parties to the proposed merger.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the Redstones have a clear conflict of interest in this situation,\u201d said Margaret Blair, a professor and expert in corporate governance at Vanderbilt University School of Law. \u201cThe law is very clear that the authority for running the corporation lies with the board. If the board feels the controlling shareholder is interfering with the best interest of the other shareholders, courts will defer to the board, and I think they should.\u201d(At a hearing on Wednesday, a judge in Delaware granted CBS\u2019s request for the temporary restraining order. The judge is expected to issue a more expansive ruling on Thursday concerning whether the result of the CBS board\u2019s planned vote will be allowed to go into effect.)Such cases are rare, because directors who dare to defy a controlling shareholder\u2019s wishes, as the CBS directors have done, can simply be replaced. There was widespread amazement on Wall Street this week that Ms. Redstone hadn\u2019t sensed the rebellion coming, and moved to replace the CBS directors or curtail their powers. Now her hands are tied, at least temporarily.Ms. Redstone has been at the center of a drawn-out soap opera over control of the media empire forged by her father, the ailing Mr. Redstone.After years of being estranged from her father and isolated from the family business, Ms. Redstone was thrust unexpectedly into the role of media mogul after she reconciled with her father, ousted his two girlfriends from his Beverly Hills mansion, and gained control of the family trust that controls National Amusements and, in turn, CBS and Viacom.Ms. Redstone has gone on a crash course in media management, lunching with other media executives and showing up at the Sun Valley conference and other media watering holes. By all accounts, she\u2019s taken on the task with a level of enthusiasm and determination that rivals her father. Still, there\u2019s nothing in her experience that would typically qualify her to run major media companies.The Harvard Law School professor Lucian A. Bebchuk used the Redstone example in an argument that dual-share class structures typically outlive their utility, and should be phased out by a company at some point. \u201cConcerns about the emergence of inferior leadership over time are further aggravated when the dual-class structure enables a transfer of the founder\u2019s lock on control to an heir who might be unfit to lead the company,\u201d he wrote last year in an article titled \u201cThe Untenable Case for Perpetual Dual-Class Stock\u201d in Virginia Law Review. He cited a \u201cwide range of distorted choices\u201d that are \u201caimed at increasing private benefits of control at the expense of the value received by other shareholders.\u201dCBS hasn\u2019t said exactly why the special committee formed to evaluate and negotiate the potential merger with Viacom finally decided this past weekend that such a deal wasn\u2019t in the best interest of CBS shareholders other than Ms. Redstone, but it isn\u2019t hard to see what their objections might be.Investors other than the Redstones have long opposed the idea \u2014 every time there were reports the deal was off, including this week, CBS shares jumped. A chorus of analysts has criticized the deal. One called the merger a potential \u201cdisaster\u201d for CBS.People close to CBS told me this week that the company was never enthusiastic about the potential combination, and agreed to consider it largely as a courtesy to Ms. Redstone. They said CBS alone is a very attractive company, either as a takeover candidate for a large telecom company like Verizon, or as a stand-alone content creator.Though CBS faces the same advertising challenges as the other broadcast networks, analysts have praised Mr. Moonves for positioning CBS for the digital era. He\u2019s not only kept CBS the No. 1 broadcast network in prime time for the past nine years, but also executed a successful direct-to-consumer streaming strategy.\u201cFrom CBS\u2019s perspective, you\u2019ve got to be pretty happy with your business,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst for Cowen & Co. \u201cWhy would you want to complicate it?\u201dFor its part, Viacom, after years of turmoil, seems to have stabilized under the leadership of its new chief executive, Robert M. Bakish, who has emerged as a favorite of Ms. Redstone\u2019s. (Ms. Redstone has pushed to have him play a meaningful role in the merged companies, either as a high-level executive or as a board member.) But so far this year, Viacom\u2019s Paramount movie studio accounted for less than 6 percent of the domestic box office. Disney, the market leader, had over 34 percent.Still, people at CBS told me that while they wouldn\u2019t mind gaining control of the Paramount studio, they have little or no interest in Viacom\u2019s traditional cable networks, including MTV, VH1 and Comedy Central. Those are suffering acutely from the cord cutting that is afflicting the entire cable industry. (Mr. Creutz, the analyst, described Viacom\u2019s cable assets as a \u201cmelting ice cube.\u201d)Given the level of acrimony that has erupted this week from CBS\u2019s move \u2014 National Amusements said it was \u201coutraged\u201d and Ms. Redstone was described as \u201cshocked, disappointed and upset\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine any amicable settlement. That leaves two potential outcomes: If Ms. Redstone prevails, Mr. Moonves and his team would be out, marking the end of an era at CBS. It would presumably fall to the relatively untested Mr. Bakish to merge the two companies and soldier on at a perilous time for cable and broadcasting operations.If CBS wins, and Ms. Redstone\u2019s control is diluted, the Redstone era will come to an end, and with it the likelihood that either CBS or Viacom will last long as independent companies. Viacom is so small and weak that it would need a rescuer, probably at a lower price than CBS was being asked to pay. And CBS would be free to pursue a merger with someone like Verizon, or go it alone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taliban Claim They\u2019ve Taken Control of Western Afghan City, Farah", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The Taliban claimed to have captured the capital of the western province of Farah on Tuesday, while government officials and their American military backers vowed that the authorities would quickly oust insurgents from the city, the first to be overrun by the militants in two years.Only the provincial governor\u2019s compound remained in government hands after a long day of fighting, which continued into the night, according to numerous residents and some local officials, as well as the Taliban insurgents. Gov. Basir Salangi fled the city after the insurgent attack began around 2 a.m., but he remained in Farah Province at a military base a few miles from the city, according to numerous local officials.A senior Afghan police official, reached by telephone inside Farah City, described the government\u2019s situation as \u201cout of control\u201d and predicted the insurgents would renew their offensive under cover of dark, when air support was less effective against them. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was contradicting official government reports.Afghan officials confirmed that a district police chief in Farah died of his wounds Tuesday, but they denied claims that the deputy provincial police chief had also died, saying he was critically wounded. Other claims by the insurgents were exaggerated, officials said.\u201cThey kill one, and they claim three,\u201d said Gen. Mohammad Radmanish, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.The American military said in a statement that it had A-10 warplanes over the city, \u201cwhich remains under government control.\u201d Those aircraft are generally used for close support of troops on the ground, but the statement did not clarify whether they were joining Afghan military helicopters in bombing the Taliban. \u201cU.S. Forces-Afghanistan stand firm beside our Afghan partners and will continue to reinforce this Afghan-led offensive,\u201d the statement said.The offensive by all accounts was launched by the Taliban side about 2 a.m. on Tuesday, with attacks on the defensive perimeter of the city, capital of a province that has seen heavy fighting for several months. By midday, Taliban insurgents were posting photographs and video of themselves celebrating in the main traffic circle at the center of the city, and parading captured Afghan military vehicles and weapons.Farah, a city of 50,000, would be the second Afghan city to fall to the insurgents since the war began. The northern city of Kunduz fell twice to the Taliban, in 2015 and 2016, but was retaken by the government both times.In Kabul, Afghan officials said they would quickly expel the Taliban from Farah. \u201cWe are hoping to get control of the fighting in the city,\u201d General Radmanish said at a news conference. \u201cOur reinforcements are trying to use their capabilities to overcome the situation.\u201dBy the end of the day that had not happened, but General Radmanish insisted the center of the city remained in government hands. \u201cThe governor\u2019s office, the police headquarters, the National Directorate for Security, the university and the airport are under our control,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are using all of our capabilities to change the situation there.\u201dResidents reached by telephone inside Farah late Tuesday all said the insurgents appeared to control most, if not all, of the city, other than the governor\u2019s offices. \u201cIt is amazing how easily the Taliban managed to enter the city,\u201d said one resident, Dill Agha. \u201cThey are telling residents to remain in their homes, that they are not hurting civilians or any military or police who surrender themselves.\u201dFareed Bakhtawar, head of the Farah provincial council, said that he had joined volunteers to fight the Taliban but that the insurgents had taken large areas of the city. \u201cThere is no extra force to help us, and the situation is getting worse,\u201d Mr. Bakhtawar said.Fighting has been intense for months in the western province \u2014 much of which, outside of military bases, has already fallen under Taliban domination \u2014 with hundreds of police officers and soldiers killed. The fighting has increased in Farah because of Taliban reinforcements sent from neighboring Helmand Province, where the insurgents have fared less well in recent months, according to Afghan officials.Qasim, a resident of the city who worked for a foreign organization, said he and friends tried to flee but were advised to hide in their homes because the insurgents were checking identification in order to find people like him. \u201cThe fighting is very fierce and it is very dangerous to go out,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the people we know are trapped in their homes. We were told not to even peek outside.\u201dA Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, also posting on WhatsApp, told Farah residents not to worry. \u201cEveryone should stay home, be calm and pray,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mujahedeen are your brothers; don\u2019t pay attention to the propaganda of the enemy.\u201dAs they advanced through the city on Tuesday, the Taliban posted numerous videos on their Facebook account and on unofficial Twitter accounts showing checkpoints and government buildings purportedly falling to their control in rapid succession. They were also seen both on social media and by residents driving commandeered police and military vehicles.A spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani, Shahhussain Murtazawi, also denied that the city had fallen. \u201cReinforcement forces have arrived in Farah City, the situation is changed there, it\u2019s not as tense as it\u2019s described in social media,\u201d he said.An Afghan Air Force general said that helicopter gunships from Shindand Air Base in western Afghanistan were joining the fight, targeting Taliban positions in the city. The general, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was unauthorized to speak to the news media, said the air force was hampered by the need to avoid bombing homes.In the past, when Kunduz fell to the Taliban, American air power and Special Operations troops intervened to help restore the city to government control. It was not clear if that was contemplated in Farah, but the American military\u2019s statement indicated the authorities were watching developments closely. \u201cAs we have seen over the last couple of days,\u201d the statement said, \u201cthe Taliban are unable to hold terrain during such isolated attacks and their unsuccessful raid attempts on district centers in Badakhshan, Baghlan, Faryab and Zabul.\u201dJawad Sukhanyar reported from Kabul, and Rod Nordland from London. Taimoor Shah contributed reporting from Kandahar, Afghanistan, and Fahim Abed from Kabul.Advertisement"}

It was the filmmakers\u2019 decision to include video footage from those deaths that has drawn outrage from artists in the film and others.Joel Francois, another poet featured in the movie, said in an interview that he and his teammates had larger questions about the documentary\u2019s approach to race. Noting that six of the seven cast members are people of color, he said of the filmmakers, \u201cAt the very least they could recognize the implications of having a film that has a clear divide racially, that we have issues with how the film treated race. And then they hire a white publicist and do a New York Times story with a white writer.\u201d (The Times did not cooperate with the film\u2019s publicist on this article.)The film\u2019s director, Max Powers, conceded in a phone interview from Toronto that the editing suggested things that didn\u2019t quite happen and that there had been a possible breach of documentary ethics. He added that he was open to cutting the offensive material.\u201cIt was a creative decision,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was ambivalent about that creative decision.\u201dBut Nikhil Melnechuk, a producer of the film and the executive director of the Bowery Poetry Club, said the news footage was inserted for a practical reason: Preview audiences were confused. When the poets were shown reacting to news events, viewers were uncertain about the details of the stories, and the filmmakers thought they needed a solution.\u201cWe screened the film about eight times, 20 people each time, always careful to make the audience as diverse as our community,\u201d Mr. Melnechuk said. \u201cWhen the team coach is shown asking herself \u2018Do I watch the videos or not watch the videos?\u2019 people didn\u2019t know what videos she referred to.\u201dSubtitles didn\u2019t help. \u201cI felt very strongly,\u201d Mr. Melnechuk said, \u201cif we were going to set the film in the summer of 2016 and use poems that were directly related to that summer, it would have been negligent to rely on an audience memory that was already fading.\u201dMr. Francois said the Bowery Poetry Club had lost credibility with him and his fellow artists. \u201cThe issues aren\u2019t personal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issues are with the film and how we were treated by Bowery once we articulated clear issues with the film.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe don\u2019t trust Bowery or anyone associated with Bowery,\u201d calling it \u201ca piss-poor organization that abuses people of color.\u201dThough he would not provide details of the abuse, he said the group\u2019s differences with Bowery Poetry Club involve an accumulation of microaggressions. \u201cWhen it comes to many interactions between people of color and white institutions,\u201d he said, \u201cyou pick your poison and make compromises when you\u2019re trying to promote the art.\u201d (Other poets in the documentary did not respond to requests for comment.)Mr. Melnechuk said that during filming there had not been a conversation about race. \u201cThere never was,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the thing that troubles me about that narrative is that even though there\u2019s a white director, the core team that made the movie is a diverse team. To label the production a white production discounts the leading contribution of Cora Atkinson,\u201d another producer on the film. \u201cTo me it\u2019s a cheap shot, and inaccurate.\u201dMs. Atkinson said that whatever the poets feel about the film is \u201cvalid and I would never take that away from them.\u201d But she bristled at the accusations of racism.\u201cAs an African-American woman, it\u2019s a hard pill to swallow,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the movie we made. I think it\u2019s a beautiful movie and I\u2019m proud of it and proud of the way we represented people of color. People don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s unfortunate, but I hope they get something from it.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article reversed the identities of the director and a producer.

This year I did not, which gave me a chance to focus on one element of the budget announcement: Australia\u2019s relationship to the wider world.A few items that factor into the equation (with figures in Australian dollars):So what does this all add up to?At first glance, it looked to me like a Trumpian shift \u2014 or at least a continued slide away from treating the world as a stage of opportunity and toward a focus on global threats.I checked that premise with a few experts to see if I was reading the numbers right.The context is striking. Australia is strong not weak, in its 27th year of economic growth, with a government surplus on the way and an economy nearly as large as Russia\u2019s.But by 2030, it is projected to slide the economic rankings and instead of pushing itself and its values further into the world, as China, Indonesia and Japan are doing, Australia still seems more interested in circling the wagons and seeking protection.\u201cThis is also reflected very plainly in the growing worries about China,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cWhere once it was seen overwhelmingly as a source of economic opportunity it is now seen more and more as a source of political, strategic and even ideological threats.\u201dSome analysts argue that there is still a lot of diplomatic work and \u201csoft power\u201d in the mix.Jacinta Carroll, director of national security policy at the Australian National University, defended the budget\u2019s foreign policy priorities, noting that they fall in line with the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, and include a greater focus on Australia\u2019s closest neighbors in the Pacific.\u201cIt\u2019s rare to see a new High Commission open, but a permanent diplomatic presence is vital to a strong relationship so it\u2019s great news that Australia\u2019s commitment to the Pacific is being strengthened by a permanent diplomatic post in Tuvalu,\u201d she said.Still, the Pacific focus is also in response to a perceived threat from China. And a good portion of that aid will go to security, not development or investment.The United States and many other countries have made a similar shift. We\u2019re in the midst of a moment when many of the world\u2019s strongest democracies are looking inward, or investing in bonds centered around security. In a previous interview, Mr. White tied this to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but what I find interesting is how that mood of fear is adapting and finding new sources of anxiety.\u201cYou have to worry, if this approach stressing defense and not foreign aid is a good one, given we don\u2019t face any military threat,\u201d said Stephen Howes, director of the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be a balanced approach.\u201dBut having seen the way a resort to the American military often becomes the default response for foreign policy matters in many countries all over the world, I also wonder about momentum, and whether spending choices today might create self-fulfilling prophecies of conflict tomorrow.Now for the news \u2014 from Trump and Iran to koala chlamydia and Met Gala fun \u2014 as well as a recommendation.________________________News / FeaturesCulture / Fun______I found a copy at a local bookstore and nearly wept when I reached the story\u2019s end.

The video demonstrated how easy it is to use current technology to create powerful and persuasive lies, now also known as fake news.When this video magic is coupled with the ability of companies like Facebook to micro-target each of us and select the news we see, the implications for the future of our democracy seem dire. Fake news and microtargeting can be combined to create a kind of advertising that\u2019s like an evil version of Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, and we are being exposed to more of these pernicious morsels every year.But two lessons from the history of advertising suggest that the fake news phenomenon is likely to change significantly in the years to come.

History also suggests, though, that the danger will probably recede over time as people grow accustomed to the ads, which will cease to work as effectively.First, in all likelihood, fake news will spread, despite efforts to rein it in. So far, most attention has focused on efforts to meddle in American elections. That is no small threat.Yet, based on the historical record, far more effort goes into persuading Americans to buy things than to elect politicians.We are already seeing technology being used to shade the truth in advertising that targets consumers.I did a Google search for \u201cbest inflatable kayak\u201d and was confronted by a blend of results that can be hard for a consumer to decipher. As expected, the choices that popped up included paid ads for kayaks that were being sold and some real reviews of kayaks. But there were also as a series of seemingly objective product-review sites that, on closer inspection, mainly contained product descriptions and links to buy items like kayaks from Amazon and other vendors.Such blurring of the distinctions between expert reviews and explicit ads provides a ripe circumstance for the rise of advertising that is less than totally transparent.The fake expert recommended that students try to refinance their loans, which was helpful to the business of LendEDU. Drew Cloud has disappeared, and LendEDU has apologized for its deception, but the problem is certain to continue.Expect to hear from the Drew Clouds of kayaks, mutual funds, laundry detergent and anything you might spend money on. Fake celebrity endorsements, altered product videos, bogus reviews and testimonials can\u2019t be far off.We have relied on the law to protect us from advertising fraud but, as we learned after the last election cycle, the more numerous and micro-targeted the ads become, the harder they are to monitor. That\u2019s a recipe for more trouble.Voters get lots of robocalls around election time, but the volume is modest compared with the number of calls about credit cards, vacation deals and loans.Given the trends, the future looks grim. But before abandoning hope, remember that the history of advertising also teaches that when people get used to ads, the ads stop working.As with special effects in movies, consumers become desensitized to ads the more they see them. The scary creatures from 1950s films, the shark in \u201cJaws\u201d or the spaceships from science-fiction movies of the 1990s now often look like jokes.That\u2019s why political consultants say straightforward TV ads no longer work. People tune them out.As technology develops, the same wearout effect is likely to occur with advertising based on fake news. As we are inundated with new, targeted, deceptive ads, we may get sick of them and, perhaps, stop finding them persuasive. For now, it\u2019s the best hope we have.Austan Goolsbee, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, was an adviser to President Barack Obama.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Icebox Cake Casts Its Spell on Strawberries", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteIcebox cakes are like magic.Coal-black cocoa wafers, dry and crumbly on their own, are layered with vanilla whipped cream and put in the fridge overnight. By morning, the crisp cookies become a tender cake, surrounded by a pillow of vanilla frosting. It\u2019s as perfect a summer dessert as you can make without turning on the oven \u2014 a rich, creamy triumph.This version appeals to fruit lovers, those of us who routinely choose berries, peaches and lemon over dark chocolate. It has the same easy charm and cloudlike lusciousness as the cocoa-wafer original, but this one is shot through with strawberries and ginger rather than fudge.Die-hard chocolate lovers can substitute cocoa wafers. You\u2019ll end up with something that tastes like chocolate-covered strawberries, but a whole lot fluffier. Just don\u2019t use any cookies (either chocolate or ginger) with a so-called cream in the center. That stiff white disk will never dissolve, leaving hard, sugary pockets where mousselike suppleness should reign.Other than swapping the cookies and adding a little fruit, the biggest change I made to the classic recipe was in the cream itself. Instead of whipped heavy cream, I went for mascarpone. Its thicker texture is better able to absorb the strawberry pur\u00e9e without becoming too thin to hold the cookies in place. When I initially tried using regular whipped cream, the cake slid into a heap during its overnight rest. Sturdy mascarpone keeps everything in its proper place.As a final garnish and to get even more fruit on the plate, I add a vivid topping of strawberries that have been macerated in sugar, lime and grated ginger until they turn syrupy and aromatic. Spooned over the cake just before serving, they\u2019re spicy and bright against the mild airiness of the cream, a contrast in both texture and flavor.Although this revamped icebox cake is certainly elegant enough for your next dinner party, it will also be right at home at any potluck, barbecue or picnic. It\u2019s an untraditional dessert perfect for all of summer\u2019s most traditional meals \u2014 a nice trick to have up your sleeve.cookingAdvertisement"}

I would argue that a lot of people have been left out: African Americans and other minorities and people in rural areas of the heartland of our country.\u201dMr. Khanna is the son of immigrants from India. As political inspiration, he cites his grandfather, a member of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s freedom movement in the 1940s who was jailed for four years before becoming a parliamentarian.At the University of Chicago, he worked on the State Senate campaign of Barack Obama, and later on Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential run.

Max Nikias, to resign over the scandal surrounding a longtime gynecologist at the student health center.We asked readers who are U.S.C. students, staff members or alumni to tell us whether they agreed with the demands for him to step down. Here are excerpts from some of the responses, edited for length and clarity:\u201cI am heartsick and outraged by what appears to be a pattern of failed leadership and cover-up by President Max Nikias and his administration. Concern about the University\u2019s reputation trumped the leadership\u2019s responsibility to ensure the safety of students. The board of trustees should clean house and establish new leadership without delay.\u201d\u201cThere are several investigations underway, and if they show that President Nikias knew what was happening and failed to act, that will be when he should resign. However, if the investigations show that the failures occurred at levels lower than the office of the president, then those responsible should be held liable. I believe it is premature to ask Max Nikias to resign.\u201d\u201cAs an alumna of U.S.C. and one of three generations of Trojans, I think Mr. Nikias should resign. Whether or not he was personally responsible for the inaction concerning Dr. Tyndall, the buck stops with him as the leader and face of the university, and he is ultimately the person who needs to be held accountable.\u201d\u201cI definitely think that Mr. Nikias should resign. I think they should hire a person who is more forthright and willing to do the right things even when it hurts. There should not be any more of the \u201cback room dealing\u201d that has occurred previously.

{"Headline": "Wall Street Gains Ground Under the New Volcker Rule: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump is imposing tariffs on China. Again.\u2022 What deal makers can learn from Bayer\u2019s new antitrust agreement.The public has two defenses against recklessness on Wall Street \u2013 regulations and the regulators themselves. Now, with the Trump administration\u2019s rule loosening in full swing, the public can only hope that the men and women who oversee the big banks are up to their jobs.Federal regulators on Wednesday proposed a sweeping set of changes that would relax the Volcker rule, a major regulation introduced after the financial crisis of 2008 to stop taxpayer-protected banks from speculating for their own profit.The rule, which came into effect in 2015, was always going to create some headaches. Banks trade regularly to meet the demands of customers and to hedge their own risks. The Volcker rule allows that sort of trading, but regulators had to have ways of making sure a bank wasn\u2019t speculating for its own gain under the guise of serving customers or hedging. To do that, the final rule included requirements that effectively forced banks to show that they were only doing the legitimate types of trading. Banks complained about the rule\u2019s complexity, and regulators said it was hard to enforce. The changes proposed on Wednesday give the banks considerable new leeway.Here are three ways in which traders gain ground.\u2022 Currently, a bank\u2019s short-term trading positions are at the outset presumed to be in violation of the rule, and banks must show that the positions were held to serve customers or hedge. The new Volcker rule presumes compliance. The balance of power will tip immediately to traders from regulators.\u2022 Under the Volcker rule now, banks have to show that trading positions held for customers are in line with what those customers\u2019 might actually demand in the near term. Assessing a legitimate level of demand can be difficult. Customers\u2019 appetites can change quickly \u2013 and the metrics used to predict demand were complex. To try and simplify this exercise, the new rule would allow banks to establish ahead of time the \u201crisk limits,\u201d or position sizes, they set for each trading desk. If a bank does not exceed those limits, they would be presumed to have a position that meets customer demand. Regulators on Wednesday said they would try to make sure that the banks\u2019 risk limits was in fact in line with customer demand, but the change clearly gives the initiative to the banks.In theory, as they relaxed the Volcker rule, regulators could have found simple new ways to increase the chances of compliance. For instance, they could have strengthened the part of the rule that requires C.E.O.s to attest that their banks are in compliance with the Volcker rule. But no changes appear to give it more bite.Some of the regulators argue that the Volcker rule was overly prescriptive and that the changes make it more like other banking rules, which, in their opinion, they enforce effectively. Indeed, on a conference call on Wednesday officials said the changes would make it easier to ensure banks comply.But the rank and file regulators can be expected to follow the lead of the political appointees who lead the agencies. If those people want to give the banks a break, the changes to the Volcker rule would clear the way for such a bonanza. \u201cThe proposed changes also put a lot of faith in banks\u2019 own internal risk models and put the onus on Trump-appointed regulators to vigorously police trading activities \u2014 a task I\u2019m not confident they are up for,\u201d Gregg Gelzinis, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said.- Peter EavisStorm clouds are gathering over the global economy, threatening a recovery that seemed to be gaining strength just a few months ago. The winners of Italy\u2019s election are at loggerheads with the E.U.; President Trump is stirring up trouble with America\u2019s biggest trading partners; and the markets and economies of developing countries once again look vulnerable.Blame the trilemma. The \u2026 what?He on Tuesday acknowledged that Italy is facing the trilemma:Here\u2019s how it works.For years, a country may have elected governments that accepted rules entwining it with other economies, reducing its national sovereignty. Italy accepted the fiscal and financial requirements of being part of the E.U., while the U.S. mostly embraced the free trade rules of the postwar era. But then governments came to power in Italy and the U.S. that questioned whether all that international integration was actually good for their respective countries.The United States is probably big enough that it can pull back from international trade agreements without causing itself severe near-term pain. But Italy is in a much weaker position, as the recent sell-off in Italian government bonds shows. Pressure from investors and leaders within the E.U. may well persuade Italy to back away from policies that diverge from the bloc\u2019s orthodoxy. But abiding by the E.U.\u2019s rules may not stimulate Italy\u2019s economy. That could, in turn, increase support for the populists.As Mr. Rodrik wrote:Finally, we can downgrade our ambitions with respect to how much international economic integration we can (or should) achieve. So we go for a limited version of globalization, which is what the postwar Bretton Woods regime was about (with its capital controls and limited trade liberalization). It has unfortunately become a victim of its own success. We have forgotten the compromise embedded in that system, and which was the source of its success.\u2014 Peter EavisHighly targeted research efforts and global collaboration are toward the top of the nation\u2019s checklist for dominating the world of technology.Nothing particularly new there, really. But he also explained some of his plans for making sure that China dominates the R.&D. underpinning those technologies.Part of that includes a focus on basic scientific research into carefully chosen areas with clear, real-world applications \u2014 a \u201cproblem-oriented\u201d approach, as he put it. Much of that might be done at a series of new national laboratories, which will focus on those themes.Also interesting was his insistence that seeking talent and collaborating with other nations would be a vital part of China\u2019s success. He said that solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems,from climate change to food security, would require a global effort. And he called out human talent as a precious resource, and an area in which, he feels China, still lags.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeBeyond scoring points on Twitter, Sanofi inserted itself into the broader issue of how companies should respond to social justice issues.Sanofi\u2019s tweet isn\u2019t nearly the same broad gesture as those. But it shows that the company is engaging in the debate on social issues all the same.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2014 Michael de la MercedOne day you\u2019re earning $1.5 million per year, the next the figure has $10.9 million. According to the WSJ, that\u2019s what happened to David King, the C.E.O. of the health care diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America.At least 16 companies in the S&P 500 have changed 2016 pay figures by more than 10 percent for one or more executives, while 17 did so for 2015 pay, a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from MyLogIQ LLC shows.Many changes, like LabCorp\u2019s, are errors caught after companies send proxies to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others can reflect changes in how the company decides to present the perks it has provided. In at least one case, the revised figure was the result of a retroactive pay cut.Microsoft\u2019s leapfrogging Alphabet in market value and new hardware from Nvidia are the latest signs that democratizing artificial intelligence tools is a lucrative business.The world is rapt by A.I. and the way it could be used to transform all kinds of industries. The problem: The technology requires stacks of computing power and significant expertise. So some companies have been creating A.I. software that\u2019s easier to use, then hosting it on their own cloud servers so people can pay for just the processing that they need to do, rather than shelling out for their own exotic hardware.That will allow other organizations to build more capable cloud A.I. systems and benefit from the wind filling Microsoft\u2019s sails.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeInvestors have suddenly shifted away from riskier investments like stocks and commodities and taken refuge in the relative safety of German and American government bonds, the United States dollar and the Japanese yen.Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone and has one of the largest piles of public debt in the world. A crisis there could endanger banks and investment portfolios everywhere.Elsewhere in tradeThe bottom line from the Justice Department\u2019s approval of Bayer\u2019s $66 billion deal for Monsanto: The department wants asset sales, not behavioral changes, in exchange for approving mergers.The question now: Will the cancellation lead to a big conservative backlash \u2014 perhaps led by President Trump, a supporter of Ms. Barr?\u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This change is aimed at decluttering the app\u2019s chat function.The pivots have some analysts worried about Mr. Spiegel\u2019s leadership of Snap.\u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is some direction,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media and technology analyst at BTIG. \u201cEvan was so decisive in that your friends are distinct from influencers \u2014 you\u2019re not friends with Kim Kardashian, so she shouldn\u2019t be in your friends list \u2014 and yet now they seem to be wavering on that.\u201dContent, rather than chat, is \u201cwhere the monetization potential is,\u201d Mr. Greenfield added.Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said, \u201cThe app redesign is a question and an open debate.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t know that the Snap leadership has proven itself to such a degree that you have high-conviction long-term investors in the stock right now.\u201dEven as Snap\u2019s growth disappoints, the company is spending a lot of money, which is another area of concern for investors. The company spent $36 million in the first quarter as it moved from Venice, Calif., to a new office in Santa Monica, Calif., up from $21 million in expenses the previous quarter.\u201cThey\u2019re spending money like a 1980s rock star,\u201d Mr. Ives said.Mr. Spiegel was unapologetic about the changes to Snapchat\u2019s app.\u201cWhen we build products, we\u2019re not just thinking about what our community is going to like to use right away,\u201d he said in a conference call on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking a lot about how our products will help us accomplish our mission.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Tuesday, he indicated he was ready to move on and continue Facebook\u2019s march of taking over people\u2019s online lives.At the social network\u2019s annual developer conference in San Jose, Mr. Zuckerberg, its chief executive, announced a slew of new products and technology features. They included a dating app for Facebook members, a group calling feature for the WhatsApp messaging service and photo filters on Instagram. Mr. Zuckerberg also said Facebook\u2019s cordless virtual reality headset, Oculus Go, was now available for $199.\u201cThe world would lose if Facebook went away,\u201d he said to a crowd of about 5,000 developers, tech executives and engineers \u2014 the kind of Silicon Valley audience he is at ease with. \u201cWe have a responsibility to move forward on what everyone else expects from us, to keep building in meaningful ways.\u201dIn the opening minutes of his speech, Mr. Zuckerberg also told the audience that Facebook was refocusing on how to keep people\u2019s personal information private and how to ensure that its platform couldn\u2019t be abused.Facebook \u201cwill never be unprepared again\u201d for attempts to undermine the democratic process, including elections, Mr. Zuckerberg promised. He also said Facebook was becoming more proactive in fighting false news and taking down fake accounts.When he introduced a feature called Watch Party, which lets people watch video and chat with their friends, he joked that his own friends had used Watch Party to discuss his recent appearances before Congress.\u201cLet\u2019s never do that again,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.But having dispensed with those preliminaries, he quickly moved on to a theme of \u201ckeep building.\u201d He began running through the list of new products and features.In particular, the announcement of the Facebook dating app quickly made waves, with the shares of Match Group, which runs dating apps like Tinder and OKCupid, plunging in response. Facebook\u2019s free dating app requires people to create a dating profile that is separate from their Facebook profile and that will be shown only to other users who have also opted in to the app.In something of an olive branch to the crowd, Mr. Zuckerberg said: \u201cI know it hasn\u2019t been easy being a developer these last few months. What I can assure you is that we are hard at work making sure people don\u2019t misuse this platform so that you can continue to build things on it.\u201dHe added that Facebook\u2019s freeze on approving new apps, which it had imposed after the Cambridge Analytica reports, was being lifted as of Tuesday. The announcement got applause from the crowd, which had been lukewarm up till then.After Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s speech, Jeff LaCroix, a co-founder of Naberly, a real estate app, said Facebook appeared to be moving on from its problems.\u201cWe are all in on leveraging Facebook,\u201d Mr. LaCroix said.Surbhi Bhatnagar, who works with the advertising tech company StudyBlue and attended the developer event, said Mr. Zuckerberg had done all right with his speech.\u201cNot all the concerns were addressed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut these are difficult problems to solve.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Populists Offer Giuseppe Conte for Prime Minister; N.Y.U. Claim in Question", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 In a significant step toward forming an anti-establishment government in the European Union\u2019s fourth-largest economy, the leaders of Italy\u2019s populist parties asked the country\u2019s president on Monday to accept a little-known law professor as their consensus candidate for prime minister.\u201cThe name we gave to the President of the Republic is the name of Giuseppe Conte,\u201d Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, told reporters after meeting with the president, who has the power to reject the nomination.Mr. Di Maio called Mr. Conte \u201ca professional of the highest level,\u201d intimately aware with the nation\u2019s problems as a child of the peripheral south. Mr. Conte, he said, \u201cis a self-made man and he\u2019s a tough guy. \u201dHe added, \u201cYou all will see.\u201dA dapper 54-year-old civil law professor with a taste for cuff links and white pocket kerchiefs, Mr. Conte has a long r\u00e9sum\u00e9 working for Roman law firms and associating with top-ranking Vatican cardinals.But with no political base or government experience, Mr. Conte\u2019s main qualification may well be his willingness to carry out a government agenda agreed upon by the populist party leaders.That agenda, which calls for lifting of sanctions against Russia, the revisiting of the bloc\u2019s budget rules and crackdowns on immigration, has already sent jitters through European markets and raised concerns that the erosion of the European Union may come from within its western European core.The nomination of Mr. Conte did not exactly assuage those concerns.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in the history of the Republic that the candidate for prime minister has been downgraded to the role of spokesman,\u201d Andrea Marcucci, a senator in the soon to be opposition Democratic Party, said in a statement.If the president, Sergio Mattarella, gives the green light, Mr. Conte will assemble a team of ministers, who are expected to be preordained by Mr. Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant League party, and Mr. Di Maio\u2019s new coalition partner. Both have designs on critical ministries.Reports in the Italian press suggested that Mr. Mattarella still had significant reservations about the direction of the new government. Late Monday evening he convened leaders of the Italian houses of Parliament to meet with him on Tuesday.But Mr. Di Maio seemed quite pleased with the choice. Smiling broadly under umbrellas outside Rome\u2019s Quirinal Palace, he talked approvingly to reporters about how Mr. Conte, who grew up in the southern region of Puglia, was a known entity to his party\u2019s base.Mr. Di Maio had proposed Mr. Conte as a potential minister for \u201cthe Civil Service, de-bureaucratisation and meritocracy\u201d during the campaign and has known him for five years. ANSA, the Italian state news service, reported that Mr. Di Maio had hired Mr. Conte as his lawyer and that Mr. Conte wrote a good deal of the justice section of the party\u2019s manifesto.(On Wednesday afternoon, the Five Star Movement disputed the ANSA report, saying Mr. Di Maio had never hired Mr. Conte as a lawyer and that Mr. Conte had worked on several sections of the party\u2019s shared policy agenda with its alliance partner, the League.)Mr. Salvini said in a Facebook Live monologue Monday evening that Mr. Conte was \u201can expert in simplification, and de-bureaucratisation, and slimming down of the administrative machine, which is what many businesses ask us.\u201dDuring his debut during the campaign, Mr. Conte, who specialized in public administration law, said that while he had voted for left-leaning parties in the past, he was drawn to the Five Star Movement because \u201ctoday I think the 20th-century ideological outlooks are no longer adequate.\u201dOver the weekend, Mr. Conte changed the profile picture of his WhatsApp account to a picture of John F. Kennedy with the words, \u201cevery accomplishment starts with the decision to try.\u201dHis friends said he was a breath of fresh air.\u201cHe has all the credentials,\u201d said Carla Lucente, a professor of modern languages and literature at Duquesne University and the Honorary Consulate of Italy in Pittsburgh.She knows Mr. Conte through their work together at the Villa Nazareth, a college in Rome associated with Duquesne University that has deep ties to the Vatican, including past and present power brokers like Cardinal Achille Silvestrini and Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli.\u201cThey know each other very well,\u201d said Ms. Lucente of the prelates and Mr. Conte.Nicholas P. Cafardi, dean emeritus and canon law professor of the Duquesne University School of Law in Pittsburgh, said Mr. Conte, whom he called \u201chighly talented,\u201d was his lawyer when he bought his house in Italy and handled legal issues at Villa Nazareth for Cardinal Silvestrini, who is the institution\u2019s president.Two years ago, when Ms. Lucente came to Rome for a Villa Nazareth event with Pope Francis, she said she saw Mr. Conte and his wife and son and noticed he was already a mover and a shaker in law circles. He had \u201ca driver and a beautiful limo,\u201d she said, but preferred to take his bicycle.She said he spoke excellent English, which is reflected in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, with numerous publications, and international work experience.He lists research at famous universities around the world, including Yale, the Sorbonne in France and New York University, where he said he \u201cperfected and updated his studies\u201d while staying at the college for at least a month every summer between 2008 and 2012.Asked about Mr. Conte\u2019s experience at N.Y.U., Michelle Tsai, a spokeswoman, said Monday, \u201cA person by this name does not show up in any of our records as either a student or faculty member,\u201d adding that it was possible he attended one or two-day programs for which the school does not keep records.Amid the dozens of courses Mr. Conte listed teaching on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, he included a summer class at the University of Malta called \u201cEuropean Contract and Banking Law.\u201dThat is especially relevant experience considering the potential government\u2019s agenda and the fear, based on the campaign promises and recent statements of the coalition partners, that it will not uphold contracts with the European Union on banking and other financial issues.But as the populist leaders approached real power on Monday, they seemed less brazen about poking the markets in the eye.Last week, Mr. Salvini and Mr. Di Maio had mocked the market reactions to their potential government, including the expanding spread on bond yields, which make it more expensive for Italians and Italian banks to borrow money.On Monday, Mr. Di Maio implored international observers to first give the government a chance before they started criticizing it.And Mr. Salvini, speaking a few minutes after Mr. Di Maio at the Quirinal Palace, said that foreign countries had \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d and that he only wanted a government that spurred growth and employment in the Italian economy.Mr. Di Maio and Mr. Salvini both ran for prime minister, and desperately wanted the job. During the campaign they constantly lamented that Italy had not had a prime minister directly elected by voters for years. Five Star in particular rose to prominence over the last decade excoriating professional politicians and presenting itself as a radical change agent.But now, intent to demonstrate that Mr. Conte reflects the will of the voters, many of whom had never heard of him, they sought to characterize him and the government he would nominally lead as deeply political.\u201cGiuseppe Conte will be a political prime minister chosen by two political forces for a political government with political figures in it,\u201d said Mr. Di Maio on Monday. \u201cAnd most of all with the support of two elected political forces.\u201dBut Ms. Lucente said she considered Mr. Conte\u2019s aversion to politics one of his great credentials.\u201cI never considered him a political person,\u201d she said.Elisabetta Povoledo and Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook and Twitter Plan New Ways to Regulate Political Ads", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook and Twitter announced plans on Thursday to increase transparency of political campaign ads, changes aimed at preventing foreign manipulation of the coming midterm elections.Facebook said it would begin including a \u201cpaid for\u201d label on the top of any political ads in the United States. Clicking on the label will take people to a page where they can view the cost of the ad and the demographic breakdown of the audience that viewed the ad.Twitter said it planned to restrict who could run political ads on its service, requiring those running political ads for federal elections to identity themselves and certify that they are in the United States. Foreign nationals will not be able to target political ads to people in the United States, Twitter said.In addition, Twitter said it would start giving prominent visual cues, including a badge and a disclaimer, to campaign ads. Accounts used for political campaigning must have a profile photo , and any advertiser\u2019s Twitter biography must include a website link that provides valid contact information.Candidates and political committees will be required to provide their identification number from the Federal Election Commission. Those who are not registered must submit a notarized form. Enforcement of the policy will begin this summer.\u201cWe are committed to enforcing stricter policies for political advertisers and providing clear, transparent disclosure for all ads on Twitter, with more details for political campaigning ads,\u201d said a statement from Vijaya Gadde, who runs Twitter\u2019s legal and public policy teams, and Bruce Falck, its general manager of revenue productTwitter\u2019s adjustments are similar to efforts by Facebook to verify political ads on its platform. Both companies have faced criticism in Washington for allowing Russians to use them to try to manipulate the 2016 presidential election. Some lawmakers have called for laws that require disclosures like those that Facebook and Twitter are promising.In April, Facebook began requiring proof that people posting an ad related to an American political campaign are in the United States \u2014 by giving the last four digits of their Social Security number, a picture of a government-issued identification and a United States mailing address. Facebook said it would mail a person a code that authorized him or her to buy Facebook political ads once the company had verified the other information.Facebook is promoting its other efforts to combat false information on the site as well. In addition to working with independent fact-checking teams, like Politifact, Facebook said this week that it would start a news literacy campaign to help teach the American public how to spot disinformation. It will include information posted at the top of the Facebook News Feed, as well as a print advertisement campaign that the company said would reach 170 million people in the country.Facebook added that it would begin working with academics to measure the volume and effects of disinformation on the social media site.Twitter, in addition to the new ad disclosure rules, said it would start labeling tweets from people running for office \u2014 but only with the candidates\u2019 permission. A label on the biography page of a candidate would indicate that the person was running for office and the seat being pursued. The label would follow each tweet sent or retweeted from that account.Twitter has begun requesting approval from candidates and expects to start using the feature at the end of the month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Foreign Activists Sway Ireland\u2019s Abortion Vote?", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.This Friday, Irish voters will decide whether to change their constitution to legalize abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The debate itself contains few new arguments; instead it circles around a question most other European countries have asked themselves over the past 40 years: What is the proper balance between the mother\u2019s right to self-determination and the unborn child\u2019s right to life?But there\u2019s another question, less about the substance of the issue and more about the campaign around it: In an era of global social media and well-funded foreign activists, what does it mean for a country to hold a vote at all? And if a democracy is no longer insulated from foreign influence, what integrity can any referendum claim?Forget hacking and illegal vote-buying. What\u2019s happening in Ireland is more transparent, but also, for that reason, more troubling.The vote, Ireland\u2019s fifth referendum in five years, is over whether to repeal the Eighth Amendment, which bans abortion except in cases where the mother\u2019s life is in danger. For such a small country, the vote has attracted enormous global attention, perhaps because Ireland remains a bastion of Catholicism in Europe.But Ireland is also a place that should be relatively safe from outside influence. Given its long history in the shadow of Britain, the country has long held its sovereignty and self-determination especially dear. Also, as a relatively small country, voters are used to personally knowing their political representatives, who spend a lot of time campaigning door to door.Ireland also has rules and laws in place to check undue influence: The Broadcast Authority of Ireland ensures balanced reporting on radio and television, and many of the country\u2019s major newspapers and magazines have followed. What\u2019s more, it is illegal to take money from abroad for political purposes: The government has ordered Amnesty International Ireland to return 137,000 euros (about $160,000) donated by George Soros, the American billionaire, allegedly to promote the repeal of the Eighth Amendment.None of these safeguards, however, can protect Ireland when it comes to social media. And, in fact, Ireland\u2019s experience is demonstrating just how vulnerable voters are to online influence.Abortion is, of course, an issue that is far from unique to Ireland; it is part of a larger cultural struggle, being fought around the world, over the conviction that liberalism has gone too far. For anyone in the world anxious to defend \u2014 or destroy \u2014 that status quo, the next battleground is Ireland. No wonder many Irish feel as comfortable in this referendum campaign as a fly under a magnifying glass.In many cases, those ads traced back to foreign activist groups, like Live Action and the Radiance Foundation, both American organizations.Or consider that Save the 8th, the most prominent organization against repealing the amendment, has hired a former online manager for the Brexit campaign in Britain, who used to work with Cambridge Analytica.John McGuirk, a spokesman for Save the 8th, rejected the notion that there was anything amiss in such cross-border activism, or in using data analysis to microtarget voters. But he also warned that outside activists might have limited success in a place like Ireland. \u201cThey think what works in Alabama will work here,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. I wish they\u2019d leave.\u201dHe also said that the growing concern in Ireland over foreign influence was a diversion. \u201cThe media and the yes side are so obsessed with the online ads, because when the political establishment loses, they will need an explanation for the defeat,\u201d he said.Calls are growing in Ireland for new regulations on social-media advertising targeted at voters, but if anything is done, it will come too late for this Friday\u2019s vote.In any event, experienced campaigners on both sides here believe they will win or lose the argument the old-fashioned way: walking the neighborhood, knocking on people\u2019s doors, engaging in real-life conversation and showing how much politicians and campaigners actually care about their cause.Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re right.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Parents Are Divided Over a Book in a Popular Student Reading Program in Oregon", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsAfter \u201cGeorge\u201d became one of 16 books selected for the 2018-19 Oregon Battle of the Books (or OBOB, commonly pronounced \u201cOh Bob\u201d) in the third- to fifth-grade division, two school districts in the state withdrew their elementary students from the competition for the next academic year. Representatives from the districts have said they will create their own version of the reading tournament instead. Administrators in other districts say they are weighing their options. (OBOB also has middle school and high school divisions. I volunteer as a middle school coach.)Since its publication in 2015, \u201cGeorge\u201d has garnered positive reviews from many news outlets, including The Times. It is published by Scholastic, a $1.6 billion company whose books are in thousands of classrooms across the country. The book has seen its share of controversy; indeed, it appeared on the American Library Association\u2019s list of the 10 Most Challenged Books in 2016 and 2017.A few parents, weighing in on the Oregon Battle of the Books Facebook group, objected to the book because it features a transgender child. More parents, however, singled out the older brother character, Scott, who, they say, behaves inappropriately in a book aimed at a younger audience. Scott appears on Page 6, banging on the door of a locked bathroom and demanding that George get out. Scott surmises that George is taking so long because she\u2019s \u201clooking at dirty magazines.\u201d Later Scott is more explicit, talking about copies of Girls\u2019 Life that George keeps hidden in a bag. \u201cDude, I thought you had porn or something in there,\u201d he says.Another sticking point: George has been able to find information about being transgender online after her brother \u201ctaught her how to clear the web browser history on Mom\u2019s computer.\u201dDarin Drill, superintendent of the Cascade School District, which is south of Salem, said in a phone interview that he had decided to pull the three elementary schools in his district out of OBOB competition at the recommendation of administrators at each school.\u201cFor my administrators, the idea of lying to your parents and a potential conversation about masturbation is probably not something we want our third, fourth and fifth graders to read,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we\u2019re saying is: Is the book developmentally appropriate for kids? And our administrators felt like it wasn\u2019t.\u201dA spokeswoman for the Hermiston School District in eastern Oregon cited similar reasons for that district\u2019s decision to keep younger grades out of OBOB for next year.The book\u2019s author, Alex Gino, said arguments about Scott were \u201ca decoy\u201d for discomfort with a book about a transgender child: \u201cOne would have to search through the whole book to find a few vague references. And if you are really looking, there are a few vague references. But the reason you were looking is because you were afraid about the trans issue.\u201dLinda Fukasawa, the administrative chair of OBOB, wrote in an email that members of the title committee for each division read all the books, and consider professional reviews and the quality of each title before putting a book on the list. The committee \u201cfelt that the anti-bullying and acceptance message in \u2018George\u2019 would be a good addition,\u201d Ms. Fukasawa wrote. \u201cNone of us anticipated this kind of reaction, and we did not intend for it to become a polarizing issue. We are greatly saddened that it has become so.\u201dThe OBOB committee is standing by its decision to include \u201cGeorge\u201d next year.Responses, in support of the book and against it, have numbered in the hundreds. A pro-\u201cGeorge\u201d petition currently has more than 1,500 signatures versus nearly 1,000 signatures on an anti-\u201cGeorge\u201d petition.Although other states offer Battle of the Books programs, Oregon\u2019s is especially vibrant, and fast-growing. The elementary school division is the most popular. During the current academic year, 869 teams went to regional competitions, according to Ms. Fukasawa. Some elementary schools have as many as 150 students participating from a single school. Although she didn\u2019t know the total number of students across the state in OBOB, a conservative guess would be more than 8,000, she wrote.Students form teams of four or five and master the content in 16 books. They face off against one another in intra-school \u201cbattles,\u201d similar to a quiz show, and then each school can send one team in each division to regional tournaments. Winners at regionals advance to the state finals. The program is voluntary, and no student is required to read every book. In fact, teams often divide the list to increase their odds of success.Debbie Huffaker, a mother of five in Grants Pass, Ore., has been following the debate on the OBOB Facebook group. She thinks that \u201cGeorge\u201d is not appropriate for the grade levels. Two of her children will be eligible for the elementary division of OBOB next year. She hasn\u2019t decided yet how she will handle \u201cGeorge\u201d with her kids.\u201cI feel like someone is pushing an agenda on these little kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI love Battle of the Books; I\u2019m a huge advocate.

{"Headline": "A Kentucky Town Votes Against a Culture War Rematch", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince Mr. Ermold announced he was running for county clerk in December, he raised more than $200,000 from around the country and drew supporters far and wide. This was a campaign, he said in an interview before the primary, for a \u201chappy ending\u201d to the whole, loud episode, for \u201credemption and how our county will be remembered.\u201dBut when the votes were counted on Tuesday night in the Democratic primary, the opportunity to face Ms. Davis, the Republican incumbent, in the November general election fell to someone else all together: Elwood Caudill Jr., chief deputy in the county property valuation office.\u201cJust like I told you,\u201d said Walter Blevins, the 68-year-old Democratic judge-executive of Rowan County. He was sitting back, between karaoke numbers, at the usual place he sings on Tuesday nights, sipping on his standard tequila with a splash of cranberry juice. \u201cIt\u2019s a local race. People know each other.\u201dMr. Caudill is a familiar figure, having run for county clerk in 2014 and come within 23 ballots of beating Ms. Davis, then a Democrat, for the party nomination. She went on easily to win the general election, as Democrats nearly always do for local office here. This time, Mr. Caudill won with 1,923 votes, in a field of four. Mr. Ermold, with 873 votes, was the runner-up.Perhaps Mr. Caudill\u2019s biggest appeal was that he only wants to talk about being county clerk. In a conversation about his ambitions for the office, he highlighted the need for a new fire alarm system so the sprinklers won\u2019t damage any of the deeds in storage.To people who lived through them, those long summer months were exhausting, aggravating and humiliating. Morehead, the county seat, is a quiet college town, with a City Council that in 2013 unanimously extended anti-discrimination protections to gay, lesbian and transgender people. But nobody outside the county ever seems to ask about this, or about the Kentucky Folk Art Center, or the lab at Morehead State where they build spacecraft. No, whenever county residents travel, they hear only about the clerk\u2019s office and the marriage licenses. People are not particularly fond of talking about it anymore, and certainly not to reporters who come around asking.\u201cMaybe it had to happen somewhere in the U.S., but I don\u2019t think any place would have raised their hand and said, \u2018Let it be here,\u2019\u201d said Jeff Fannin, a local pastor and the operator of The Good Shepherd\u2019s Printing Services. \u201cThe majority of the people I think were just embarrassed by how it escalated.\u201dPolitics used to be pretty predictable. The same families showed up in election after election \u2014 Ms. Davis succeeded her mother, who was clerk for 37 years. Caudill is as common a last name around the county as Smith or Jones. Then came \u201cthe whole deal that went on,\u201d as some call the events of 2015.The county clerk\u2019s office is essential: running elections, recording deeds, handling titles and issuing licenses for hunting, fishing and, of course, marriages. It is the front line of the government, the arbiter of what is officially recognized as legitimate, and what is not.Thus Mr. Ermold was maddened to hear his competitors, Mr. Caudill in particular, complain of the inconveniences of the summer of 2015, as he spent most of his life officially marginalized and in many ways left at risk.\u201cI not only understand but I\u2019ve been dealing with it for the past 44 years,\u201d he said.Still, it is a county office, one of 120 in Kentucky, and its commission is carrying out the routine details of bureaucracy, not setting a big social agenda. Mr. Ermold acknowledged that he had to combine his campaign message of redemption and social progress with an assurance that he could efficiently manage car tags and fishing licenses. \u201cI kind of didn\u2019t focus on that at first because I just took it for granted that I have the experience to do it,\u201d he said.Ms. Davis, who was unopposed on Primary Day, has a similarly two-pronged message. In an interview on Tuesday she insisted that she never sought the attention that came that summer, that she in fact hates conflict. She was not sure if she would run again this year but felt called to do so, and she wants to focus her campaign on her experience running the office.Mr. Caudill does not think Ms. Davis should have done what she did. He was not objecting to her beliefs, he said, but \u201cyou are elected to do a job.\u201d She did not do the job. This prosaic approach is why many of his supporters believe he stands a better chance of beating Ms. Davis in a general election than Mr. Ermold did.But it is also what left many fired-up local supporters of Mr. Ermold in a dour mood on Tuesday night, with one taking to Facebook to say he couldn\u2019t wait to leave a town he called \u201cbigoted.\u201dSome of the people at Pasquale\u2019s restaurant, where Democrats had gathered to watch the returns on Tuesday night, insisted it was nothing like that. A 2016 law had removed the clerk\u2019s names from marriage license forms, rendering the actual conflict moot. Running for the clerk\u2019s office to make a statement about social change, some suggested \u2014 well, that was the whole issue with Kim Davis in the first place.\u201cNow,\u201d said Traci Stevens, 24, who works at the local Cracker Barrel, \u201cit\u2019s just who\u2019s going to do the job better.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is This Artichoke Kosher? Rome Defends a Classic Jewish Dish", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLADISPOLI, Italy \u2014 As women wearing artichoke body paint caressed artichoke sculptures shaped like an owl, a snowman and a cobra at this seaside town\u2019s 68th annual Festival of the Artichoke, Ada Di Porto stood inside a tent, banging a peeled artichoke bud against a white plastic plate.\u201cIf you want,\u201d she volunteered, \u201cI will pound another 3,000 of them.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be kosher,\u201d the head of imports for Israel\u2019s rabbinate, Yitzhak Arazi, told Haaretz. \u201cIt\u2019s not our politics, this is Jewish religious law.\u201dThe dictate, coming as it did during Passover, was a bitter herb to swallow for Rome\u2019s Jews. The dish \u2014 basically a peeled artichoke, fried in oil and then refried in more oil \u2014 dates back to the 16th century, and a stroll down the restaurant row of Rome\u2019s Jewish ghetto shows that it is still very much a main attraction.Restaurants display raw artichokes on tables out front to draw in customers. Menus, ornate signs and prominently presented testimonials from fans like Anthony Bourdain (\u201cThis artichoke is terrific\u201d) proclaim carciofo alla giudia excellence.Using what he called \u201ca Talmudic type of reasoning,\u201d Mr. Pavoncello said that if Jews had been following the ancient kosher rule for centuries, it is unlikely that they would have suddenly made an exception for fried artichokes in the 16th century. Rabbis back then must have determined, he said, that Roman artichokes were impervious to worms, and thus edible.Watching his waiters carry out plates of gleaming artichokes, Mr. Pavoncello observed that \u201ckosher is a big business\u201d and expressed appreciation that his community\u2019s leadership had rallied for what the Rome daily newspaper Il Messaggero called \u201cthe artichoke war.\u201d\u201cThere is no pope,\u201d Mr. Pavoncello said.Some argued that the hard overlapping petals of their preferred mammole, romanesco and cimaroli artichokes seal out insect eggs and other invasive species. One local rabbi, Umberto Piperno, said in an interview that \u201cJewish Roman women know how to inspect the artichoke, and better than the rabbis.\u201dBut in order to keep the artichokes clean and kosher the world over, Rabbi Piperno hopes to patent an ultrasound flying-bug repellent he is developing; it works, he said, like a veritable \u201cIron Dome\u201d for artichokes.At the end of artichoke season, in mid-April, Rabbi Piperno sent Ms. Di Porto and other people of the artichoke to promote Jewish-style artichokes (and his ultrasound idea) in the heart of artichoke country.In Ladispoli, which in the 1970s and \u201980s became a temporary harbor for thousands of Russian Jewish immigrants escaping persecution in the Soviet Union, Ms. Di Porto, eyeglasses hanging on a string around her neck, methodically prepared for a cooking demonstration.\u201cIt starts at 4 Italian time, not German time,\u201d Ms. Di Porto, 64, said when she was asked when things would actually get going. \u201cPass me another one,\u201d she said as she poured a fifth bottle of extra-virgin olive oil into a big pot on a hot plate.After being expertly cleaned with a paring knife in a climbing spiral motion that removes all the peel and external petals (\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat and spit, as they say in Rome,\u201d Mr. Pavoncello explained) the artichokes are submerged in hot oil for about 10 minutes. Drained, dried and sometimes salted and peppered, they are, just before serving, refried in hotter oil that renders the outside crackling and the inside soft.Standing between the prep table and a poster of \u201cthe violet artichoke of Sant\u2019Erasmo,\u201d Ms. Di Porto and Claudio Nardocci, the president of an association promoting local Italian foods, deftly peeled artichokes over a black garbage bag. Mr. Nardocci spoke of the volcanic activity 600,000 years ago that gave the local fields, and the artichokes that grew there, lots of iron.\u201cIt\u2019s for this that it assumes such colors \u2014 look at what a work of art it is,\u201d he said, holding the artichoke up for appreciation like a fine wine. Ms. Di Porto instead emphasized the structural assets of the Roman artichoke; one reason women in the Jewish ghetto had used it for centuries, she said, was that \u201cinsects can\u2019t get in because it\u2019s entirely closed.\u201d\u201cAt the most, a little ladybug,\u201d Mr. Nardocci added.Minutes later, he officially began the event with more remarks about artichoke history and geology, including the update that recent bad weather had increased iron levels, a fact he said he had verified by walking the fields with a magnet.He introduced Rabbi Piperno, whose forehead appeared on a large screen via a terrible Skype connection, and who attempted to read a statement titled \u201cThe Dilemma of the Jewish-Style Artichoke.\u201d\u201cPart of the Jewish community,\u201d the rabbi began, before fading out. His voice returned to say \u201c2,000 years,\u201d then vanished again. Another awkward silence, then: \u201csuper kosher artichoke.\u201d\u201cNo one can understand a word,\u201d Ms. Di Porto called out as she squeezed lemon juice on the stripped artichokes to keep them from turning black.The hot plate under the oil stopped working, and Ms. Di Porto took a cigarette break outside the tent. There, artichoke enthusiasts read posters about the \u201cGreat Personalities\u201d who had enjoyed past fairs (\u201cRossellini came with his lovers\u201d) and about \u201cThe Artichoke Between Myth and Reality.\u201d (Zeus, the poster explained, had punished Cynara for rejecting his advances by turning her into a \u201cgreen artichoke with hints of violet like her eyes.\u201d)Ms. Di Porto\u2019s husband, Amedeo Marino, fixed the hot plate and she went back into the tent, where she rinsed her hands with lemon juice. With two forks she fished the artichokes out of the oil to prepare them for another, hotter oil bath.\u201cThis is the first Jewish-style artichoke to come out,\u201d Mr. Nardocci announced dramatically. \u201cThus it is refried. The Jewish-style artichoke is refried!\u201d\u201cLengthens life,\u201d Rabbi Piperno could be heard saying over Skype, then \u201cvalue of our identity,\u201d and then \u201cthe Jews.\u201dAs the event ended, a woman handed out bouquets of long-stemmed artichokes to fair participants from around the country, who lined up like potbellied beauty pageant contestants. In the meantime, Ms. Di Porto started handing out the fried artichokes.Anna Benedetti, 70, one of the dozen or so local women in the crowd, devoured her artichoke and shook her head at the mention of a foreign power\u2019s daring to mess with the jewel of Roman Jewish cuisine.\u201cExceptional. Delicious. What tenderness,\u201d she said. \u201cGood things should be eaten!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Protests Defined a Generation in France 50 Years Ago", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe photographs of Gilles Caron are the most comprehensive and enduring record of the civil unrest in Paris during 1968.Fifty years ago this month, France erupted. Students lobbed cobblestones at riot police in Paris\u2019s Latin Quarter. Millions of union workers went on strike. The government of President Charles de Gaulle tottered. Regardless of one\u2019s political persuasion, those who think back on the events of May 1968 are likely to conjure the images of Gilles Caron, whose photographs stand as the most comprehensive and enduring record of the period. To mark the unrest\u2019s 50th anniversary, the Parisian government and the Gilles Caron Foundation are presenting an exhibition dedicated to the photographer from May 4 to July 28 at the H\u00f4tel de Ville in Paris.After high school, Mr. Caron studied journalism in Paris for a year before becoming a certified parachutist. He served 28 months in the military, including nearly two years during the Algerian War. He was imprisoned for two months in Algeria after refusing to resist a coup attempt against de Gaulle in 1961.\u201cIt\u2019s not that surprising that he wanted to get into journalism and photography,\u201d said Robert Pledge, the co-founder and director of Contact Press Images, who once reported alongside Mr. Caron and represented his work for decades. \u201cHe was somebody who in the army had spent more time looking and observing than being able to speak.\u201d By 1968, at 28, Mr. Caron was already a star, a \u201cJames Dean of photography,\u201d according to Mr. Pledge. He\u2019d worked on Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s film sets, photographed the English fashion icon Twiggy, and covered the day\u2019s most prominent conflicts, including the Six-Day War, the Vietnam War and the Biafra War. Two years before the unrest in Paris, he founded the Gamma photo agency with the photographer and filmmaker Raymond Depardon and others. It soon became one of the most prestigious agencies in the world. While Mr. Caron was, according to Mr. Pledge, \u201calways on the side of the underdog\u201d and had expressed sympathy with the protesters, his photos of May 1968 represent the full range of parties involved in the events. He photographed Daniel Cohn-Bendit and the student assemblies at the Nanterre campus of the University of Paris, where the first protests began in March. He photographed the messy consequences of the garbage collectors strike. He photographed pro-Gaullist demonstrators on the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. He even photographed de Gaulle himself, during a state visit to Bucharest, Romania, that May while protests churned back home. \u201cEven if he had an opinion and had implicitly chosen a side he\u2019d always try to look at all sides of an event,\u201d Mr. Pledge said. Mr. Caron\u2019s photographs capture the key players, but they also contain a subject uniquely attractive to Mr. Caron: other observers. On the Rue Saint-Jacques, he photographed an artist sketching a line of police officers standing in front of the Sorbonne. On Rue du Renard, he photographed a rooftop full of photographers. In a cafe, he photographed a group of people listening to the radio. \u201cHe understood that an event is at the same time the action and its media representation,\u201d said Michel Poivert, a professor of the history of contemporary art and photography at the Sorbonne, who curated the H\u00f4tel de Ville exhibition.The protests fizzled in June, President de Gaulle remained in power, and Mr. Caron moved on to other conflicts. In 1969, he photographed the troubles in Northern Ireland and the anniversary of the Prague spring in Czechoslovakia. In 1970, he was taken hostage for a month while covering the civil war in Chad with a group including Mr. Pledge. Just a few months after their release, Mr. Caron traveled to Cambodia, where, one day, he disappeared in Khmer Rouge-controlled territory, never to be seen again. He was 30. \u201cThe interesting thing about Caron is that, in a way, he does represent that generation, that change, that movement, that aspiration to see the world change,\u201d Mr. Pledge said. \u201cHe used photography as a way to observe changing realities and underline the unfairness, the unbalance of situations. In those days, there was still the belief that photography could contribute to not only observing the world, to understanding it better, but that it could also contribute to making it better.\u201d Advertisement"}

Now, Activism Is Their Job.", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCONNEAUT LAKE, Pa. \u2014 The next stop on Kathy Rentz\u2019s mission to rescue American democracy was the Pizza Hut on Route 322. In a drably lit room in the back, more than a dozen people were already gathered, huddling over cheese sticks, pitchers of Diet Pepsi and maps of state legislative districts.The subject was how to end gerrymandering. The meeting opened with a brief talk about how parties in control \u2014 Republicans, in Pennsylvania\u2019s case \u2014 draw districts to lock in power. But it quickly turned to political tactics. Should they hand out fliers at the upcoming food festival? Better to go to a stubborn lawmaker\u2019s office in shifts or all at once?Ms. Rentz offered her counsel. \u201cI think,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to pester the life out of these people.\u201dFor most of her 74 years, Ms. Rentz was a mildly attentive Republican; since retiring eight years ago as a high school French teacher, she was content to spend her time gardening, knitting and spoiling her grandchildren.Now she is the kind of person who writes \u201cNot For Trump\u2019s Golf Trips\u201d across her federal tax return. She leaves a plastic bin filled with canvassing paperwork outside her front door in case fellow activists are looking for something to do. At candidate forums in V.F.W. halls 45 minutes from her home, there in the back sits Ms. Rentz.\u201cI\u2019d really like to go down to Philadelphia for my grandkids\u2019 piano recitals,\u201d she said. But all this, she continued, \u201cis now my job.\u201dBeneath all of this is a machine that keeps humming. In suburbs, exurbs and small towns around the country, and here in politically contested western Pennsylvania, the machine has been powered to a large degree by college-educated women in midcareer or retirement. Like Ms. Rentz, they often have no prior interest or experience in politics. But with the election of Mr. Trump, they were aghast at how they felt the political system, which most had taken for granted to the point of indifference, had allowed things to fly so far off the rails.\u201cI knew it was possible,\u201d said Beverly Graham, a retired special education teacher in rural Mercer County, Pa. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think it was probable.\u201dThese days they can be found in Pizza Huts, Panera Breads, living rooms and libraries, plotting political strategy to help Democrats wrest back power. They meet in small groups \u2014 dozens in western Pennsylvania alone \u2014 with names like Oil Region Rising, Slippery Rock Huddle, Progress PA, 412 Resistance, Indivisible Wexford. They have undergone a civics crash course, learning the intricacies of voter canvassing, candidate recruiting, database building and the often arcane rules of local politics.Their goals have become both narrower and more ambitious: Yes, to achieve Democratic victories in this fall\u2019s midterm elections, but also, more fundamentally, to rebuild the Democratic Party from the ground up, including in long-neglected places won by Mr. Trump. In party primaries in Pennsylvania next week, they will be focused not just on the congressional and governor races, but on their local Democratic committees, the county-level governing boards \u2014 an office so little celebrated that many of the seats have long sat vacant.\u201cIt was not, \u2018Oh my God, the Democratic Party is too far to the left or to the right,\u2019\u201d said Lara Putnam, a history professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has both participated in and studied the new grass-roots groups. \u201cIt was that we assumed the infrastructure was there and it\u2019s not.\u201dAround Pittsburgh, the grass-roots groups have coalesced into a sprawling and potent political operation. A \u201csuper PAC\u201d is even being formed. But farther outside the city, where the resources and activists are scarcer, the task of a political overhaul falls to anyone willing to put in the work.Ms. Rentz was drawn away from her lifelong Republican voting habits by President Barack Obama, whom she very much liked, though she did not support him beyond casting a ballot. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Bernie Sanders inspired much fondness.But she \u201chated hated hated\u201d Mr. Trump. This was not out of objection to any particular policy, but to nearly everything else: The name-calling, the bluster, the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, the mocking of the disabled, the tolerance of hate groups, \u201cthe fact that he couldn\u2019t complete a sentence.\u201dShe spent election night \u2014 her birthday \u2014 alone in the house where she had lived in the decade or so since separating from her husband. Once Pennsylvania was called, she went to bed dejected, a mood that darkened further when her youngest daughter called at 3 a.m. in despair. A week followed of venting on Facebook and subsequent unfriending, a foretaste of months of broken acquaintances to come. How could her and her friends\u2019 core values have been so different all this time? Invites to lunch were turned down, social gatherings barely tolerated. \u201cWhat are we going to talk about?\u201d she mused. \u201c\u2018How are the kids?\u2019\u201dShe found one woman in another part of New Castle who was also on the same hunt. She went to a march-planning conclave at a Panera Bread the next county over. Eventually she found a bus to Washington with a group out of Perrysville, organized by another former schoolteacher, Michele Knoll, who is now campaigning for State Legislature.At long last, Ms. Rentz thought, these were her people.When she returned, she began going to the meetings and marches of a relentlessly busy women\u2019s group in nearby Mercer County. After three months of watching and learning, she called Richard Christofer, the chairman of the Lawrence County Democratic Party. She introduced herself and announced that she and another woman wanted to form a group, Lawrence County Action.\u201cHave at it, girl,\u201d he said.Democrats in Lawrence County, on paper at least, still slightly outnumber Republicans, and as recently as the early 2000s, hundreds would gather for lavish Democratic Party banquets at the Scottish Rite Cathedral overlooking downtown New Castle. Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton all made visits. The election ground game was a force.\u201cThere was patronage and the old system and after that was the strong labor movement,\u201d said Mr. Christofer, sitting in his office at the New Castle Sanitation Authority. A life-size cutout of Dean Martin leaned in the corner; everywhere else there were souvenirs \u2014 photographs, Christmas cards \u2014 of Democratic luminaries.\u201cThe old system doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d Mr. Christofer said. Campaigning had years ago become organized around the candidate, not the party, but recently the national campaigns stopped showing up at all, at least here. Unlike the Republican Party, he said, the Democratic establishment, state and national, didn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cForget grass-roots politics, they just abandoned all that,\u201d he said. In 2016, \u201cwe didn\u2019t have banners, we didn\u2019t have signs, we didn\u2019t have anything.\u201dWith a sour taste from the experience, he has not done much campaigning work since 2016 and is not running again for chairman. Still, he is not entirely pessimistic about the party\u2019s future. \u201cDid you meet with that Rentz lady?\u201d he asked.Grass-roots groups across the state have been focused on gaining control of the Democratic State Committee, which oversees nominations for statewide candidates and the platform, and have been aggressively recruiting candidates in an effort to dislodge the existing \u2014 and to many, sclerotic \u2014 local leadership.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.\u201cI don\u2019t really understand why they hold these positions when they\u2019re not doing anything,\u201d said Christina Proctor, who is running for committee in her county southwest of Pittsburgh.But some party veterans, while praising the enthusiasm of the grass-roots activism, ask whether there is a broader vision. The volunteers seem less focused on ideology than the Tea Party, which hammered out a clear dogma of smaller government, galvanizing voters and leading to a makeover of the party and, eventually, the federal government. For all the tireless work of these new groups, what\u2019s the long game?\u201cIs it just to make yourself feel good or is it to make change?\u201d asked Matthew Mangino, a Democratic former district attorney in Lawrence County. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t like this president and I\u2019m mad as hell and I\u2019m going to put some door knockers on people\u2019s doors and I come home and feel good about myself\u2019 \u2014 is that really going to accomplish something?\u201dWhen asked for their political vision, some activists say that attaining certain policy goals isn\u2019t really the point.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like, what can we do more than what do we think,\u201d said Ms. Graham, the former Mercer County teacher, who is now running for local party committee. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound sexist, but I do think that women are less ideological and more practical.\u201dFor Ms. Rentz, there are perks to this new life: The dinners with her new friends in Mercer County and road trips with her new friends in Butler County; the old and almost forgotten acquaintances she comes across while door-knocking; the others she meets for the first time who seem as isolated and discouraged as she once was.The night of the Pizza Hut meeting, Ms. Rentz stopped for a quick dinner at a warm and jovial seafood restaurant up the road. Retirees sat around the bar catching up. One man spotted Ms. Rentz.\u201cWhat\u2019ve you been doing down in New Castle these days?\u201d he asked.Her \u201cBe The Wave\u201d pin was hidden by her coat; her tote bag, full of literature for the gerrymandering meeting, was in the car. The man only knew her as Kathy Rentz, retired French teacher.One day, she said, she would tell him.Advertisement"}

I don\u2019t get anything for it. It\u2019s just how I feel about my building.\u201dThen there are the outliers, on one side the residents who complain about absolutely everything in the building, and on the other side, those who, if subjected to withering cross-examination, would confess that they felt a bit of a pang when a doorman strike was recently averted. Trash removal duties would have afforded them a chance to spend time with the neighbors.They\u2019re the organizers: the first people to submit their proxy for the co-op or condo board election; the first to volunteer for Halloween and holiday parties; the planners-in-chief for a gathering in honor of the retiring doorman. Ms. FitzGerald, for example, is part of a group that\u2019s been working to establish a \u201clife line\u201d system for older residents in her building. She has also been instrumental in organizing an annual potluck dinner.\u201cThese people see the building as an extension of family,\u201d Ms. Braddock said. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s for family, you do all you can.\u201dOften, what some see as a problem in the building, cheerleaders see as an opportunity. \u201cThe elevators may often be packed, but because these people have made it a point to know all their neighbors, they\u2019re so busy talking to them that they don\u2019t even notice how crowded it is,\u201d Mr. Grossman said.\u201cThere was nothing in the courtyard and it was sort of taking forever for the co-op board and the management company to get on it and the weather was getting too nice,\u201d said Ms. Dercher, 32, who works in marketing for a data company.Finally, she and a neighbor stepped unto the breach, splitting the cost of several pieces of outdoor furniture (and keeping that contribution anonymous \u2014 until now). \u201cIt was our gift to the building,\u201d Ms. Dercher said. \u201cThis is my home. I want to make it great for everyone.\u201dShe and her husband bought their one-and-a-half bedroom apartment because of the light, the moldings and the hardwood floors \u2014 even if there isn\u2019t a single one that\u2019s level. They knew they had made the right choice when they went to their first shareholder meeting.\u201cEveryone was sweet, mostly our age, mostly first-time homeowners,\u201d said Ms. Dercher, who is now the vice president of the board. \u201cThere was a sense of community that people often say they\u2019re moving to the suburbs to find. I love this building.\u201dShe loves that a group of mothers hang out once a week after putting their babies to bed and that at almost every board meeting there\u2019s news of a birth. \u201cA few of us each choose a night and take dinner to the parents,\u201d said Ms. Dercher, who often posts an invitation to shareholders on the building\u2019s Facebook page to join her for a glass of wine in the courtyard.\u201cIt\u2019s not really in my nature to be a cheerleader for something,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m not generally \u2018this is the most, the best, the greatest,\u2019 but I do feel that way about my building.\u201dSo much so that when she sees prospective residents walking around the property, she invites them over to look at her apartment. \u201cI want them to see the potential,\u201d said Ms. Dercher, who can easily envision staying in the building when she\u2019s ready to upsize.Shelby Cinelli, who lives at River & Warren, a condo in north Battery Park City, Manhattan, said she would be the first to say if there were a problem in her building. But since she moved into a four-bedroom apartment two years ago, she hasn\u2019t had a single issue. The staff is attentive, the neighbors are warm, her two children have lots of playmates right on-site.Ms. Cinelli has played a large role in creating the family-friendly vibe she was seeking in a New York building. Less than thrilled with the tentative plans the sponsor had for the building\u2019s playroom \u2014 \u201cHe wanted to put a TV in there and I didn\u2019t like that\u201d \u2014 she formed a committee of like-minded fellow residents. They convinced the sponsor to give them the money he had earmarked for the space, \u201cand we did the playroom ourselves,\u201d said Ms. Cinelli, 37, a stay-at-home mother.She followed up with the formation of a committee to arrange a Halloween party, an event that included entertainment and snacks for the children and wine and beer for the adults.The event\u2019s success led Ms. Cinelli and some friends to arrange a catered holiday party in the lobby complete with a visit from Santa Claus, and subsequently, an end-of-summer \u201cwelcome home\u201d party and barbecue on the building\u2019s rooftop. \u201cI like to be involved,\u201d said Ms. Cinelli, whose involvement extends to encouraging others to buy in the building. One of her friends has already done so. \u201cAnd when I\u2019m in the elevator and I see a broker with clients, I\u2019ll tell them all the reasons they should move in,\u201d she said.Was it when Steven Sladkus raved to strangers about his family\u2019s co-op on the Upper East Side for the 20th time? Or was it, perhaps, the 100th? Whatever. At some point, his wife, Stephanie, told him to cool it.Well, good luck with that. The couple\u2019s two children \u201cwill be like \u2018Oh, Daddy, we\u2019re going upstairs\u2019 when I\u2019m in the lobby or outside schmoozing with would-be residents, but most people like my cheerleading,\u201d said Mr. Sladkus, 48, a real estate lawyer, who is especially bullish on his building\u2019s high ceilings and the thick soundproofing concrete sandwiched between each floor.He has breath enough to brag even when he\u2019s on the elliptical in the building\u2019s gym, and a sales agent comes in with clients. \u201cWhile I\u2019m exercising and sweating, I\u2019m giving a full dissertation on how great the building is and encouraging them to move in,\u201d said Mr. Sladkus, who bought his apartment 12 years ago, and who, needless to say, knows the name of pretty much everyone in the 52-unit co-op. \u201cI tell people that we allow washers and dryers and dogs and cats and rabbits.\u201dPerhaps he\u2019s guilty of being overenthusiastic, Mr. Sladkus said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve turned off a buyer \u2014 at least no broker has ever told me so.\u201dBesides, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t blindly love everything in the building. I don\u2019t always love the floral arrangements in the lobby. We had a tree in a pot in the lobby that I didn\u2019t like, but fortunately it lived a short life.\u201dWhen there are open houses, he shows up, and introduces himself to the attendees. He\u2019ll tell them that the shareholders are friendly, that although it\u2019s a tall building (26 floors), it has the feel of a small building and that it\u2019s the direct opposite of stodgy.Fellow shareholders can count on Mr. Silber to turn up at the rooftop summer gatherings and he has never missed a holiday or trick or treating at Halloween. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m not in costume.

Yes, it\u2019s still sweaty.It was a scene out of New York\u2019s grimy industrial age: thick black smoke billowing out of an old apartment building uptown.Except, we saw it last month.The culprit, we found, was heating oil.In New York City, thousands of buildings still rely on large boilers that burn oil to keep apartments warm.The pollution spewed from these boilers is one of the largest contributors to adverse air quality in our city, along with motor vehicles, according to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.Smoke that you see around town is probably not the nastier oil, but most likely from a boiler that was turned on after a long rest or was in need of repair, said Edward Timbers, the director of communications at the city Department of Environmental Protection. (Either way, if you see smoke you should call 311, Mr. Timbers said.)We were left curious about the city\u2019s future pollution problems, so we asked for a forecast.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Saturday Sunday Call it extreme sightseeing.The 32-mile walk was founded more than 30 years ago by the author and conservationist Cy A.

{"Headline": "Malaysia Sidelines Officials Accused of Ignoring Graft", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Malaysian officials accused of covering up a large corruption scandal stepped down or were placed on leave Monday as Malaysia\u2019s leadership continued to be upended by the defeat of the governing coalition last week.Mahathir Mohamad, the new prime minister, said Monday afternoon that the attorney general, Mohamed Apandi Ali, had been placed on leave.He was among the most prominent officials supporting Mr. Najib\u2019s assertion of innocence, and he may now face an investigation for what critics contend was a cover-up.Mr. Apandi showed up for work on Monday even though Mr. Mahathir said last week that the attorney general had been removed from office. He acknowledged in a text message that he had gone to work but declined to comment on his situation.Mohammad Irwan Serigar bin Abdullah, secretary general of the Malaysian Treasury and chairman of 1MDB, was also relieved of his duties on Monday.Mr. Mahathir also said he hoped that a new leader of Malaysia\u2019s anti-corruption commission would be announced by Tuesday. The previous commission chief, Dzulkifli Ahmad, offered his resignation on Monday, according to reports in Malaysian news outlets. He did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.Mr. Mahathir suggested on Monday that more officials would be removed. \u201cI have to get proper information, proper reports before I can act,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t just suspend any officer as I like. I want to do things according to the rules and the procedures.\u201dMr. Mahathir was prime minister of Malaysia from 1981 to 2003. Mr. Najib had been his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, but Mr. Mahathir later said that supporting him had been the \u201cbiggest mistake that I have made in my life.\u201dA former anti-corruption chief has already submitted two reports that he said contained evidence of Mr. Najib\u2019s wrongdoings.He served a previous prison sentence for sodomy and corruption, after falling out with Mr. Mahathir in 1998. The cases against him have widely been seen as politically motivated.Mr. Anwar was scheduled to be released in June but he could be freed as early as this week with a pardon from Malaysia\u2019s king, Sultan Muhammad V.The parole board is scheduled to meet Wednesday and is expected to recommend a pardon for Mr. Anwar, a required step in the process.Nurul Izzah Anwar, Mr. Anwar\u2019s daughter and a member of Parliament, said that the board was expected to rule that there had been a miscarriage of justice and that her father was innocent.The king\u2019s pardon would allow Mr. Anwar to participate in politics again, lifting a five-year ban on political activity that he would have faced based on his release under normal circumstances.Mr. Anwar is expected to replace the 92-year-old Mr. Mahathir as prime minister at some point. Mr. Anwar\u2019s wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, is the deputy prime minister and has long said that her goal was to win his freedom.The pardon process can take many months. An immediate pardon, which was agreed on last week in meetings between the king, Mr. Mahathir and Ms. Wan Azizah, according to the new prime minister, would accelerate the potential timetable for Mr. Anwar to take over from Mr. Mahathir.But there are still some hurdles. To become prime minister, Mr. Anwar must win a seat in Parliament. And for a new election to be held, someone must leave office to create a vacancy.Ms. Nurul Izzah said that there was no rivalry between the two leaders, who were once allies and then foes before becoming allies again.\u201cHe has given his unequivocal support to the prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, and the reform agenda,\u201d she said of Mr. Anwar.The days since the election have seen other dramatic turnabouts as the country adjusts to the end of decades of control by the former governing party.Tony Fernandes, chief executive of the budget airline AirAsia and one of Malaysia\u2019s most prominent businessmen, apologized on Sunday for supporting Mr. Najib.Before the election, Mr. Fernandes appeared in a video praising the government and Mr. Najib, who appeared in an AirAsia jet that had been painted with the slogan of the former governing coalition: \u201cMake My Country Greater.\u201dHe said that he had been under pressure after the head of AirAsia\u2019s long-haul arm grew increasingly outspoken in supporting Mr. Mahathir\u2019s coalition. And the addition of flights to allow Malaysians to return home to vote also angered the previous government, he said.Sharon Tan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside a Powerful Silicon Valley Charity, a Toxic Culture Festered", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Silicon Valley technology executives have amassed enormous fortunes in recent years, one relatively obscure group \u2014 the Silicon Valley Community Foundation \u2014 has emerged as the local charity of choice.Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has donated stock worth more than $1.8 billion to the foundation. Reed Hastings, the founder and chief executive of Netflix, has given $100 million. And many other tech titans, including the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Microsoft\u2019s co-founder Paul Allen, have donated millions.According to interviews with a half dozen former and current employees, some of whom agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity, Mari Ellen Loijens, the foundation\u2019s top fund-raiser, routinely bullied and demeaned colleagues, made sexually and racially insensitive remarks and at times even threatened physical violence.The employees say that Emmett Carson, the foundation\u2019s chief executive, ignored multiple complaints about abusive behavior by Ms. Loijens because she was responsible for much of the organization\u2019s growth.\u201cShe brought in the money, made the place bigger, and he could go out and be a superstar,\u201d said Rebecca Dupras, an executive who said she left the foundation last year because she no longer wanted to work with Ms. Loijens. \u201cHe could have stopped this and reined her in, and he didn\u2019t.\u201dCiting the ongoing investigation, Sue McAllister, a foundation spokeswoman, declined to answer specific questions about the allegations against Ms. Loijens and Mr. Carson.\u201cThe investigation will be thorough, and will include a focus on workplace culture, including among other things, how teams are managed and what type of working environment is being fostered,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not able to comment on confidential internal H.R. matters.\u201dMr. Carson initially suggested on Twitter he was unaware of the problems at his foundation, and has not spoken publicly since being placed on leave. He and Ms. Loijens did not respond to requests for comment.The foundation\u2019s upheaval has sent shock waves through the philanthropic world. Mr. Carson was a respected nonprofit executive with a rising national profile, and his ambition to make the Silicon Valley Community Foundation a national powerhouse was well-known.The foundation was formed in 2007 through the merger of two local charities that decided to pool their resources. Mr. Carson, who had worked at the Ford Foundation and was chief executive of the Minneapolis Foundation, was brought in to raise the group\u2019s profile.Community foundations have historically been local affairs, vehicles for wealthy individuals to give back to their communities by investing in regional nonprofit groups.But Mr. Carson had a grander mission. With huge fortunes being created by technology companies, there was a chance to make the Silicon Valley Community Foundation one of the nation\u2019s biggest philanthropies, an institution that could rival the foundations created with Gilded Age wealth a century ago.Mr. Carson pushed his team to raise as much money as possible, and the foundation increasingly gave grants not just to local groups, but to national and international causes, ranging from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire to the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Sweden.\u201cThere was this bigger is better mentality,\u201d said Dory Gannes, who worked at the foundation for two years, leaving in 2016 after what she said was a dispute with Ms. Loijens. \u201cOur world was driven by scale \u2014 how many clients we had, how many grants we processed, how many countries we made grants to.\u201dMs. Loijens, who came from the Junior League of San Jose, distinguished herself as an accomplished fund-raiser and made herself indispensable to Mr. Carson. Yet to her colleagues, Ms. Loijens was known as a bully who regularly made offensive remarks.During one meeting, Ms. Dupras said she mentioned to the group that she wasn\u2019t feeling well, eliciting a sexually charged retort from Ms. Loijens.\u201cShe said I was pretty good looking and might be pregnant,\u201d Ms. Dupras said. \u201cShe said, \u2018You might want to get that checked out.\u2019\u201dElizabeth Dressel, who left the foundation in 2012, said that one evening, a young black woman on her team was working late. Ms. Loijens approached the young woman and said, \u201cWork, slave, work.\u201dAt another meeting, Ms. Dupras said Ms. Loijens threatened her staff. Employees were supposed to take meetings with donors or their advisers in pairs, but Ms. Loijens learned that someone had met with a donor without a partner.\u201cThen she said, \u2018If I ever catch you having a meeting by yourself, I\u2019ll kill you,\u2019\u201d Ms. Dupras said.\u201cI personally went to H.R. on more than five occasions, and I was only there for one year,\u201d Ms. Dressel said. \u201cBut the culture was supported by Emmett because the sole focus was to increase the size of the funds.\u201dMs. Dupras said she attempted to discuss the toxic workplace culture with Mr. Carson twice, but was brushed off. \u201cHe was definitely not open to a conversation about her at all,\u201d she said.Despite the internal turmoil, money kept flowing into the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.Since 2011, Mr. Zuckerberg has donated some 45 million shares of Facebook stock to the organization, worth roughly $1.8 billion at the time they were given. In 2014, GoPro\u2019s founder, Nicholas Woodman, donated stock worth $500 million to the foundation. That same year, WhatsApp\u2019s co-founder, Jan Koum, donated stock worth $566 million.It was a distinction that grated on former employees. \u201cThis guy is enabling bullying in the workplace, then he\u2019s walking around promoting philanthropy,\u201d Ms. Dupras said.After the allegations first surfaced last month, Mr. Carson took to Twitter.But a former employee, Maria Moreno, quickly called out Mr. Carson.The next week, a group of 65 current staff members sent the foundation\u2019s board a statement that accused the foundation\u2019s leadership team, including Mr. Carson, of ignoring complaints about Ms. Loijens.\u201cThey knew about her behavior,\u201d read the statement, a copy of which was reviewed by The Times. \u201cAnd, through their inaction, senior leadership and HR has created and reinforced a toxic culture of fear, blame and intimidation.\u201dWithin days, Mr. Carson was placed on leave and the human resources director, Daiva Natochy, had left the foundation.Donors to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation have had little to say about the turmoil at their charity of choice. Representatives for Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Hastings said they support the actions of the foundation\u2019s board, which placed Mr. Carson on leave and began the investigation.Former employees said they anguished over their decision to come forward, fearing it would jeopardize their careers, but felt they had a responsibility to do so.\u201cThe focus was on bringing dollars in the door, rather than creating a culture where people were supported and respected,\u201d said Ms. Dressel, who added that it was her four daughters who encouraged her to speak out publicly.Ms. Dressel said she hoped the departure of Mr. Carson and Ms. Loijens would allow the foundation to start fresh. \u201cIt could be an amazing organization doing wonderful charitable work,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the United States foundations that are larger than the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. Both the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Society Foundations are larger; the Gates Foundation is not the only one larger than the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taliban Overrun Afghan City, Kill 30 People and Leave", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Taliban insurgents abandoned their effort to take over the capital of the western Afghan province of Farah, leaving the city early Wednesday without apparent opposition, local residents said.Even with 25 members of the security forces and five civilians killed, officials immediately hailed the insurgents\u2019 departure as a victory. They said that hundreds of insurgents had been killed in the one-day assault on Farah city and that the government\u2019s response proved it could beat back any Taliban initiative to take and hold territory.But for many Afghans, especially residents in battered Farah, the assault showed mostly that the insurgents could attack at will even against a well-entrenched government position backed up by both Afghan and American air power.\u201cThe Taliban managed to leave the city without a single shot being fired, and the night was calm,\u201d said Abdullah Khan, a resident reached by telephone. \u201cIt shows the utmost incompetence of our forces. The Taliban were wandering the Farah city streets openly without fear as if they had lived there a long time, making jokes with their friends and telling citizens to stay calm and not worry.\u201dThe decision to send the Green Beret soldiers into an area that is usually overseen by the Italian military echoes a similar tactic in October 2015 after the Taliban took control of the city of Kunduz. Then, the team of roughly 12 soldiers fought alongside their Afghan counterparts and helped call in airstrikes. The Green Berets were later found partly responsible for the Oct. 3, 2015, bombing of a Doctors Without Borders hospital, which killed at least 30 people.\u201cOverrunning parts of Farah city was a big achievement for the Taliban,\u201d said Atiqullah Amarkhel, a retired Afghan Army general and military analyst in Kabul. \u201cThey showed their power to the whole world.\u201dThat success would not have come, however, without support from Iran, Mr. Amarkhel said. \u201cThe main reason for the collapse of parts of Farah is Iran,\u201d he said.Najib Danish, the spokesman for the Interior Ministry, declared the fighting over Wednesday, saying: \u201cThe whole Farah city is cleared from the Taliban. Around 300 members of the Taliban were killed in the fighting. House-to-house searching for the Taliban and clearance operation is underway.\u201dBut across the country, the insurgents were claiming more territory on Wednesday. The Taliban said that two more areas had fallen to their fighters: Jaghatu district in Ghazni Province in the country\u2019s southeast, and Dara-e Bom in Badghis Province in the northwest, according to a WhatsApp statement from the Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid.In Badghis Province, Faiz Mohammad, the deputy governor, denied the Taliban assertion on Dara-e Bom. \u201cThis area is in government control, and the claims in this regard are untrue,\u201d he said. Officials in Ghazni Province could not immediately be reached.But Mirza Ali, the departing governor of Qades district, which includes Dara-e Bom, confirmed that government forces abandoned their defense of Dara-e Bom against the Taliban late Tuesday night.He said that there had been 360 soldiers and police guarding the strategic area but that all had fled without offering resistance, allowing the insurgents to take control.A provincial council member in Farah, Dadullah Qani, said that the insurgents left the city after Afghan security forces began searching for them house by house, and that they had left behind booby-trapped bombs.Mr. Khan, the Farah resident, said that the insurgents mostly left homes and businesses alone, but that they did burn several cafes that served alcohol, leaving notes warning their owners against doing so.Fahim Abed reported from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan. Reporting was contributed by Jawad Sukhanyar from Kabul, Najim Rahim from Mazar-i-Sharif, Rod Nordland from London and Thomas Gibbons-Neff from Brussels.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brink\u2019s Truck Spills Cash on Highway, and Drivers Scoop It Up", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was hardly a cloud in the sky over Indianapolis on Wednesday morning when it started raining money.In a moment that instantly tested the core of human morality, the definition of right and wrong, and the limits of acceptable risk, the back door of a Brink\u2019s armored truck swung open during rush hour on Interstate 70, blowing bags of cash onto the highway.There was money \u2014 $600,000, troopers estimated \u2014 everywhere.Some bags tumbled onto the road and stayed intact \u2014 thousands of dollars, sorted and organized, just sitting there for the taking. Others ripped open, showering cash over four lanes of the interstate. On the shoulder, $20 bills gathered like leaves and formed piles in the grass off the highway.Suddenly, the timeless hypothetical question became reality: What would you do?A school bus driver knew what he would do, the police said. He pulled over on the highway, jumped out from the driver\u2019s seat and grabbed some cash before driving away. So did four men in a white pickup truck who snatched an entire bag and then sped off.\u201cOne of those little bank trucks just dropped all this money and people just came out here,\u201d Ms. Danae said as she walked along the highway shoulder, which was covered in $20 bills.At some point during the mayhem, word must have spread to people living in the residential area off the interstate in West Indianapolis. They started jumping fences and frantically stuffing their pockets with cash.Within minutes, the cash grab was over. State troopers blocked traffic on the highway, helped Brink\u2019s employees collect what remained of the money and warned people that they would be arrested if they pocketed any of it.The officers didn\u2019t find it amusing.\u201cYou got money?\u201d a trooper asked Ms. Danae in her video. No, she replied.Ms. Danae, 25, said in an interview on Thursday that she was driving her grandmother to the airport when traffic came to a standstill on Interstate 70. At first, she thought the people running out of their cars were trying to rescue people in a bad accident.But then her grandmother\u2019s friend, a passenger in the car, spotted the real reason. \u201cThere\u2019s money!\u201d the woman screamed, prompting all of them to hop out.Ms. Danae said it was tempting to grab a handful of cash, but she knew she would have not been able to sleep at night. \u201cI have three kids, and I didn\u2019t want to put myself in that situation,\u201d she said.Troopers at the scene told local news media that the Brink\u2019s truck had unloaded about $600,000. A company spokesman said the episode was under investigation and declined to offer additional information.The Indiana State Police said later that the exact figure would not be released but that it was a \u201csubstantial amount.\u201d And they issued a warning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Weak Unions Get Teachers More Money?", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThat followed a roughly $6,000 salary increase that Oklahoma teachers won by threatening a walkout (and later following through). Which in turn came on the heels of a 5 percent raise for teachers in West Virginia, who had shut down schools for almost two weeks.That all this took place in so-called right-to-work states, where the power of unions is limited, raises some interesting questions: Do weak unions go hand-in-hand with more effective political activism? Would strong organized labor prevent teachers from getting their way? After all, in Wisconsin, a state where unions were famously powerful, public sector workers suffered a historic defeat at the hands of Gov. Scott Walker in 2011.Yet the reality is closer to the opposite.But in certain parts of the state, the unions have not only remained viable, they\u2019ve become more aggressive.Consider Racine, a city of about 75,000 in southeastern Wisconsin, whose teachers have voted overwhelmingly to retain their union.Just before the Walker measures were enacted, the union secured a two-year extension of its favorable contract \u2014 with strict rules on class size, staffing and evaluation procedures. When that contract ended, the union saw to it that most of the key elements were inserted into a \u201chandbook,\u201d said Peter Knotek, a recent president. That included a requirement that the district consult with the union on policy changes.\u201cWe were pursuing an agenda of growing power independent of any other institution in the community,\u201d Aaron Eick, one of Mr. Knotek\u2019s successors as union president, said in an interview last week.The teachers\u2019 union in Racine is proof that strong unions provide more than just wage increases and protection from arbitrary bosses. They provide a kind of social glue \u2014 making members feel invested in a larger mission and promoting a sense of solidarity. Thanks to their involvement in the union, Racine teachers immediately understood the threat that Governor Walker\u2019s plan posed. Hundreds trooped to the capital to resist it.\u201cVery scared and conservative people were like, \u2018All right, fine,\u2019\u201d Mr. Eick said. \u201cPeople who you never would have thought would participate\u201d got involved.In West Virginia, by contrast, it was years before teachers rose up to protest their eroding standard of living.Beginning in 2014, after the Republican-controlled Legislature refused to increase funding for health insurance, foisting benefit cuts and cost increases onto public sector workers, the teachers\u2019 unions pleaded their case to lawmakers. But the unions were ineffectual because they struggled to rile up their membership. Even in many counties where the unions were active, most members were disengaged.Nicole McCormick, a music teacher who helps lead the Mercer County local, said, \u201cIt was like the same 15 faces at every meeting,\u201d even though there were hundreds of members. For the rest, she added: \u201cI was having to say the same thing 25 times and they still wouldn\u2019t understand. \u2018What do you mean? What legislation?\u2019\u201dWorse, the lack of collective bargaining rights set teachers against one another, distracting them from external threats. Without collective bargaining, no one union can operate as the exclusive representative of teachers in a county. In that vacuum, at least two unions competed to scare up members.\u201cThe unions spend a lot of time trying to out-recruit the other one,\u201d said Jay O\u2019Neal, a seventh-grade English teacher from Charleston who was a leader of the protest movement.Mr. O\u2019Neal and his colleagues were remarkably successful at building momentum for the walkout through a Facebook group. But they won only a down payment on what they\u2019d hoped for. The health insurance issue was deferred to a task force that began public hearings last week \u2014 not coincidentally, long after the fervor had subsided.Mr. O\u2019Neal observed that \u201cwe\u2019ve seen people fall off, not be as involved\u201d since the strike was resolved in March, pointing to another problem with weak unions: It is much easier to rouse people for a single, high-profile fight than for sustained advocacy. For that you need institutions that carry on the struggle while workers get on with their daily lives.\u201cI think sometimes it\u2019s a little glib for people on the political left to say we should just have a more fired-up base,\u201d said Joseph Slater, an expert on public employee unions at the University of Toledo College of Law. \u201cWorkers have full-time jobs.\u201dOf course, strong unions can bring their own baggage. Leaders can grow remote from their membership. A union\u2019s strength may give it irrational confidence that it can defeat threats through conventional politics \u2014 like elections and lobbying \u2014 rather than more radical measures, like work stoppages.In West Virginia, by contrast, the weakness of the unions left workers no choice but to take the lead. And the unions were in no position to resist. \u201cI said the unions won\u2019t start the movement, but if it hits critical mass, they\u2019ll have to join in,\u201d said Ryan Frankenberry, West Virginia director of the Working Families Party, who advised Mr. O\u2019Neal and his colleagues.But, in the end, there is no substitute for a strong union in a long-term struggle against powerful antagonists. And even the West Virginia walkout would have been impossible without the unions, which presided over an authorization vote in every county. \u201cYou can\u2019t organize a strike on Facebook, even if everyone sounds really excited,\u201d said Cathy Kunkel, an organizer with the progressive group Rise Up West Virginia who helped teachers strategize.To really get teachers marching in lock step, Ms. Kunkel said, they needed the heft of a union.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Peter Knotek was the president of the union in Racine when it fought for the continuation of key contract elements. He had recently served as president, but was not president at the time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Will Italy\u2019s Next Government Do? A Leak Jolts Stocks", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Talks between two anti-establishment parties to form a new Italian government seemed to be regaining momentum on Wednesday, even as financial markets were spooked by leaked documents that suggested the two sides shared a desire to radically change Italy\u2019s relationship with the European Union.The leaders of the Five Star Movement and the anti-immigrant League party dismissed the leaked document Tuesday night as \u201cold.\u201dBut the draft, which was on the negotiating table as of Monday morning, was apparently not \u201cold\u201d enough to avoid raising jitters. On Wednesday, investors shed Italian assets, and shares trading on the Milan stock market slipped.In a series of joint statements, the two parties tried to distance themselves from the positions in the document, but in doing so only seemed to further betray their real ambitions for what they called \u201ca rethink\u201d of Italy\u2019s relationship to the European Union and the common currency of most of its members, the euro.In a joint statement Tuesday night, they protested that the proposals in the leaked document had been \u201cradically changed\u201d in subsequent meetings. \u201cFor example, on the euro, the parties have already decided not to put in discussion the single currency,\u201d it said.That statement said they preferred to return to the arrangement before the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, which created the framework and fiscal rules for the euro \u2014 a time when the Italian lira was the coin of the realm.\u201cThe structure of European economic governance, based on the dominance of the market, and the respect for rules that are stringent and unfounded from a social and economic point of view, requires a rethink with our European partners,\u201d they said. \u201cThe spirit must be to return to the pre-Maastricht setting.\u201dLeft unaddressed was the document\u2019s proposed request to the European Central Bank that it cancel 250 billion euros, or almost $300 billion, in Italian debt, which some analysts think violates a European Union treaty.The document showed that they would also like to revisit Italy\u2019s contributions to the European Union budget and protect Italian small businesses from the bloc\u2019s free market and expanded work-hour rules.The proper relationship with Europe has apparently been a sore spot between the parties, and between the parties and Mr. Mattarella, in this week\u2019s tense negotiations.As a result, either they form a government together or Italy will return to new election, probably in the fall.During the campaign and in the days of negotiations, Five Star had sought to ease concerns, perhaps including those of Mr. Mattarella, about their antagonism toward the European Union.But the leaked document, the authenticity of which has not been disputed, revealed that their anti-establishment and euroskeptic heart still pulsed.\u201cWe confirm our membership of the North Atlantic alliance, with the U.S. as a privileged ally and an opening to Russia, which should not be viewed as a threat but an economic and commercial partner,\u201d the document reads.As part of the immediate fallout, the spread between Italy\u2019s and Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yields grew.Mr. Salvini, speaking on Facebook live, relished the angst.Then he took aim at the elites in Washington, Berlin and Brussels, saying that he would ignore their concerns about the potential new Italian government and put Italians first.\u201cIf, in the little salons where they decided our children should live precariously and with fear, they are worried,\u201d he said, \u201cif these little salons who massacred our future are worried, it means that we are doing something right.\u201cThe more they insult us, the more they threaten us and the more they blackmail us, the more they make me want to take this challenge on,\u201d he said, adding that he and Mr. Di Maio had already agreed on a rollback of pension overhauls, fiscal reforms, the use of a flat tax and a universal basic income.He made the case that an interior minister from his party would slam shut the door for illegal immigrants, and speed up asylum requests in camps outside Italy.Speaking directly into the phone on a sunny field, Mr. Salvini showed a disposition remarkably sunnier than he had on Monday afternoon, when he suggested the fledgling alliance could be in peril.\u201cWe have taken big steps forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be crazy to fall in the moment of truth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The News Isn\u2019t Fake. But It\u2019s Flawed.", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistThis is a condensed version of the 2018 Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture, delivered at the University of California, Riverside, on Friday.On the last Saturday of April, Donald Trump, who doesn\u2019t exactly like working on weekends, made a trip to Michigan for a rally. He touted what he saw as the many accomplishments of his administration so far. He railed against all of the injustices that he must endure. And of course he bashed the media.\u201cThese are very dishonest people \u2014 many of them,\u201d he said, and I must admit: The \u201cmany of them\u201d qualifier surprised and gratified me. It was atypically generous of the president. \u201cFake news,\u201d he muttered. \u201cVery dishonest,\u201d he groused. \u201cThey don\u2019t have sources,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThe sources don\u2019t exist.\u201dWhile he was painting this portrait of us as frivolous and sour, what image were we putting out? That night, at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner, journalists swanned into a ballroom as thick with self-regard as any Academy Awards auditorium. They listened to the comedian Michelle Wolf do what she was hired to: savage Trump and his aides in vicious and occasionally vulgar terms that predictably caused the media\u2019s enemies to trumpet that journalists are no more dignified than the president whose indecency they lament.Tim Alberta, who writes for Politico, correctly noted that \u201cevery caricature thrust upon the national press \u2014 that we are culturally elitist, professionally incestuous, socioeconomically detached and ideologically biased \u2014 is confirmed by this train wreck of an event.\u201d Kyle Pope, the editor of Columbia Journalism Review, pointed out the inevitability of that train wreck, observing that the event itself is \u201cdestined to be either sycophantic, on one extreme, or meanspirited, on the other. Neither is a good look at a time when trust in media is tenuous.\u201dWe\u2019re under sustained attack by a shameless president whose contempt for a free press is profound. And regardless of the merits of that attack, our response is pivotal to surviving it and preserving the public\u2019s trust.In many ways, that response \u2014 from excavations of links between Trump and Russia to expos\u00e9s of the workings of Facebook \u2014 has been excellent, a perfect illustration of why journalists are so vital.But other aspects of our reaction trouble me. Because Trump is so hyperbolic \u2014 and so dishonest \u2014 about our vices, we\u2019re prone to focusing excessively and even exclusively on our virtues. We sing an immodest aria about them.\u201cI won\u2019t dispute that journalists are crucial to a free society,\u201d he wrote. But \u201cthe chords that aggrieved journalists strike make them sound as entitled as tenured professors.\u201dPushed up against the ropes, we\u2019re so busy self-justifying that we sometimes forget to self-examine. And there are aspects of how we work \u2014 and how we come across \u2014 that definitely warrant adjustment.We indulge too often in snark for snark\u2019s sake, using it not in the service of an essential point but because it\u2019s fun and gets attention.I was trying to cast his coiffure as a metaphor for his inconstancy and obsession with surfaces. But still. I played into a caricature of journalists as smart alecks taking cheap shots from the cheap seats. We have to watch our tone. We really do.It\u2019s impossible to talk about tone without talking about Twitter, so let\u2019s. Are we right to spend so much of our time there? Twitter is a powerful tool, a handy delivery system for bulletins, fact checks, links. But too often, we use it as a vanity fair and an ego fortification system. Driven by the dopamine of \u201clikes\u201d and retweets, we jockey to be bitchiest or most blistering, snidest or most sarcastic. These gibes are then used against us. I also believe that the sniping nurtured on Twitter seeps into our interactions elsewhere.Meanwhile, more and more of us are yoking ourselves to increasingly narrow ideological and oratorical identities. A particular perspective of ours draws notice. We get bookings \u2014 on television, for speeches \u2014 based on it. It becomes a brand with financial rewards. Press this button and get this argument. We\u2019re economically welded to it. And as it grows more fixed, we appear less genuine.We\u2019re also served poorly by an occasionally reflexive pessimism bereft of adequate nuance or a sufficient sense of triage. Don\u2019t hear me wrong: If Trump\u2019s press is overwhelmingly negative, that\u2019s because he has earned it. But we sometimes go too hard on lesser actors and episodes, potentially sacrificing the credibility and authority that we need for more galling moments.One bit of recent press coverage raked Mick Mulvaney, a former congressman who is now the White House budget director, over the coals for saying: \u201cWe had a hierarchy in my office in Congress. If you\u2019re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn\u2019t talk to you. If you\u2019re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to be lulled into a false security by the \u201cTrump bump\u201d in business for many newspapers and networks, whose fans are more passionately engaged than before. But that bump may not last forever, and it doesn\u2019t do away with the misgivings that a majority of Americans have about us.It\u2019s also easy to be so fixated on the ludicrousness of some of the charges that the president hurls at us that we fail to improve in ways that he\u2019s not discussing. The news that we report is real. But so is the need to be even better at reporting it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why A.I. and Cryptocurrency Are Making One Type of Computer Chip Scarce", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two technology booms \u2014 some people might call them frenzies \u2014 are combining to turn a once-obscure type of microprocessor into a must-have but scarce commodity.Artificial intelligence systems, made by companies ranging in size from Google to the Chinese start-up Malong Technologies, rely heavily on a computer chip called a graphics processing unit, or G.P.U. The chips are also very useful in mining digital currencies like Ethereum, a Bitcoin alternative riding the same wave of hype as its more famous cousin.With people and companies involved in the two surging tech niches buying up the same chips, G.P.U.s have been in short supply over the past several months. Prices have increased by as much as 50 percent, according to some resellers and customers.\u201cThe chips are simply going out of stock,\u201d said Matt Scott, a technologist from the United States who founded Malong after leaving Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Beijing in 2014. \u201cAnd the problem is getting worse.\u201dMalong, based in Shenzhen, is building a system that can analyze digital photos and learn to recognize objects. Doing so requires an enormous number of photos, and analyzing all these photos depends on the G.P.U. chip.When the company recently ordered new hardware from a supplier in China, the shipment was delayed by four weeks. And the price of the chips was about 15 percent higher than it had been six months earlier.\u201cWe need the latest G.P.U.s to stay competitive,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cThere is a tangible impact to our research work.\u201dBut he did not blame other A.I. specialists for the shortage. He blamed cryptocurrency miners. \u201cWe have never had this problem before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was only when crypto got hot that we saw a significant slowdown in our ability to get G.P.U.s.\u201dG.P.U.s were originally designed to render graphics for computer games and other software. In recent years, they have become an essential tool in the creation of artificial intelligence. Almost every A.I. company relies on the chips.Speculators in digital currency are snapping up G.P.U.s for a very different purpose. After setting up machines that help run the large computer networks that manage Ethereum and other Bitcoin alternatives, people and businesses can receive payment in the form of newly created digital coins. G.P.U.s are also efficient for processing the math required for this digital mining.Crypto miners bought three million G.P.U. boards \u2014 flat panels that can be added to personal and other computers \u2014 worth $776 million last year, said Jon Peddie, a researcher who has tracked sales of the chips for decades.That may not sound like a lot in an overall market worth more than $15 billion, but the combination of A.I. builders and crypto miners \u2014 not to mention gamers \u2014 has squeezed the G.P.U. supply. Things have gotten so tight that resellers for Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chip maker that produces 70 percent of the G.P.U. boards, often restrict how many a company can buy each day.\u201cIt is a tough moment,\u201d said Kevin Scott, Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cWe could do more if we had more of these\u201d chips in data centers. \u201cThere are real products that could be getting better right now for real users. This is not a theoretical exercise.\u201dAMD, another G.P.U. supplier, and other companies say some of the current shortage is a result of a limited worldwide supply of other components on G.P.U. boards, and they note that retail prices have begun to stabilize. But in March, at his company\u2019s annual chip conference in Silicon Valley, Nvidia\u2019s chief executive, Jen-Hsun Huang, indicated that the company still could not produce the chips fast enough.This has created an opportunity for many other chip makers. A company called Bitmain, for instance, has released a new chip specifically for mining Ethereum coins. Google has built its own chip for work on A.I. and is giving other companies access to it through a cloud computing service. Last month, Facebook indicated in a series of online job postings that it, too, was working to build a chip just for A.I.Dozens of other companies are designing similar chips that take the already specialized G.P.U. into smaller niches, and more companies producing chips means a greater supply and lower prices.\u201cYou want this not just for economic reasons, but for supply chain stability,\u201d said Mr. Scott of Microsoft.The market will not diversify overnight. Matthew Zeiler, the chief executive and founder of a computer-vision start-up in New York, said the prices of some of the G.P.U. boards that the company uses have risen more than 40 percent since last year.Mr. Zeiler believes that Nvidia will be very hard to unseat. Many companies will stick with the Nvidia\u2019s technology because that is what they are familiar with, and because the G.P.U. boards it provides can do more than one thing.Kevin Zhang, the founder of ABC Consulting, has bought thousands of G.P.U.s for mining various digital currencies. He said that a chip just for, say, mining Ethereum was not necessarily an attractive option for miners. It cannot be used to mine other currencies, and the groups that run systems like Ethereum often change the underlying technology, which can make dedicated chips useless.Interest in digital currency mining could cool, of course. But the A.I. and gaming markets will continue to grow.Mr. Zeiler said that his company had recently bought new G.P.U.s for its data center in New Jersey, but could not install them for more than a month because the computer racks needed to house the chips were in short supply as a result of the same market pressures.\u201cThe demand,\u201d he said, \u201cis definitely crazy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a researcher who tracks graphics processing units. He is Jon Peddie, not Joe.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a deflection, sure, but also not entirely wrong.Facebook said it began an investigation to find other groups that used data-harvesting tactics similar to those employed by Cambridge Analytica.

{"Headline": "For \u2018Columbiners,\u2019 School Shootings Have a Deadly Allure", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTA FE, Tex. \u2014 The exact reasons a teenage gunman shot his fellow students and teachers here at Santa Fe High School remain a mystery. His model for carrying it out is more clear.The 17-year-old junior wore a black trench coat and fired a sawed-off shotgun, the same attire and weaponry used by the two gunmen who killed a dozen students and a teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999.He wore a T-shirt with the phrase \u201cBorn to Kill\u201d on it in bold, similar in design to those worn by the Columbine attackers, which read \u201cWrath\u201d and \u201cNatural Selection.\u201dHis crude arsenal included canisters of carbon-dioxide gas and Molotov cocktails, two types of explosives used by the Columbine gunmen.The picture he had posted of his trench coat on Facebook showed a small red-star medallion with the Communist hammer-and-sickle on the collar, the same type of button a Columbine gunman attached to his boot.It was not the first time a high school suddenly engulfed in gunfire and death found itself looking for clues in the random symbology of a nearly 20-year-old mass shooting that has become, it seems, the standard by which youthful gunmen across America have come to measure themselves.The 20-year-old attacker who killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 had compiled an enormous mass-murder spreadsheet and materials on the Columbine attackers on his computer, including what appeared to be a complete copy of the official Columbine investigation.In his manifesto, the 23-year-old student who shot and killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007 had called the Columbine gunmen by their first names and described them as \u201cwe martyrs.\u201dThe May 18 mass shooting at Santa Fe provides the latest evidence of a phenomenon that researchers have in recent years come to recognize, but are still unable to explain: The mass shootings that are now occurring with disturbing regularity at the nation\u2019s schools are shocking, disturbing, tragic \u2014 and seemingly contagious.Interviews with law enforcement officials, educators, researchers, students and a gunman\u2019s mother, as well as a review of court documents, academic studies and the writings of killers and would-be killers, show that the school-shooting copycat syndrome has grown more pervasive and has steadily escalated in recent years. And much of it can be traced back to the two killers at Columbine, previously ordinary high school students who have achieved dark folk hero status \u2014 their followers often known as \u201cColumbiners\u201d \u2014 in the corners of the internet where their carefully planned massacre is remembered, studied and in some cases even celebrated.Investigators say school shootings have become the American equivalent of suicide bombings \u2014 not just a tactic, but an ideology. Young men, many of them depressed, alienated or mentally disturbed, are drawn to the Columbine subculture because they see it as a way to lash out at the world and to get the attention of a society that they believe bullies, ignores or misunderstands them.On Wednesday, the authorities in Florida released chilling cellphone video taken by the gunman in the Parkland school shooting. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the next school shooter of 2018,\u201d he said. \u201cMy goal is at least 20 people, with an AR-15 and a couple tracer rounds.\u201dHe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big event. When you see me on the news you\u2019ll all know who I am.\u201d He then was shown laughing, and singing the words, \u201cYou\u2019re all going to die.\u201dThe seemingly contagious violence has begun branching off Columbine, researchers say, and is now bringing in more recent attacks, many of them building off the details and media fixation with the last. School gunmen have admitted to investigators that they were now effectively competing with other attackers, in trying to come up with deadlier tactics, and in trying to kill the most people.\u201cThe phenomenon is feeding on itself,\u201d said Peter Langman, a psychologist who is the author of \u201cWhy Kids Kill: Inside the Minds of School Shooters\u201d and who runs the website SchoolShooters.info. \u201cIt\u2019s gaining momentum, and the more there are, the more there will be.\u201dMr. Langman has created a mass-shooter diagram tracking the influence Columbine has had on more than 30 other rampage attacks at schools and elsewhere, from California to Germany. The diagram resembles a corporate flowchart, with lines branching out and intersecting, but all of them flowing out of two names: the Columbine killers.\u201cI do believe there is a contagion,\u201d said Sue Klebold, 69, the mother of one of the two teenage gunmen in the Columbine attack.Ms. Klebold said her son and her son\u2019s friend helped set a template for others, leading young people with depression, thoughts of suicide or other struggles to believe a mass shooting is an escape route. A confluence of forces \u2014 including news coverage of attacks, social media, community disconnection and ready access to lethal weapons, she said \u2014 has reinforced and spread that mistaken notion.\u201cWe don\u2019t do this intentionally, but we glorify shooters by showing the damage they\u2019ve done \u2014 all the crying, all the empty seats \u2014 and for people with rage that has a particular appeal for them,\u201d Ms. Klebold said.On the other hand, researchers said, the fabric of events and motivations that culminate in school shootings inevitably are more individual and complex than simple copycat crimes.\u201cMaybe he got the trench coat idea from Columbine, but not the will to kill,\u201d said James Alan Fox, who is a criminology professor at Northeastern University in Boston and who studies mass shootings. \u201cSeeing someone else do something won\u2019t take a perfectly happy individual and make him decide to pick up a gun and go shoot students.\u201dIn recent years, some school shootings have borne the hallmarks not just of Columbine, but of subsequent attacks.In the wake of a 2015 shooting in which a gunman killed a Virginia news reporter, Alison Parker, and a photojournalist, Adam Ward, on live television, a young man in Oregon took to his blog, and noted how the story of the gunman was being covered by news outlets.\u201cOn an interesting note,\u201d the 26-year-old man wrote, \u201cI have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are.\u201d He added, \u201cSeems the more people you kill, the more you\u2019re in the limelight.\u201dA few months later, that man entered his school in a sleepy Oregon town, Umpqua Community College, armed with six guns, a flak jacket and spare ammunition. He opened fire. Nine people died.He had also uploaded a documentary about the Sandy Hook shooting.But Columbine, it seems, remains the template \u2014 a legacy of which the school outside Denver is ever mindful.One late-August afternoon at Columbine in 2006, more than seven years after the massacre, the principal\u2019s office was suddenly responding to another shooting.But this one wasn\u2019t at Columbine. It was at a high school nearly 1,600 miles away in North Carolina.An 18-year-old man in Hillsborough, N.C., sent an email to the Columbine principal, Frank DeAngelis, claiming responsibility for a school shooting that the principal would soon hear about. \u201cDear Principal,\u201d the young man wrote in a seven-sentence email. \u201cI remember Columbine. It is time the world remembered it.\u201dMr. DeAngelis and school administrators scrambled to notify the authorities. They were too late: The young man had killed his father and driven to Orange High School in Hillsborough, opening fire in a parking lot and wounding two students. He was wearing a black trench coat, like the Columbine attackers, and was armed with a sawed-off shotgun he named Arlene \u2014 as one of the Columbine killers had. He called his attack \u201cOperation Columbine.\u201dThere was another case, five years later. Mr. DeAngelis said a 16-year-old high school student from Utah came to the school to interview him. The boy claimed to be a budding journalist and asked seemingly innocuous questions about the recovery process. Weeks later, Mr. DeAngelis received a call from police: The student had been arrested in Utah for plotting with another student to set off a bomb during a school assembly, admitting to the authorities that he was \u201cfascinated\u201d by Columbine.\u201cIt worries me that even now, kids who were not even born during Columbine High School are still making reference to Columbine,\u201d said Mr. DeAngelis, 63, who retired in 2014. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to feel helpless and hopeless, but I think what those two did, what they wrote in their journal is: \u2018We\u2019ll never be forgotten\u2019 and \u2018We\u2019ll be remembered forever.\u2019 And I believe they\u2019re fulfilling that.\u201dWhile so-called Columbiners have been a regular phenomenon on websites and internet chat rooms, there appears little doubt that the front-page headlines and mug shots splashed across television can become a powerful motivating factor.The role of the media in turning school gunmen into household names and perpetuating \u201cthe infamous legacy they desire\u201d can be shown to have inspired additional attacks, researchers at Western New Mexico University reported recently. There have been growing calls for withholding the names and biographies of school gunmen from newspaper and television coverage. The New York Times regularly identifies and profiles the perpetrators, though in order to focus attention on the issue of school shootings and not on the gunmen themselves, this article does not name any of them.A number of the suspects who have carried out or planned school shootings not only wear the same clothing, read the same books and adopt the same tactics; some have even contacted the victims of previous shootings before they attempt their own attacks.An 18-year-old man who was arrested in Vermont in February and accused of planning a mass shooting at his old high school had contacted a student he knew at the Parkland, Fla., high school where a mass shooting occurred in February \u201cbecause he wanted to know how it made her feel and what it felt like being inside the school,\u201d a police report said.Ms. Klebold, the mother of one of the Columbine attackers, said she was shocked by the number of letters she receives from people who relate to her son: \u201cThe girls who say, \u2018I wish I could have his baby\u2019\u201d; others who say that her son, to them, is \u201cheroic.\u201d Even seeing images of the Santa Fe gunman\u2019s Communist hammer-and-sickle medallion \u2014 just like the one that her son wore, a gift from a friend\u2019s parent who went to Russia \u2014 was painful to her.\u201cIt\u2019s to me like this kid was being\u201d her son, \u201call over again,\u201d she said.Manny Fernandez and Jess Bidgood reported from Santa Fe, Tex., and Julie Turkewitz from Denver.

{"Headline": "Who Is Dimitrios Pagourtzis, the Texas Shooting Suspect?", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDimitrios Pagourtzis was seen entering the low-slung building at Santa Fe High School on Friday morning, armed and wearing a trench coat.Like others who\u2019ve terrorized American students, the 17-year-old planned to kill his peers and then himself, the authorities said.He opened fire, and the school erupted in chaos. An alarm clanged, and in the art room, bloodied students cried for help.But once the bullets pierced his classmates\u2019 bodies, the suspect surrendered, said Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, and admitted \u201cthat he didn\u2019t have the courage to commit the suicide.\u201dOn Friday, as a small Texas town grappled with the deaths of 10 of their own, a sketchy profile of another violent young man came to the fore, the disturbing details of his life blurring with those of the school gunmen of the past.\u201cBorn to Kill\u201d appeared on a T-shirt he posted on his Facebook page, along with images of the trench coat and an explanation of its decorations.\u201cHammer and Sickle=Rebellion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRising Sun=Kamikaze Tactics. Iron Cross=Bravery. Baphomet=Evil.\u201dAbove all this, Mr. Pagourtzis posted artwork seemingly inspired by the electronic musician James Kent, professionally known as Perturbator. Mr. Kent\u2019s music \u2014 largely instrumental \u2014 has been adopted by affiliates of neo-Nazi groups and the alt-right.On social media Mr. Kent\u2019s fans condemned reports linking his work to the alt-right, and Mr. Kent himself responded on Saturday.Mr. Abbott said that the gunman had used a shotgun and .38 revolver, both of which appeared to be obtained from the suspect\u2019s father, who legally owned them. The suspect also kept a journal, which detailed his plans for the attack and his suicide.Dr. Chuck Burnell, the chief medical officer for Acadian Ambulance Service, said it appeared that the gunman had loaded the shotgun with buckshot and that \u201cthe high degree of lethality was because of close-range buckshot.\u201dBy Friday afternoon, the suspect was in custody at the Galveston County jail. Federal authorities are seeking search warrants to find explosive devices at two residences.Police said the gunman brought several of these devices into the school. It was unclear whether any went off.During a court appearance that lasted about two minutes on Friday evening, a Texas judge denied bond for Mr. Pagourtzis, who has been charged with capital murder and aggravated assault against a public servant. Mr. Pagourtzis, who was dressed in a jail jumpsuit and said little as he stood before a judge, requested a court-appointed lawyer. He was not asked to enter a plea.Investigators, meanwhile, are scouring his journal, a computer and a cellphone that Mr. Abbott said showed the suspect had been planning the attack, and his own death.On Friday, authorities intended to question two other people: One was at the scene and had \u201csuspicious reactions,\u201d according to the governor, and another had drawn the scrutiny of investigators.Mr. Pagourtzis had no known confrontations with law enforcement, Mr. Abbott added. \u201cAs far as having a criminal history, he has none. His slate is pretty clean.\u201dIn many ways, Mr. Pagourtzis was a part of the Santa Fe community.Valerie Martin, a teacher at the junior high school in Santa Fe, said she had Mr. Pagourtzis in her pre-A.P. language arts class last year.She saw no signs that Mr. Pagourtzis might do such a thing, she recalled in an interview. She viewed him as bright, she said, adding he had taken part in the school\u2019s competition for a national history contest. \u201cHe was quiet, but he wasn\u2019t quiet in a creepy way.\u201dTyler Ray, 18, a football player who said he knew the Pagourtzis family well, said that Mr. Pagourtzis showed up for summer workouts and tried hard even though he wasn\u2019t very athletic. His family, Mr. Ray said, came to the games to support him, though they struggled to pay for equipment.The day before the shooting, Mr. Ray and Mr. Pagourtzis went on a class field trip to Schlitterbahn, a water park in Galveston.On Friday, though, a different young man showed up at school in Santa Fe.In the art room, Zachary Muehe, a sophomore, was engrossed in his phone. He heard several booms and whipped around to see Mr. Pagourtzis, who was wearing the coat and the \u201cBorn to Kill\u201d T-shirt.Mr. Muehe said Mr. Pagourtzis had begun shooting as soon as he entered the classroom.\u201cIt was crazy watching him shoot and then pump,\u201d Mr. Muehe said. \u201cI remember seeing the shrapnel from the tables, whatever he hit, I remember seeing the shrapnel go past my face.\u201dMr. Muehe immediately tried to escape. He and his friends went to a back door in the classroom, which leads to a small courtyard, but the door was locked.He went next to a ceramics closet that connects his classroom to another art classroom, and took one more look at the classroom behind him, and saw students lying on the ground.\u201cThere was a girl on the ground,\u201d Mr. Muehe said, \u201cand he shot her in the head one or two times.\u201d\u201cI just started running, as fast as I could to the other side of the campus,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I got to the main part I started banging on the door and I saw one of my teachers. I say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got a gun, everyone needs to get out.\u2019\u201dMr. Muehe\u2019s mother, Christina Muehe, said that by Friday evening the entire community had been broken.Roxanna Asgarian, Alan Blinder, Christina Caron, John Schwartz and Reggie Ugwu contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Gold Medals and Gray Hair", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this misty Thursday.Don\u2019t let the name fool you \u2014 the competition at the Senior Games is fierce.\u201cI came to win\u201d was a common refrain we heard from the athletes, who were all over 50.The citywide competition wrapped up yesterday with a closing ceremony in Prospect Park, where winners were crowned in swimming, track and field, table tennis, bowling, pickleball and more.Has the athlete in you changed over time?\u201cLet me say that I am a gentler and more focused athlete,\u201d said Jill Kelly, 70, of Chelsea, who placed first in women\u2019s doubles in pickleball. \u201cBefore, I just wanted to win at all costs, like a machine. We went to the games to have fun and meet other people, but we also went to bring it all home and compete. And we did.\u201dWhat was your biggest challenge?\u201cI\u2019m disabled,\u201d said Ricardo Corral, 58, of Jackson Heights, Queens, who placed in multiple swimming competitions. He lost part of his left leg in a motorcycle accident at the age of 22 in his native Ecuador and began training in swimming for the first time again this year. \u201cI said: \u2018I don\u2019t have both my legs, but who cares? I\u2019ll use my upper body more than my lower body.\u2019 Maybe I can\u2019t compete in running, but I\u2019m a fish in the water.\u201dWhat\u2019s your best advice for competing against other seniors?Beware of trick shots, said Muriel Moses, 69, of East Flatbush, Brooklyn, who placed second in women\u2019s table tennis.\u201cI find that seniors make a lot of drop shots,\u201d she said. \u201cThey let the ball drop by the net, so it\u2019s harder for the opponent to get to it. I\u2019m not as fast as I used to be, I don\u2019t have the speed, so you really have to make an effort to get it.\u201dHow has your sport changed over time?\u201cWhat is really nice is that there are a lot of women, which is great to see,\u201d said Leroy Cummins, 66, of East Flatbush, who competed in track and field and recalled a time when women weren\u2019t allowed to run in the marathon. New Yorkers, he added, are now more receptive to his sport as well.\u201cIn the late \u201960s and going into the \u201970s, people in Bed-Stuy and the East Flatbush area used to want to chase you off the streets if they saw you running,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d roll down their car windows and say, \u2018You don\u2019t have no license to run in the street!\u2019\u201d\u201cNow when they\u2019re blowing their horns, they\u2019re cheering you on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has come a long way.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:The flowers are having a field day.Keep your umbrella close by. It\u2019s wet until at least Sunday.Today, you can catch performances of \u201cAnnabel Lee,\u201d \u201cThe Oblong Box\u201d and \u201cThe Masque of Red Death,\u201d among others, beginning at 8 p.m. [Tickets $24]Legend has it that he wrote \u201cThe Raven\u201d at a farmhouse near 84th Street and Broadway, where today a pair of dueling plaques lay claim to the author. The mantel on which he wrote his most famous poem is held at Columbia University.And we even have the bell that inspired his poem \u201cThe Bells,\u201d supposedly. It\u2019s kept in a safe at Fordham University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Southwest Pilot Who Landed Fatal Flight Wasn\u2019t Supposed to Be On It", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA deafening bang. A puff of gray smoke. Oxygen masks dropped. At first, the plane vibrated violently side to side. Then it lunged to the left. In the cockpit, alarms and warnings rang out \u2014 so loud that the pilots had to scream to talk to each other.\u201cI\u2019m not trading with him anymore,\u201d Captain Shults joked.In the explosion, a piece of the engine broke off, slammed into a window in Row 14 and shattered it. The passenger sitting in the window seat, Jennifer Riordan, was partially sucked out of the plane before she was pulled back inside the cabin. She later died.The pilots have been praised, including in a White House visit with President Trump, for bringing the plane under control and averting a far worse outcome.\u201cAs long as you have altitude and ideas, you\u2019re O.K.,\u201d Captain Shults, who was among the first women to fly fighter jets for the Navy three decades ago, said in the interview. \u201cAnd we had both.\u201dAs passengers strapped on their oxygen masks and flight attendants tried to save Ms. Riordan, the pilots were still trying to make sense of what had just happened, they said in the interview. The plane was shaking, but the cockpit instruments did not offer any clues. Maybe there was an engine seizure, the pilots thought.Then the cabin and cockpit rapidly decompressed, causing the masks to drop.\u201cThe seizure of the aircraft would not cause a rapid decompression, so we knew that something extraordinary had happened pretty quickly,\u201d Captain Shults said.The plane, a twin-engine Boeing 737-700, banked hard to the left in the skies over Pennsylvania. Officer Ellisor, 44, a former Air Force pilot, was behind the controls, as Captain Shults, 56, kept communication open with air traffic controllers. Captain Shults later took over the controls.The pilots forced the plane to drop thousands of feet to an altitude where it was safe to breathe without a mask.\u201cDarren handled it beautifully,\u201d Captain Shults said, adding that he did not \u201cforce the aircraft to stay on altitude and return to that heading, which is kind of a normal pilot reaction, or can be, to get back on course.\u201dMany passengers feared that the plane would crash. Some sent goodbye texts to their families. Others started streaming live on Facebook.In the cockpit, the pilots were yelling and using hand signals to communicate with each other and were preparing for a lengthy approach into Philadelphia International Airport.But there was a change of plans. Flight attendants were finally able to talk to the pilots and told them about Ms. Riordan and a few passengers who had minor injuries. \u201cThat\u2019s when we decided it was time to go land,\u201d Officer Ellisor said.The Southwest plane landed in Philadelphia at 11:23 a.m. on Runway 27L \u2014 about 20 minutes after the engine failure.An earlier version of this article misstated the reason that Tammie Jo Shults and her husband switched schedules. It was so she could go to their son\u2019s track meet, not so her husband could go.Advertisement"}

Watson met in 2008, when Mr. Watson was 15 and beginning as a sophomore at St. Andrew\u2019s School in Middletown, Del. Ms. Valliant, a senior, was there greeting new students and their families, and he made quite an impression on her.\u201cI remember seeing him and I don\u2019t think there was a moment that I was, \u2018This is the man I\u2019m going to marry,\u2019 but I was 17, and it was, \u2018Wow!

I cannot be around this kid because of the way he talks.\u201dNevertheless, they did continue to talk, bumping into each other on campus over the next few weeks. \u201cI was incredibly attracted to him,\u201d Ms. Valliant said. \u201cHe played guitar, was No. 1 on the school\u2019s tennis team, spoke Spanish, and was from New York.\u201dEventually, they shared their first kiss. \u201cIt just sort of happened,\u201d Ms. Valliant said. \u201cI decided, let\u2019s just go for it and get it over with.\u201dBy the end of Mr. Watson\u2019s first term, they were a couple, but Ms. Valliant didn\u2019t really fall in love with him, she said, for several more years. It was on a 10-week cross-country bike trip, in 2012, in which she found herself struggling with the physical challenges as well as the stress and anxiety of riding on roads that had no shoulders to protect the bicycles from speeding cars and trucks, that it came to her that he was the one for her. \u201cI realized, this man can protect me, he can care for he, more than any other man I\u2019ve met in my life,\u201d she said.Mr. Watson\u2019s version of their romance is a little more straightforward, though he doesn\u2019t remember meeting her on his first day at the school.

{"Headline": "An Alabama Chef and Her Beloved Desserts Hit the Big Time", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 Dolester Miles bought a pair of black slacks and a sequined blouse to wear to the James Beard Foundation awards ceremony in Chicago this month. She wanted to look nice, even though she didn\u2019t think she was going to be chosen pastry chef of the year.She was up against some heavy hitters. There was Margarita Manzke, whose desserts at the bistro R\u00e9publique were declared \u201cterrific\u201d by Jonathan Gold in The Los Angeles Times, and Meg Galus of Boka in Chicago, whose recipes made use of toasted milk and the funk of fermented black lime.Why in the world would the 600 or so Beard Foundation voters pick a self-taught, 61-year-old cook from a small steel-making town who has spent the past 30 years making Southern-influenced desserts for the same Alabama restaurant?Instead of planning acceptance speeches, the team from Alabama used the trip as a nice break. The night of the awards, Ms. Miles put on her new outfit, slipped on a favorite pair of earrings (she has a thing for earrings) and took a seat in the Lyric Opera House. When her category came up, she was as calm as a cat. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for them to call out one of the other names,\u201d she recalled during an interview here in Birmingham.Instead, she heard hers. \u201cAt first I couldn\u2019t move. I was just in disbelief,\u201d she said. She made it to the stage somehow, barely holding back tears. She thanked the Beard voters. She thanked Frank Stitt and his wife, Pardis, and her pastry crew back home, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s all I got to say.\u201d She was done in less than 30 seconds.The radical shift was rooted in a cultural moment. The restaurant business is reckoning with issues of gender and race in unprecedented ways. To be sure, there has been plenty of debate over whether this year\u2019s awards were an anomaly driven by social pressure or the start of an enduring shift in what the James Beard officials \u2014 and perhaps diners \u2014 consider the elements of a great restaurant.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best peach cobbler I\u2019ve ever had. All of her cobblers are great, but the peach is the one that makes my soul burst into four-part harmony.\u201dMr. Edge holds Ms. Miles in high regard for her ability to be thoroughly modern with some desserts but also to reach back into African-American baking traditions and bring forth impeccable renditions of classic Southern cakes and pies. \u201cShe has to meet the standards of a diner\u2019s grandmother,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Dol also meets the expectation of the fine-dining customer. That straddle is hard to manage.\u201dMrs. Harris is the kind of woman who might make nine cakes at a time and deliver them to people in nursing homes. It was a good birthday if you got one of her cakes.Her brown sugar poundcake was a favorite when Ms. Miles was growing up. Unlike a cadre of Southern women who find power in refusing to share a recipe, Mrs. Harris was always generous with her knowledge.\u201cI didn\u2019t mind showing nobody how to cook anything,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cIt was a joy.\u201dMs. Miles, the youngest of five children and always a hard worker, was an eager student. \u201cEverything that tastes good, she was interested in it,\u201d Mrs. Harris said. (Ms. Miles recalls it more as an interest in getting to the spatula and the beaters before her cousins.)Family being family, Ms. Miles did not escape some teasing when word of the award made it to Bessemer.\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019d accept it if you said you were the best in Birmingham, but not America,\u2019\u201d her aunt said. A cousin took it one step further: She looked online and saw how much Ms. Miles\u2019s desserts sold for at the restaurants.\u201cShe said she is going over to eat one of them $9 slices of cake because she wanted to know what does a $9 slice of cake taste like,\u201d Mrs. Harris added.Ms. Miles didn\u2019t plan on a cooking career. After high school, she headed to college to study computer science, but came home to have a baby. (Her daughter, LaToya Phillips, now grown and with two children of her own, traveled to Chicago to support her mother at the awards ceremony.)One day in 1982, Ms. Miles heard about a new restaurant that a young chef named Frank Stitt was opening in Birmingham\u2019s progressive Southside neighborhood.\u201cFrank was a son of the gentry and a son of the country and a socially aware Southerner who left the South and returned with a new perspective,\u201d Mr. Edge said. \u201cWhen he began that restaurant, he invested in African-Americans in and around Birmingham, and those investments from long ago are now yielding some national recognition.\u201dAll Ms. Miles knew was that something big was happening and she wanted to be a part of it from the moment she met him. \u201cIf you talk to him you\u2019re like, oh my God, you\u2019ve got to go work for him, you\u2019ve got to get in on that,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s so excited even by a little piece of garlic or a piece of ginger.\u201dShe started as the pantry chef. She and Mr. Stitt still laugh about the early days, when he would send her to the store for leeks and she had no idea what she was looking for, or how he urged her to taste arugula and watercress.\u201cI am like, \u2018This looks like some weeds or something,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019d turn his back and I\u2019d throw it in the trash and he\u2019d ask how was that and I\u2019d say, \u2018Oh that was great.\u2019 But now I love that kind of stuff.\u201dAs a result, she can toggle from chocolate pots de cr\u00e8me to polenta poundcake tiramis\u00f9 to blueberry cobbler with ease.Some of it is just managing Mr. Stitt, who on a recent Monday came into the pastry kitchen with a page torn out of a hospitality magazine showing off a dessert inspired by Italy\u2019s Friuli region. He liked the way it had been plated, in a dramatic horizontal stripe peppered with pistachios and kumquat slices.\u201cMaybe we could do that with strawberries,\u201d she said.\u201cOr peaches,\u201d he countered.\u201cI might have to try something like that,\u201d she said.\u201cShe\u2019s just blossoming,\u201d said Ms. Stitt, who manages the front of the house in the Stitt empire.Dessert orders are way up at the restaurants, as are reservations, she said. A couple drove all the way from Minneapolis the other night just to eat at the Highlands because of the Beard win.But the surge of interest in a steady, understated Southern restaurant with a French sensibility may be broader than one award. At a time when stark political divisions are driving headlines, a place like the Highlands and the solid appeal of Ms. Miles\u2019 desserts have a new luster.Food, she said, can be a subversive vehicle for social change.Mr. Stitt suspects the newfound appreciation for his restaurants is part of what he calls \u201ca renewed hunger for character.\u201d\u201cI would like to think that what we\u2019re about is integrity and respect and quality and pursuit of beauty in our work and for our guests,\u201d he said.But a person can overthink these things. Sometimes, dessert is just dessert and a job well done is its own reward, Ms. Miles said.\u201cJust do hard work and keep reading books and keep learning,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do every day because that\u2019s my philosophy.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Things I Love About Australia (and One I Loathe)", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 58______This week, like the country itself, I\u2019m looking inward.That\u2019s not always a welcome trait \u2014 navel-gazing tends to be unattractive in both lovers and nations \u2014 but I\u2019ve been thinking lately about what Australia is so eager to protect.Clearly, there\u2019s a lot, but let\u2019s be honest: These things are personal. And they change.And now, the five things I really love about Australia at this very moment:1. The Coastline, I Mean, I Can\u2019t EvenA clich\u00e9? Yeah maybe, but seriously, how fantastically gorgeous is the Australian coast?From Sydney\u2019s rocky cliffs to the Northern Territory\u2019s tropical lagoons to the Great Ocean Road to Noosa to Denmark\u2019s ruggedness (easily the best part of \u201cBreath,\u201d the movie), I am perpetually amazed at the rich bounty of the world\u2019s most beautiful island continent.I am eternally grateful whenever I get near it, even when I\u2019m getting smashed by waves that remind me I don\u2019t know how to surf.2. Johnny SpitWhenever I watch Australian movies \u2014 this week \u201cDead Calm\u201d (great) and \u201cBreath\u201d (disappointing) \u2014 I find myself comparing the writing and characters to Johnny Spit, the scene-stealer of \u201cGettin\u2019 Square\u201d played by David Wenham.John Francis Spiteri is the ultimate larrikin, a savant, a satirist and a fool all at the same time. I long for the day when I can cock my head just the way he does and tell someone, as he does in court, \u201cHey, you\u2019re trying to verbal me, trying to put words in my mouth!\u201d3. AtticaI\u2019ve had many great meals in my life, in many cities and countries. Attica tops the list. Hands down.4. Understated #AuspolWhen I went to interview John Howard, the former prime minister, I ran into him in the elevator, alone, without an entourage.Never could I have imagined such a thing happening in the United States or in many other countries where I\u2019ve worked. The accessibility and willingness to eschew the trappings of power were a welcome sight.On the other hand, no one in Canberra seems to get along and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has repeatedly refused our interview requests.5. Work-Life Balance A lot of those link to sport, sure, but there was no shortage of parents at my daughter\u2019s dance recital either, and what that tells me is that this is a society that treats work as just one part of a fulfilled life.There is an expectation of balance or at least a respect for it as a lived reality (Americans write about it more than they live it) that I find enormously refreshing after moving here from New York.Many Australians probably don\u2019t even notice it, but for me, it\u2019s nothing short of thrilling and wondrous.... And one thing I loathe:No, it\u2019s not Vegemite, but close. It\u2019s food delivery.Here in Sydney, there are at least three online providers, Deliveroo, Foodora and Uber Eats. I\u2019ve tried them all. They\u2019re terrible.It\u2019s not necessarily their fault. Restaurants appear and disappear on their apps, delivering some days, not others. Menus are just as fungible and wait times often extend mysteriously like gambling debts.Yes, this is a first-world problem. No, it doesn\u2019t change how much I love it here. But still.Now for news of the week and some don\u2019t-miss features \u2014 plus ya know, another recommendation.______The health issue of The New York Times Magazine is out, and Michael Pollan, who usually writes about food, has a doozy of a story about guided psychedelic therapy.\u201cMy first psilocybin journey began around an altar in the middle of a second-story loft in a suburb of a small city on the Eastern Seaboard,\u201d he writes.And from there, the trip is on, with a mix of serious science and skepticism.______Do you have one of those cars that lets you just push a button to start it? Have you ever accidentally left it running?__________________NewsCulture / Fun______When we were in Tasmania, we visited a number of vineyards (our children were not pleased) and last week, the boxes of wine we ordered finally arrived.Our two favorites are from the Craigie Knowe Vineyard: the 2017 chardonnay (light, not too oaky) and their 2017 riesling (crisp but flavorful).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silvaner, a Lovely yet Unloved Spring Wine, Needs Friends", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourWith the overwhelming number of wines available today from all over the world, in a vast diversity of styles, many made from grapes virtually unknown a generation ago, consumers have had to resort to shortcuts and workarounds to slice through the confusion.Some buy only wines made from familiar grapes that have been critically praised over time. Others are more adventurous, as long as the wines come from well-known producers or established importers. A few try to track what\u2019s new and exciting in wine bars, shops and restaurants.Occasionally, wines that have much to offer are cast aside simply because they meet none of those artificial criteria. Their presence in the marketplace ebbs. They come to be seen as stuffy, old-fashioned or obsolete.With this in mind, I would like to make the case for silvaner, a grape and a wine that has few champions and could use one badly.Silvaner is a white grape of German origin, though I\u2019ve seen many more bottles in the United States from Alsace, where it is spelled sylvaner, than from Germany. It is also found throughout Central Europe under myriad spellings and names, and in Italy, primarily Alto Adige, the Tyrolean region in the northeast, where it is again simply called silvaner.What does it have to offer? To my mind, silvaner is a perfect wine for spring: light, fragrant, gentle and almost shy, like the first buds emerging from a bare tree branch. It is classically dry, light and graceful, moderate in alcohol and touched with herbal and floral notes. This is a perfect lunchtime wine \u2014 easy to have a glass or two and still be productive the rest of the day.Silvaner was far more popular back when it was not considered shocking to enjoy some wine in the middle of the day. A hundred years ago, it was the most commonly planted grape in Germany, but it is now fifth, well behind the highly deserving riesling, as well as M\u00fcller-Thurgau, a nondescript white, and two reds, sp\u00e4tburgunder, or pinot noir, and dornfelder, which has the potential to be interesting.What happened? He suggested the problem was that an overwhelming amount of bad silvaner had been sent to the United States, which had essentially turned off the American market. It\u2019s too bad, because Trimbach\u2019s 2016 Sylvaner, tasted in France, was lovely, fresh and springlike, yet with a savory, almost saline note that punctuated it perfectly.\u201cIt\u2019s not the caviar, it\u2019s the butcher and the baker,\u201d he said of silvaner last year, meaning the wine is foundational to the culture of Alsace.\u201cAlsatian food is based on white wine, and the wine used for sauces and macerations was sylvaner,\u201d he said by email recently. \u201cThat\u2019s why I say sylvaner flows in my veins. Since I was in my mother\u2019s womb I was drinking sylvaner.\u201dMr. Ostertag shares the belief that the biggest problem for the grape has been the abundance of bad wine. In Alsace, he said, it was seen as an everyday wine and, as a result, growers and producers did not take it seriously. In the vineyard, they valued quantity over quality. Winemaking was slapdash and prices were low.\u201cOvercropping, quick and fast winemaking and no marketing was the vision for sylvaner,\u201d he said. \u201cNot really the best way to produce a serious wine.\u201dZusslin\u2019s Bollenberg Sylvaner is lively, energetic, gentle and savory, but it, too, is not currently sold in the United States. \u201cI think they trust in it,\u201d Ms. Zusslin said of her American importers, \u201cbut the market is not that simple.\u201d\u201cI do think there is a market for silvaner,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy not, if the wine is good? Obviously, it\u2019s a niche.\u201dLike Mr. Ostertag, Ms. Zusslin believes the future of silvaner requires diligent, conscientious farming and a belief in the importance of the grape, which she called \u201can underdog that only needs good care to fully reveal itself.\u201d\u201cBecause it is deeply rooted in our tradition, we have to keep it alive and to give it as much care as we can,\u201d she said by email. \u201cEven more when you think about all it has to offer when you put enough effort in its growing and vinification.\u201dMr. Ostertag says he sees a renaissance coming for silvaner, citing the Zotzenberg victory, though that goes back to 2001. He also senses a revived affection for the wine in Alsace because it is so easygoing and companionable, and goes well with food, particularly fish, cheese and vegetable dishes. He sees evidence in his own home.\u201cThe proof is my wife uses it every day for cooking,\u201d he said. \u201cNot any more for the sauce, but for the cook.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name and surname of the New York importer of Domaine Valentin Zusslin wine. He is Geoffroy Ducroux, not Geoffrey Ducroix.Advertisement"}

Some of the crowd peered into arriving vehicles, but there was no indication that Mr. Najib and his wife were there.Also on Saturday, the daughter of the imprisoned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said that she expected him to be released on Tuesday.Mr. Anwar is a former deputy prime minister who was removed from office after falling out with Mr. Mahathir in 1998, and was then sentenced to prison for corruption and sodomy. He is now serving a five-year sentence on a second sodomy conviction. The cases against him have been called politically motivated.At a separate news conference on Saturday afternoon, Mr. Najib announced that he was resigning as president of the United Malays National Organization, the party that had governed the country since independence from Britain in 1957. He also said he was stepping down as chairman of Barisan Nasional, which had been the governing coalition until this past week\u2019s election.Mr. Mahathir, who previously served as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, said that any wrongdoing connected with 1MDB would be investigated.\u201cThere is sufficient evidence that an investigation into certain things that have been done by the former prime minister has to be done, and if necessary the rule of law will apply,\u201d he said.Mr. Mahathir added that the investigation would also look at whether officials had failed to fully pursue allegations in the 1MDB case. The government has to place \u201ccertain restrictions\u201d on \u201cpeople who may be involved in wrongdoing or making wrong decisions,\u201d he said.He added that the attorney general, Mohamed Apandi Ali, had been removed from office. \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t have an attorney general,\u201d he said.Mr. Mahathir also named a so-called council of elders that included the tycoon Robert Kuok to advise the new government.Mr. Lim was asked by a Chinese journalist how he felt about being the first ethnic Chinese to hold his position in 44 years.\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself as a Chinese,\u201d he responded. \u201cI am a Malaysian.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of Malaysia\u2019s new prime minister.

{"Headline": "Justice Department and F.B.I. Are Investigating Cambridge Analytica", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department and the F.B.I. are investigating Cambridge Analytica, the now-defunct political data firm, and have sought to question former employees and banks that handled its business, according to an American official and other people familiar with the inquiry.Prosecutors have questioned potential witnesses in recent weeks, telling them that there is an open investigation into Cambridge Analytica \u2014 which worked on President Trump\u2019s election and other Republican campaigns in 2016 \u2014 and \u201cassociated U.S. persons.\u201d But the prosecutors provided few other details, and the inquiry appears to be in its early stages, with investigators seeking an overview of the company and its business practices.Cambridge Analytica, the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment.The company, whose principal owner is the wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer, offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. Its so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned Cambridge\u2019s work for the Trump campaign in 2016.The federal investigation in the United States appears to focus on the company\u2019s financial dealings \u2014 investigators have reached out to the company\u2019s banks, for instance \u2014 and how it acquired and used personal data pulled from Facebook and other sources, according to the American official, who was briefed on the inquiry, and other people familiar with it.In addition, the investigators have contacted Facebook, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation. The official would not provide any other details, and Facebook declined to comment.In a sign of the inquiry\u2019s scope, one of the prosecutors involved is the assistant chief of the Justice Department\u2019s securities and financial fraud division, Brian Kidd. The effort is being assisted by at least one agent who investigates cybercrime for the F.B.I., those people said.Mr. Kidd traveled to London this month with another Justice Department prosecutor and an F.B.I. agent to interview Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee who has emerged as one of the firm\u2019s fiercest critics.\u201cI can confirm that I\u2019ve been contacted by the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice, and answered preliminary questions,\u201d Mr. Wylie said in a brief interview. \u201cWe plan to meet again to provide substantive answers to the investigators.\u201dIt was not clear whether the investigation is tied to the inquiry being led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, who is examining whether Mr. Trump or any of his associates aided Russia\u2019s effort to interfere in the presidential election. Prosecutors from Mr. Mueller\u2019s team questioned at least two Cambridge executives last December in Washington, according to one company official.The employee, who asked to remain anonymous to describe confidential internal matters, added that the inquiry appeared to be perfunctory. There have been no other concrete signs from Mr. Mueller\u2019s team that Cambridge is a focus of their efforts.The Justice Department\u2019s investigation is running parallel to a separate investigation by the National Crime Agency of Britain. There, investigators are examining a range of allegations, including whether Cambridge Analytica employees sought to bribe foreign officials, destroyed evidence, hacked computers and violated Britain\u2019s Data Protection Act.\u201cThere is an international investigation being coordinated by the National Crime Agency in Britain, and I intend to be as helpful and cooperative as I can,\u201d he said.Cambridge Analytica grew out of the SCL Group, a well-established British company that specialized in psychological research for defense and intelligence agencies but also worked on election campaigns, chiefly in developing countries.Over the past year, Cambridge\u2019s efforts to break into commercial data and marketing work had suffered from the company\u2019s association with Mr. Trump, according to former employees. And in the months before shutting down, Mr. Nix, the Mercer family and SCL\u2019s owners had considered new ventures together.One new firm, a British holding company called Emerdata, was formed in part to bring in new investors, according to a former employee. Emerdata\u2019s directors, according to public records, came to include Johnson Ko Chun Shun, a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince, founder of the private security firm formerly known as Blackwater.Mr. Ko and Mr. Prince have links to the Chinese government: Citic, a state-owned Chinese financial conglomerate that for decades has employed the sons and daughters of the Communist Party\u2019s elite families, is a major investor in Frontier Services Group, Mr. Ko and Mr. Prince\u2019s Africa-focused logistics company.Matthew Rosenberg reported from Washington, and Nicholas Confessore reported from New York.

{"Headline": "Recovering Hidden History Along the Armenian-Turkish Border", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLensTwo female photographers \u2014 one Armenian, one Turkish \u2014 worked together to document life on both sides of the border, focusing on Armenians living in hiding.The women were searching for \u201chidden Armenians,\u201d whose Christian ancestors survived what historians consider to be a genocide by the Ottoman Empire, starting in 1915, in which nearly 1.5 million Armenians died. The Turkish government rejects the term genocide.These hidden Armenians whom the photographers sought are descendants of survivors, who were mostly women and children taken in by local Kurdish, Turkish and Arab families, and converted to Islam. In some of the more remote villages in Turkey that Ms. Hayrapetyan and Ms. Akcan visited, the ethnic and religious background of these Armenians were concealed out of fear of reprisal from their neighbors. Parents rarely informed children of their Armenian heritage, with many even avoiding the spoken language so children would not pick it up and discover their ancestry.In 2009, they decided to work together to document Armenian and Turkish life on both sides of the border, and over the next eight years photographed in the villages and towns along it. At times, Ms. Hayrapetyan carried the youngest of her three children with her. Though the presence of an Armenian woman on the Turkish side of the border, or a Turkish woman on the Armenian side created difficulties for the photographers, Ms. Akcan said, it was important that they work together.\u201cWe are doing this project because we want to change the single most accepted thing in Armenia and Turkey \u2014 that the Armenian and Turkish people are enemies,\u201d she said. \u201cSo by working together, people start to see that we can be friends \u2014 that we can be sisters.\u201dMs. Hayrapetyan, a co-founder of 4Plus, a collective of Armenian women photographers, said that they \u201cnever hid that Serra is Turkish or that I\u2019m Armenian\u201d while working.\u201cIt made things more difficult, but much more honest, or deep,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause families knew what the story we were working on was about.\u201d When they started the project about life on both sides of the border they did not know much about the Armenians living in hiding in the Kurdish and Arab villages on the Turkish side, but as they worked they began to hear more about them. So in 2015, Ms. Akcan and Ms. Hayrapetyan turned to finding, interviewing and photographing them. Their experiences varied, often village by village. In Kurdish areas it was often easier for the Armenians to talk, Ms. Hayrapetyan said, because the Kurdish people \u201care going through their own difficult times with the government,\u201d and \u201cfacing the past, saying that they had a role in the genocide too, and apologizing.\u201dMany of the hidden Armenians said they did not know of their background until recently. One man described to them secretly following his grandmother after she said she was going to pick herbs in nearby hills. He discovered her praying in the ruins of an Armenian Christian church in a language he did not understand. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Stockton Tries Free Cash to Fight Income Inequality", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.In the national consciousness, Stockton has had a run of bad associations. It suffered as an epicenter of the foreclosure crisis, and was a prime exhibit of how a city can plunge into bankruptcy.Finland has tested the idea. Trials have been underway in Oakland and in Canada. But Stockton is set to become the first American city to embrace the idea from City Hall itself.That a city in California has made itself a venue for the idea seems no accident. The state has long tried fresh approaches to governance. Ahead of the state\u2019s political primaries on Tuesday, much of the conversation has centered on concerns about economic inequality.The project in Stockton is the product of a partnership between the city\u2019s history-making, social-media savvy mayor, Michael Tubbs, and a philanthropic foundation headed by the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes.Silicon Valley has taken a shine to basic income as a way to soften the effects of its creations \u2014 a potential army of robots poised to capture jobs from humans. But Stockton wants to demonstrate a different aspect of basic income\u2019s appeal: its potential to alleviate the troubles of the working poor.The idea is that single mothers might use cash to go back to school, while poor families add fruit and vegetables to their diets.Basic income confronts potent skepticism. Some argue it will undermine the work ethic. Others contend that it will compete with \u2014 and siphon funding from \u2014 existing government relief programs for the poor and jobless. A national program could cost trillions of dollars a year.But the Stockton trial is engineered as an test of how an unconditional cash grant program can operate.Which means that a Central Valley City that has long represented scarcity will now be used to convey how life can change when struggling people get a little more.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Google\u2019s work for the Defense Department has touched off an existential crisis in Mountain View.It recently won a share of the contract for the Maven program, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used for drone strikes.By reviewing emails and documents and interviewing Google insiders, Times reporters got a detailed picture of how the news fractured its work force, fueling heated staff meetings and prompting employees with moral objections to resign.Executives now face this dilemma: Proceeding with defense contracts could drive away brainy experts in artificial intelligence; rejecting such work would deprive the company of a potentially huge business.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "A Day to Celebrate Haiti\u2019s Flag, and Its Foods", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter six hours of cooking, my aunt Margaret Moise finally sat down at a table covered with a medley of dishes from her native Haiti. She had spent the day in my parents\u2019 kitchen on Staten Island teaching her daughter and nieces, including me, to cook the food she grew up eating on holidays like Haitian Flag Day, celebrated on May 18.A day once marked by compulsory demonstrations of national pride under the dictator Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, it is now observed as the highlight of an entire month of heritage celebrations for the Haitian diaspora.Silent clips of Kanaval revelers adjusting their headdresses played on the television in the corner while my aunt recounted memories from her childhood in Port-au-Prince. \u201cWhen there were special parades the government was doing, it was like you were forced\u201d to go, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018like\u2019 we were forced,\u201d my father, Gabriel, interjected from across the crowded table. \u201cWe were forced!\u201dAnd no Haitian celebration would be complete without a homemade feast, much like the one my aunts preside over every year \u2014 with my mother, MarieYolens Fequiere, who defers to my aunts\u2019 cooking skills, serving as sous-chef. The food of Haiti is a rich, fragrant patchwork of French, African, Caribbean and Spanish influences.\u201cI learned to cook the real Haitian way through the community I was involved with at the church in Brooklyn,\u201d said Marie Carmel Vallon, Margaret\u2019s older sister. The two women immigrated to the United States as teenagers, before they had the chance to acquire cooking skills.In 1971, the family joined a burgeoning Brooklyn community of Haitian-Americans hailing from different regions of the island nation. \u201cI remember burning beans,\u201d Marie Carmel recalled, laughing. \u201cI almost set the apartment on fire.\u201dAlarmed by Haiti\u2019s steadily intensifying political upheaval in the 1960s, my grandmother, Anita Fabre, had gone ahead of her husband and six children to get situated in the United States.By the time the rest of the family arrived in Prospect Heights, Marie Carmel said, \u201cShe was already very involved in the church and the Haitian community, which was beginning to grow.\u201d Anita arranged for my mother, who had led a Girl Scout troop in Port-au-Prince, to resume her role in Brooklyn.\u201cWe used to have a bunch of girls that would hang out in our apartment after the meetings,\u201d Marie Carmel recalled. Women cooking together in the kitchen was a big part of their upbringing, she said.\u201cNot long ago, we were talking about how my mother wasted a lot of money \u2014 because she\u2019d go and shop for the week, but by the time Saturday afternoon came by, the Girl Scouts would use almost everything she had by experimenting with food,\u201d she said.While the country\u2019s wide variety of dishes is certainly worth exploring, there are a few that constitute a worthy crash course for the uninitiated.Served at just about every Haitian gathering, griot consists of pork shoulder spiced with incendiary, fruity Scotch bonnet chiles; the pork is cubed, marinated and cooked to maximum tenderness before frying (or baking, as my Aunt Margaret chose to do), yielding a crispy crust on all sides.Fortunately, she also knew how to make black rice, also known as diri djon-djon, a dish I\u2019d never seen made from scratch. The mushrooms are soaked and strained, and the dark water is later used to both color and flavor the rice, along with Scotch bonnets, garlic, cloves and thyme. Aunt Margaret enlisted her daughter, my cousin Josiane Moise, to help her strain the mushrooms until the water was perfectly clear.Josiane, a doctoral candidate in clinical psychology at George Washington University, considers herself a kitchen novice. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying forever in my head I need to learn from my mom to cook Haitian food, and I never do,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI think today was a good start.\u201d On her left wrist, she sports a tattoo of the Haitian flag\u2019s motto, \u201cL\u2019union fait la force.\u201d (Unity makes strength.)Missing from the festivities were Haitian patties, rarely made by home cooks. A ubiquitous appetizer at gatherings from Christmas to graduations to baptisms, patties are labor-intensive. Enter the Haitian bakery. From six people, I got six different New York-area recommendations, and each one insisted that his or her choice was the only one worth visiting.Opened in 1988 by Clervoix\u2019s parents, George and Ghislaine, Le Bon Pain has developed a clientele beyond the Haitian community; that has led to offerings beyond the traditional fillings of chicken, herring, beef or cod.\u201cPeople are getting addicted to that crust and liking the taste even without meat, so now we\u2019re selling spinach, meatless,\u201d said Mr. Clervoix, who splits his time between the bakery and a career in music production. \u201cPeople really enjoy the puff pastry.\u201dBack at my family\u2019s table, we cousins shared the skills we had developed as children to spot which patties were filled with herring (which we feared) and which were filled with beef (which we loved). Our conversation about Haitian food continued long after the last plates had been cleared.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Arkady Babchenko\u2019s \u2018Murder,\u2019 a Twist Was Revealed. By Him.", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The assassination bore all the hallmarks of yet another contract killing carried out in the murky shadows of the conflict pitting Russia against Ukraine.A photo of the victim, a dissident Russian journalist, showed him lying face down Tuesday in a vermilion pool of his own blood. He was found by his wife, and died on the way to a hospital from multiple gunshot wounds to the back, said the police in Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s capital.Then on Wednesday, the journalist, Arkady Babchenko, to all appearances very much alive, walked into a news conference that Ukrainian security officials had called to discuss his \u201cmurder.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, I would like to apologize that all of you had to live through this, because I know the horrible feeling when you have to bury your colleagues,\u201d Mr. Babchenko told stunned reporters after the gasps died down. \u201cSeparately, I want to apologize to my wife for all the hell she had to go through.\u201dThe staged death, said Vasily S. Gritsak, the head of the Ukraine Security Service, was a sting operation aimed at stopping a real assassination plot against Mr. Babchenko. It was the latest twist \u2014 if an especially bizarre one \u2014 in the tortured relations between Ukraine and Russia, which annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and is fueling a separatist war in eastern Ukraine.\u201cMatters of life and death in Ukraine, as well as trust of the international community to its policy, are nothing more than a bargaining chip used to fuel the anti-Russian hysteria of the Kiev regime,\u201d the Russian statement said.Both the story of Mr. Babchenko\u2019s death and that of his resurrection garnered enormous attention around the world.Various voices, especially from the world of journalism, called the ploy a bad idea in an era when battling fake news has become a daily problem \u2014 and when real news is dismissed as fake news whenever politicians from Washington to the Kremlin find it in their interest to do so.Critics said Ukraine\u2019s actions would only help the Kremlin raise doubts now when it is accused of wrongdoing, as in the shooting down of a civilian airliner over Ukraine in 2014 that killed nearly 300 people, and the poisoning of a retired Russian spy and his daughter in Britain in March.Ukrainian officials defended their actions, saying the ruse had been necessary to try to stop Russian-financed attacks against targets in Ukraine. Mr. Gritsak said there was no doubt that \u201cthe assassination of the Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko was ordered by Russian intelligence.\u201dMr. Babchenko, 41, a former war correspondent, fled Russia last year after his criticism of the Kremlin for the wars in Ukraine and Syria prompted a nationalist campaign of intimidation against him. He roused particular fury with a Facebook post saying he \u201cdidn\u2019t give a damn\u201d about the deaths of 92 people, most of them Russian singers, dancers and musicians, who died in a plane crash en route to Syria to perform.Ukrainian security officials did not fully explain how their ruse was supposed to work. One man, a Ukrainian, is already in custody, they said.They said it began after they got wind of a $40,000 contract to assassinate Mr. Babchenko, which they said had been paid for by the Russian security services.The authorities identified the supposed organizer as Mr. G., a Ukrainian citizen, and showed tape of security agents arresting a portly man in a white shirt on a city street.Mr. G., they said, had hired a veteran of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine to carry out the killing. But the hit man secretly agreed to cooperate with the security services, the officials said, pretending to carry out the killing and collecting a $30,000 fee. (Mr. G. kept $10,000 for himself, they said.)It was not entirely clear from their description, but it seemed that the payment was somehow contingent on producing a picture of the corpse. The police also released a sketch of the supposed killer.Security officials thanked Mr. Babchenko and his family for participating in the operation, without specifying which family members knew about it. Mr. Babchenko later avoided a question about what his wife had known. She was the one who summoned the ambulance, saying she had found him lying on the floor bleeding.Just before his putative assassination, Mr. Babchenko posted a comment on his Facebook page about how he escaped death four years ago when a general barred him from an overloaded helicopter that ended up crashing, killing all 14 people on board.The post prompted an outpouring of comments that this time, he had not been so lucky.Iuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine, and Ivan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev from Moscow.Advertisement"}

They say they have no political aspirations. They\u2019re not techies and they aren\u2019t your run-of-the-mill privacy zealots. Instead, they say they are like many internet consumers \u2014 a little freaked out about tech firms gobbling up people\u2019s personal data.\u201cPeople want some basic rights,\u201d said Alastair Mactaggart, the 51-year-old real estate developer who has put more than $2 million of his own money to get the measure off the ground. \u201cPeople are resentful but accepting because there isn\u2019t any sense of control about their data.\u201dThe California measure has three major components: It gives consumers the right to ask companies to disclose what data they have collected on them; the right to demand that they not sell the data or share with third parties for business purposes; and the right to sue or fine companies that violate the law.Google, Facebook, major telecommunications companies and California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce have already come out against the initiative, saying it is flawed and a threat to the economic model supporting the internet. They\u2019ve created an organization to fight the measure with a decidedly populist name, \u201cThe Committee to Protect California Jobs.\u201dPolitical consultants have told the initiative\u2019s backers that they should prepare for the opposition campaign to spend $100 million. Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the opposition, declined to put a number on the campaign spending, but acknowledged that there is a lot at stake. \u201cIt\u2019s California,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s privacy initiative hasn\u2019t been certified yet by state officials for the November election, but it is expected to appear on the ballot. The measure\u2019s backers said they have submitted over 600,000 signatures, far eclipsing the 366,000 minimum requirement.Mr. Mactaggart said he first became concerned about data privacy when he asked a Google engineer at a cocktail party if he should be worried about all the information companies were collecting about users. The engineer\u2019s response surprised him: Mr. Mactaggart was right to be worried.Mr. Mactaggart said he then reached out to Rick Arney, a finance industry executive who had worked in the California State Senate as a legislative analyst 20 years ago. Their children go to the same school, and Mr. Mactaggart knew that Mr. Arney was a supporter of ballot measures as a way for ordinary citizens to get something done outside of the political system.\u201cOne of the reasons why it\u2019s brought as a ballot initiative is that there is consensus that Silicon Valley owns Sacramento,\u201d said Chris Hoofnagle, an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and an adviser for the initiative. \u201cThere\u2019s no prospect of any consequential consumer privacy legislation.\u201dBut there was a small problem: neither Mr. Mactaggart nor Mr. Arney was a privacy expert or policy wonk. So they hired Mary Stone Ross, another neighborhood friend, who worked at the Central Intelligence Agency and had been legal counsel for the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, to oversee the effort.They spent months talking to technologists, academics and lawyers. They conducted polls and focus groups to understand what people wanted.After considering various options, they decided against taking a hard-line approach. Companies can still use personal data for their own purposes to sell advertising or improve products. They would be restricted, however, from selling or disclosing that data to someone else for \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d upon a consumer\u2019s request.Mr. Hoofnagle said, however, that the measure\u2019s financial punishments for violators give the law teeth that previous attempts at privacy regulation lacked. It also takes a broader view of what constitutes personal information beyond real names and Social Security numbers \u2014 including biometric data and numbers that identify the devices people use.Opponents of the measure say that those broad definitions of personal data are excessive and that companies can adopt their own privacy rules faster and more effectively.\u201cSomething that takes such a sledgehammer approach to regulating data is extraordinarily concerning,\u201d said Robert Callahan, a vice president of state government affairs at the Internet Association, an industry trade group. \u201cWe think the initiative is filled with flaws and it will have really dangerous consequences for the California economy.\u201dThe initiative\u2019s backers said they were raising money for their campaign using a crowdfunding approach. But to get their message out and raise awareness of the measure, they are advertising on \u2014 where else? \u2014 Facebook.Reflecting on his transformation from wealthy real estate developer to privacy activist, Mr. Mactaggart said that after devoting two years and millions of dollars, he\u2019s more certain than ever that this initiative is important and necessary \u2014 a point brought home during a focus group session that took place in Sunnyvale, a city in the heart of Silicon Valley, with a room full of engineers.\u201cOf all the focus groups we did around the state, that was the one most vehement about the need for this,\u201d Mr. Mactaggart said. \u201cThat was really one of the catalyzing moments for me when I was like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re onto something here.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korea Frees American Prisoners, Lifting Hurdle to Nuclear Talks", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health. Also, good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date & Place set.The president said that Mr. Pompeo was \u201cin the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen\u201d and that the group seemed \u201cto be in good health.\u201dSouth Korea welcomed the release of the prisoners \u2014 two of whom were arrested during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 calling it \u201cvery positive for a successful North Korean-United States summit,\u201d said Yoon Young-chan, a spokesman for President Moon Jae-in.A senior United States official said the prisoner release was an American condition to the planned talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea.Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the meeting would not be held in the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas. He would not disclose the exact date and place, but has previously cited Singapore, a neutral site favored by some of his advisers, as an option. The president said an announcement with the details would come in three days.The meeting would be the first face-to-face encounter between the top leaders of the two nations; Mr. Trump, 71, hopes to persuade Mr. Kim, 34, to abandon his nuclear weapons and the missiles that can carry them.\u201cThis show of good will is a positive signal for the U.S.-North Korean summit because it reflects a willingness to negotiate and compromise,\u201d said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul. \u201cIt also delivers a political score for the scandal-ridden President Trump at home, giving him something to brag about.\u201dSenator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement that the release of the three men was a \u201cpositive step.\u201dTheir return \u201cremoves an obstacle to a successful summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir release before the meeting also demonstrates that the combination of pressure and direct engagement is critical for making progress with North Korea.\u201dBut unlike those announcements, the release of the three Americans is permanent, and Mr. Kim forfeited a bargaining chip in freeing them. No other Americans are believed to be held prisoner in North Korea.The United States has persistently demanded the release of the three citizens \u2014 Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim and Kim Hak-song \u2014 who were held on charges of committing espionage or unidentified \u201chostile acts\u201d against North Korea.The Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea welcomed the release of the three but urged the North to release other detainees said to be held there, and to shut down its camps for political prisoners.\u201cIt is a time to remember the nationals of Japan, South Korea, and other countries who were abducted and are still held in North Korea,\u201d said Greg Scarlatoiu, the committee\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt is also a time to remember the 120,000 men, women, and children held in North Korea\u2019s political prison camps as well as political prisoners held at other unlawful detention facilities.\u201dAnticipation of the release had been building since Mr. Pompeo secretly visited North Korea over the Easter weekend. He was still the C.I.A. director then, and held initial talks with Mr. Kim and other top North Korean officials about the planned summit meeting, which could happen in the next few months.Mr. Trump teased the possibility they would be freed last week in a Twitter post, in which he also incorrectly asserted that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration had unsuccessfully pressed for their release. Two of the three were seized after Mr. Trump took office.\u201cThey used him as a political pawn for as long as they could,\u201d Mr. Warmbier said of his son, \u201cand when he was of no value to them, they essentially sent him home to our family in a body bag.\u201dA month before his trial, Mr. Kim appeared at a government-arranged news conference in Pyongyang and apologized for what he described as his attempted theft of military secrets in collusion with South Koreans. The South Korean spy agency has denied any involvement.Mr. Kim\u2019s predicament was not known until January 2016, when the North Korean government let CNN interview him in Pyongyang. At that time, Mr. Kim identified himself as a 62-year-old naturalized American citizen who lived in Fairfax, Va. He said he had once run a trading and hotel services company in Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea\u2019s borders with China and Russia.He said he had been arrested in October 2015 while meeting with a former North Korean soldier to receive classified data.Mr. Kim, who is in his 50s, studied accounting at the University of California, Riverside, and at Aurora University, and he worked as an accountant in the United States for more than a decade, according to his Facebook page.According to CNN, Mr. Kim, an ethnic Korean, was born in Jilin, China, near the North Korean border, and emigrated to the United States in the 1990s. After becoming an American citizen, the network said, Mr. Kim returned to China and studied agriculture in Yanbian before moving to Pyongyang.\u201cIt\u2019s also worth remembering that North Korea\u2019s practice of seizing, imprisoning and, in one case, probably torturing Americans represents reprehensible behavior that says something about the nature of the regime,\u201d said Evans J.R. Revere, a former State Department diplomat who specializes in East Asia. \u201cI would not give Pyongyang too much credit for undoing something it shouldn\u2019t have been doing in the first place.\u201dMr. Pompeo secured the freedom of the three Americans hours after he arrived in Pyongyang on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, he extended an olive branch to senior North Korean officials, promising better ties and a bright future for their country if it abandoned its nuclear weapons program, according to pool reports by journalists traveling with Mr. Pompeo.\u201cFor decades, we have been adversaries,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in a toast during a lunch that the North Koreans hosted for him. \u201cNow we are hopeful that we can work together to resolve this conflict, take away threats to the world and make your country have all the opportunities your people so richly deserve.\u201dThe North Koreans feted Mr. Pompeo and a dozen staff members traveling with him with red wine and dishes of poached fish and duck on the 39th floor of the Koryo Hotel in Pyongyang.Kim Yong-chol, a vice chairman of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party who has been Mr. Pompeo\u2019s main interlocutor, also voiced hopes for a friendship with Washington as he indicated that North Korea might be changing its course.\u201cIt is our policy to concentrate all efforts into economic progress in our country,\u201d Mr. Kim said at the lunch, reminding the Americans of a policy shift that Kim Jong-un adopted at a party meeting last month. \u201cI hope the United States also will be happy with our success,\u201d he added. \u201cI have high expectations the U.S. will play a very big role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201dBut Kim Yong-chol said the decision to engage in talks with the United States was \u201cnot a result of sanctions that have been imposed from outside,\u201d an apparent effort to rebuff the widespread belief in Washington that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d tactics had brought North Korea to the negotiating table. North Korea has said it is willing to denuclearize only if Washington withdraws \u201chostile policies\u201d and guarantees its security.Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York, and Eileen Sullivan from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Went Naked to a Museum, and It Was \u2026 Revealing", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReporter\u2019s NotebookPARIS \u2014 The most uncomfortable thing about being naked in a museum, it turns out, is the temperature. A half-hour into the first nudist tour of the Palais de Tokyo, a contemporary art museum in Paris, I had gotten used to the feeling of exposure, but I hadn\u2019t acclimatized to the cold air circulating through the cavernous galleries.Standing in a politically themed exhibition by the French-Algerian artist Ne\u00efl Beloufa, I began shaking my arms for warmth. Museums, I was discovering, are not temperature-controlled for people wearing only sneakers.In drawing this conclusion, it seemed, I wasn\u2019t alone. Jacqueline Bohain, a 65-year-old retiree who had taken an eight-hour bus trip from the Alsace region of eastern France to attend the event on Saturday, tried to warm herself in a sliver of sunlight. Other members of the group jiggled around to heat up. \u201cMaybe we should walk around the corner, so we can stand in the sun,\u201d Marion Buchloh-Kollerbohm, the tour guide, suggested, and maneuvered us to another area of the exhibition.\u201cI was imagining about 100 or 200 people might want to come, not 30,000,\u201d he said in a telephone interview before the tour.At 10 a.m., I joined the 161 people who had managed to get one of the limited tickets, and we undressed in an ad hoc changing room on the second floor of the museum. For the next two hours, we took part in one of six tours by (clothed) museum guides of \u201cDiscord, Daughter of the Night,\u201d a series of exhibitions spread across the museum, which is the largest in France for the presentation of contemporary art. The shows consist of one large, suspended sculpture and five separately curated but thematically related exhibitions in different parts of the museum, dealing mostly with issues of political strife and resistance.Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm, who is also the museum\u2019s head of education, told me that she was mindful of the potential awkwardness of combining nudism with the exhibition\u2019s serious subject matter.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make this into a conference on the post-colonial subject, because that would really kill the atmosphere,\u201d she said. Nevertheless, she added, \u201cI am hoping the experience of leaving their clothes at the door will help them leave some part of their identity with it, and experience it with more openness.\u201dOther museums have organized similar tours for temporary shows thematically connected to nakedness, including a Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition in Montreal and a show of male nudes at the Leopold Museum in Vienna. Mr. Luft said that it was \u201cactually more pleasing to me to find something that had nothing to do with nudity.\u201dMr. Luft and I walked into a small room in one corner of the exhibition where Mr. Beloufa was exhibiting an Iranian propaganda video from the Holy Defense Museum in Tehran that showed a simulation of a bomb attack on a marketplace. It felt insensitive to be watching a video of an atrocity (albeit a staged one) while standing in nothing but my running shoes, but Mr. Luft saw it differently. In his view, the exhibition confirmed his belief that nudity was a great social and political equalizer. \u201cIf world leaders had their meetings naked,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019d stay a lot calmer.\u201dMr. Luft said that he had proposed the tour to the Palais de Tokyo at a meeting in December. The idea, he said, was to expand the activities of the nudist association beyond sports \u2014 the group, he pointed out, held the world record for the largest number of people participating in a nude tenpin bowling. He expressed hope that cultural events like the one at the museum would lead to an influx of more diverse members.In a one-time concession, the Palais de Tokyo closed its doors to non-nude visitors on Saturday morning. Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm said the museum saw the event as being part of its mandate of cultural and social outreach.The results seemed promising: The attendees were slightly more male than female, but there was a broad mix of ages, and there were many newcomers to public nudity \u2014 like Junyu Deng, a 29-year-old Parisian \u2014 who seemed thrilled by the tour. She said that being nude had allowed her to have a more \u201cintimate\u201d interaction with the art.Our group moved into a space created by the British artist George Henry Longly, where several suits of armor used by the daimyo, feudal lords who reigned over Japan from the 10th to the 19th centuries, were exhibited. It felt oddly poignant to stare at an exhibition of ornate battle armor while being so physically vulnerable. Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm explained that the suits of armor had been crafted to look like aggressive animals, such as wasps, and that they consisted of a kind of \u201cexoskeleton.\u201d\u201cPutting on clothing, or an armor, it\u2019s a statement,\u201d Vincent Simonet, a 42-year-old singing teacher who offers naked classes, told me as we left the room. \u201cToday, nudism is seen as a statement, but really it\u2019s the opposite, it should be seen as a pure state.\u201dAn installation at the Palais de Tokyo show. The attendees were slightly more male than female, but there was a broad mix of ages, and there were many newcomers to public nudity.The final section of the tour, by the French artists Kader Attia and Jean-Jacques Lebel, was described partly as an \u201carchaeology of fear,\u201d and included a room filled with newspaper and magazine coverage of grim historical events primarily connected with colonialism. Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm crowded the group into a small corner to show us some \u201csickness masks\u201d from Nigeria, with distorted features that gave them the appearance of someone who has suffered from leprosy or a stroke.\u201cThese are not about a concept of perfect and symmetrical beauty,\u201d she said, to the hushed group, \u201cbut about accepting difference and its worth and power.\u201d Ms. Bohain, the retiree from Alsace, said to another tour member that it was an emotional note to end on, especially for a group committed to accepting and celebrating their own bodies.A few minutes later, we were ushered onto a patio with a view of the Eiffel Tower, where Ms. Bohain warmed herself in the sun. Mr. Luft said that he was extremely happy with the day\u2019s event, adding that he was already in discussions with several other museums to conduct similar tours.As for me, I was inclined to revisit the exhibition, especially its more political works, in a clothed context, when I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about feeling insensitive.Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm said she had enjoyed leading the group, but that the Palais de Tokyo was undecided about doing another nudist tour.Standing on the patio, Ms. Bohain told me that although she had not enjoyed all the art, she had enjoyed the experience. \u201cI\u2019m standing in the sun, naked, staring at the Eiffel Tower,\u201d she said. \u201cLife is great.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He wears a bracelet on his ankle that monitors him; he\u2019s out of prison after doing time for an unspecified crime and still under house arrest. He can\u2019t get permission to travel out of state for a family function.When he goes out for a run \u2014 his toned physique speaks of a devotion to fitness \u2014 he\u2019s greeted outside his home by some cartoonishly thuggish types who remind him they were there for him \u201con the inside.\u201d Keith\u2019s reaction suggests he\u2019s not interested in what they\u2019re selling.Back in the house, Keith fires up the computer and tries to get into an online course related to his stated ambition of learning a trade. It would be salutary to learn one, but he is easily distracted. He soon goes to Facebook instead, looking up an old friend, a tattooed fellow who posts pictures of himself delighting in thug poses.But Keith, his internet meanderings notwithstanding, perhaps feels done with the idea that the lifestyle of his one-time friend (now an enemy, it turns out) is something to aspire to. When his father, played by a low-key Jim Belushi, observes that Keith feels guilty about too many things, he shoots back: \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with guilt. I just have a problem with knowing that I let everybody down.\u201d His dad has an answer that he\u2019s perhaps given dozens of times before: \u201cWell then don\u2019t!\u201dCharacters like this one can be infuriating. But Mr. Lombardi imbues Keith with an ordinary likability \u2014 a quality that does evaporate somewhat as he makes ever more aggressively bad choices.Mr. Porterfield\u2019s evenhanded direction doesn\u2019t try to pull the viewer\u2019s sympathies one way or another. Within his realistic mode he crafts some startling effects \u2014 a strip-club brawl that spills out into broad, embarrassing daylight is eye-opening.Mr. Porterfield also excels in depicting Keith\u2019s nerve-racking environment, a segregated neighborhood in which Keith has divided interests: Most of his friends, including his one-time girlfriend Courtney (the superb Zazie Beetz) are African-American. But his associates from \u201cinside\u201d are White Power gangsters \u2014 Michael Rogers, as the evil scoutmaster of this crew, is chilling in a scene in which Keith asks for a break \u2014 one of many that he cannot catch in this quietly brutal story.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When White People Call the Police on Black People", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey happen while black people are going about their everyday lives, only to be interrupted by someone calling the police for the thinnest of suspicions.In the past month, more than a handful of such interactions have attracted widespread attention on social media \u2014 and, in turn, in national outlets like The Times, CNN and The Washington Post.He added, \u201cIt\u2019s humiliating and aggravating and upsetting, but the idea that it\u2019s national news is unexpected.\u201dBut until recently, the cellphone videos of these everyday interactions weren\u2019t constantly going viral, and the news stories were far less common. Now routine police interactions, those that don\u2019t end in an arrest or violence but still leave people shaken, are entering national consciousness in a way they have not in the past.Here are six instances in just the past month that have exploded on social media and made national headlines, and what the people were doing when the police were called.Lolade Siyonbola, a graduate student in African studies at Yale, fell asleep while working on a \u201cmarathon of papers\u201d Monday night. At 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, a woman who lived in the dorm turned on the lights and called the Yale police, telling Ms. Siyonbola she wasn\u2019t allowed to sleep in there. Several officers arrived, and Ms. Siyonbola showed them the key to her apartment and her ID.A Yale spokeswoman said the officers followed procedures, but Kimberly M. Goff-Crews, the university\u2019s vice president for student life, said in an email to students she was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the episode. On Thursday, Yale made a point to emphasize that officers had told the caller that this was not a police matter.Three teenagers looking for last-minute deals before a prom were trailed by Nordstrom Rack employees in suburban St. Louis on May 3. When they left the store carrying the items they bought, they were met by the police outside. The officers let them go after looking at their receipts and inside their bags and car.Nordstrom Rack\u2019s president called the three men to apologize. A company spokeswoman said in a statement the employees didn\u2019t follow policy, which directs employees to call the police only in emergencies.Three black people loaded suitcases into their car after staying at an Airbnb in Rialto, Calif., on April 30, but they were halted by the police after a neighbor suspected they were burglars. They were questioned by officers as a helicopter flew overhead.The renters are suing the Rialto Police Department, which said in a statement it was \u201cconfident officers treated the involved individuals with dignity, respect and professionalism.\u201d Airbnb said in a statement that the guests\u2019 treatment was \u201cunconscionable.\u201dThe everyday suspicions are not limited to African-Americans. Other minorities face increased scrutiny. On April 30, two Native American brothers were touring Colorado State University when a parent reported them to the campus police, saying their behavior and band T-shirts were suspicious. Officers pulled them aside and questioned them for about four minutes before releasing them to rejoin the tour, but the guide had already moved on.The university said it was \u201csad and frustrating from nearly every angle,\u201d and offered to reimburse the prospective students for the trip and bring them back as V.I.P. guests.An owner and employees of Grandview Golf Club in Dover Township, Pa., called the police on a group of black women who they said were playing too slowly on April 21. Officers left the golf course after they \u201cquickly determined that this was not a police issue,\u201d said Mark L. Bentzel, chief of the Northern York County Regional Police Department.No charges were filed, and one of the women, Sandra Thompson, said on Facebook that \u201cthe police were respectful.\u201d Jordan and J.J. Chronister, co-owners of the golf club, said in a statement that \u201cthe interaction between our members and our ownership progressed in a manner that was not reflective of our company\u2019s values or expectations for our own professionalism.\u201dTwo black men, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, were waiting for another man for a business meeting at a Starbucks in downtown Philadelphia on April 12. An employee asked them to leave, and called the police when they refused.The men settled with the city of Philadelphia for $1 apiece and a pledge to spend $200,000 to help young entrepreneurs. Starbucks apologized and reached a confidential financial settlement with the men, and said it would close all its stores in the United States on May 29 to give 175,000 employees anti-bias training.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Police Need Warrants for Driveway Searches, Supreme Court Rules", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe case arose from a search for a Virginia motorcyclist who twice committed traffic offenses while riding a distinctive orange and black motorcycle with an extended frame. Police officers gave chase, but the man eluded them. In one chase, the motorcycle reached speeds of more than 140 miles per hour.Officer David Rhodes, of the Albemarle County Police Department, investigated that matter. Relying on a Facebook post from a Virginia man named Ryan Collins showing what appeared to be the same motorcycle at the top of a driveway, Officer Rhodes tracked down the address, which was the home of Mr. Collins\u2019s girlfriend.Officer Rhodes, without a warrant or an invitation, visited the property. He saw what appeared to be a motorcycle covered in a tarp, walked up the driveway and lifted the tarp. The motorcycle, it turned out, was stolen.Mr. Collins was convicted of receiving stolen property after Virginia courts rejected his motion to suppress the evidence gained by the police officer\u2019s search.The question for the justices was whether the Fourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable searches, allowed this one.The exception, the United States Supreme Court has said, is based on the \u201cready mobility\u201d of vehicles and \u201cthe pervasive regulation of vehicles capable of traveling on the public highways.\u201dJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for an eight-justice majority, said the case involved a clash of those two principles.\u201cThe question before the court,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis whether the automobile exception justifies the invasion of the curtilage. The answer is no.\u201d\u201cTo allow an officer to rely on the automobile exception to gain entry into a house or its curtilage for the purpose of conducting a vehicle search,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote, \u201cwould unmoor the exception from its justifications, render hollow the core Fourth Amendment protection the Constitution extends to the house and its curtilage, and transform what was meant to be an exception into a tool with far broader application.\u201d\u201cIndeed, its name alone should make all this clear enough,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is, after all, an exception for automobiles.\u201dJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. dissented, saying the search had been reasonable and thus constitutional. The motorcycle, he wrote, was just a car\u2019s length or two from the curb. \u201cIf the motorcycle had been parked at the curb, instead of in the driveway,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit is undisputed that Rhodes could have searched it without obtaining a warrant.\u201dIn defending the search, Virginia officials urged the Supreme Court to draw a distinction between enclosed structures like garages and other areas around a home. Justice Sotomayor said that would give richer people more protection.\u201cVirginia\u2019s proposed bright-line rule automatically would grant constitutional rights to those persons with the financial means to afford residences with garages in which to store their vehicles,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut deprive those persons without such resources of any individualized consideration as to whether the areas in which they store their vehicles qualify as curtilage.\u201dIn his dissent in the case, Collins v. Virginia, No. 16-1027, Justice Alito cited a passage from \u201cOliver Twist\u201d by Charles Dickens.\u201cAn ordinary person of common sense would react to the court\u2019s decision the way Mr. Bumble famously responded when told about a legal rule that did not comport with the reality of everyday life,\u201d Justice Alito wrote. \u201cIf that is the law, he exclaimed, \u2018the law is a ass \u2014 a idiot.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

The nonprofit organization NOYB \u2014 short for \u201cnone of your business\u201d \u2014 claimed that Google and Facebook, along with two of Facebook\u2019s subsidiaries, WhatsApp and Instagram, failed to give European users specific control over the use of their data, in violation of the new rules.Even for cash-flush tech giants, those would be painful checks to write.I spoke with Mr. Schrems on Monday, several days after the start of his new privacy crusade. He said that while the timing of his latest volley was mainly symbolic \u2014 the organization had been preparing complaints against Facebook and Google for months \u2014 its substance was very real.\u201cIt was important to point that out the first day, that this is not compliant,\u201d Mr. Schrems told me. Facebook and Google, he said, have \u201cfundamentally tried to ignore or redefine\u201d the new European laws by forcing users to consent to wide-ranging data collection, without telling them exactly how their data would be used.\u201cAll of these cases should be absolutely won,\u201d he added.Tech companies never thought that Europe\u2019s data collection rules would be painless. But they may not have anticipated the chaos that unfurled last week, as lawyers rushed to tease apart the law\u2019s complications and companies barraged people with messages about their new, G.D.P.R.-compliant privacy policies.As other countries also look to establish their own European-style privacy regulations, the potential impact of the G.D.P.R. across the globe has turned a feeding frenzy of ambitious lawyers, lobbyists and activists into a kind of crowdsourced rule-making process that will ultimately determine how the new rules are enforced.As global companies, Facebook and Google don\u2019t have the option of cutting off the Continent. In statements, both companies defended their data collection practices, saying they fully complied with the new European regulations.\u201cWe have prepared for the past 18 months to ensure we meet the requirements of the G.D.P.R.,\u201d Erin Egan, Facebook\u2019s chief privacy officer, said in a statement. \u201cWe have made our policies clearer, our privacy settings easier to find, and introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete their information.\u201dA Google spokesman, Al Verney, said, \u201cWe build privacy and security into our products from the very earliest stages and are committed to complying with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation.\u201dAt the core of Mr. Schrems\u2019s complaints is the question of whether tech companies are giving people realistic choices about how their data is collected and used.Like many companies, Facebook and Google, which developed the Android mobile operating system, prompted users last week to accept new terms of service that explained their data collection particulars. Facebook members who declined to accept the new terms were unable to log into their accounts. Android users who didn\u2019t agree to the new terms were, in effect, locked out of their phones.Mr. Schrems said these all-or-nothing privacy policies violated the G.D.P.R.\u2019s requirement that consent be particularized and \u201cfreely given.\u201d To comply with the law, he said, large tech platforms need to give privacy-conscious users the option of sharing certain types of data but not others.Realistically, Mr. Schrems said, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to walk away from all your friends on Facebook.\u201dMr. Schrems shrugged off these concerns. The European market is too lucrative for companies like Google and Facebook to abandon, he said. And he doesn\u2019t believe that social networks and search engines would suffer unduly if they were forced to be more judicious about how they collected fine-grain data about people for the purposes of selling more ads.\u201cYou can still make a lot of money without microtargeting,\u201d he said.But if these types of complaints succeed \u2014 and it\u2019s not entirely crazy to think that they could, given the current antipathy toward American tech giants and the satisfaction that European officials might take in kneecapping a few of them \u2014 it could be a watershed moment for large tech companies.\u201cMassive fines in this case would have pretty significant repercussions,\u201d said Courtney M. Bowman, a lawyer at the firm Proskauer Rose who specializes in international privacy law. \u201cIt would be a strong signal from the E.U. authorities that this isn\u2019t just a law that\u2019s on the books that isn\u2019t going to be enforced,\u201d she said.Whether or not Facebook and Google end up paying billion-dollar fines, it\u2019s clear that the G.D.P.R. has already introduced a new, scary variable into Silicon Valley\u2019s privacy calculations. If tech giants know that privacy wonks like Mr. Schrems are watching their moves carefully, probing for openings to file complaints against them \u2014 and now, they undoubtedly do \u2014 they will need to think twice before adding new, privacy-invading features.\u201cIt\u2019s about who has control over information in an information age,\u201d Mr. Schrems said. \u201cWho has power over all this stuff?\u201dAdvertisement"}

And while the flavor isn\u2019t meaty, exactly, it is very full and also rich, for which some of the credit should go to the pool of hollandaise on the plate and some to the rivers of butter the carrots swam in as they cooked.This New Nordic carrot is perfectly at ease in a restaurant that is a little Irish, a little Midwestern, more than a bit Farm-to-Table, and extremely Bring Your Appetite. After you sit down, as the servers gloss the menu, they also lay down some Irish rarebit crackers coated with powdered cheese and mushrooms and pour hot black tea into grandma china. This is not a figure of speech; some of the china was owned by Ms. Williams\u2019s grandmother.There\u2019s Paris-style cooked ham, a red-pink pile of it, cold, like an invitation to a picnic; an all-American prime rib au jus with way more flavor and spirit than you\u2019ll find at any banquet venue; a salad of very young greens in tarragon vinaigrette and a lavish shower of Basque sheep cheese; steak tartare darkened with charred leeks and oyster aioli, a dish that would fit right in at a natural-wine bar in Paris or the Lower East Side.The cocktails run the gamut from gin to vermouth and back again.After dinner, you can have a slice of Bundt cake, her grandmother\u2019s recipe, soaked with aged rum and coffee syrup, or doughnut holes made from baked-potato batter. (They are neither light nor fluffy, but they are terrific.)These strands are wound together, somewhat loosely at times, by Ms. Williams, the undisputed lady of the house. A fair amount of the menu is autobiographical, like the restaurant. Inside, you can still see traces of its last tenant, an Irish tavern, including a fireplace set with stones from every county in Ireland. For Ms. Williams, the space is a link back to her great-grandparents, Irish immigrants who met in Corktown.Ms. Williams, 33, grew up in Northville, a suburb west of Detroit, and was chasing a cooking career in New York when she came back home \u2014 just for a short time, she thought \u2014 to attend to a death in the family.\u201cThen I fell in love with it, and decided this is the only place I want to have a restaurant,\u201d she said in a phone interview. A good deal of what attracted her was the hope that vacant-lot farms and start-up food businesses can help rebuild Detroit.\u201cIt\u2019s a full-circle thing,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cWe want to be a no-waste kitchen.\u201dIf I\u2019ve made dinner at Lady of the House sound like a block association meeting, I apologize. It isn\u2019t. In context, the scrap-saving comes across as creativity, and the local ingredients aren\u2019t treated like sacred relics. The kitchen puts food on plates with an openhanded generosity, which may explain why the restaurant has been getting noticed by national media, including, last week, Food & Wine magazine, which named Ms. Williams one of the best new chefs of the year.Ms. Williams pursues a style of hospitality that is historically female and that doesn\u2019t get talked about much in the restaurant business. It is a domestic style, the style of mothers and grandmothers for whom welcoming guests was among the few realms of undisputed control many of them enjoyed in the era before feminism.It\u2019s a style that recognized the power that comes from feeding visitors, from teaching them about the place they\u2019re in by handing them something delicious they\u2019ve never had back at home.You can see it in Ms. Williams\u2019s opening gambit, the Irish crackers and hot tea. What an odd way to start a restaurant dinner, but what a smart way to say, This is mine, and you\u2019re welcome to it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Teacher Walkout Movement Won\u2019t Reach Every State", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 The nationwide teacher protest movement spread to a sixth state on Wednesday as thousands in North Carolina rallied at the Capitol for higher pay and more money for schools. It was the first mass walkout for teachers in the state.In the months since the movement began, teachers have walked out in deep-red states and purple states; in states with booming economies and ones that are struggling; in states where school funding scrapes the bottom, and others where the numbers are closer to the national average.Despite the diversity and seemingly endless energy, the movement has limits. Most states have schools that are funded more or less equally from state and local coffers, with voters making many financial decisions close to home. But North Carolina shares something with other walkout states: Its state government plays an unusually strong role in funding education and setting its priorities, often superseding the influence of school districts.This strong-state model can include a larger-than-typical role for state governments in funding schools, a state-mandated salary schedule for teachers or efforts to equalize funding between poor and rich school districts.Because of such policies, the states are, in a way, ripe for large-scale labor actions, despite having weak public sector unions. Unlike some Northeast states where teachers in one town can earn $20,000 more than those in a nearby city, low-income and middle-class districts in the states that have had walkouts have similar teacher salary and school funding challenges, building solidarity \u2014 and political leverage \u2014 across hundreds of miles.Teacher salaries across the United States have failed to keep pace with inflation since 2009, falling by an average of 4 percent, according to data from the National Education Association, the national teachers\u2019 union. The drop is steeper in the six walkout states \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia.After Republicans took control of state government in 2013, North Carolina ended the estate tax and lowered corporate taxes as well as some personal income taxes.The actions, plus the recession, meant schools took a hit. Since 2009, the budgets for supplies, textbooks and school technology have been slashed by about half, according to the Public School Forum of North Carolina, a nonpartisan research group. And a greater share of teacher compensation has been dedicated toward pensions and health care costs.Symone Kiddoo, 27, is a school social worker in Durham. On Tuesday, she packed and distributed hundreds of donated meals to students at Southwest Elementary School and Forest View Elementary School. Ms. Kiddoo is the sole social worker for both schools, where over half of the 1,400 students come from low-income families. The food was for students to eat when school was closed for the walkout.Ms. Kiddoo spends her days responding to behavioral incidents, like a student overturning a table, and counseling children through crises, like the death of a parent. She makes sure students who can\u2019t see the chalkboard get glasses, and she maintains a food pantry and a clothing closet for children in need.She earns about $42,000 a year and works a second job as a pool attendant at the Y.M.C.A. She said she was participating in the walkout not primarily because of low pay, but for more mental health funding to hire social workers, school psychologists and counselors.\u201cWe are scrappers,\u201d she said, able to get a lot done with few resources. Still, she said it would be easier if social workers were assigned to one school at a time.As in Arizona, the last state to mount a widespread walkout, traditional public schools here have been challenged by the expansion of charter schools and private school vouchers.When students leave a traditional public school, they take their per-pupil funding with them. While the traditional school no longer has to provide them with instruction, other costs remain, like the repair of a roof or a heating system.\u201cIt\u2019s my biggest concern, that we\u2019ve become more segregated,\u201d said Mark Jewell, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union.Rhonda Dillingham, executive director of the North Carolina Association for Public Charter Schools, said she agreed that teachers should be paid more but would not be participating in the protest because of the negative rhetoric about school choice.\u201cI can\u2019t get behind the rally,\u201d Ms. Dillingham said. \u201cAs far as segregation, charter schools are open to all North Carolina students. I can\u2019t think of anything more segregating than a child\u2019s ZIP code and what a parent is able to pay for a house.\u201dConservatives see the walkout movement as partisan, with Democratic Party-aligned groups trying to fire up their base ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections. They acknowledge that teacher salaries could be higher and that more money is needed for items like textbooks, but point to the difficulty of balancing state budgets that must also pay for Medicaid and pension systems.\u201cThe only discernible crisis for the organizers of the event is that Republicans still control the General Assembly,\u201d said Terry Stoops, director of education studies at the John Locke Foundation, a conservative research group in Raleigh.Mr. Jewell, the union president, has been candid about wanting to change the makeup of the legislature. The walkout, which he calls a \u201cday of advocacy,\u201d is \u201cjust the beginning of a long stretch that we\u2019re calling the six-month haul\u201d toward the ballot box.The Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, has proposed an average pay raise for teachers of 8 percent and wants to halt planned tax cuts for businesses and high-earners in order to dedicate more money to schools.Republicans, who hold a veto-proof majority, say they can offer a 6 percent raise and smaller class sizes while maintaining tax cuts, and say additional raises should be tied to performance. Over the last several years, they phased out a program that paid teachers more for earning a master\u2019s degree and did away with most tenure protections.In North Carolina, as in the other five walkout states, union membership is optional for teachers.Mr. Jewell came to North Carolina from West Virginia, where he participated in a 1990 statewide walkout. This winter, when he saw rank-and-file teachers in his home state organizing on Facebook, he said he knew he wanted his own association to lead the way toward a mass labor action. \u201cYou have to get in front of the movement,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

A third Afghan, also involved in making the medal, said he, too, would flee the country because he no longer felt safe.Zabihullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban, said in a statement on WhatsApp that the insurgents were responsible for the killing of Gul Nabi in Pul-e-Alam, the capital of Logar Province, in revenge for his \u201ccriminal\u201d role in making the medal. Shapoor Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Logar Provincial Police, said Mr. Nabi, a prominent tribal elder in the province, had been killed by a bomb attached to the underside of his car last Friday.On his Twitter account, Mr. Mujahid posted a photograph of Mr. Nabi along with a statement that he had been killed.\u201cNow the U.S. president recognizes that Pakistan plays a double game and he cut aid to Pakistan,\u201d Mr. Akbari, 38, said in an interview in January. \u201cWe sent him that medal to show our unity and our appreciation.\u201dThe two men raised about $640 to buy the gold, mostly using small contributions from Logar residents, they said.

He had also relocated to Kabul, the capital, from his home in remote Daikundi Province.Mr. Akbari said he now regretted the decision to make a medal for Mr. Trump because those involved had received no support from the authorities or the American government.\u201cHajji Gul Nabi thought the Americans are our friends and can help us,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, we were deceived because we thought the Americans really appreciate our work and our intentions.\u201cWe thought the U.S. is a superpower and values friendship, but they don\u2019t,\u201d he added.The American Embassy in Kabul did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the episodes.Jawad Sukhanyar and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Despite holding the contents of an investigation still open after more than two years, the file was barely half an inch thick. \u201cHappy birthday,\u201d his boss said.It was not Rob Sand\u2019s birthday. His boss, an Iowa deputy attorney general named Thomas H. Miller, was retiring in July 2014 after nearly three decades of prosecuting everything from murder to fraud. He hired Sand about four years earlier and made him the youngest prosecutor in a nine-attorney team that handled challenging cases all over the state. Now Miller was offloading cases to colleagues. This one, having to do with a suspicious lottery ticket worth $16.5 million, was full of dead ends. Investigators didn\u2019t even know if a crime had been committed. The most tantalizing pieces of evidence were on a DVD: two grainy surveillance clips from a gas station. Sand slid the disc into his laptop and pressed play.A man walked into a QuikTrip convenience store just off Interstate 80 in Des Moines. It was a weekday afternoon, two days before Christmas. The hood of the man\u2019s black sweatshirt was pulled over his head, obscuring his face from two surveillance cameras overhead. Under the hoodie, he appeared to be wearing a ball cap; over the hoodie, he wore a black jacket. The man grabbed a fountain drink and two hot dogs.\u201cHello!\u201d the cashier said brightly.The man replied in a low-pitched drawl, a voice that struck Sand as distinct: \u201cHell-ooooh.\u201d\u201cCouple hot dogs?\u201d the cashier asked.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the man replied quietly, his head down.The man pulled two pieces of paper from his pocket. They were play slips for Hot Lotto, a Powerball-like lottery game available in 14 states and Washington, D.C. A player \u2014 or the game\u2019s computer \u2014 picked five numbers between 1 and 39 and then a sixth number, known as the Hot Ball, between 1 and 19. The prize for getting the first five numbers right was $10,000. But a much larger prize that varied according to the number of players who bought tickets went to anyone who got all six numbers right. The record Hot Lotto jackpot of nearly $20 million had been claimed in 2007. The jackpot at the time of this video was approaching the record. The stated odds of winning it were one in 10,939,383.The cashier took the man\u2019s play slips, which had already been filled out with multiple sets of numbers. At 3:24 p.m., the cashier ran the slips through the lottery terminal. An older man with a cane limped by the refrigerated section. A bus drove by. The cashier handed over his change. Once outside, the man pulled down his hood and removed his cap, got into his S.U.V. and drove away. The gas-station parking lot gleamed; there had been snow flurries that afternoon.Two years into the case, that was virtually all the investigators had. Sand watched the video again and again, trying to pick up every little detail: the S.U.V.\u2019s make; the man\u2019s indistinct appearance: most likely in his 40s, and 100 pounds overweight, maybe more; the tenor of his voice.Sand, a baby-faced Iowan who turned down Harvard Law School for the University of Iowa College of Law, had a background that seemed perfect for the case: a high school job writing computer code and doing tech support, a specialty in white-collar crime. His recent cases included securities fraud and theft by public officials.The ticket in the video was purchased on Dec. 23, 2010. Six days later, the winning Hot Lotto numbers were selected: 3, 12, 16, 26, 33, 11. The next day, the Iowa Lottery announced that a QuikTrip in Des Moines had sold the winning ticket. But one month after the numbers were drawn, no one had presented the ticket.The Iowa Lottery held a news conference. Phone calls poured in; dozens of people claimed to be the winner. Some said they had lost the ticket. Others said it was stolen from them. But lottery officials had crucial evidence that wasn\u2019t publicly available: the serial number on the winning ticket and the video of the man buying it. One by one, they crossed off prospective claimants. One caller said his friend was a regular Hot Lotto player who had just died in a car wreck \u2014 should he go to the junkyard to search through his deceased friend\u2019s car?Three months after the winning ticket was announced, the lottery issued another public reminder. Another followed at six months and again at nine months, each time warning that winners had one year to claim their money. \u201cI was convinced it would never be claimed,\u201d says Mary Neubauer, the Iowa Lottery\u2019s vice president of external relations. Since 1999, she had dealt with around 200 people who had won more than $1 million; she\u2019d never seen a winning million-dollar ticket go unclaimed. \u201cAnd then comes Nov. 9, 2011.\u201dA man named Philip Johnston, a lawyer from Quebec, called the Iowa Lottery and gave Neubauer the correct 15-digit serial number on the winning Hot Lotto ticket. Neubauer asked his age \u2014 in his 60s, he said \u2014 and what he was wearing when he purchased the ticket. His description, a sports coat and gray flannel dress pants, did not match the QuikTrip video. Then, in a subsequent call, the man admitted he had \u201cfibbed\u201d; he said he was helping a client claim the ticket so the client wouldn\u2019t be identified.This was against the Iowa Lottery rules, which require the identities of winners to be public. Johnston floated the possibility of withdrawing his claim. Neubauer was suspicious: The winner\u2019s anonymity was worth $16.5 million?One year to the day after the winning numbers popped up on the random-number-generator computers \u2014 and less than two hours before the 4 p.m. deadline \u2014 representatives from a prominent Des Moines law firm showed up at the Iowa Lottery\u2019s headquarters with the winning ticket. The firm was claiming the ticket on behalf of a trust. Later, the Iowa Lottery learned that the trust\u2019s beneficiary was a corporation in Belize whose president was Philip Johnston, the Canadian attorney. \u201cIt just absolutely stunk all over the place,\u201d says Terry Rich, chief executive of the Iowa Lottery. The Iowa attorney general\u2019s office and the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation opened a case.In an interview in Quebec City, Johnston told investigators that he had been contacted about the ticket by a Houston attorney named Robert Sonfield. Johnston also pointed investigators toward a Sugar Land, Tex., businessman named Robert Rhodes. A trip to Texas by Iowa investigators proved fruitless; during their several days there, both Sonfield and Rhodes managed to avoid them.By the time the file ended up on the desk of Rob Sand in 2014, the case had acquired cultlike status in his office. It was spoken about with gallows humor: \u201cWe\u2019ll find the guy who bought the ticket ended up getting offed,\u201d Sand said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is going to turn out to be, a murder case.\u201dMiller had mentored Sand and saw in him a kindred spirit, someone for whom practicing law was a calling. Sometimes Sand\u2019s moral compass was so steady that he came off as a square; his brothers-in-law nicknamed him Baby Jesus. Sand grew up in Decorah, in northeast Iowa, the son of a small-town doctor who still made house calls. He wanted to get into white-collar criminal prosecution because it focused not on crimes of desperation but on crimes of greed. \u201cCrimes against gratitude,\u201d Sand called them.But all he had was grainy video of a man buying a lottery ticket worth $16.5 million. \u201cWe only had one bullet left in our revolver,\u201d Sand says, \u201cand that was releasing the video.\u201dOn Oct. 9, 2014, nearly 46 months after the man in the hoodie left the QuikTrip, the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation put out a news release that included a link to a 74-second clip of the surveillance footage. A few days later, in Maine, an employee of the Maine Lottery opened an email forwarded from his boss. The employee recognized the distinct voice in the video: It belonged to a man who had spent a week in the Maine Lottery offices a few years earlier conducting a security audit.In Des Moines, a web developer at the Iowa Lottery who watched the video also recognized that voice: It belonged to a man she had worked alongside for years. A receptionist in another lottery office handed her earbuds to Noelle Krueger, a draw manager, and told her to listen. \u201cWhy am I listening to a video or listening to a tape of Eddie?\u201d Krueger replied.By Eddie, she meant Eddie Tipton, the information-security director for the Multi-State Lottery Association. The organization runs lotteries for 33 different states plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was based in the Des Moines suburbs. Among the games it ran was the Hot Lotto.Tipton built a 4,800-square-foot, $540,000 house in the cornfields south of Des Moines. The house had five bedrooms and a huge basement, including a pool table, a shuffleboard table, a stadium-style home theater with couches and a space he considered turning into a basketball court. Friends wondered why a single man needed such a big house and how he could afford it on a salary just shy of $100,000 a year. In private moments, Tipton told them he was lonely and wanted a family more than anything, so he poured his savings into the house he hoped to fill with a wife and children. But the right partner never came. Instead, he hosted office Christmas parties, and he constantly asked friends to visit. His family, still in Texas, checked on him frequently.His life revolved around his job. The Multi-State Lottery Association was a small organization, and Tipton felt overextended. He wrote software and worked on web pages. He handled network security and firewalls. And he reviewed security for lottery games in nearly three dozen states. He was putting in 60-hour weeks and staying at the office until 11 p.m.When Ed Stefan, the chief information officer and chief security officer at the Multi-State Lottery Association, saw the surveillance video, he didn\u2019t want to believe it. This wasn\u2019t just some co-worker. This was Eddie Tipton, a man he had known for more than two decades, since they were in calculus class at the University of Houston. Stefan met his future wife while he and Tipton were on a charity bike ride in Texas; Tipton would later be in their wedding. Stefan helped Tipton get his job at the association. They bought some 50 acres of land together and built adjacent houses. They even applied for a joint patent for computer-based lottery security.Jason Maher was another friend and colleague who didn\u2019t want to believe what he was seeing on the video. He and Tipton had met at Taki, a Japanese restaurant outside Des Moines that they both frequented. The lifelong computer aficionados and gamers hit it off; Tipton joined Maher\u2019s gaming clan, and they spent hours playing the multiplayer online game World of Tanks. Tipton suggested Maher apply for a job at the lottery association as a network engineer. Tipton, Maher told me, \u201chad a heart of gold.\u201dSo when Maher saw the video and heard that familiar low-pitched voice, he did what a computer whiz does. \u201cThat night I sat down \u2014 there\u2019s no way Eddie did this,\u201d Maher said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something wrong.\u201d He put the file of the surveillance tape into audio software, removed white noise and isolated the voice. Then he took footage from security cameras in his house \u2014 Tipton had just visited the night before \u2014 and compared Tipton\u2019s voice in that footage with the convenience-store video. \u201cIt was a complete and utter match, sound wave and everything,\u201d Maher said. The next day, he went to the QuikTrip where the ticket was purchased and measured the dimensions of the tiles on the floor, the height of the shelving units, the distance between the door and the cash register. He used the results to compare the hand size, foot size and height of the man in the video with the man he had become friends with.\u201cWhen the F.B.I. guys came in, I wanted to be able to tell them it wasn\u2019t Eddie,\u201d Maher said. \u201cOnce I did this, it was like, \u2018Well, [expletive] \u2014 it\u2019s Eddie.\u2019\u2009\u201dTipton was arrested in January 2015 and charged with two felony counts of fraud. Half a year later, on a hot, sticky July morning, Rob Sand stood before a jury at the Polk County Courthouse. \u201cThis is a classic story about an inside job,\u201d he began. \u201cA man who by virtue of his employment is not allowed to play the lottery, nor allowed to win, buys a lottery ticket, wins and passes the ticket along to friends to be claimed by someone unconnected to him. This story, though, has a 21st-century twist.\u201dThe prosecution knew Tipton had bought the winning ticket. The video, specifically the distinct voice that colleagues had recognized, made that pretty clear. So did cellphone records, which showed Tipton was in town that day, not out of town for the holidays as he claimed, and that he had been on the phone for 71 minutes with Robert Rhodes, the man who briefly had possession of the ticket. Investigators believed he\u2019d fixed the lottery. But how?Jason Maher, Tipton\u2019s gaming buddy, told them about Tipton\u2019s interest in rootkits: malicious software that can be installed via flash drive in order to take control of a computer while masking its existence until it deletes itself later. Sand theorized that Tipton went into the draw room six weeks before the big jackpot and, despite the presence of two colleagues, managed to insert a thumb drive into one of the two computers that select the winning numbers. That thumb drive contained the rootkit; the rootkit allowed Tipton to direct which numbers would win the Hot Lotto on Dec. 29, 2010.Tipton\u2019s defense attorney, Dean Stowers, called this the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theory. Stowers characterized the story of a malicious, self-destructing rootkit (\u201cmagic software\u201d), installed while two colleagues looked on, as preposterous. His closing arguments referenced a quotation attributed to Albert Einstein: \u201cLogic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you anywhere.\u201dBut Sand called Stowers\u2019s focus on this complicated rootkit theory a red herring. Sand told the jury to focus on the many ways Tipton could have fixed the lottery: He wrote the code. He had access to the random-number-generator machines before they were shipped to other states. You don\u2019t have to understand the exact technology to convict Tipton, Sand argued; you just have to realize the near-impossible coincidence of the lottery security chief\u2019s buying a winning ticket and that ticket\u2019s being passed to his best friend. The prosecution had to prove only that Tipton tried to illegally buy lottery tickets as a Multi-State Lottery Association employee and tried to claim the prize through fraudulent means.The jury found him guilty on July 20, 2015. He would be sentenced to 10 years in prison, and he would appeal. The State Supreme Court later dismissed his conviction on one charge, tampering with lottery equipment, and the case was sent back to District Court.Six weeks after the trial concluded, Sand had returned to his desk. It had been a busy summer. But in the back of his mind, he was still thinking about Eddie Tipton. Sand knew white-collar criminals aren\u2019t usually caught on their first attempt. The fact that Tipton\u2019s attorney had demanded a 90-day speedy trial, an unusual maneuver that cut short the prosecution\u2019s time to investigate, made Sand suspicious. His gut said other fraudulent lottery tickets were out there.One morning Sand\u2019s office phone rang, and an area code he recognized popped up: 281, from Texas, where Tipton used to live. Sand picked up. The caller had a drawl and told Sand he\u2019d seen an article in the La Grange, Tex., newspaper about Tipton\u2019s conviction. \u201cDid y\u2019all know,\u201d the tipster asked, \u201cthat Eddie\u2019s brother Tommy Tipton won the lottery, maybe about 10 years back?\u201dA man named Tom Bargas had contacted local law-enforcement authorities in early 2006 with a suspicious story. Bargas owned 44 fireworks stands in Texas. Twice a year \u2014 after the Fourth of July and after New Year\u2019s \u2014 he had to handle enormous amounts of cash, more than a half-million dollars at once. A local justice of the peace who shod Bargas\u2019s horses called him around New Year\u2019s. The justice of the peace caught Bargas off guard: \u201cI got half a million in cash that I want to swap with your money.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your money?\u201d Bargas replied.What\u2019s a justice of the peace who makes around $35,000 a year doing with that much cash? Bargas thought. He called the sheriff and the police, who called the F.B.I. Soon, the bureau contacted Bargas. Federal agents outfitted him with a wire. Bargas met with the man, who pulled out a briefcase filled with $450,000 in cash, still in their Federal Reserve wrappers. As the F.B.I. listened, Bargas swapped $100,000 of worn, circulated bills for $100,000 of the man\u2019s crisp, unused bills. To the F.B.I., this smelled like public corruption, and they went to work investigating the serial numbers on the bills.One day a couple of months later, Rennison got a call from the Fayette County sheriff in La Grange, a place best known for the Chicken Ranch, the brothel that inspired \u201cThe Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\u201d The sheriff was laughing so hard he could hardly speak. He told Rennison the justice of the peace was holed up in a Houston hospital with two shattered legs. He had fallen 31 feet out of a tree. He had been hunting Bigfoot.\u201cMy grandmother was raised on a farm in Arkansas where this creature would come in and harass all the farm animals,\u201d this man later told investigators. \u201cMy grandmother would tell me all these stories of this animal that harassed my family.\u201d He went on: \u201cI started hitting the woods. It was always that doubt in your mind. And then something happened to me in Louisiana where I actually watched these animals for a couple of hours, and I\u2019ve been hooked ever since.\u201dRennison visited the man in the hospital and then set up an interview once he was discharged. The man was a member of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization. He told Rennison he\u2019d won the lottery in Colorado while on a Bigfoot hunt. He was on the outs with his wife and was trying to keep the lottery winnings from her. A Bigfoot-hunting friend claimed the prize in exchange for 10 percent of the money. It all checked out. Case closed.\u201cRight before I leave, we\u2019re still sitting down at this nice conference table, and he looks over at his attorneys and says, \u2018Can I show him?\u2019\u2009\u201d Rennison recalled. \u201cHanging off the back of his chair is a plastic grocery bag. He pulls out a plaster cast of a footprint.\u201dRennison put the footprint next to his own foot. They were roughly the same size. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t look like Bigfoot,\u201d the F.B.I. agent said. \u201cIt was a juvenile,\u201d the man snapped. The man\u2019s name was Tommy Tipton.The investigators collected a decade\u2019s worth of winners from lotteries around the country associated with the Multi-State Lottery Association. They loaded data from approximately 45,000 winning tickets into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and searched for any connections to Eddie Tipton. They reviewed Tipton\u2019s Facebook friends, pulled phone records and looked for matches with the spreadsheet.In September 2015, they learned that a $783,257.72 payout for Wisconsin\u2019s Very Own Megabucks Game had been claimed in early 2008 by a Texas man named Robert Rhodes, who wanted to deposit it into the account of a limited-liability corporation. That drawing took place on Dec. 29, 2007 \u2014 the same day the winning numbers on Tipton\u2019s $16.5 million Iowa ticket were selected three years later. Rhodes was Eddie Tipton\u2019s best friend. Another hit.One evening over the holidays, Sand was at his parents\u2019 house working on his laptop, sifting through records, using search commands on his computer again and again. He noticed that a Kyle Conn from Hemphill, Tex., won a $644,478 jackpot in the Oklahoma Lottery some years back. Tommy Tipton had three Facebook friends named Conn. Sand got a list of possible phone numbers for a Kyle Conn and cross-referenced them with Tommy Tipton\u2019s cellphone records. Another hit.Investigators noticed two winning Kansas Lottery tickets for $15,402 apiece were purchased on Dec. 23, 2010 \u2014 the same day Tipton had purchased the Iowa ticket, and the same day that cellphone records indicated he was driving through Kansas on the way to Texas for the holidays. One of the winning tickets was claimed by a Texan named Christopher McCoulskey, the other by an Iowa woman named Amy Warrick. Each was a friend of Eddie Tipton\u2019s.Early one morning, Sand and an investigator knocked on the woman\u2019s door. She told them she\u2019d gone on one date with Tipton, but their relationship became platonic. Tipton told her he wasn\u2019t able to claim a winning lottery ticket because of his job. If she could claim it, Tipton said, she could keep a significant portion as a gift for her recent engagement.Investigators in Wisconsin discovered they still had the random-number-generator computers used for the 2007 jackpot sitting in storage. Unlike Iowa\u2019s computers, the hard drives had not been wiped clean; their software was the same as the day Robert Rhodes won $783,257.72. Wisconsin enlisted a computer expert named Sean McLinden to conduct an investigation that included forensic analysis and reverse engineering.On Jan. 7, 2016, Sand\u2019s phone rang. It was David Maas, an assistant attorney general in Wisconsin. He told Sand to check his email. Maas had sent him an attachment with 21 lines of \u201cpseudocode,\u201d a common-language translation of McLinden\u2019s forensic analysis that showed part of Tipton\u2019s malicious computer code. The code was small enough that it would not radically change the size of the file, which might create suspicion. And the code hadn\u2019t been hidden. You just needed to know what to look for.\u201cThis,\u201d Maas says, \u201cwas finding the smoking gun.\u201dThe smoking gun would help lead to a guilty plea from Tipton. In the plea deal, Sand insisted that Tipton come clean about how he fixed the lottery. This could help the lottery industry improve its security. If Tipton lied \u2014 or if another fraudulent ticket were found later \u2014 the deal would be voided, and Tipton would be subject to further charges.Tipton\u2019s program was called QVRNG.dll: Quantum Vision Random Number Generator. In Tipton\u2019s telling, his wasn\u2019t an evil plan to get rich. This was just a computer nerd\u2019s attempt to crack the system. \u201cIt was never my intent to start a full-out ticket scam,\u201d Tipton told investigators. \u201cIt occurred to me, like, Wow, I could do this, I could be making a living doing this.\u201d He went on: \u201cIf this was, like, some mob-related thing, I\u2019d just give this information to the mob and they would go out and win the lotteries left and right. Nobody would know. But that \u2014 I don\u2019t have any mob ties. I don\u2019t know anybody. I gave tickets to friends or family.\u201dMore than a decade ago, Tipton told them, he walked past one of the organization\u2019s accountants at the Multi-State Lottery Association. Tipton was conservative, the accountant liberal, and they often ribbed each other.\u201cHey, did you put your secret numbers in there?\u201d the accountant said, teasing Tipton.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWell, you know, you can set numbers on any given day since you wrote the software.\u201dAnd that\u2019s when the idea first came. \u201cJust like a little seed that was planted,\u201d Tipton said in his proffer. \u201cAnd then during one slow period I just had a \u2014 had a thought that it\u2019s possible, and I tried it and I put it in.\u201d The code wasn\u2019t a brazen \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d stunt of sneaking into the draw room with a malicious thumb drive. It was a simple piece of code, partly copied from an internet source, inserted by the one man responsible for information security at an organization that runs three dozen United States lotteries.Here\u2019s how the Multi-State Lottery Association\u2019s random-number generators were supposed to work: The computer takes a reading from a Geiger counter that measures radiation in the surrounding air, specifically the radioactive isotope Americium-241. The reading is expressed as a long number of code; that number gives the generator its true randomness. The random number is called the seed, and the seed is plugged into the algorithm, a pseudorandom number generator called the Mersenne Twister. At the end, the computer spits out the winning lottery numbers.Tipton\u2019s extra lines of code first checked to see if the coming lottery drawing fulfilled Tipton\u2019s narrow circumstances. It had to be on a Wednesday or a Saturday evening, and one of three dates in a nonleap year: the 147th day of the year (May 27), the 327th day (Nov. 23) or the 363rd day (Dec. 29). Investigators noticed those dates generally fell around holidays \u2014 Memorial Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas \u2014 when Tipton was often on vacation. If those criteria were satisfied, the random-number generator was diverted to a different track. Instead, the algorithm would use a predetermined seed number that restricted the pool of potential winning numbers to a much smaller, predictable set of numbers.So Tipton knew what no one else knew: For the Iowa Hot Lotto drawing on Dec. 29, 2010, there weren\u2019t really 10,939,383 sets of possible winning numbers. There were only a few hundred. Late at night before a draw that fulfilled his criteria, Tipton stayed in his messy, computer-filled office. He set a test computer to the date and time of the coming draw, and he ran the program over and over again. For the first lottery he rigged, the Nov. 23, 2005, drawing in Colorado, Tipton wrote down each potential set of winning numbers on a yellow legal pad. He handed the pad \u2014 each sheet had 35 or so sets of six numbers \u2014 to his brother.It was a cheat sheet; instead of playing every possible number combination to ensure one combination won, he had to play only a few hundred. \u201cIf you want a chance to win, you need to play all of these,\u201d Tipton told his brother. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any of them will win, but you\u2019re going anyway\u201d \u2014 his brother was about to go on a Bigfoot-hunting trip to Colorado \u2014 and \u201cthese have a good chance of winning based on my analysis.\u201cPlay them,\u201d he said. \u201cPlay them all.\u201dIn statements to prosecutors, Tipton painted himself in the most generous way possible, a kind of coding Robin Hood, stealing from the lottery and helping people in need: his brother who had five daughters, his friend who\u2019d just gotten engaged. \u201cI didn\u2019t really need the money,\u201d Tipton said. The judge noted that Tipton seemed to rationalize his actions \u2014 that Tipton didn\u2019t think it was necessarily illegal, just a taking advantage of a hole in the lottery\u2019s system. It wasn\u2019t all that different, Tipton believed, from insider trading, except laws didn\u2019t specifically prohibit him from fiddling with the random-number-generator code. His attorney equated what he did with counting cards at a casino. Tipton wasn\u2019t robbing the casino at gunpoint; he was cheating the house.The other side disagreed. Tipton was \u201cnothing but a common thief who happened to be handed the keys to the candy store,\u201d Miller, Sand\u2019s former boss, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of Sherlock Holmes\u2019s archnemesis, Moriarty, being a criminal genius. This is just a regular schlub, who is a thief who happens to have knowledge of computer security.\u201dFrom Tipton\u2019s point of view, it was complicated. He had done something to see if he could do it. To his surprise, it worked. He said he inserted that code only once; after the code was approved by Gaming Laboratories International, machines containing it were shipped all over the country. He had created a beast and sent it into the world. \u201cYou plant that money tree in your backyard,\u201d as Maas, the Wisconsin prosecutor, put it, \u201cand it\u2019s hard not to keep picking at it.\u201dIn interviews, investigators had asked Tipton if he was proud of the success of his code. \u201cIt was more like I\u2019m ready for it to be gone,\u201d Tipton said. \u201cIt was never my intent to go out there and start winning all these lotteries. It was just, like I said, step by step it happened.\u201dAt sentencing, the judge asked if Tipton had anything to say. After a long pause, Tipton cleared his throat. Family members and former co-workers were in the courtroom. \u201cWell,\u201d Tipton said matter-of-factly, \u201cI certainly regret my actions. It\u2019s difficult to say that with all the people behind me that I hurt. And I regret it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d As the case was being litigated, Tipton had confessed to friends that he was racked with guilt. At another point during the proceedings, Tipton leaned across a divide and extended his hand to Sand. Sand took the handshake as a sign of respect, as if Tipton had thought he outsmarted the system but the system figured him out. On the day of his sentencing, Tipton told the judge he\u2019d been taking classes to go into ministry. A deputy placed Tipton in handcuffs and led him away.Earlier in the summer, Tipton sat in a conference room with Sand and law-enforcement and lottery officials to give his full confession, as promised in his plea agreement. Eventually he would head to Clarinda Correctional Facility in southern Iowa, near the Missouri border, where he remains today, Offender No. 6832975. (Through his attorney, he declined interview requests for this article; Tipton did not respond to nearly a dozen emails through the prison email system.)During a lunch break in Tipton\u2019s hourslong confession, Sand and others involved in the prosecution walked a few blocks to the High Life Lounge. They ordered bacon-wrapped tater tots to celebrate. \u201cEddie sees himself as much brighter than the rest of the world, the sharpest tool in the toolbox,\u201d Sand says. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing I see in white-collar case after white-collar case, people who think they\u2019re better than everybody else, that people trust them and love them, and that no one will be able to figure this out.\u201dThe judge sentenced Tipton to a maximum of 25 years in prison. His restitution payments to the various state lotteries came to $2.2 million even though, according to his attorney, Tipton pocketed only around $350,000 from the scam, the rest going to those who claimed the tickets. (Prosecutors did not believe that, pointing to Tipton\u2019s massive house as well as the fact that Tipton and his brother owned 11 pieces of property either jointly or individually in Fayette County, Tex.) In Iowa, which has indeterminate sentencing, a 25-year sentence could mean Tipton is released much sooner; Sand expects Tipton to be released by the Iowa Board of Parole within seven years.Sand says he felt a deep intellectual satisfaction in solving the puzzle: \u201cThe justice system at its best is really about a search for truth.\u201d But it couldn\u2019t go back in time and correct wrongs. At the end of this yearslong case, he came to a realization: He had grown weary of dealing with criminals. \u201cIn so much darkness,\u201d Sand says, \u201cI started to lose my light.\u201dA few months after the highest-profile case of his career, Sand went up to his boss and quit. He had decided to run for state auditor in the coming November election, so he could make positive changes. If he wins, he will be investigating government waste, abuse and fraud. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I would make a move to get away from the darkness of prosecution without finishing this case first,\u201d Sand says. \u201cSo finishing it, to me, was not merely satisfying. It was liberating.\u201dIt\u2019s pricey, it\u2019s portable, its users need it constantly, and retailers love to buy it at a discount.

{"Headline": "When Cooking Is About Ease, Not \u2018Easy\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEasy cooking may not be as easy as it seems. This simple truth became painfully evident on a trip to the port of Essaouira in Morocco a few years back.I visited the town to shoot a segment in a TV show about Moroccan food, and my first task was to grill a whole sea bass over fire in an open-air restaurant. Gathered around were a bunch of local kids, a production team of eight, a few chefs from neighboring restaurants and anyone, really, that cared to come and watch.Things didn\u2019t go well. A strong wind with a mind of its own, blowing in from the Atlantic, first over-stirred the coals, then blew them out and, finally, rustled black bits of char all over my fish, rendering it inedible. By the third take, a makeshift covering was erected, but I was already covered in sweat and yearning to escape into the cool water my poor sea bass had been lifted from only a few hours earlier. Eventually, I did manage to pull together the fish and the scene, but I was utterly drained.The next day, I joined a couple of fishermen on their tiny wooden boat as they looked for sardines. Within minutes, we had just enough for my hosts to make me the kind of breakfast feast they prepare for themselves every morning after hours at sea. They gutted and filleted the sardines with their hands, minced them and added preserved lemon and some spices. They then shaped the mix into balls and cooked them on a tiny portable gas stove in a sauce made with some grated tomato and garlic. The fish balls and sauce, stuffed into fluffy bread rolls, were a chunk of heaven.This dish, created by Moroccan Jews who are long gone from Essaouira, inspired my fish koftas in tomato and lime sauce. It also taught me a lesson about the importance of ease in cooking. There was nothing particularly simple about the dish I was so generously served; it involved some serious cooking with very basic equipment. The flavors were complex and well rounded. But there was a serenity and confidence there that comes from cooking something for the hundredth time. There was a great deal of intimacy, too, of the kind that, I can only imagine, just happens when you spend half your life with other men on a small boat.Paradoxically, my anxious cooking in front of a crowd involved a dish that, in theory, was much simpler to make: a whole fish in marinade, grilled and served with a plain salsa. What could go wrong? The mackerel fillets with pistachio and cardamom salsa, which is a simpler take on the flavor profile of my koftas, should be equally untaxing.My Moroccan experience, however, showed me that stressless cooking is not always about \u201ceasy,\u201d but about \u201cease\u201d; it\u2019s not about a dish but about a state of mind. For me, that means being able to create for myself an intimate moment in the kitchen (or on a boat, if that\u2019s where I happen to be); it means finding a quiet space to cook and properly engage; it means preferring the real show (sitting down for a delicious meal) over the showmanship.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reviving Ancient Spanish Vineyards, Building New Traditions", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourNAVARREVISCA, Spain \u2014 Old vineyards dot the landscape surrounding this village about an hour west of Madrid. But to find the tiny, astounding Rumbo al Norte vineyard, where 70-year-old garnacha vines grow on granite and sandstone slopes threaded with quartz and strewn with gigantic boulders, you not only have to know someone, you have to earn his trust.The reward? For decades, the garnacha, as grenache is known in Spanish, went to the local cooperative, which made bulk wines that ended up in anonymous blends. Many growers lost money on their vines. But their attachment to the land was deep, transcending economics.Beyond the elderly caretakers, whose children were seldom interested in carrying on their stewardship, not many valued these old vineyards. Twenty years ago, the few commercial wineries in the area were planting cabernet sauvignon and merlot on the flatlands in an effort to appeal to international markets.Many of the old vineyards have been abandoned over the decades. You can sometimes see traces of them, their ancient stone terraces fading back into the hillsides. Only in the last decade has it become apparent that the area could offer agricultural riches to those willing to seek them out.Over the last 10 years, Mr. Garc\u00eda and Mr. Landi have tracked down vineyards that were only legends, whispered about in taverns or in the fields. They befriended farmers and earned their trust and respect.\u201cWe have a big, big treasure here,\u201d Mr. Landi said. \u201cThe big heroes are those who worked and maintained these vineyards, even as they lost money selling to the co-ops.\u201dMr. Landi, who goes by Dani, said the vineyard prospecting has required a great deal of research.\u201cTalking to old guys in bars,\u201d he said. \u201cI found when you drink beer, you find good vineyards.\u201dToday, along with Comando G, a handful of producers working in the Sierra de Gredos is showing how distinctive the wines can be from an area that was ignored for so long.But the bottles with the most finesse and nuance, and which have drawn the most interest, are from Comando G, whose wines are now among the most compelling in Spain.The entry-level red, La Bruja de Rozas, is lovely and floral, with light, chalky mineral flavors. Rozas 1er Cru is a step up, not as effusive or ample as La Bruja, and a little more chiseled.Most striking are a trio of wines made from old-vine garnacha grown in granite at high altitudes, all striking similar chords yet discernibly different. Las Umbr\u00edas, from a vineyard of sandy granite and clay, tastes like flowers, citrus and minerals. Tumba del Rey Moro \u2014 from a vineyard of almost pure granite with ancient vines interspersed with trees \u2014 is more like concentrated rose petals, yet distinctly salty. Rumbo al Norte is dry, chalky and almost austere.\u201cThe texture of this vineyard is the texture of the wine,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda said, pointing to fine grains of quartz as we wandered among the boulders in Rumbo al Norte. Collectively, they are among the most striking grenache-based wines I have had.Mr. Garc\u00eda and Mr. Landi took many trips to Burgundy, to the Rh\u00f4ne and the Loire, and eventually to Roussillon in the south and to Sicily and the Barolo region of Italy.\u201cIn Spain, we didn\u2019t have any references,\u201d said Mr. Garc\u00eda, who goes by Fer. \u201cWe learned about terroir and minerality in France and Italy, but not in Spain.\u201dOnly in recent years, Mr. Garc\u00eda said, have many Spanish winemakers felt freer to explore their own tastes and muses.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to copy the style of Burgundy, but to follow the philosophy,\u201d Mr. Landi said. \u201cEvery village here is completely different. We want to express the style of each village.\u201dMr. Landi grew up in the region. His family owned vineyards and was one of the first in the area to bottle its own wine. With the encouragement of the European Union, his family planted international varieties rather than the traditional grapes.In Madrid, Mr. Landi met Mr. Garcia, who was studying agricultural engineering and working at one of the city\u2019s best wine shops. Together with a third partner, Marc Isart, who eventually dropped out, they started Comando G in 2008.\u201cUp until 2012 or \u201913, we both had day jobs and worked weekends and holidays on Comando G,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda said. \u201cNow Comando G is the day job.\u201dIn their search for old vineyards, they are looking for three qualities: granite soils, garnacha and altitude. The soils provide strength and freshness in the wines, Mr. Landi said.Garnacha, which Mr. Landi calls the pinot noir of the south, gives the winemakers the ability to produce fresh, elegant wines. Altitudes of at least 2,500 feet \u2014 and preferably 3,000 to 4,000 \u2014 allow a longer ripening cycle, and wines with less alcohol and more balance. The men are especially interested in vineyards facing east and north, which receive less direct heat, especially important in the era of climate change.The region encompasses three different valleys with three different climates, from Mediterranean in the southern Ti\u00e9tar and Alberche valleys to continental in the northern Alto Alberche. The divergence is reflected in the landscape, where lavender and fig and olive trees in the southern part give way to oak, chestnuts and almonds in the north.They farm biodynamically, but each vineyard, Mr. Garc\u00eda said, required slightly different techniques, derived often by observing how the older people worked the land.All the garnachas are fermented with their stems, in the ancient fashion, the single-vineyard wines in big oak vats, the others in a mixture of oak and concrete. The aim, always, is to preserve freshness. \u201cWith grenache, you don\u2019t need structure, you need acidity,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda said.Comando G also makes a tiny amount of a lovely white wine from garnacha gris and garnacha blanc, El Tamboril, which smells like lemons, rocks and flowers.Since 2015, the aim has been to produce smaller quantities of better-quality wine in bottles, rather than bulk wine. The 2017 was fresh, fruity, direct and easy to drink, a good value for about $15. The Comando G wines range from about $25 to $100 or more for the single-vineyard wines.For Comando G, it has been a remarkable decade.\u201cTen years is not so long in the wine business,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda said. \u201cBut 10 years ago there was practically nothing here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rhubarb Shows Off Its Stripes", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteWith its high moisture content, rhubarb quickly disintegrates when it\u2019s heated, turning into a beige mush that doesn\u2019t reflect its rosy elegance when it\u2019s intact.Poaching the rhubarb in sugar syrup can help. The sugar lightly candies the stalks, helping them keep their shape while sweetening their intense tartness. Poaching also allows you to add flavorings. Vanilla is a classic choice, but you could just as easily throw in a few cardamom or star anise pods, a curl of lemon zest, or a couple of slices of fresh ginger root.Be sure to keep the aromatics on the lighter side here. After poaching the rhubarb, the sugar syrup is boiled down into a glaze to be brushed over the cake, adding shine and moisture. Too much star anise, or any other ingredient for that matter, can become bitter when reduced.The cake itself \u2014 a buttery, moist poundcake flecked with vanilla beans \u2014 is plenty good on its own. I often make it without fruit, but I like it even more in rhubarb season, when the poached stalks add a tangy, syrupy juiciness that somehow makes the cake seem lighter.It\u2019s a real beauty, too, with the top of the loaf covered in glistening stripes of rhubarb. Buy the reddest stalks you can find. They will fade to lipstick pink after poaching, and are more eye-catching than the pale green ones (which still taste just as good, if that\u2019s what you have).While you may be tempted to lay the rhubarb lengthwise across the cake, crosswise is much more practical when it comes to serving. The stalks are easier to slice this way, giving each piece an equal amount of the jammy topping.To keep the poached rhubarb from sinking into the cake batter \u2014 which is decidedly not pretty \u2014 I add it to the top of the cake after the batter bakes and sets for 20 minutes. Do this carefully: The pan will be hot, and you don\u2019t want to singe your fingers.Your reward will be a thing of beauty, a pink-striped stunner that\u2019s perfect for spring.cookingAdvertisement"}

In the late 1930s theft was almost entirely associated with the poor. As he saw it, his fellow sociologists had come to the conclusion that crime was a result of \u201cfeeblemindedness, psychopathic deviations, slum neighborhoods and \u2018deteriorated\u2019 families\u201d; it was believed that less than 2 percent of crime came from members of the upper echelons of society. But Sutherland believed this outlook was not only biased, but blinkered, failing to take into account theft that was taking place in plain sight. \u201cThe \u2018robber barons\u2019 of the last half of the 19th century were white-collar criminals,\u201d he told the crowd of the American Sociological Society in 1939, recounting the time Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt more or less confessed that his family wealth was ill gotten, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose you can run a railroad in accordance with the statutes, do you?\u201dAccording to people on both sides of the law, today, thanks to the internet and tax havens, it is even easier for white-collar crime to slip under the radar: Cash is stashed in untouchable island accounts; corporate checks can be forged and deposited; money laundering takes the form of a prepaid debit card; insider trading is just a conversation over cocktails. You\u2019ll be shocked to learn just how simple it is to rob and steal while maintaining a veneer of respectability.Checks can be useful tools when it comes to engaging in both corporate theft and what are called account takeovers. Each requires a basic understanding of forgery. To steal from a business, says Frank Abagnale, whose criminal exploits inspired the movie \u201cCatch Me if You Can,\u201d the best forgers \u201ccapture a corporate logo and maybe the front of the building \u2014 layer it in the background, and you can make a check 10 times better looking than the actual check.\u201d Then they call the company and ask to speak to someone in accounts receivable. After they explain that they want to pay an invoice by wiring money to the institution, they are told where it does its banking and are given its routing and account numbers. They add that information to the fake check.Next they find someone in corporate communications to give them a press statement, which will include the signature of the C.E.O. or C.F.O. They scan the document and print the signature onto the check. It is not likely be scrutinized unless the amount is more than $2,000. \u201cNo human being sees the check \u2014 it goes through a high-speed processor,\u201d Abagnale says. For the last 40 years, he has been a consultant to financial institutions and government agencies, telling them how to combat forgery. Around 17 billion checks, with a value of roughly $27 trillion, were written in 2015, according to the Federal Reserve.Another, more common way to use checks fraudulently is to take over an individual\u2019s account. \u201cLet\u2019s say you gave me a check for $9,\u201d Abagnale says. \u201cAll I would do is go to checksinthemail.com \u2014 they have every style of check you can imagine.\u201d It\u2019s possible for fraudsters to match the style of check they\u2019ve been given \u2014 to duplicate the trees in the background, say \u2014 and then to order with a different name on the check along with the bank account information of the unsuspecting person. When the other person\u2019s bank receives those checks, it will debit that account. The swindler can pay rent and credit-card bills or visit a local check-cashing operation and walk away with thousands of dollars. \u201cIt\u2019s months later that anyone would discover it,\u201d Abagnale says. \u201cAnd the bank is responsible for paying both parties even if the business files a complaint within 30 days.\u201dScammers have long mounted schemes to pressure gullible customers to buy assets, especially penny stocks, with promises of hot tips and inside information. But today, the pump-and-dump playbook is being applied to the new frontier of cryptocurrency. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re seeing in the virtual-currency space is an application of these old schemes to new conduct,\u201d says James McDonald, the director of enforcement for the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. What pump-and-dump schemes need is a thinly traded market where a price swing is easy to manipulate and disproportionately large compared with how little the asset costs. \u201cIf I buy a hundred shares of Apple, that\u2019s not going to move the price,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cBut if there\u2019s a new currency, if I buy a hundred tokens or shares, that could be 50 percent of the trading for that day. If it was trading at 10 cents, that could triple the price or more.\u201dThe scammers begin by investing a large sum in a currency that is relatively unknown. Then they spread misinformation on social media, claiming, say, that a famous investor like Warren Buffett is investing in the currency. They might post false news articles that say it has been granted a line of credit by bank or a company like Mastercard, and then circulate links to the fake news on social media \u2014 spreading the news on Twitter accounts known to promote stocks, for example. It\u2019s a risk if the stories are too appealing. An article claiming that the Fed chairman is endorsing an unknown currency for the Reserve or that the United States is going to use a specific coin will not be believed.Scammers often cultivate an online identity on Twitter or Facebook that becomes known for specializing in recommending currencies or stock picks \u2014 then recommend the one they want to pump up and wait for followers to buy it. \u201cThen you have trading that corroborates the misinformation,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cYou get the false reports, the currency spikes and then it looks believable.\u201d Monitoring the enthusiasm for the currency, they sell when it seems to be at a peak. Because they hold the majority of the currency, its price will plummet once they dump the holdings. \u201cThis can happen in a matter of minutes,\u201d he says.People who want to keep their money away from the tax collector will move it to a foreign country. Those who are rich enough will hardly even have to seek out such a tax haven \u2014 the opportunities will come to them. \u201cWhen you have more than $20 million, then you\u2019re going to start being targeted by these financial institutions \u2014 you will be invited to sporting events like golf or galas,\u201d says Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of \u201cThe Hidden Wealth of Nations.\u201d \u201cThey won\u2019t sell in an aggressive way, but they will talk about legal tax immunization and strategies.\u201dUntil the financial crash in 2008, according to Zucman\u2019s research, Switzerland controlled approximately 50 percent of the \u201coffshore\u201d accounts used by the world\u2019s wealthiest; today that figure is roughly 25 percent. More wealth is now stored in Asia: Singapore and Hong Kong are home to 30 percent of offshore accounts in use, while the rest are in the Caribbean, Panama and Europe.A lawyer or financial adviser can set up a shell corporation. \u201cThere are intermediaries \u2014 law firms that can connect people to banks, and they supply these anonymous shell companies,\u201d Zucman says. Once the shell company is established, it will send an invoice for phony services like investment advice. Payment for these services then goes to the offshore bank account attached to the shell company. The resulting paper trail looks legitimate.Zucman estimates that an amount equivalent to 8 percent of the world\u2019s household financial wealth is held, untaxed, in offshore accounts \u2014 around $8.6 trillion in 2016. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of opacity,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see all this wealth that belongs on paper, and authorities don\u2019t have a good way to pierce this veil of secrecy. They rely on the good will of bankers, which is not sufficient.\u201dAccessing money in an offshore account is as easy as using a debit card from the offshore bank or taking out a loan in the United States against the assets held abroad. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to show up,\u201d Zucman says. \u201cIt can all be done remotely.\u201dEmployees at publicly held companies often possess something quite valuable to outside investors: knowledge about their employers\u2019 prospects beyond what has been issued in news releases. Those who would share \u2014 and perhaps illegally profit from \u2014 this intelligence in order to play the stock market know to circulate among their company\u2019s various departments, says Roomy Khan, a former analyst at Intel who went to prison for passing nonpublic information to Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire founder and former chief of the Galleon Group hedge fund and others.\u201cI was always trying to make connections in the company\u2019s finance department and the marketing chain,\u201d Khan says. \u201cIn sales they know what the bookings are; in marketing they know what people are looking for.\u201d Because Intel controlled nearly 90 percent of the PC market for microchips when she was there, the intelligence gathering she did for Rajaratnam gave him the ability to predict the fortunes of Intel and the entire PC market.When it comes to buying or selling stocks based on those predictions, insider traders must avoid being consistently accurate. Too many on-the-spot and out-of-the-ordinary trades that are correct can raise flags. \u201cThe government spots insider traders,\u201d says Khan, who now gives speeches to companies about the dangers of insider trading. The feds aren\u2019t the only ones monitoring unusual trades. Companies can get in trouble if they have too many leaks, and so can investment funds if they act on them, so both types of businesses are looking out for suspicious activity.Social and professional circles can be used to draw out information from anyone willing to share secret details of products or strategies. \u201cLet\u2019s say Samsung was having battery issues, and if my friend said something about the issues, I would start probing him. I know what the market is looking for,\u201d Khan says. \u201cI would ask more and more detailed questions.\u201d Manipulation is the key to gaining confidential information, but insider traders try to be casual and friendly; people are more easily persuaded to share if they are made to feel powerful, wanted and included in the upper echelons of financial society. Khan says: \u201cI used my lifestyle, my success, the trappings of success.\u201dIllegal enterprises seek every possible way to get their cash back into circulation. To launder this dirty money in the United States requires them to \u201cstructure\u201d their deposits of ill-gotten cash. Banks are required to report transactions involving $10,000 or more in cash, so their deposits need to be much smaller than that. \u201cCriminals understand that U.S. banking laws have become a lot stricter in the last several years,\u201d says Adam Braverman, United States attorney for the Southern District of California. \u201cThey used to deposit $9,999 in 10 or 20 different banks. Now we look for those suspicious activities.\u201d Would-be launderers try to avoid triggering the software banks use to maintain anti-money-laundering controls by varying their deposits by amount, location \u2014 both geographically and institutionally \u2014 and even timing.Prepaid debit cards like Green Dot offer more anonymous (and less labor-intensive) means of working dirty money into the system. \u201cA new way organizations launder money is by purchasing gift cards or debit cards that they can resell and transfer money easily,\u201d Braverman says. Because anyone can buy such cards at a drugstore, for example, they\u2019re harder to trace than bank deposits, which require accounts. Purchasers still need to limit how much they put on debit cards to less than $10,000.If launderers want to do things the old-fashioned way, they can smuggle cash across a border. It\u2019s best to vacuum-seal it or pack it with plastic wrap to reduce the bulk \u2014 a million dollars can take up a lot of space \u2014 and hire a courier to transport it in duffel bags to a country with lax banking laws. Once the money is in, say, a South American location where that\u2019s the case, dollars can be exchanged for the local currency at a casa de cambio.The United Nations estimates that up to $1.6 trillion is laundered annually worldwide. Pop culture would have us believe that cash-driven businesses like strip clubs, car washes and casinos are the best places to clean up money. Dealing with the burden of running a legitimate business and paying actual taxes is anything but easy money.It\u2019s pricey, it\u2019s portable, its users need it constantly, and retailers love to buy it at a discount. All of which makes it a perfect product to steal.Insys Therapeutics paid millions of dollars to doctors. The company called it a \u201cspeaker program,\u201d but prosecutors now call it something else: a kickback scheme.In 2016, a mysterious syndicate tried to steal $951 million from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank - and laid bare a profound weakness in the system by which money moves around the world.When the Iowa attorney general\u2019s office began investigating an unclaimed lottery ticket worth millions, an incredible string of unlikely winners came to light - and a trail that pointed to an inside job.How the biggest scammers get away with it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tiny Brains of Extinct Human Relative Had Complex Features", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat makes humans so smart? For a long time the answer was simple: our big brains. Not every scientist agrees with their interpretation.Since its remains were first retrieved, Homo naledi has puzzled scientists. From head to toe the ancient hominin displays a medley of primitive, apelike features and more advanced, humanlike characteristics.\u201cIt\u2019s this mosaic that is unlike anything we have seen or expected,\u201d said Dr. Berger who first discovered Homo naledi in the Dinaledi Chamber in South Africa\u2019s Rising Star cave system. So far, researchers have found more than 2,000 fossils belonging to the human relatives which have provided a portrait of what the species once looked like. Now, researchers have found that Homo naledi\u2019s similarities with modern humans extend into the brain. After examining the imprints, or endocasts, from five Homo naledi skull fragments, the team found that the species had a frontal lobe that was very similar to that of modern humans and unlike that of an ape\u2019s. The scientists also found that Homo naledi had an asymmetrical brain, with the left brain appearing more forward than the right, which is also seen in humans. Asymmetry in the brain is associated with higher levels of behavioral complexity, the team said. \u201cIs that aspect of the brain evolution central to talking or stone tool making? We don\u2019t know enough to say that,\u201d he said. He added that the finding does not mean that brain size is not important to creating a complex brain \u2014 it is. Rather, size alone does not tell the whole story. \u201cThere\u2019s something about shape that actually matters too,\u201d he said.Dr. Bruner agreed.\u201cIt is not reasonable to forget all that evidence because of a couple of outliers,\u201d he said. \u201cExceptions are, as always, expected.

{"Headline": "Dear Movie Industry, We Have Thoughts", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery so often, our chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott, fire off a number of thoughtful memos to the movie industry and the industry-adjacent. These messages are largely ignored, which does not stop Ms. Dargis and Mr. Scott from continuing this semi-serious tradition. Given the new summer season and how deeply fraught the past year has been \u2014 Harvey Weinstein, Netflix, #MeToo, #oscarsalittlelesswhitebutnotmuch \u2014 it was time for our critics to weigh in again with their thoughts (and complaints).No pressure, but you\u2019re all we\u2019ve got right now. Don\u2019t mess it up.[Ms. Dargis has decided to remain quiet on this subject in favor of her more temperate colleague.]What are you watching? Nobody knows! The streaming service doesn\u2019t share its numbers. But many of us love it anyway, just like we loved getting those DVDs in the mail. There is so much good stuff in the queue, all available for home viewing. Original movies and TV shows and much more besides, though it isn\u2019t always easy to find.Every distributor of content, including movie studios and this newspaper, seeks to monetize a share of human attention. The tech giants, whose ranks Netflix aspires to join, want something more like a monopoly, to be the conduit for as much of our experience as they can.At the moment, the terms of the bargain look attractive, and the complaints trivial. Netflix is throwing money at creative people (Chris Rock and Shonda Rhimes) and cool movies (\u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories\u201d and \u201cMudbound\u201d) and turning our queues into cornucopias. What we get is endless choice and stupefying abundance. We might risk losing something of greater value, though. An infinite archive and a perfect algorithm don\u2019t add up to a culture.So \u2026 subtitles. Apparently you are not a fan, as we know from \u201cIsle of Dogs,\u201d a fantasy you far too carelessly set in Japan. You were sharply criticized for your representation of Japanese people and culture, which is, you know, understandable given that its canine heroes all speak in cute English while much of what the Japanese human characters say remains untranslated. You\u2019ve said that \u201csubtitles didn\u2019t seem that fun\u201d and that \u201cwhen you\u2019re reading subtitles, you\u2019re really focused on the subtitles all through the movie and you don\u2019t listen to the language as much.\u201d I assume that you didn\u2019t want subtitles messing with your beautiful, meticulously designed visuals \u2014 but come on!First of all, you have my gratitude and admiration for breathing life into the fainting corpse of adventurous, independent, democratic American cinema. The movie world is better for \u201cMoonlight,\u201d \u201cThe Florida Project\u201d and \u201cLady Bird\u201d and for the genre experiments and argument starters that have filled out your slate since \u201cSpring Breakers\u201d put you on the map in 2013.Your movies play in festivals alongside a lot of interesting films from other countries, films that have an increasingly hard time finding traction in the American marketplace, in theaters or on streaming platforms. Maybe you could use some of your money to acquire a few, and your marketing savvy to connect them with the audience you have already cultivated, which is young, worldly and curious. And also capable of reading subtitles.More than six months later, female activists, like those in Time\u2019s Up, are admirably working for real change. But as Sun Tzu or perhaps Angelina Jolie once said, the only thing that power understands is greater power, which in the industry often means money. But there are different forms of power, including that of self-determination. Actresses turned producer-directors like Lois Weber who worked in early cinema understood that and so did Ida Lupino back in the 1950s. So it\u2019s heartening to see performers like Ms. Jolie, Charlize Theron, Eva Longoria, Rachel Weisz and Alia Shawkat help bring female-driven stories onto the screen. More, please.Please read some history. About the Salem witch trials, the Spanish Inquisition, the martyrdom of early Christians, Joseph McCarthy, Joseph Stalin, the Gestapo, Pol Pot and any of the other historical monsters and catastrophes you like to invoke when talking about whatever is bothering you in contemporary culture. Also please refrain from hyperbolically throwing around words like \u201csilencing,\u201d \u201cthought police\u201d and \u201ccensorship\u201d in reference to criticism on social media or elsewhere. People who indulge in this kind of rhetorical inflation are like rats spreading bubonic plague.What, exactly, is so complicated about dealing with discrimination and harassment?You are perhaps at this moment breathing a sigh of relief, crawling out from under your desk and looking forward to getting back to business as usual. The daily barrage of news reports about bad men in your industry (and many others) seems to have subsided, and in some circles the talk has even turned to redemption. It\u2019s comeback time! Not in every case, of course, but if Harvey Weinstein ends up being the guy who takes the fall for everyone else, you won\u2019t mind. You never much liked him anyway (even if you used to tell anyone in earshot what good friends you were).As for you: Your harassment never reached the level of assault; your flirting and touching wasn\u2019t really harassment; your general contempt for women doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not one of the good guys. If your first two wives won\u2019t vouch for you, the third one surely will. And for whatever reason, you were spared. You\u2019ve picked up a new vocabulary \u2014 \u201creckoning,\u201d \u201crespect,\u201d \u201cinconsistent with our values\u201d \u2014 and adjusted your behavior a bit, mostly by making self-conscious jokes about being a white man and loudly professing admiration for the strength and bravery of certain actresses. You sometimes worry that the whole #MeToo thing might be going too far, but your own position seems secure. Your #time, by golly, is not yet #up.Keep telling yourself that.Advertisement"}

Still others live in temperate climates (all of you with lemon trees, you know who you are).The rest of us have to wait for those softly balmy nights that make going inside seem like a defeat, those evenings when grilling a steak and eating it on the deck is the sweetest reward for a punishing winter.A grilled steak salad, with charred onions and plenty of greens, is made for those summer nights. It\u2019s the kind of recipe you can vary endlessly, always falling back on the time-honored combination of juicy beef and leafy greens, with a piquant citrusy dressing to pull it all together.In this version, a flank steak is marinated in a mix of ancho chile for heat, brown sugar for caramelization, and dried oregano and toasted sesame oil for complexity. The result is sweet, spicy and a little smoky from the grill.A lean cut, flank steak can dry out if overcooked. Grill it rare, and slice it thinly against the grain. This will give you tender meat with plenty of juices that will puddle as you carve. Be sure to pour those beefy juices into the salad dressing for even more depth \u2014 they add a lot of flavor.With any steak salad, the vegetables should be a cooling, lighter element next to the meat. Here, I particularly like the way spicy lettuces (arugula, watercress, baby kale and the like) contrast with the marinade\u2019s sweetness. For textural diversity, I also toss in some radishes and avocado.As the summer progresses, you can replace the vegetables with others coming into season \u2014 just as long as you have a combination of greens and crunchy add-ons (cucumber, slivered bell peppers, jicama, fennel, baby turnips, carrot, raw corn kernels) to keep things balanced.Last but not at all least are the charred onions. Blackened on the outside, compote-like on the inside, they are wonderfully concentrated and silky-soft on the tongue. When eggplants and peppers start appearing in August, you can char those instead; they\u2019ll add the same kind of richness to the plate.Open a bottle of ros\u00e9 or a chilled light red, and breathe a sigh of relief.

McAdam of Verizon, according to people familiar with the discussions but not authorized to speak publicly.The lawsuit was pre-emptive, given that Ms. Redstone has considered replacing CBS\u2019s board if it continued to resist a merger with Viacom. CBS has wanted Les Moonves to become the combined company\u2019s C.E.O. and his C.O.O., Joe Ianniello, to take the No. 2 position. Viacom has pressed for its C.E.O., Bob Bakish, to hold that spot, and Ms. Redstone had largely sided with Viacom.CBS added that its board believes it is acting out of a fiduciary duty to all of its shareholders, and not just Ms. Redstone.\u2014 Michael de la MercedAfter CBS essentially declared war against its controlling shareholder and her desire to combine the company with Viacom, Ms. Redstone dropped a bombshell of her own.From a statement by National Amusements, the vehicle through which the Redstones control CBS and Viacom:NAI believes CBS\u2019s action today was precipitated following NAI raising specific concerns about incidents of bullying and intimidation in relation to one CBS director, dating back to 2016. NAI has made every effort to deal with this matter privately and confidentially. Unfortunately, CBS\u2019s action today continues to enable and empower such conduct.In meetings and informal discussions during the week of May 7, 2018 and continuing over the weekend of May 11\u201313, 2018, the CBS Special Committee finally determined that a CBS/Viacom merger is not in the best interests of CBS stockholders (other than NAI).CBS asserted that it filed suit because it was worried about Ms. Redstone blocking a meeting of the special committee taking place on Thursday. At the meeting, the committee is set to consider issuing a special dividend to all shareholders that could effectively neuter Ms. Redstone\u2019s 79 percent voting stake in the media company.National Amusement also said that CBS and Viacom had even reached a provisional agreement on valuation. Viacom\u2019s investors would receive 0.6135 CBS shares for each Viacom share they own, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations. The valuation marked a compromise for both sides and is a sign that CBS had previously supported exploring a merger of the two companies.Symantec, a cybersecurity software company, on Monday released details about an internal investigation that arose from concerns of a former employee.Symantec announced the investigation late on Thursday but provided scant details.

The proceedings will not be televised. A spokesman for Mr. Tajani said lawmakers in attendance will be able to speak freely about it, and a verbatim transcript of the meeting will be released afterward.The format of the meeting was the result of weeks of tense negotiations between Mr. Tajani\u2019s office and Facebook, according to Pedro L\u00f3pez de Pablo, a spokesman for the European People\u2019s Party, the biggest party in parliament, which endorsed Mr. Tajani\u2019s proposed format.Still, one European lawmaker who was invited to the meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg said he would not attend if it was not made public. \u201cIt must be a public hearing \u2014 why not a Facebook Live?\u201d said Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of a liberal group in the European Parliament.The prospect of Mr. Zuckerberg publicly testifying before the European Parliament would have raised the profile of an institution whose 751 members rarely make international headlines. The body does not directly regulate Facebook or other technology companies.Yet Europe has won a reputation in recent years as the technology industry\u2019s toughest watchdog. Officials in the region have investigated Facebook for the improper handling of customer data, fined Amazon and other companies over their tax practices and penalized firms like Google for antitrust violations.\u201cIt shows Zuckerberg really is worried about the effects of regulation and the potential for more,\u201d said Michael Carrier, a law professor at Rutgers University who focuses on antitrust issues and intellectual property law. Mr. Carrier added that the trip demonstrated the leading role Europe plays in regulating the tech sector.Most concerning for Mr. Zuckerberg and others in Silicon Valley, Mr. Carrier said, was a broader skepticism of the industry. \u201cBig tech is under the public microscope from the left and the right,\u201d he said.Facebook has also announced new privacy and security settings that give people more control over their data.

{"Headline": "The 7 Greatest Packaged Frozen Treats, Ranked", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTejal Rao scoured the bottom of the freezer case to come up with this list of her favorite prefabricated pleasures.I tasted more than 40 individually wrapped bars, bought with cash from the noisy, off-key ice cream trucks that circle my block, as well as the bodegas in my Brooklyn neighborhood. I was looking for big, summery flavors; satisfying, nostalgic textures; and the kind of general resilience that is necessary for a single frozen treat to thrive in a packed chest freezer. I went for everything \u2014 novelty character pops, classic sandwiches, ice cream bars co-branded with candy bars.I tried not to hold it against them, but some had suffered in transportation, or in the fluctuating temperatures of a chest freezer on the fritz. If you\u2019ve ever unwrapped one of Popsicle\u2019s SpongeBob SquarePants bars after it has melted a little, then refrozen \u2014 its droopy grin no longer recognizable, its gumball eyes sunken deeper into its hideous face \u2014 then you know what I mean. These are simply the daily trials of a frozen treat in a New York summer, and these are the ones I liked best.Strawberry season may be an ephemeral joy, but the season for strawberry shortcake bars never, ever ends. The Barbie-convertible shade of pink doesn\u2019t fade. The specific, candied tang of artificial fruit is elegantly coded into its soft cake crumbs. This is a grotesque and strategically layered delight (not technically ice cream \u2014 rather, a \u201cdessert bar\u201d). But it can be surprisingly delicate when it\u2019s unwrapped, meets the heat outside and turns distressingly floppy and gelatinous. The only way to avoid this: Eat fast.The flavors are cherry, lemon and raspberry. The colors are red, white and blue. These three pleasantly sour ices, all stacked on one narrow stick, make up a classic cheap thrill that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. On the hottest days of the year, even those averse to high-fructose corn syrup and food coloring should let a freezer-burned Firecracker into their lives, if only for the joy of sticking out a blue- and red-stained tongue and reading the terrible joke on the stick out loud.There\u2019s a beautiful ritual to opening up a single, individually wrapped cone \u2014 first you crinkle up the top edge so you can peel away the thick paper disc that protects the ridged ice cream top without damaging it, then carefully unfurl the paper that protects the sides of the cone. The smell of frozen peanuts hits you first, then the ice cream that tastes suspiciously like cold butter, intricately swirled with crisp, waxy chocolate. The best part is the ritual\u2019s finish: a final bite of the crisp cone\u2019s tip, filled with the tiny wedge of chocolate that kept you safe from melting drips all along.Unlike many of the classic ice cream bars on wooden sticks, with their thick, armorlike chocolate layers that crack apart in giant pieces and slide to the ground, Klondike (no stick) has mastered a fine, delicate outer layer that almost seems to shatter against your teeth and cling to the filling. Of course, you always want to try and grab one that hasn\u2019t been crushed or handled, and unwrap it with care, for the pleasure of breaking that shell. Inside, the mint chocolate flavor is clean, chemical and bright, creating the illusion of being colder than it is, and the ice cream is light, with an almost frothy, foamy quality.The ice cream in this perfect sandwich is impossibly airy, dissolving with immediacy in your mouth like a frozen, vanilla-perfumed breeze. I don\u2019t usually mean this as a compliment, but it\u2019s so insubstantial, it\u2019s like eating nothing at all. The cookies are thin, soft, sticking a little to your fingers and the roof of your mouth, and sometimes a little sweaty from extended stretches of time at the bottom of the freezer. But somehow it never matters how much time has gone by: This is an exemplary ice cream sandwich.It\u2019s not quite ice cream, but then again it\u2019s so much creamier than an ice pop. The Fudgsicle is a singular treat with all the sugary sweet, whisper-soft chocolate flavors of industrial chocolate milk (rather than actual chocolate, or actual milk). This is, of course, delicious. And as a bonus, it always seems to melt at a rate you can keep up with.At a glance, the Chipwich doesn\u2019t seem like anything special: two chocolate chip cookies sandwiching a fat layer of vanilla ice cream, edged with small, crunchy chocolate chips. But like every great sandwich, it\u2019s constructed with great attention to proportion and texture. In fact, the Chipwich is perfectly built. Right out of the freezer, this sandwich has an ideal softness all the way through (just part of what makes it better than so many of the fancier imitations). The cookie is frozen but completely tender \u2014 exactly as tender as the ice cream itself. This means that when you bite in, everything yields easily, at the same pace, and nothing is squished out. It\u2019s this, in addition to the treat\u2019s mellow, comforting flavors and the dense creaminess of its ice cream, that makes the Chipwich such a great and reliable pleasure.Advertisement"}

At times, in the West Village, it seemed like every door and window that could be opened, was.By midafternoon, some New Yorkers, perhaps not yet accustomed to the heat, began to get sluggish, and we spotted people dozing off in every park and pedestrian plaza we passed.Even the uneven boulders of Central Park became an irresistible nesting ground.That\u2019s where we found Edgar Clausse, 37, an artist who was killing time before a dance audition at the Metropolitan Opera.We gently roused Mr. Clausse from his sleep to ask him a pressing question about the weather. Like many New Yorkers we spoke to, he was too warm and relaxed to put up hardened city slicker vibes.\u201cThis is excellent, I\u2019m just crashing into the sky,\u201d he said. \u201cNapping, man.\u201dBefore long, we noticed workers returning, hazy-eyed, to their air-conditioned offices. At least they\u2019ll get to do it all again today.Prepare for another sunny day, with highs in the mid-80s. The heat has settled in until the weekend, which looks cooler, though stunning as well.Here\u2019s what else is happening:News flash: Not everyone is enjoying this warm weather.Whenever we gleefully write about these temperate days, some of our readers write in, wag their fingers and remind us that not everyone shares our taste in mild weather.We recently asked them why.\u201cAbsolutely I prefer colder temps. I\u2019m \u2018blessed\u2019 with a thick \u2014 O.K., fat \u2014 neck, and wearing turtlenecks just makes me feel better, like I\u2019m hiding something.\u201d\u2014 Thom Wise, 64, West New York, N.J.\u201cWhen the weather suddenly gets warm like it will this week, New York buildings rarely make the adjustment from heating to cooling in time, which means every interior is stiflingly hot and miserable and my skin itches from the sudden change. I feel drained, bloated, greasy. Plus when the city heats up, all the unpleasant smells, like garbage, urine and body odor, emerge to slap you in the face.\u201d\u2014 Lenge Hong, 51, East Village\u201cEveryone looks and feels better in layers. Scarves, hats, boots? Wonderful. But sweat marks, frizzy hair, damp subway seats after booty shorts? Horrible.\u201d\u2014 Gregory Gallagher, 31, Bushwick, Brooklyn\u201cThere\u2019s just something really cozy about adverse weather. The worse the storm, the better. I travel a lot for work, but if I can get away with it, sometimes I\u2019ll actually fly back early so I can be home for a storm.\u201d\u2014 Ryan Matzner, 33, Williamsburg, Brooklyn\u201cWhen you\u2019re cold it\u2019s easy to heat up, but when you\u2019re hot there\u2019s not a thing you can do to stop the feeling that you might possibly be dying. I think that even if New York were a city of nudists, the temperature would be miserable, but in the winter, well, there\u2019s no such thing as bad weather \u2014 just bad clothing.\u201d\u2014 Anna Van Dine, 20, East Village\u201cTeam Winter here. It\u2019s not that a temperate day is bad, it\u2019s that cold is exciting. It\u2019s that the world during a snowstorm is smaller, quieter, softer. It\u2019s that winter is a challenge to be overcome. It\u2019s that the world is getting warmer, and summer is a constant reminder of our own imminent, self-made destruction.\u201d\u2014 Spike McCue, 32, Greenpoint, BrooklynAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Golden Betting Slips for the Golden Knights", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Behind steady play from goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, the Vegas Golden Knights notched victories in their first three regular-season games and created a believer in John Lytle.Lytle strolled over to the sports book at Texas Station Gambling Hall & Hotel in North Las Vegas to make a futures bet that the new N.H.L. franchise would capture the Stanley Cup in its inaugural season. When Lytle, an Air Force veteran who served in Iraq, posted his $100 ticket on Instagram, a few of his friends purchased their own, locking in odds as high as 200-1.Lytle is among a contingent of Las Vegas residents in line for a massive payday if the Golden Knights prevail in the best-of-seven series against the Washington Capitals. The series is tied, 1-1, with Game 3 on Saturday in Washington.While the winnings will not be the windfall the soccer club Leicester City delivered to fans who got 5,000-1 odds on the middling club winning the Premier League two years ago, the money will be nothing to sneeze at.Lytle, a rising senior at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has plans to use the $20,000 in potential winnings to pay for a portion of his law school tuition.Across the area, bettors on the Golden Knights include nonhockey fans who purchased $5 futures bets to commemorate the team\u2019s inaugural season and sophisticated bettors who employed complex arbitrage strategies in search of a healthy profit. At William Hill, one of the largest sports books in Nevada, there are 350 outstanding bets on Vegas to win the Stanley Cup at 100-1 or higher.Lytle has had numerous opportunities to hedge his bet throughout the N.H.L. playoffs, but in a nod to the team he is opting to let it ride.\u201cI ride with my city the whole way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll either raise that Cup and have a parade from downtown to the Strip, or we will bow our heads and get them next year.\u201dOthers are not taking the chance. Hermin Soriano, a food server at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, placed a $300 wager on the Knights at 100-1 and a $100 bet on a mobile betting platform at the same odds in October.Last month, while on vacation in the South Pacific, he boarded a flight as the Knights took an early lead in Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals against the San Jose Sharks. Shortly after arriving in the Philippines, Solario thought the Knights took a 2-0 series lead on a double-overtime score by Jonathan Marchessault, only to see the goal disallowed on a goaltender interference call.\u201cI had a bad feeling about it; the next thing I knew the Sharks won the game,\u201d Soriano said. \u201cIt was nail-biting.\u201dUnwilling to lose the bet on a fluke call, Soriano promised his wife that he would hedge the wager if the local team advanced to the finals. Through PropSwap.com, an online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of sports bets, Solario completed the sale on May 22. The buyer, Brad Feinberg, a real estate investor from Bryn Mawr, Pa., spent $12,600 for a chance to win $30,300.Soriano plans to use the money to celebrate his wedding anniversary next month in Paris.\u201cThat really makes me smile; I hope he has an amazing time,\u201d Feinberg said.Another bettor could use his winnings when he backpacks through Europe this summer. Joe Ellis, a recent graduate of San Diego State, split a $100 wager with two roommates last fall, at odds of 150-1. An avid surfer, Ellis has tentative plans to go to Portugal\u2019s famed Nazar\u00e9 Beach on the trek.Some tourists holding Knights tickets will gladly return to Sin City to collect their winnings. Last fall, Adam Vosding, a commercial property manager from Tampa, Fla., booked a last-minute flight to Las Vegas to spend the weekend with a friend. While making a futures bet on his beloved Lightning at William Hill, Vosding noticed what he considered a good price on the Knights at 200-1. He placed $100 on both.Vosding cheered for both teams during the conference finals, posting a hockey card of Vegas Coach Gerard Gallant in a Lightning uniform on his Facebook page. Vosding plans to use some of his winnings to expand his food blog, Traveling Food Dude.Vasilios Pangalidis, a restaurant owner in Macomb Township, Mich., is an ardent sports bettor, and frequents Las Vegas often enough to consider it a second home.Should Washington win the series, Pangalidis will collect around $8,200, roughly $3,000 more than he will take home if the Knights complete the storybook ending.\u201cMy wallet might be pulling for Washington, but my heart is with Las Vegas,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

My husband and I would be thrilled if they married. She grew up in a country where people lick their knives during meals. Although she\u2019s lived here for a decade, she still does this regularly. I\u2019ve never raised the issue with our son; I want to be supportive. But if they marry and have children, their kids will likely pick up this habit from Mom. Our extended families might find fault, as would their children\u2019s friends. How may I broach the subject with this lovely person?ANNESo, this is about the imaginary friends of children yet to be conceived? (Color me skeptical!) The best-mannered people (somehow) manage to observe differences among us without judgment or comment. This woman is not your child or mate, to whom you bear some responsibility. Nor do you seem to be her mentor, in which case, we might grapple with whether this knife licking is holding her back. She has simply kept a custom from home. Melting pots are like that: better for chunky stews than silky pur\u00e9es. If she and your son marry and produce offspring, you will be entitled to express grandparental concern about sharp objects in tiny mouths. But that\u2019s a problem for a far-off day. You\u2019ve done very well to keep quiet about cutlery to date, and I encourage you to keep it up. A supportive mother-in-law trumps a Westernizing etiquette coach every day of the week.I was at a memorial service, and the woman next to me was on her phone, texting and browsing the internet. She didn\u2019t seem to be dealing with an emergency, just checking her phone every few minutes when she got bored. I considered saying something to her after the service, to educate her politely that using a cellphone, while bereaved children were speaking of their departed parent, was out of line. Should I have?LIZLadies and gentlemen, a new low: scrolling away at a memorial service! But there\u2019s a funny thing about us adults, Liz. We don\u2019t much care for being \u201ceducated\u201d about our behavior by others. Better simply to lean in and whisper: \u201cYour phone is distracting. Could you put it away, please?\u201d That way, she can accommodate your reasonable request \u2014 or not. But you are much less likely to suffer the defensive fury I receive three out of 10 times I ask people to stop texting at the movies. (I know memorial services are different from multiplexes. I\u2019m just telling you what I\u2019ve observed.)I am a college senior in Chicago. Over the past two years, I have embraced my lesbian identity. My parents don\u2019t know yet. We don\u2019t discuss my dating life, though I have told them about boyfriends in the past. I know I need to come out to them, but they live in California, and I only see them a couple of times a year. I expect them to be supportive, but I don\u2019t want to rob them of any private time they need to deal with this news. Can I tell them over the phone? Is it selfish to tell them on a major holiday?A.M.F.I respect your sensitivity to your parents\u2019 (possible) need for processing time. But let me caution you that coming out is not often a \u201cone and done\u201d transaction with parents. You\u2019ve had a couple of years to get comfortable with your sexuality. (I\u2019m happy for you.) But your parents may have a range of feelings to express over time. Have the initial conversation in person, if possible. It\u2019s kinder to them to put the daughter they love within arms\u2019 reach. As for timing, if major holidays are what you\u2019ve got, then major holidays are what they get. But try the day after Thanksgiving or Christmas, not the evening before. Coming out can take up a lot of emotional space; a short delay may avoid dominating the entire holiday. I\u2019m heartened by your prediction of a loving response. Get back in touch if it\u2019s even slightly hairier than you expect, O.K.? I gave my 10-year-old niece a book for her birthday: \u201cLittle House in the Big Woods,\u201d by Laura Ingalls Wilder. It was a childhood favorite (and much better than the mediocre TV series). So far, she hasn\u2019t mentioned reading it, nor have I seen it among her possessions. Perhaps her parents banned it, based on the TV series. Should I ask how she liked it?ANONYMOUSThanks for making me feel super-lowbrow for loving the Michael Landon TV show. (\u201cPa! Pa!\u201d) There\u2019s a difference between a book report and a birthday present: Your niece may read the book when she likes, but she\u2019s not required to. I don\u2019t know her parents, but it seems extreme to ban Laura Ingalls Wilder from the house. We all have our childhood favorites, but I\u2019d let this one slide.

{"Headline": "Napping While Black (and Other Transgressions)", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Mzezewa is a staff editor for the Opinion section.Early Tuesday morning, Lolade Siyonbola, a graduate student at Yale, fell asleep in her dorm\u2019s common room, where she\u2019d been working on a paper. At around 1:30 a.m. she was awakened when a white student turned on the lights and said, according to Ms. Siyonbola: \u201cIs there someone in here? Is there someone sleeping in here? You\u2019re not supposed to be here.\u201d The student, Sarah Braasch, then called the campus police.\u201cYou\u2019re in a Yale building and we need to make sure that you belong here,\u201d one of the officers said to Ms. Siyonbola, in a 15-minute exchange she videotaped and posted to Facebook.After Ms. Siyonbola used her key to open the door to her room, the police still doubted that she belonged there and asked to see her ID.The message here is clear: Black and brown people seem out of place to some people when they encounter them in institutions of higher learning. Never mind that Ms. Siyonbola is earning a master\u2019s degree in African studies, that she founded the Yoruba Cultural Institute in Brooklyn and that she is the author of a book about African history and diaspora migration. To her fellow student, she seemed like an interloper.I know what that feels like.I was thrilled to be on my own for the first time. I embraced what made Rome so different from the suburbs of Washington, where I\u2019d grown up. (I\u2019d never heard of an Aperol Spritz, let alone tried one.)But even thousands of miles from home, one constant remained: I was constantly made aware of the color of my skin.I was regularly asked if I was a prostitute in broad daylight, asked how much I cost while walking to class. I was pushed off a bus twice by angry old men. I was spat at. I was once locked in a taxi and propositioned by the driver. I got out only when I started to scream and hit the windows.While subletting an apartment for a summer, the landlord came to pick up the rent money (this is common in Italy), and instead of just taking the money and giving me a receipt, he said I could keep my money if I just \u201chad a little fun\u201d with him. I declined, threw the money on the table and left the apartment. When I told the white student that I\u2019d sublet the apartment from, she was skeptical and said she had never had any problems with the man.In this environment, the campus, its supportive professors and the group of friends I found became a haven. But on a few occasions, it felt like the nastiness outside the school found its way in.My junior year, I took a rigorous course that nearly everyone dropped after the first week. One day, the professor asked me a question and my response fell short. He laughed. I later learned he had posted about the response on his Facebook account, calling out students who ask silly questions. The same professor later told me he was \u201csurprised\u201d I got into Columbia Journalism School.A few weeks after I received that message, a different professor accused me of plagiarizing a history paper. I showed him my sources; it was clear I hadn\u2019t done so.I loved school and wanted to shrug off these experiences. But while I could chalk up the hostility on the street to Italian culture, in the classroom, I was surrounded by Americans. And the truth is that my white friends weren\u2019t being questioned about the validity of their work or asked to prove that they deserved to be there.But I never said anything. I didn\u2019t want to seem paranoid or overly sensitive. Most of all \u2014 amazingly \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to make them feel uncomfortable.I remember one day during my senior year a staff member whom I had worked with several times over three years asked me how my family was \u201cholding up with the war and all.\u201d I was confused. My family is from Zimbabwe, but there was no war. I realized she had confused me with my friend and classmate who was South Sudanese. \u201cThey\u2019re fine,\u201d I told her, unsure of how to correct her and unwilling to take the time. My classmate was often mistaken for being me. We were the only black women in our class.As a senior I became frustrated that the security guards asked for my ID every time I entered one of the campuses. That was the policy, sure, but they didn\u2019t hold other students to the same standard. Others came and went without flashing theirs, yet I always had to show mine. I later heard from other students of color that this was a common experience.After graduation, I moved to New York to attend Columbia Journalism School. There, a career counselor told me not to bother applying to Reuters, The Washington Post or The New York Times, even for internships. When I asked why, she told me I was too young and inexperienced, and it just wasn\u2019t realistic.I ignored her. I applied to that internship at Reuters. I got it.She couldn\u2019t imagine me there. But I knew I belonged.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Evangelical Journalist Finds His Calling at the White House", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "David Brody has unusual access to the president. In return, Mr. Trump gets a direct line to the evangelical audience he depends on.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was the morning after another breathtaking revelation about President Trump and a $130,000 payment to a pornographic film actress, and dozens of reporters crowded into the White House Rose Garden, seeking answers. When one of them shouted a question about the payment, the president simply walked away.Standing nearby, on a ceremonial balcony overlooking the West Wing, was another reporter, David Brody, waiting for a private interview with Vice President Mike Pence.Mr. Pence smiled and answered each question. Then he invited Mr. Brody to get coffee.\u201cThe access has been phenomenal,\u201d Mr. Brody said later in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m very appreciative to God for allowing it.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump attacks major news organizations and suggests revoking media credentials for outlets he deems \u201cFake News,\u201d Mr. Brody and his network enjoy a closeness to the White House that is foreign to most reporters. In return, Mr. Trump gets a direct line to his most supportive voters, the conservative evangelicals who make up CBN\u2019s core audience. Their allegiance is critical to his success; more than 80 percent of white evangelicals who went to the polls in 2016 voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cWhat you are seeing in the White House is base-tending,\u201d said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, co-founder of FactCheck.org and a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania.Viewers of Christian media, she added, are often presented with more favorable information about Mr. Trump than they would find in the mainstream media. \u201cIt is agenda control,\u201d Ms. Jamieson said.That criticism frustrates Mr. Brody. He points to interviews he has done with Democrats, including Barack Obama. \u201cI never personally make the case for Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, I will say, \u2018this is why evangelicals love him.\u2019 \u201dBut Mr. Brody, an evangelical himself, acknowledges that his network has achieved a loftier status under Mr. Trump. Last year, network executives erupted in cheers when Sean Spicer, the president\u2019s former press secretary, called on their correspondent in his first news conference. Mr. Brody is now at the White House several times a week. And he was invited to an exclusive annual luncheon with the president, along with anchors from major news outlets, for the first time last year.For the White House, this strategy has been intentional.\u201cIt is a great platform,\u201d Mr. Spicer said in an interview. \u201cCBN in particular has a very large audience that was very active in the election. A lot of those issues are not represented by Washington elite media folks.\u201dMr. Brody\u2019s role as a conduit between Mr. Trump and his evangelical base is growing as the midterm elections approach. His new book, \u201cThe Faith of Donald J. Trump,\u201d written with Scott Lamb, a vice-president of Liberty University, outlines what he calls the president\u2019s spiritual biography in more than 300 pages.Mr. Brody and his co-host, Jenna Browder, plan to act as moderators for parts of the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s Road to Majority Conference, which brings together politicians and leaders of the religious right in early June. The two have also met with Ivanka Trump to talk about following her on the road as part of their midterm coverage, Ms. Browder said.Mr. Brody\u2019s position and his audience make him an unusual voice in Washington and a counter to what he calls the \u201cliberal mainstream media.\u2019\u2019\u201cThe media\u2019s version of tough questions and my version of tough questions are different, based on the audience we serve,\u201d he said. \u201cOur audience isn\u2019t going to want me to really ask about Russia or Stormy Daniels. They are just not going to want me to ask.\u201dMost Washington newsrooms are pressure cookers. But inside the Christian Broadcast Network\u2019s news bureau, a short walk from the White House, the atmosphere is more relaxed, even familial. Mr. Brody, 53, is clearly the star, but it is impossible to imagine him ever barking an order.Instead, he is more like the newsroom dad, always ready with advice or a cheesy aside. Younger reporters recite some of his mantras, like \u201cYou get more with honey than vinegar.\u201d On the National Day of Prayer, staff members were joking that the day was their Super Bowl.Mr. Brody grew more serious as he sat down on his set to talk about his job. His calling, he said, is to be \u201ca megaphone for God\u2019s truth.\u201d\u201cI report the news and I analyze the news based on what evangelicals are saying and thinking out there in the heartland,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a hybrid, for sure, but it is definitely more analysis.\u201dCBN News devotes itself to \u201cnews through a biblical worldview,\u201d he explained, and his top three areas of coverage are Israel, abortion, and religious freedom. These days, he said, he is praying more than ever.Compared to giants like CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, CBN\u2019s news division is tiny. It has an annual budget of only $10 million, a staff of 70 and a website that gets just 1.5 million unique visitors a month. The network would not provide television audience numbers, and Nielsen does not track them.Its power derives from the spiritual capital the network has built for more than half a century in evangelical homes across America. Just 15 percent of white evangelicals say they have a lot of trust in national news organizations, according to the Pew Research Center, but they are nearly twice as likely to trust news they hear from friends and family.Mr. Brody and Ms. Browder started a weekly program last year \u2014 primarily airing on Facebook \u2014 called \u201cFaith Nation,\u201d which tries to engage a younger evangelical audience.For the National Day of Prayer this month, CBN News interviewed several of Mr. Trump\u2019s leading evangelical supporters for a Faith Nation special.One of the guests, Penny Nance, president of the Concerned Women of America, welled up with tears as she told Mr. Brody how long she had been waiting for the United States to move its embassy to Jerusalem.In the makeup room before her appearance, she spoke of how valuable the network was for reaching her socially conservative supporters. Last year, Ms. Nance was scheduled for an on-camera appearance at CBN\u2019s headquarters in Virginia Beach, Va.; when her flight was canceled, she drove through the night to arrive in time.\u201cOften, people think you need to get on Fox and CNN,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if I\u2019m being more strategic, I should want to do CBN, specifically David\u2019s show.\u201dIn high school, Mr. Brody dreamed of being a radio announcer for the New York Mets, a forlorn underdog team at the time. On game days, he and a friend would record their own play-by-play.When his college girlfriend converted to evangelicalism, Mr. Brody adamantly resisted. \u201c \u2018I will never believe in Jesus,\u2019 \u201d he recalled, smiling. \u201cI said those words to her.\u201dGradually, though, he grew more curious. The couple married under a huppah at her family\u2019s home in Chelsea, loaded up a U-Haul and their dog, Mookie (named after Mookie Wilson, a hero of the Mets\u2019 1986 World Series champion team), and moved to Colorado Springs.Mr. Brody had no idea then that he was moving to the epicenter of American evangelicalism. They bought a house a mile from Focus on the Family, the conservative Christian organization James Dobson had founded not long earlier.

{"Headline": "Trump Jr. and Other Aides Met With Gulf Emissary Offering Help to Win Election", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Three months before the 2016 election, a small group gathered at Trump Tower to meet with Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son. One was an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation. Another was an emissary for two wealthy Arab princes. The third was a Republican donor with a controversial past in the Middle East as a private security contractor.The meeting was convened primarily to offer help to the Trump team, and it forged relationships between the men and Trump insiders that would develop over the coming months \u2014 past the election and well into President Trump\u2019s first year in office, according to several people with knowledge of their encounters.Erik Prince, the private security contractor and the former head of Blackwater, arranged the meeting, which took place on Aug. 3, 2016. The emissary, George Nader, told Donald Trump Jr. that the princes who led Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were eager to help his father win election as president. The social media specialist, Joel Zamel, extolled his company\u2019s ability to give an edge to a political campaign; by that time, the firm had already drawn up a multimillion-dollar proposal for a social media manipulation effort to help elect Mr. Trump.The company, which employed several Israeli former intelligence officers, specialized in collecting information and shaping opinion through social media.It is unclear whether such a proposal was executed, and the details of who commissioned it remain in dispute. But Donald Trump Jr. responded approvingly, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting, and after those initial offers of help, Mr. Nader was quickly embraced as a close ally by Trump campaign advisers \u2014 meeting frequently with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and Michael T. Flynn, who became the president\u2019s first national security adviser. At the time, Mr. Nader was also promoting a secret plan to use private contractors to destabilize Iran, the regional nemesis of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates.After Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Nader paid Mr. Zamel a large sum of money, described by one associate as up to $2 million. There are conflicting accounts of the reason for the payment, but among other things, a company linked to Mr. Zamel provided Mr. Nader with an elaborate presentation about the significance of social media campaigning to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.The meetings, which have not been reported previously, are the first indication that countries other than Russia may have offered assistance to the Trump campaign in the months before the presidential election. The interactions are a focus of the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, who was originally tasked with examining possible Trump campaign coordination with Russia in the election.Mr. Nader is cooperating with the inquiry, and investigators have questioned numerous witnesses in Washington, New York, Atlanta, Tel Aviv and elsewhere about what foreign help may have been pledged or accepted, and about whether any such assistance was coordinated with Russia, according to witnesses and others with knowledge of the interviews.The interviews, some in recent weeks, are further evidence that special counsel\u2019s investigation remains in an intense phase even as Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are publicly calling for Mr. Mueller to bring it to a close.It is illegal for foreign governments or individuals to be involved in American elections, and it is unclear what \u2014 if any \u2014 direct assistance Saudi Arabia and the Emirates may have provided. But two people familiar with the meetings said that Trump campaign officials did not appear bothered by the idea of cooperation with foreigners.A lawyer for Donald Trump Jr., Alan Futerfas, said in a statement that \u201cprior to the 2016 election, Donald Trump Jr. recalls a meeting with Erik Prince, George Nader and another individual who may be Joel Zamel. They pitched Mr. Trump Jr. on a social media platform or marketing strategy. He was not interested and that was the end of it.\u201dThe August 2016 meeting has echoes of another Trump Tower meeting two months earlier, also under scrutiny by the special counsel, when Donald Trump Jr. and other top campaign aides met with a Russian lawyer after being promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton. No evidence has emerged suggesting that the August meeting was set up with a similar premise.The revelations about the meetings come in the midst of new scrutiny about ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers and at least three wealthy Persian Gulf states. Besides his interest in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, Mr. Mueller has also been asking witnesses about meetings between White House advisers and representatives of Qatar, Saudi Arabia\u2019s bitter rival.A lawyer for Mr. Zamel denied that his client had carried out any campaign on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf. \u201cNeither Joel Zamel, nor any of his related entities, had any involvement whatsoever in the U.S. election campaign,\u201d said the lawyer, Marc L. Mukasey.\u201cThe D.O.J. clarified from Day 1 that Joel and his companies have never been a target of the investigation. My client provided full cooperation to the government to assist with their investigation,\u201d he said.Kathryn Ruemmler, a lawyer for Mr. Nader, said, \u201cMr. Nader has fully cooperated with the special counsel\u2019s investigation and will continue to do so.\u201d A senior official in Saudi Arabia said it had never employed Mr. Nader in any capacity or authorized him to speak for the crown prince.Mr. Prince, through a spokesman, declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, the king\u2019s main adviser, had long opposed many of the Obama administration\u2019s policies toward the Middle East. They resented President Barack Obama\u2019s agreement with Iran over its nuclear program, his statements of support for the Arab Spring uprisings and his hands-off approach to the Syrian civil war.News outlets linked to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates fiercely criticized Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, when she was secretary of state, and diplomats familiar with their thinking say both princes hoped for a president who would take a stronger hand in the region against both Iran and groups like the Muslim Brotherhood.Mr. Nader had worked for years as a close adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed of Abu Dhabi, and Mr. Zamel had worked for the Emirati royal court as a consultant as well. When Mr. Trump locked up the Republican presidential nomination in early 2016, Mr. Nader began making inquiries on behalf of the Emirati prince about possible ways to directly support Mr. Trump, according to three people with whom Mr. Nader discussed his efforts.Mr. Nader also visited Moscow at least twice during the presidential campaign as a confidential emissary from Crown Prince Mohammed of Abu Dhabi, according to people familiar with his travels. After the election, he worked with the crown prince to arrange a meeting in the Seychelles between Mr. Prince and a financier close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Companies connected to Mr. Zamel also have ties to Russia. One of his firms had previously worked for oligarchs linked to Mr. Putin, including Oleg V. Deripaska and Dmitry Rybolovlev, who hired the firm for online campaigns against their business rivals.Mr. Deripaska, an aluminum magnate, was once in business with the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has pleaded not guilty in the special counsel investigation to charges of financial crimes and failing to disclose the lobbying work he did on behalf of a former president of Ukraine, an ally of Mr. Putin. Mr. Rybolovlev once purchased a Florida mansion from Mr. Trump.Mr. Nader\u2019s visits to Russia and the work Mr. Zamel\u2019s companies did for the Russians have both been a subject of interest to the special counsel\u2019s investigators, according to people familiar with witness interviews.Mr. Zamel and Mr. Nader were together at a Midtown Manhattan hotel at about 4 p.m. on the afternoon of Aug. 3 when Mr. Nader received a call from Mr. Prince summoning them to Trump Tower. When they arrived, Stephen Miller, a top campaign aide who is now a White House adviser, was in Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s office as well, according to the people familiar with the meeting.Mr. Prince is a longtime Republican donor and the brother of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, and Mr. Prince and Mr. Nader had known each other since Mr. Nader had worked for Blackwater as a business agent in Iraq in the years after the American invasion. Mr. Prince has longstanding ties to the Emirates, and has frequently done business with Crown Prince Mohammed.Mr. Prince opened the meeting by telling Donald Trump Jr. that \u201cwe are working hard for your father,\u201d in reference to his family and other donors, according to a person familiar with the meeting. He then introduced Mr. Nader as an old friend with deep ties to Arab leaders.Mr. Nader repeatedly referred to the Saudi and Emirati princes as \u201cmy friends,\u201d according to one person with knowledge of the conversation. To underscore the point, he would open his mobile phone to show off pictures of him posing with them, some of which The New York Times obtained.Mr. Nader explained to Donald Trump Jr. that the two princes saw the elder Mr. Trump as a strong leader who would fill the power vacuum that they believed Mr. Obama had left in the Middle East, and Mr. Nader went on to say that he and his friends would be glad to support Mr. Trump as much as they could, according to the person with knowledge of the conversation.Mr. Zamel, for his part, laid out the capabilities of his online media company, although it is unclear whether he referred to the proposals his company had already prepared. One person familiar with the meeting said that Mr. Nader invited Donald Trump Jr. to meet with a Saudi prince \u2014 an invitation the younger Mr. Trump declined. After about half an hour, everyone exchanged business cards.\u201cThere was a brief meeting, nothing concrete was offered or pitched to anyone and nothing came of it,\u201d said Mr. Mukasey, the lawyer for Mr. Zamel.By then, a company connected to Mr. Zamel had been working on a proposal for a covert multimillion-dollar online manipulation campaign to help elect Mr. Trump, according to three people involved and a fourth briefed on the effort. The plan involved using thousands of fake social media accounts to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy on platforms like Facebook.There were concerns inside the company, Psy-Group, about the plan\u2019s legality, according to one person familiar with the effort. The company, whose motto is \u201cshape reality,\u201d consulted an American law firm, and was told that it would be illegal if any non-Americans were involved in the effort.Mr. Zamel, the founder of Psy-Group and one of its owners, has been questioned about the August 2016 meeting by investigators for the special counsel, and at least two F.B.I. agents working on the inquiry have traveled to Israel to interview employees of the company who worked on the proposal. According to one person, the special counsel\u2019s team has worked with the Israeli police to seize the computers of one of Mr. Zamel\u2019s companies, which is currently in liquidation.In the hectic final weeks of the campaign and during the presidential transition, several of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers drew Mr. Nader close. He met often with Mr. Kushner, Mr. Flynn and Stephen K. Bannon, who took over as campaign chairman after Mr. Manafort resigned amid revelations about his work in Ukraine.In December 2016, Mr. Nader turned again to an internet company linked to Mr. Zamel \u2014 WhiteKnight, based in the Philippines \u2014 to purchase a presentation demonstrating the impact of social media campaigns on Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral victory. Asked about the purchase, a representative of WhiteKnight said: \u201cWhiteKnight delivers premium research and high-end business development services for prestigious clients around the world. WhiteKnight does not talk about any of its clients.\u201dAfter the inauguration, both Mr. Zamel and Mr. Nader visited the White House, meeting with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bannon.At that time, Mr. Nader was promoting a plan to use private contractors to carry out economic sabotage against Iran that, he hoped, might coerce it to permanently abandon its nuclear program. The plan included efforts to deter Western companies from investing in Iran, and operations to sow mistrust among Iranian officials. He advocated the project, which he estimated would cost about $300 million, to American, Emirati and Saudi officials.Last spring, Mr. Nader traveled to Riyadh for meetings with senior Saudi military and intelligence officials to pitch his Iran sabotage plan. He was convinced, according to several people familiar with his plan, that economic warfare was the key to the overthrow of the government in Tehran. One person briefed on Mr. Nader\u2019s activities said he tried to persuade Mr. Kushner to endorse the plan to Crown Prince Mohammed in person on a trip to Riyadh, although it was unclear whether the message was delivered.Asked about Mr. Nader\u2019s plans to attack Iran, the senior Saudi official said Mr. Nader had a habit of pitching proposals that went nowhere.Mr. Nader was also in discussions with Mr. Prince, the former head of Blackwater, about a plan to get the Saudis to pay $2 billion to set up a private army to combat Iranian proxy forces in Yemen.Since entering the White House, Mr. Trump has allied himself closely with Saudi Arabia and the Emirates. His first overseas trip was to Riyadh. He strongly backed Saudi and Emirati efforts to isolate their neighbor Qatar, another American ally, even over apparent disagreement from the State and Defense Departments.This month, Mr. Trump also withdrew from an Obama administration nuclear deal with Iran that both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had campaigned against for years, delivering them their biggest victory yet from his administration.Mark Mazzetti reported from Washington, Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv and David D.

{"Headline": "Lemony Chicken Wings, Soaring Above the Rest", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenServed at a bar or at a casual summer gathering, chicken wings are crowd pleasers, whatever way you prepare them.As a young cook, I learned from a chef friend how to properly butcher a chicken without wasting anything. The breasts and legs were swiftly removed, which if done well meant leaving behind as little meat as possible. The carcass, feet, wing tips and neck were then saved for broth, but to get even more from the bird, the meaty parts of the wings were turned into hors d\u2019oeuvres or staff meals.But you don\u2019t have to be a frugal French chef butchering a dozen chickens to get a pile of wings on the table: Most supermarkets sell them packaged, of course. I prefer the hefty drumette part, but you can also use the midsection, the tips (which are near-meatless but still delicious) or the whole wings, with all three sections attached.The wings can be dressed however you\u2019d like. They\u2019re just as delicious salted, peppered and roasted on a sheet pan as they are with a more complex marinade or sauce.But at home the other night, I headed in a Greco-Italian direction. I wanted the wings to be very lemony, so more than a few sliced lemons were involved, as were olive oil, garlic and rosemary, plenty of black pepper and a good pinch of hot crushed red pepper.The wings, baked on a bed of fingerling potatoes, emerged well bronzed and fragrant. I gave them another splash of lemon juice and a sprinkling of dried oregano.The lemony wings and potatoes are delicious hot and crisp, but just as good at cool room temperature. It\u2019s definitely finger food, though, whether you serve them indoors or out. So no silverware, please \u2014 just napkins.And to Drink \u2026If you are eating chicken wings Buffalo-style, grab a beer by all means. But for these Mediterranean-style chicken wings, flavored with lemon, garlic and herbs, I\u2019d prefer a bracing Mediterranean white wine. I might like a vermentinu, as vermentinos are called on the island of Corsica. They tend to be a little more linear and mineral than those from Liguria. Or perhaps a French white from Cassis, a town outside Marseilles. You could try Etna Biancos, made from the carricante grape, or Greek whites, made from assyrtiko or moschofilero. Eat these wings with gallons of dry ros\u00e9, if you are feeling all summery, or try a dry sparkling wine \u2014 good cava, if you want to stay Mediterranean. And you wouldn\u2019t be wrong if you stuck with beer. ERIC ASIMOVcookingAdvertisement"}

Until recently, the company took a 5 percent cut of all donations, in addition a slice of the credit card processing fees.Last fall, it changed its policy and now offers use of the platform for free for personal campaigns in the United States, Canada and some countries in Europe, with United States donors charged a credit card processing fee of 2.9 percent, a portion of which goes to GoFundMe. (Certified charities are still charged 5 percent, and voluntary \u201ctips\u201d are solicited from those creating personal campaigns.)GoFundMe pages tend to look like basic blog posts, but the company has created a new division, GoFundMe Studios, that sends production teams to locations around the world to film heart-tugging documentary-style videos about various causes. The point is to convey to as broad an audience as possible that the site is about more than paying for funerals. \u201cThere is a hunger for these life-affirming stories,\u201d said Raquel Rozas, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer, and they can inspire additional campaigns.Earlier this spring, a team led by Wil Tidman, the head of GoFundMe Studios, traveled to the rural community of Louisa County, Va. (population: approximately 35,000), to film a video at the local high school. Students in the newspaper and leadership classes had gone to local businesses, soliciting sponsorships for Ms. Fletcher\u2019s 100-mile run. They came up with nearly $10,000, almost double the amount donated last year when Ms. Fletcher ran for an entire school day. Mr. Tidman and his team put together storyboards to map out some of the shots they wanted to help convey the drama, leading toward an emotional climax. They gathered footage the day before: of dilapidated houses lining the roads that connect Ms. Fletcher\u2019s home to the school, as well as of Ms. Fletcher jogging the sidewalks of the economically struggling commercial center of Louisa.\u201cThere is so much content coming at us from social-media feeds, and a lot of it is creating a numbness,\u201d said Mr. Tidman, formerly the vice president for original productions for GoPro, the action-camera company. \u201cI want us to help people turn that numbness into something else, something that has feeling and emotion.\u201dSeveral inches of snow fell on the April day of Ms. Fletcher\u2019s run, enhancing the drama; temperatures hovered in the 30s. The production team had worked with Ms. Hicks to plan a number of surprises that would boost Ms. Fletcher\u2019s spirits and add emotion.Former students of Ms. Fletcher who credit her with helping them get to college showed up throughout the day and night to run with her. Ms. Fletcher\u2019s daughter arrived for a few laps. They had planned for the school\u2019s marching band to descend a hill toward the track just as she was finishing her 400th lap, but her pace slowed after she had run about 80 miles. So that wasn\u2019t quite the climax Mr. Tidman and his team had hoped for.Still, a flood of students rushed down the hill from school to the track, encircling Ms. Fletcher as she hit the 400-lap mark.In the finished film, former students read letters of thanks to Ms. Fletcher as the camera shows her running in the mist. The effect, as the kids would say: #AllTheFeels. As of early this week, it had generated over $22,000 more in donations than last year\u2019s campaign, which was sans video. Legacy media has plenty to cry about, but sad shows are a bright spot in the television business. There is no bigger tear-jerker than NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d a multigenerational family drama told in present tense and flashbacks. The second season ended in March. That the show makes people cry is a big part of NBC\u2019s promotional strategy. On social media, the program\u2019s feeds regularly share viewers\u2019 sobbing reactions. \u201cI have an ugly cry headache. Anyone else love this show like I do?\u201d said one fan on Twitter. The show reposted this and added the comment, \u201cThere are a few that might,\u201d with a winking emoji.In another tweet, a new viewer who works from home wondered how many tissues she would need.Like with most makeover shows, leading viewers to a catharsis is built in to the formula. \u201cThe nice thing about our show is we are there to help, and when you help someone, there will be emotion,\u201d said David Collins, its creator.The juxtaposition of cosmopolitan gay men with men living, in some cases, in quiet towns in the Deep South is a setup for a lot of funny situations, but poignant ones too. In several episodes, members of the so-called Fab Five confront individuals who have not interacted much with gay people. In an episode focused on a makeover of a conservative Christian named Bobby Camp, Bobby Berk, the interior-decorating expert, is reminded of his religious upbringing and childhood feelings of shame about his sexuality. Sobfest! Karamo Brown, who is black and the team\u2019s resident adviser on cultural matters, finds common ground in another episode with Cory, a white police officer and supporter of President Trump. If that episode doesn\u2019t make you cry, it at least gives you hope. \u201cWe are showing the conversation that more Americans should be having,\u201d said Rob Eric, an executive producer of the show.At the top of the industrial complex of tears stands \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d the daytime talk show that provides the web with some of its most viral tear-jerking content. There are military reunions; there are surprised holiday shopping sprees and college scholarships; there are celebrity duets with children of cancer patients. Catharsis reigns.When Ms. DeGeneres was conceiving the format and tone of her show in 2003, she insisted that compassion and empathy would guild her humor, Ms. Connelly said.\u201cThere was a time when I was the person people were making fun of,\u201d Ms. Connelly remembers the host saying. \u201cAfter I came out, I would turn on late night TV and people would be making fun of me and it hurt my feelings.\u201dIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, which is Ms. DeGeneres\u2019s hometown. She told her producers she wanted to create segments that helped the community and also that focused on the good work taking place in the storm\u2019s aftermath. This created a genre of segments that viewers of the show have come to expect \u2014 as they once did from \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d \u2014 along with comedy bits and celebrity interviews. After he described the ordeal in a calm and humble manner, Ms. DeGeneres asked him who he considered a hero. Mr. Shaw cited Dwyane Wade, the star shooting guard with the Miami Heat. \u201cI like the way he carries himself off the court,\u201d Mr. Shaw said.\u201cLet\u2019s see how he carries himself out here,\u201d Ms. DeGeneres said.Mr. Wade walked onto the stage. He and Mr. Shaw hugged. I wept.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScientists have discovered what they say is \u201cdirect evidence\u201d supporting the theory that Ice Age migrants from Asia traveled down the Pacific Coast, rather than through North America\u2019s interior.How did early humans first enter the Americas?After crossing into Alaska, the Ice Age adventurers may have trekked along two routes: either by foot through the interior of present-day Canada through a grassy passageway between two large ice sheets, or they moved south along the Pacific Coast. In the summer of 2015, Ms. Lesnek hopped out of a helicopter into a grassy valley on Baker Island in southeastern Alaska. There, she spotted a large gray boulder, that to most people may have appeared unremarkable. But to Ms. Lesnek, the rock\u2019s smooth surface and rounded edges were clues to its ancient past: it had been plopped onto the landscape thousands of years earlier by giant glaciers.She took out a power saw with a blade as wide as a grapefruit and with two hands cut into the rock. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting, but a little bit nerve-racking because it spins really fast and makes a loud noise like \u2018Reeeiiiinnnn\u2019,\u201d Ms. Lesnek said. Back at the lab, the team determined how long ago the rock samples had been trapped by ice sheets. Glaciers are like slow-moving rivers that pick up rocks and move them. When the ice melts, the boulders are dropped. As they sit on the Earth\u2019s surface, they are exposed to cosmic radiation, which the scientists can analyze. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a rock sunburn,\u201d said Ms. Lesnek. The team concluded the islands had been covered by ice sheets up until about 15,000 to 17,000 years ago. The finding suggests that the glaciers covering that part of the Pacific Coast melted and possibly created a pathway for humans at the right time. \u201cOur data suggest the coastal route became available 17,000 years ago,\u201d Dr. Briner said. \u201cThat\u2019s like 4,000 to 3,000 years earlier than when the inland route opened.\u201dThe team also dated some seal bones that had been previously discovered in a coastal cave and found that the animals were present around 17,000 years ago. The bones suggested that if people had taken the coastal route they would have found food.Dr. Briner said their study only looked at about 10 percent of the entire coastal corridor, and that future work will aim to apply the same dating methods on other parts of the route.

Marriage connects two families, each with their own language, customs and way of chopping onions. Uniting the differences can be like trying to piece Pangea back together. Further complication: I have a mother-shaped hole in my heart.The story of my childhood in rural Missouri is not a tidy one. My mother basically abandoned me as a young child, sending me from the constant chaos of her domestic situations to live with others again and again. My father wasn\u2019t around at all. The burden of raising me fell upon my wonderful extended family; grandparents, aunts, uncles and older siblings all took turns. But no one can take the place of a mother. The mother-daughter relationship is one of the most fundamental, informative and complex relationships of a woman\u2019s life. I longed for it as a child and expressed my frustration as a child would \u2014 by being needy, annoying, attention seeking.The desire is no less strong now as an adult woman, longing for the voice at the end of a late night phone call or an authority on how to thicken soup or remove a stain. People are not handing out mothers on the street. I have not yet managed to achieve, please or bargain my way into having one. And I still sometimes express this lack by being needy, annoying and attention seeking. My poor, long-suffering husband.Though I have cobbled together some answers from experience, Google and good friends, my mother wound remains. I cry at movies about mothers. I cry at the trailers of movies about mothers. I cry if someone I know has a fight with her mother. I cry if I even think about becoming a mother. How would I know how without having had a model? Meanwhile, my own fecund uterine years are slipping by.Then comes along my mother-in-law.When I first met my partner\u2019s parents 12 years ago, I spent three hours deciding on the most capable and love-deserving outfit in my closet, settling on a baby-pink sweater under a black blazer. We decided to meet in Manhattan for Italian food since they would be taking the train in from Connecticut.I had so many questions for them. Did my husband always love to read? When did you know he had a gift for music? What was he like as a little boy?I wanted to understand the years I had missed in his life, the years that shaped him into the wonderful human being he had become.They shifted in their seats and answered each question with short replies: \u201cHe did.\u201d \u201cAround 5.\u201d \u201cHe was like a little boy.\u201dNo questions seemed to be forthcoming from them about me, so when the evening ended we parted ways without me knowing them or them knowing me and I walked away feeling completely crushed. They obviously hated me.Then my husband put his arm around me and said, \u201cThat went great.\u201d He wasn\u2019t being sarcastic.When he flew home with me for the first time, my two sisters grilled him with questions about his family and past. \u201cHow many siblings do you have?\u201d \u201cWhat are your parents like?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite kind of pie?\u201d I kept thinking smugly: \u201cNow this is how you welcome someone into your family.\u201dMinutes later, however, I found him hiding on the back patio. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I said.\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust taking a break from the interrogation.\u201dMy husband and I come from families that are so culturally different that in the beginning we did not know how to be in each other\u2019s families. Mine is huge and southern and gregarious, full of drama and closeness. His is reserved, East Coast Catholics of Irish descent.I thought they were cold and vowed to wear them down. Every year for the last 12, I have written his parents a thank-you note on his birthday, expressing my gratitude for the person they raised. Not once have they acknowledged these notes.Every time I saw them, I hugged them close and said, \u201cI love you, guys.\u201d And they never said it back. Not for a decade.I tried hard not to take this personally. Demonstrative, verbalized love was simply not their thing. Fine. Even so, I wanted them to know how much I loved them and appreciated their son. So I chose to tell them. Over and over.And somewhere along the way, we started to meet in the middle. I began to understand that his family did show love but in a different way. They do table arrangements. They move furniture. They support the goals of those they care about. They show love by showing up, and I came to respect that.Slowly, after many years, they also started to say it, responding to my stubborn affection with \u201cI love you, too.\u201d I nearly did a victory dance the first time they said it. I suppose it\u2019s possible they didn\u2019t say it for so many years because they didn\u2019t love me, but that\u2019s not the conclusion I came to. I think it\u2019s more that outward displays of affection were uncomfortable for them. After a while, though, they understood that hearing \u201cI love you\u201d was something I needed.Now they throw the phrase around with the ease of people who have been saying it their entire lives \u2014 at arrivals and departures and sometimes dropped into the middle of conversations.My mother-in-law is a gardener. She knows the name of every plant and flower, both the common and scientific names. She has fully outfitted me with gardening clothes and tools that I don\u2019t know how to use with the hope of instilling this enthusiasm in me. I find this endearing, and I confess that I feign interest so we have more reasons to talk.In person, she is stoic, intelligent and polite. But in her emails she is effusive, warm, enthusiastic and expansive. I\u2019m not sure why there\u2019s a difference. Maybe because this avenue of communication is private and makes her feel safe. But I choose this version of her as the real one.We regularly exchange lengthy, unabashedly loving emails, full of the mundane and the profound: \u201cDid you get the tulip catalog I sent you?\u201d \u201cI looked at that mural and I just knew centuries haven\u2019t changed humans. We\u2019re still the same.\u201dIn person, we discuss books and writing and art because these are safe and distant topics. But I tune my heart to hers and deliver secret messages that I love her and I hope she loves me, too. Because excessive displays of emotion are still not natural to her, I try my best to play it cool.Often, I have failed. I cry easily. I laugh easily. I say things without calculating their effect. She has a long fuse for me, and this quality \u2014 her endless patience \u2014 is also a form of love.She has given me support, encouragement and gentle reprimands to let go, to resist pettiness, to forgive. She explains which plants need what in order to survive, and she has, at times, applied an annoying amount of pressure on me to do what she believes is best for my life. I have come to realize this is what having a mother may be like.If there were an intelligence quotient that measured empathy, I\u2019m certain she would test in the highest percentile. On the city streets, she gives her dollars to every homeless person who asks. She sees everyone as someone\u2019s child. Even my mother is someone\u2019s child. I am too.For my entire life, motherhood has felt like a vast, impossible terrain I dare not tread upon. But after more than a decade of watching my mother-in-law gracefully traverse this ground, I feel as if for the first time I have what I needed all along. There\u2019s more than one way to love in this world and no one family owns the correct way.A few months ago, my entire in-law clan celebrated my mother-in-law\u2019s 70th birthday with her at a restaurant over osso buco and tiramis\u00f9. I cried myself to sleep that night, afraid of when I will lose her. After all this time, I had finally found her.She emailed me the other day to check on the daffodils.I wrote back to say they have indeed bloomed and are growing toward the light. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Suspect Identified in C.I.A. Leak Was Charged, but Not for the Breach", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn weekly online posts last year, WikiLeaks released a stolen archive of secret documents about the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s hacking operations, including software exploits designed to take over iPhones and turn smart television sets into surveillance devices.Now, the prime suspect in the breach has been identified: a 29-year-old former C.I.A. software engineer who had designed malware used to break into the computers of terrorism suspects and other targets, The New York Times has learned.Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched the Manhattan apartment of the suspect, Joshua A. Schulte, one week after WikiLeaks released the first of the C.I.A. documents in March last year, and then stopped him from flying to Mexico on vacation, taking his passport, according to court records and relatives. The search warrant application said Mr. Schulte was suspected of \u201cdistribution of national defense information,\u201d and agents told the court they had retrieved \u201cN.S.A. and C.I.A. paperwork\u201d in addition to a computer, tablet, phone and other electronics.But instead of charging Mr. Schulte in the breach, referred to as the Vault 7 leak, prosecutors charged him last August with possessing child pornography, saying agents had found 10,000 illicit images on a server he created as a business in 2009 while studying at the University of Texas at Austin.Court papers quote messages from Mr. Schulte that suggest he was aware of the encrypted images of children being molested by adults on his computer, though he advised one user, \u201cJust don\u2019t put anything too illegal on there.\u201dIt is unclear why, more than a year after he was arrested, he has not been charged or cleared in connection with Vault 7. Leak investigators have had access to electronic audit trails inside the C.I.A. that may indicate who accessed the files that were stolen, and they have had possession of Mr. Schulte\u2019s personal data for many months.In court in January, a prosecutor, the assistant United States attorney Matthew J. Laroche, said that \u201cthe government immediately had enough evidence\u201d to make Mr. Schulte a target of the investigation. He said that the investigation was continuing, and that it involved in part how Tor, software that allows anonymous communication on the internet, \u201cwas used in transmitting classified information.\u201dMr. Schulte\u2019s lawyers have repeatedly demanded that prosecutors make a decision on the Vault 7 leak charges. Prosecutors said in court last week that they planned to file a new indictment in the next 45 days, and Mr. Schulte\u2019s lawyer Sabrina P. Shroff, of the federal public defender\u2019s office, asked the court to impose a deadline on any charges that the government sought to bring under the Espionage Act for supplying the secret C.I.A. files to WikiLeaks.\u201cThis case has been dragging since August 2017,\u201d Ms. Shroff said in an interview. \u201cThe government should be required to indict so Mr. Schulte has the opportunity to defend himself. Otherwise he is just languishing.\u201dSpokesmen for the C.I.A. and the Justice Department declined to comment. When WikiLeaks began to post the stolen documents last year, the C.I.A. said in a statement, \u201cThe American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community\u2019s ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries.\u201dFamily members, who have spent much of their savings on legal fees, say they believe that Mr. Schulte is a scapegoat for the C.I.A.\u2019s inability to secure its most sensitive files. They say the child pornography charges, based on his actions nine years ago when he was 20, are a thin pretext for keeping him incarcerated.\u201cI am just scared to death,\u201d said Roger Schulte, Mr. Schulte\u2019s father, who lives in Lubbock, Tex. \u201cI think he\u2019s innocent of all these crimes, as far as everything I\u2019ve seen.\u201d The elder Mr. Schulte said that his son was in college when he built the server later found to contain child pornography, and that he \u201chad so many people accessing it he didn\u2019t care what people put on it.\u201dFar from leaking classified information, his father said, Mr. Schulte had actually complained about security vulnerabilities at the C.I.A., first to his superiors and later to the agency\u2019s inspector general and to a House Intelligence Committee staff member. Family members shared with The Times evidence of those contacts, which predated the Vault 7 release.Most of the government\u2019s cyberespionage is carried out by the N.S.A., but the C.I.A. also employs hackers. The leaked Vault 7 documents came from the agency\u2019s Engineering Development Group and included descriptions and instructions for the use of agency hacking tools, but only a small amount of the actual computer code for the tools.Despite the scale of the breach, Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, Calif., said WikiLeaks had exaggerated the danger to civil liberties from the C.I.A. hacking tools, which he said were actually designed to target small numbers of high-priority targets.Mr. Weaver called the Vault 7 tools \u201ccreative but not really special\u201d and designed for \u201cvery targeted espionage.\u201d He said the real significance of the leak was that it could happen at all, despite tightened security measures imposed after Edward J. Snowden took hundreds of thousands of classified N.S.A. documents and shared them with journalists.\u201cSomebody managed to walk out with a huge amount of secret data from a C.I.A. facility,\u201d he said. If the leaker has been identified, he said, \u201cthat is very reassuring.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Texas School Shooting, 10 Dead, 10 Hurt and Many Unsurprised", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementAt least 10 people are dead after a school shooting in Santa Fe, Tex.SANTA FE, Tex. \u2014 A nation plagued by a wrenching loop of mass school shootings watched the latest horror play out in this small Southeast Texas town Friday morning, as a young man armed with a shotgun and a .38 revolver smuggled under his coat opened fire on his high school campus, killing 10 people, many of them his fellow students, and wounding 10 more, the authorities said.It was the worst school shooting since the February assault on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a young man with an AR-15 rifle left 17 people dead and prompted a wave of nationwide, student-led protests calling on lawmakers to tighten gun laws.It was barely after 7:30 a.m. at Santa Fe High School, about 35 miles southeast of Houston, when gunfire first resounded through the halls, the opening volley of yet another massacre at an American high school that would leave students, teachers and staff members shocked, and in some cases bloodied. But they were not necessarily surprised.\u201cWas there a part of you that was like, \u2018This isn\u2019t real, this is \u2014 this would not happen in my school?\u2019\u201d the reporter asked.The young girl shook her head: \u201cNo, there wasn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhy so?\u201d the reporter asked.\u201cIt\u2019s been happening everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt \u2014 I\u2019ve always kind of felt like eventually it was going to happen here, too.\u201dPresident Trump, in the East Room of the White House, expressed his solidarity with the people of Santa Fe, and said his administration would do \u201ceverything in our power\u201d to protect schools and keep guns away from those who should not have them.Mr. Trump had also vowed to take action after the Parkland shooting. At the time, the president, a member of the National Rifle Association who has strong political support from gun owners, said he would look at stricter background checks and raising the minimum age for buying an assault weapon, proposals that the group opposes.He also pressed for an N.R.A.-backed proposal to arm teachers, and said he would favor taking guns away from potentially dangerous people.But Mr. Trump did not press for action on any of those initiatives, and Congress did not follow through. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday that the Justice Department was proposing to ban so-called bump stocks through regulations rather than wait for Congress to act.The authorities had not released the names of those who died in the shooting late Friday, but family and associates of some of the victims had begun to share their stories on social media. The family of Cynthia Tisdale, a teacher, said on Facebook that she had been killed in the shooting. And on the Facebook page of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, Pakistan\u2019s ambassador to the United States expressed condolences for the victims, which he said included a Pakistani exchange student named Sabika Sheikh.The shooting in Texas began at the start of a school day when summer seemed just around the corner. The night before, seniors had gathered for a sunset dinner and a Powder Puff football game, according to the school\u2019s website, and the baseball team had been playing in the regional quarterfinals.Zachary Muehe, a sophomore, headed to school thinking about the late work he was supposed to submit before the end of the school year, and settled into his art class to work on a drawing project. He was engrossed in his phone, he said, when his class began to transform into a horror scene.It started with a boom, and then one or two more. \u201cI turned around and I saw the kid who\u2019s in my football class, I see him every day, and I saw him with a shotgun,\u201d Mr. Muehe said in a phone interview. \u201cI saw him in a trench coat. My immediate thought was just get out.\u201dIt was Mr. Pagourtzis, a youth he recognized as a football teammate who used the locker next to his. \u201cHe had one sawed-off shotgun and he had a pistol,\u201d Ms. Muehe said. \u201cHe was wearing a trench coat with combat boots. He had a \u2018Born to Kill\u2019 shirt on.\u201dMr. Pagourtzis, he said, began shooting as soon as he entered the classroom. \u201cIt was crazy watching him shoot and then pump,\u201d Mr. Muehe said. \u201cI remember seeing the shrapnel from the tables, whatever he hit, I remember seeing the shrapnel go past my face.\u201dMr. Muehe immediately tried to escape. He and his friends went to a back door in the classroom, which leads to a small courtyard, but the door was locked. He then went to a ceramics closet that connects to another art classroom, and as he took one more look at the classroom behind him, he saw students lying on the ground.\u201cThere was a girl on the ground,\u201d Mr. Muehe said, \u201cand he shot her in the head one or two times.\u201d When Mr. Muehe opened the door to the closet, he said, he found students from the next classroom hiding inside. He urged them to run, and began running himself. \u201cI just started running, as fast as I could to the other side of the campus, where I could at least tell someone,\u201d he said.Kole Dixon, 16, a sophomore, said he was standing outside history class when the fire alarm suddenly went off. He sprinted out a side door, and heard gunshots in rapid succession over the sound of the fire alarm.When the shooting stopped, Mr. Dixon said that friends told him that the gunman first entered an art classroom, said \u201cSurprise!\u201d and started shooting. The suspect\u2019s ex-girlfriend was among the people shot in that classroom, he said.Santa Fe is a town where a fear of hurricanes usually outweighs a fear of homicides, and residents seemed shocked by the scene that unfolded. Billie Scheumack, 68, said she saw students from the high school running, scared and clutching their phones, down her street, Tower Road, about a block from the school. A neighbor told her that some children had been shot.\u201cIn this little town, you wouldn\u2019t think something like this could happen,\u201d Ms. Scheumack said.\u201cWe know that because they were willing to run into that building and engage that other lives were saved,\u201d the colonel said.Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said two police officers had been on the campus at the time at the attack \u2014 as envisioned by the school\u2019s safety plan \u2014 and that they were \u201cable to confront the shooter early on in the process.\u201dPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.The governor said that the suspect had offered few clues that he would carry out a massacre of such scale, although Mr. Abbott did say that the suspect\u2019s Facebook page had included a photograph of a shirt that read \u201cBorn to Kill.\u201d\u201cUnlike Parkland, unlike Sutherland Springs, there were not those types of warning signs,\u201d Mr. Abbott said. \u201cWe have what are often categorized as red-flag warnings, and here, the red-flag warnings were either nonexistent or very imperceptible.\u201dThe T-shirt, Mr. Abbott said, appeared to be \u201cmaybe the only, if not the foremost, warning sign.\u201d He added that Mr. Pagourtzis had no history of arrests or confrontation with law enforcement.\u201cHis slate is pretty clean,\u201d Mr. Abbott said.The governor said that the suspect had information about the shooting on his computer and cellphone.\u201cHe said that not only did he want to commit the shooting, but he wanted to commit suicide after the shooting,\u201d Mr. Abbott said, adding that Mr. Pagourtzis had ultimately surrendered and \u201cadmitted at the time that he didn\u2019t have the courage to commit the suicide.\u201dBoth weapons appeared to have been taken from the suspect\u2019s father, who is believed to have obtained them legally, Mr. Abbott said.Investigators intended to question two other people: One was at the scene and had \u201csuspicious reactions,\u201d according to the governor, and another is someone who quickly drew the scrutiny of investigators.Many answers about who the young man was, and what may have motivated him, remained blurry or fragmented Friday evening. A photo of Mr. Pagourtzis shows a young man with heavy black eyebrows and a backward baseball cap, staring at the camera with lips slightly pursed.Some images on his Facebook page, now deleted, suggest a possible interest in white supremacist groups, though a direct link to his politics was not evident.\u201cHe was quiet, but he wasn\u2019t quiet in a creepy way,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was an introvert, not an extrovert.\u201dMs. Martin had also taught Mr. Pagourtzis\u2019s sister; she said she had heard the high school had been hard on her, and that \u201cshe was bullied so terribly at the high school that she transferred to Clear Creek,\u201d a school district up the road toward Houston.But Ms. Martin did not know if the young man had received the same kind of treatment, and said she had seen no signs of bullying toward either of them when she had taught them.Some students at Santa Fe High School had taken part in a protest after the Parkland shooting.On a cold Friday morning last month \u2014 the day of the National School Walkout \u2014 Kyle Harris and 11 other students had stood outside Santa Fe High hoping to spread their gun control message to their classmates.One of them held a poster: \u201cSanta Fe High School says #NeverAgain.\u201d They read a poem by a survivor of the Parkland shooting, an event that was searing to them, but far away.\u201cBeing part of that gathering was me telling people to stand up for themselves,\u201d said Mr. Harris, who is in 10th grade.One month later, the family of Sarah Salazar, a sophomore at Santa Fe High, held an anxious vigil at a Texas hospital, where Ms. Salazar was in surgery after being shot several times.Rosemary Salazar, Sarah\u2019s aunt, said that she was in art class when the shooting occurred. Doctors were working to repair wounds to her stomach, her thigh and her shoulder, which was severely damaged.\u201cThey said that her left shoulder is pretty much gone,\u201d Ms. Salazar said. \u201cShe\u2019ll have to undergo a lot more surgery.\u201dThe family had spent 90 minutes calling and texting Sarah \u2014 and receiving no response \u2014 before finding out that she had been shot.\u201cI started replaying what happened to us in my head,\u201d she said. \u201cOver and over.\u201dManny Fernandez reported from Santa Fe, Tex., Richard Fausset from Atlanta and Jess Bidgood from Boston.

{"Headline": "Death of a Biohacker", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAaron Traywick envisioned a future in which self-taught scientists would cure diseases and bend the human body to their will.People who knew Aaron Traywick, the biohacker who died last month at a spa in Washington, D.C., were initially suspicious about the circumstances of his death. David Ishee, a researcher for Mr. Traywick\u2019s company, Ascendance Biomedical, said his first thought upon hearing that Mr. Traywick\u2019s body had been discovered in a sensory deprivation tank was that he had faked it and run off with his clients\u2019 money.Tristan Roberts, another biohacker who worked with Ascendance, thought the same thing. Maybe the body was just \u201ca very convincing clone,\u201d he joked.The police do not suspect foul play and the cause of the death is unknown. Edwina Rogers, Mr. Traywick\u2019s adoptive cousin, said a police detective told her that he found the drug ketamine in his pants pocket. She thought it likely that he had taken the drug, lost consciousness in the tank and drowned. In the span of two years, Aaron Traywick, who was 28 when he died, went from a virtual unknown to a notorious personality in the biohacking community. At the time of his death, he was estranged from many of his closest collaborators. He had remained close with his adoptive family, though they knew little about his work. His mother, Rita Traywick, was completely blindsided by the news. \u201cHe was fine, we saw him in April,\u201d she said. \u201cTalkative and proud of the work that he was doing.\u201dBut Ms. Traywick, 70, said she barely understood his work. \u201cHe would tell us these things, and I would stand there and say, that\u2019s great, we\u2019re proud of you, and I couldn\u2019t understand a thing he was saying to tell you the truth.\u201dUntil several months ago, the company was viewed by many biohackers as a potentially groundbreaking venue for invention.But Mr. Traywick proved to be secretive and aggressive. He kept the people he worked with away from one another, ensuring that he was the only person at his company with all the information. He tried to gain financial control over his collaborators\u2019 inventions, and to sell them before they were fully tested. Rich Lee, who created a vibrating penile implant called the Lovetron 9000, recalled that Mr. Traywick wanted to own 75 percent of profits made from sales of his device in exchange for funding. He said Mr. Traywick offered to pay him only $5,000 and was insistent that Mr. Lee presell the implant before it was finished and tested. \u201cI was left with a bad taste in my mouth,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cHe did seem to promise anything to everyone who was looking for something,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, the Ascendance contractor. \u201cHe was actually developing some of the things he was saying he was developing. On the other hand, it did seem like he would take any money that people handed him with no regard for executing.\u201dBy the time Mr. Traywick died, biohackers, researchers and engineers he had recruited had soured on his approach to the business.Walt Crompton, an engineer and life extension enthusiast who worked as a contractor for Boston Scientific and other medical device manufacturers, started doing research for the company in the fall of 2016. Shortly after Mr. Traywick\u2019s death, Mr. Crompton wrote an email to a friend about his ambivalence. He said that while the Ascendance founder\u2019s behavior had convinced him to leave the company, he found himself \u201ckicking the dirt, though, expecting that Aaron would go on to be rich and famous, while so many great contributors will not, precisely because of the way he elbows his way to the front of the line.\u201dStill, he wrote:The cousin, Edwina Rogers, is a lobbyist and former economic adviser to the George W. Bush White House. She was also the founding executive director of the Secular Policy Institute, an organization that promotes the separation of religion and public policy, and is the chief executive of the Center for Prison Reform. But he gave her a call after he graduated from college to ask for career advice. She asked him what he was interested in, and one of the topics, life extension, was a passion she shared.She also allowed him to move into the house she shared with her husband in Washington, D.C., a decision they would later regret.Three weeks into his stay, Mr. Traywick told Mr. Neimeyer that after college, he had lived in a tantric sex house in Colorado and began to talk about his experience there. The discussion was disturbing, Mr. Neimeyer said.\u201cHe had delusions that women wanted him,\u201d Mr. Neimeyer said. \u201cHe\u2019d be talking with them and promising them meetings with senators.\u201d He said that at one point Mr. Traywick referred to the women he slept with as \u201cmy skanks.\u201d \u201cHe had a smooth-talking game, but beneath that thin veneer, he had a seething caldron of animosity and predation,\u201d Mr. Neimeyer said. The couple also began to realize that Mr. Traywick was lying to them. He intercepted professional correspondence that was meant for Ms. Rogers, and at least once, accepted an airplane ticket and a conference invitation on her behalf. One night in late March, when Mr. Neimeyer was out of town, Mr. Traywick attempted to force his way into Ms. Rogers\u2019s bedroom at 2 in the morning. Shortly thereafter, the family moved him into a new apartment.\u201cWe were so desperate that we went and rented a place for him,\u201d Ms. Rogers said. They told him: \u201cThis is your new home. You\u2019re not welcome in ours.\u201dSeveral months later, Ms. Rogers terminated Mr. Traywick\u2019s employment. \u201cYou have moved aggressively, unprofessionally, and incorrigibly against the directives that we have been giving you, demonstrating vividly your commitment to insubordination and unmanageability,\u201d she wrote to him in an email on July 17, 2016.\u201cAaron promised that he would work very hard and be a serious understudy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe talked about a variety of experience he had but it was all smoke and mirrors.\u201dMr. Traywick continued to tell people he was employed at the nonprofit for another year. One of the ways Mr. Traywick convinced people to work with him \u2014 or to buy what he was selling \u2014 was the persona he affected. He used his brief experience working for his cousin to represent himself as a moneyed veteran of Capitol Hill, knowledgeable about health care policy and the structural limitations placed on researchers by the Food and Drug Administration.He had already contacted dozens if not hundreds of people to talk about experimental ways to improve the human body. A group of individuals began to coalesce around him. Among them were a Dutch futurist named Demian Zivkovic, a British geneticist named Matt Johnstone, and a marketer from Oshkosh, Wis., Kelly Martin.Ms. Martin, 39, said she began to speak to Mr. Traywick online between late 2015 and early 2016. She saw her new contact as a radical thinker on the order of Steve Jobs. \u201cHis ideas were kind of revolutionary,\u201d she said. Gennady Stolyarov II, the chairman of the United States Transhumanist Party, a political organization with close to 880 members that supports life extension through science and technology, had been corresponding with Mr. Traywick since November 2015. \u201cHe definitely shared a lot of our values,\u201d Mr. Stolyarov said. \u201cI think Mr. Traywick was sincere about what he was doing. I don\u2019t think he was trying to scam anyone or mislead anyone.\u201d In October 2017, Mr. Traywick hit the mainstream press for the first time and Mr. Roberts became Ascendance Biomedical\u2019s first public guinea pig. Sitting on a couch next to Mr. Traywick and another hacker, Mr. Roberts, who was diagnosed with H.I.V. in 2010, injected himself with an experimental gene therapy that was meant to treat the disease. They were filmed by an independent journalist, Ford Fischer, who broadcast the injection on Facebook Live.Josiah Zayner, a prominent biohacker who that month had injected himself with modified DNA in an effort to enlarge his muscles, happened to be surfing Facebook at the moment that the live stream began. He was impressed.\u201cI think they were excited to be presenting the concept almost as much as they were to see the results from it,\u201d Mr. Fischer, the documentarian, said. \u201cAaron had some really large notions of what could be done with this stuff in the future. He felt like this was the first step in being able to change the world.\u201d\u201cI remember I just started contacting all these people I knew,\u201d Mr. Zayner said. \u201cTelling them you\u2019ve got to check this out. After that it was kind of disappointing. Tristan, his viral load went up instead of going down. The treatment didn\u2019t really work.\u201d With the October injection, Mr. Traywick gained a measure of fame. He wanted to keep the momentum going so, several months later, he planned another stunt. This time no one, including his closest collaborators, knew exactly what he had in mind.He reached out to the organizers of BDYHAX, a three-day body hacking conference to be held in Austin in February. He told them he wanted to do a live test of what he billed as an experimental vaccine for herpes. But the injection he had planned to take was not ready in time. On Feb. 4, Mr. Traywick took the stage at the convention and told the audience that Ascendance Biomedical had developed a vaccine to cure herpes. He also announced that the company\u2019s technology could be used to address a panoply of genetic diseases. Interested people were told to simply get in touch with Ascendance. He dismissed an audience question about whether the procedure had undergone formal ethical oversight (\u201cno\u201d), and announced to the room that he had been diagnosed with herpes five years prior. Then, he took off his pants and injected himself. \u201cThe idea that any scientist, biohacker or not, has created a cure for a disease with no testing and no data is more ridiculous than believing jet fuel melts steel beams,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAscendance Bio are not legit in any measure.\u201d The stunt in Austin set off a mutiny. Tristan Roberts and the others who had been working as contractors for Ascendance in the lead-up to the October and February injections met in Jacksonville, Fla. There, they confronted Mr. Traywick for exaggerating Ascendance\u2019s accomplishments and for not paying them what he had promised.They were also frustrated to discover that he had invited several film crews to Jacksonville to witness Mr. Roberts take another round of experimental H.I.V. therapy. But Mr. Roberts knew the compound wasn\u2019t ready, and wouldn\u2019t inject it.A month later, Mr. Traywick filed suit in federal court. Acting as his own lawyer, he said that Mr. Zayner\u2019s Facebook post and Ms. Brown\u2019s article had profoundly impacted his personal and professional life and his business interests. He said they had caused him and his company to suffer significant harm, \u201cincluding financial losses, damage to their reputation, humiliation, embarrassment, mental suffering, shame and emotional distress.\u201d\u201cThese damages are ongoing in nature and will continue to be suffered in the future,\u201d the lawsuit said. It was dismissed on April 23. Six days later, Mr. Traywick\u2019s body was found.\u201cAaron left a trail of destruction as he burned one bridge after the next,\u201d Ms. Rogers, his adoptive cousin, said.\u201cWe knew he had some mental issues going on,\u201d Rita Traywick said. \u201cHis biological family had some issues going on.\u201dDavid Ishee, who first became interested in genetic manipulation because he breeds dogs, said that Mr. Traywick\u2019s approach to biohacking was off the rails. \u201cA lot of people want to go fast,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody who\u2019s new thinks they\u2019re going to have a pet dragon in six weeks. But biology beats you down and you realize, O.K., this is going to take way longer than I expect. I just wanted to make dogs glow, and it\u2019s taken years.\u201dMr. Traywick left a mixed legacy. But his career in biohacking stands as a symbol of the unrealized goals of the community to which he briefly belonged. Shortly after his death, the United States Transhumanist Party, Mr. Stolyarov\u2019s organization, issued a statement.\u201cRegardless of the cause, the U.S. Transhumanist Party emphasizes that death is wrong,\u201d it said. \u201cMr. Traywick\u2019s death is deeply wrong and will remain so. He will be missed by all of us. May his vision live on.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "French Cafe Food, Not So New but Very Much Improved", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review11 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The classic cafes of Parisian boulevards \u2014 rattan chairs and their occupants facing the sun in all but the nastiest weather, waiters stepping nimbly over small dogs \u2014 are central to the city\u2019s street culture, but they\u2019re pretty marginal to its eating and drinking culture now. Cafes may have been known for their namesake drink in Voltaire\u2019s day, but since then their coffee has become internationally notorious. Today the Parisian love of caffeine is more likely to be consummated over flat whites, cortados or, most un-French of all, filtered coffee at a third-wave espresso shop.For the past four months, Ms. Rose has been cooking as if the fate of the planet depended on the tenderness of her cheese omelets, the judiciousness of her vinaigrettes, the airy spaces in her croissants and the crackle of the buckwheat in her savory crepes.As borrowed lifestyles go, it\u2019s a pretty nice one. Many of the servers are dressed in high-waisted, loose-legged trousers and flowing white dress shirts, as if they were in costume for a Fred Astaire movie. Meanwhile, the customers never seem to be rushed or out of sorts, and I started to wonder if they were all extras being paid to sit there looking serene. Or maybe eating next to a room full of expensive vases, Swedish sheepskins, enormous woven baskets and antique tables makes everybody feel as if they are one of the exhibits in a small museum.The theme of the merchandise is craft \u2014 it\u2019s all handmade \u2014 and Ms. Rose has taken this to heart in her kitchen. La Mercerie\u2019s chicken bouillon is simmered and skimmed just the way it should be. Marked by balance and brightness, it is oolong tea to bone broth\u2019s double espresso. Also in the bowl are an egg with a liquid yolk and, down at the bottom, a flock of herb-pasta butterflies, each one the size of the tip of your pinkie.Ms. Rose\u2019s pastries are already some of the finest in the city. Croissants have crisp whorls on top that you can count like tree rings; the savory ones are filled with ham and Comt\u00e9, or broccoli and cherry tomatoes in custard, which may not sound good but is.More exotic is the tourteau fromag\u00e9, a palm-size cheesecake with a blackened, domed top. Born in Poitou-Charentes, it looks something like a Boston cream doughnut, but its interior is a moist, fine-crumbed cake that tastes, just barely, of fresh goat cheese. Ms. Rose serves it with a poached apricot in star-anise syrup. If you are a serious pastry watcher, you will want to add it to your life list.Having recently run up against a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e that seemed to contain no eggs and a plate of profiteroles allowed to get soggy at a purportedly French restaurant nearby, I was relieved to sink into the yolk-rich cr\u00e8me caramel and crisp choux puffs under bittersweet chocolate sauce at La Mercerie. A devout and often disappointed Francophile I ate with eyed the crepes au sucre warily. \u201cThe sugar had better be crunchy,\u201d she said. It was, of course.The menu changes once a day, at noon. The soft-cooked egg goes away, replaced by the omelet. Four main courses arrive, including a very nice piece of roasted salmon with red-wine sauce. Salads appear.It is almost impossible to rave convincingly about salads, so please trust me that La Mercerie\u2019s are great, particularly the ni\u00e7oise, with tuna preserved in oil on the premises and anchovies cured in oil at the source, the Cantabrian Sea.Most things are so precisely as they should be that it is hard to find fault. But I am not sure that a sheet of Calvados-poached apple is of much use to a wedge of Camembert, and I wish that the boeuf bourguignon\u2019s dark and lovely sauce did not slide so easily off the smooth macaroni Ms. Rose sets under the stew. Maybe the buckwheat crepe curled above the creamed chicken reminded me a bit too much of a dosa. But the one around ham, Comt\u00e9 and a fried egg is reassuringly folded like an envelope.The wine list is full of the amenably drinkable bottles you want with this food. As for the coffee, it too is drinkable \u2014 one of the rare departures from French cafe tradition.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}

I have honed my list over many years of traveling for both my job and pleasure. Here are my picks. I will not be taking questions.This is a desperation move for the times you don\u2019t want to pull into a fast-food restaurant, and you\u2019ve got miles to go before you rest. A couple of caveats: They have to look fresh, and the buns have to be stored in a warming bin.A call that needs to be made in the field: Corn Nuts are a crisp, reliable alternative to Fritos, which can get tiresome fast. Combos satisfy the part of you that has been thinking about pretzels for 120 miles but knows how one-note they can be.Sometimes you need a little fruit pick-me-up. Do not touch any banana that is starting to show too much ripeness. (Note: Peel disposal can be an issue.)A lot of chew to the mile, without too much sugar.You get crunch, sweetness and ease of consumption here, and they can hang around on the console for long-term, intermittent snacking.Weird local brands are best. If there are fresh cracklings, this item moves to the top of my list. (Pro tip: Grab a packet of salsa to dump into the bag.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Tesla Seems Worried It\u2019s Consuming Too Much Cash: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s plan to cut back on capital expenditures.\u2022 Why Apple\u2019s share repurchases have been good for investors.\u2022 Will the Fed offer clues about future rate increases?\u2022 How activist investors shook Xerox.Tesla in recent weeks has faced concerns that it is consuming too much cash as it tries to produce a new model of electric car.Now, Tesla itself seems to share those worries.While reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to \u201csignificantly cut back\u201d the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash.Cash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it\u2019s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers.In its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in.But the company is running out of room for maneuver. Cash on Tesla\u2019s balance sheet at the end of the first quarter fell to $2.7 billion from $3.4 billion in the previous quarter. And the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on a conference call on Wednesday said the company did not want to raise fresh capital.Analysts on the conference call asked what capital expenditures Tesla may reduce in order to meet its lower target. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company might be able to spend less as it attempts to rationalize its production. But when an analyst then asked Mr. Musk about Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, the chief executive did not answer the question and told the operator to move to another questioner. Around this time, Tesla\u2019s stock slid sharply in the after-market trading.-- Peter EavisTesla lost nearly $800 million in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarter in a row it has lost money.But Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn and could make money in the second half of the year. That, of course, came with a major caveat: Tesla achieving its latest goals for Model 3 production, which is well behind schedule.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s net loss increased to $784.6 million from a loss of $397.2 million a year ago.\u2022 Tesla\u2019s adjusted loss per share came in at $3.35. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a loss per share of $3.58.\u2022 Revenue climbed to $3.41 billion, topping analyst expectations of $3.28 billion.Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, and analysts said investor expectations may have been overblown and voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company\u2019s average revenue per user.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Spotify reported a first-quarter loss of \u20ac169 million ($202 million), or \u20ac1.01 a share, from \u20ac173 million, or \u20ac1.15, in the same period a year earlier.\u2022 Spotify posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago\u2022 Revenue rose 26 percent to 1.139 billion euros. Analysts had expected 1.143 billion euros.\u2022 Monthly active users increased 30 percent from a year ago to 170 million.\u2022 Paid subscribers rose 45 percent from a year ago to 75 million.\u2022 Average revenue per user fell to 4.72 euros from 5.32 euros in 2017.\u2022 Gross margins were 24.9 percent.What is in the executive order, which could be released within days:\u2022 It is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China\u2019s most prominent technology firms.\u2022 Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption.The order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology.\u2022 On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said it was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns.As expected, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.The central bank acknowledged rising inflation but provided little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.Perhaps the biggest change to the Fed policy statement was the use of the word \u201csymmetric\u201d to describe its inflation target.\u201cThe Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.\u201d\u201cTo the extent there is a surprise in the policy statement, it is that the addition of the description of the 2% inflation objective as being \u2018symmetric.\u2019 This intended to reinforce some of the inflation rhetoric that has indicated that deviation of inflation to the upside will not necessarily elicit a policy response, especially in light of the prolonged period of below-target inflation.\u201dApple\u2019s stock buyback program isn\u2019t just bigger than those of other companies, it\u2019s also better at doing what investors want share repurchases to do.Apple on Tuesday said it was going to buy back another $100 billion of its own stock. The company announced the plan as it is about to complete a $210 billion stock repurchase program. As large as those numbers seem, they don\u2019t reveal the degree to which the repurchases have benefited shareholders. What matters to them is whether Apple has significantly fewer shares outstanding at the end of the program. If that is achieved, Apple\u2019s earnings per share will be higher, which could lead investors to view the stock more positively.Apple\u2019s diluted shares outstanding have fallen nearly 24 percent over the past five years. Here\u2019s how that compares with some companies that are known for their large stock buybacks. Over the past five years, IBM\u2019s shares outstanding have declined by some 18 percent, Cisco\u2019s have decreased just over 8 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s have fallen by 7.5 percent.Apple\u2019s cash flow statements show it has spent nearly $200 billion on stock repurchases over the past five years, which works out at 57 percent of its cash flow from operations for the period. That percentage is also above that of other companies. The cash Cisco spent on stock repurchases over the past five years amounted to 46 percent of its cash flow from operations. At IBM, that number was 44 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisMost everyone expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.But investors and policymakers will comb over the Fed\u2019s policy statement for clues about whether the central bank plans to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed.Here\u2019s what to watch:\u2022 Any new signs of officials expressing concern about an acceleration in prices.

{"Headline": "The Green-Feathered Terror That Slaughtered Bats in Spain", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "The largest bat in Europe, a vulnerable species, found shelter in a city park\u2019s trees. Then they started to turn up dead.Supported byThe greater noctule is the largest bat in Europe. It is listed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d on the threatened species list, but for many years these winged mammals found shelter in the hollows of trees at Mar\u00eda Luisa Park in Seville, Spain.Then a few years ago, they started to turn up dead. The corpses were savaged, with holes torn in their wings, scientists who study the colony discovered. Many of them were nursing pups; one corpse was a pregnant female. Two bats that managed to survive were so injured that they could not climb or fly back up to their nests. What was behind the attacks?The culprit turned out to be another park inhabitant: beautiful, invasive rose-ringed parakeets who also make their homes in tree hollows.When scientists first began studying the bats more than 15 years ago, they didn\u2019t pay much attention to the birds. But now, there are thousands of them, and they are pushing the bats out of their holes, killing some, and taking over the trees where noctules once lived. In a cage, or its own habitat in Asia and Africa, the rose-ringed parakeet is a charming, sociable bird. Martina Carrete, a conservation biologist who is an author of the new paper, said the parakeets are believed to have first appeared in the park after about 10 of them were confiscated from a pet shop and released around 1990. \u201cAt this time, nobody expected that they could become an aggressive invasive species,\u201d she said. Dailos Hern\u00e1ndez-Brito, the graduate student who is the study\u2019s lead author, first began looking into the relationship between the birds and the bats more closely in 2013. \u201cWe were very surprised because in this year we found out that most of the trees previously occupied by noctules were at this moment occupied by parakeets,\u201d said Dr. Carrete. And then they started to find the bodies and witness the attacks. The first attack Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez-Brito saw was against a pregnant female bat. He and collaborators then saw more than 30 attacks in the last two years and collected 20 bodies presented in the current study, though there likely have been many more deaths.Today, the number of trees that noctules live in has dropped by 81 percent since the researchers first began keeping track, with the parakeets taking over the bats\u2019 old homes. Although it is difficult to get exact numbers for the bat population, it appears to have roughly halved since the work began, bringing their numbers down to about 250. The bats are also living in tight quarters, with double the old number occupying a given hole. The scientists helped the city government come up with an eradication plan to get rid of the parakeets in 2016, but at the last moment, officials canceled the plans. The parakeets are popular, and citizens argued there must be some other way besides killing them \u2014 perhaps artificial nest boxes for the bats. However, the bats do not take to such nests well, and the situation is growing urgent. The parakeet population will surpass 3,000 this year. Dr. Carrete hopes that this paper will help provide evidence that if the noctules are to be saved, eradication is the only option. Advertisement"}

The privacy law essentially compels companies operating globally to play by stricter European Union rules if they want to keep doing business there. It entitles us \u201cdata subjects\u201d to move our information from one platform to another; to know how and by whom it is being used; and to contest a decision made by an algorithm, among other things. By reaching extraterritorially, regulators make it harder for companies to shop around for friendly jurisdictions to avoid these rules.In broader terms, the regulation is an attempt to make sense of newly complex and decentralized relationships among individuals, their data, the state and the private sector that have emerged under globalization.These are relationships we negotiate and renegotiate every day.The digital privacy law\u2019s \u201cdata subject\u201d gets at the same idea, by tethering what\u2019s done with our data to places on earth. The law doesn\u2019t draw borders around the data itself, or indeed around us; it acknowledges that on the internet, individuals and their data travel all over. Under the new law, you can be a citizen of the United States, a resident of Japan and a European \u201cdata subject\u201d at the same time.And this time, the borders are being drawn around corporations. The law\u2019s extraterritorial reach ensures that corporations can\u2019t weasel their way out. Like so many laws, this one is meant to provide some protections to vulnerable populations from those who wield a lot of power. In the digital world, the power rests with a small handful of multinational leviathans; all of us are vulnerable, and we can be exploited without even knowing it. The new privacy law acknowledges the dangerous power of these companies while attempting to return some personal sovereignty to their clients, the people.We should all start thinking of ourselves not just as clients of a company, residents of a state or citizens of a country, but also as data subjects of the world. Data is currency; creating and holding it is power. This power has gone to Google, Facebook, Amazon and the other neo-feudal masters that use it to their advantage, not ours.If it takes a European Union bureaucrat\u2019s definition of \u201cdata subject\u201d to help us wrest back some of that power, I\u2019m O.K. with that, because what\u2019s done to us should be a matter of fundamental rights, whether online or in real life. Technological innovations should be for the good of the world, not just the market.

{"Headline": "The Great Breakup: The First Arrivals to the Americas Split Into Two Groups", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "The earliest populations in the Americas would not mingle again for thousands of years. Why they separated is still a mystery.Supported byEarly inhabitants of the Americas split into two populations over 13,000 years ago, according to a new study of ancient DNA, and remained separated for thousands of years.Eventually, somewhere, the two groups met again and began commingling. Today, their descendants inhabit a vast region stretching from Mexico to the southern tip of South America.\u201cThis study is important because it begins to move us away from overly simplistic models of how people first spread throughout the Americas,\u201d said Deborah A. Bolnick, a geneticist at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved in the study.Until the 1990s, archaeological sites provided much of the evidence for the spread of people across the Americas. There\u2019s firm archaeological evidence that people had reached southern Chile by 14,500 years ago, for example; some researchers even argue that people arrived several thousand years earlier.Yet archaeology alone has left many questions unanswered, such as who exactly lived in those early sites and how they were related to each other. Geneticists are seeking to answer some of those questions by looking at the DNA of living Native Americans.Early studies on small fragments of genes suggested that all Native Americans south of the Arctic descended from the same group of migrants, who may have traveled across the Bering Land Bridge connecting Asia to what is now Alaska at the end of the last ice age.But the pace of this research slowed in the early 2000s, thanks in part to the distrust that many Native American communities felt toward scientists after a long history of abuse.As scientists learned how to extract DNA from ancient human remains, a similar conflict arose.Many museums store Native American skeletons, often exhumed without consent from burial grounds. Native American communities reclaimed many of these remains and often turned down research requests.In recent years, however, these strains have started to ease.Each summer, Ripan Malhi, a geneticist at the University of Illinois and co-author of the new study, and his colleagues run a workshop at the University of Illinois to train Native American students in genetics, focusing on research that can help their communities.He also has established long-running relationships with Native American communities in Canada and Alaska.Christiana Scheib, another co-author on the new study, traveled to California to meet with tribal representatives. She explained why she wanted to study Native American remains in California museums.\u201cSome of them were surprised,\u201d said Dr. Scheib, who now heads the ancient DNA research group at the University of Tartu in Estonia. \u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re the first researcher to talk to us and ask our opinion.\u2019\u201dIn the new study, Dr. Scheib, Dr. Malhi and their colleagues searched for DNA in remains they had gained permission to study. They succeeded in finding genetic material in the teeth and ear bones of 91 individuals.In some cases, they were only able to retrieve fragments of DNA; in other instances, they found enough material for an accurate reconstruction of the entire genome.The researchers then compared the new data to publicly available genetic information about other people \u2014 both living and ancient \u2014 in North and South America. The scientists also looked at DNA from communities in Asia for close relatives.At first, the family tree that emerged was baffling, suggesting close genetic connections between distantly related people. \u201cWe kept getting results that didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Dr. Scheib said.A closer look resolved some of the mystery.From their data, the researchers concluded that living Native Americans descended from a population of Asians who moved into Alaska and then expanded southward, likely along the coast.Soon afterward, that original population split into two groups, which Dr. Scheib and her colleagues call ANC-A and ANC-B.At some point, at least a few ANC-B people must have moved far to the east: Dr. Scheib and her colleagues found that people as old as 4,800 years in what is now southern Ontario belonged to ANC-B.Once they arrived, these people put down roots. Algonquin-speaking people living today in Ontario also belong to ANC-B.But when the scientists looked at DNA from people in California and further south, they were surprised to discover mixtures of ANC-A and ANC-B ancestry.The oldest evidence for this mixture comes from people who lived 4,500 years ago on what are now the Channel Islands, off the coast of California. These people were 58 percent ANC-A and 42 percent ANC-B.The researchers found similar DNA mixtures in living people in Mexico and South America.Dr. Scheib and her colleagues put forward a few scenarios that might explain these results.It\u2019s possible that ANC-A people moved down the western coast of the Americas, establishing fishing communities along the way. Thousands of years later, a lineage of people descending from the ANC-B group also expanded southward, making contact with those communities.Another possibility is that the two groups came together somewhere in North America. Only later did their descendants expand through the two continents.Dr. Malhi said that there may well have been other massive migrations in the Americas. In the new study, for example, the researchers found that ancient people in what is now Ontario, as well as living Native Americans in places like Alaska, had ancestry related to the Inuit of Greenland.It\u2019s possible, then, that Arctic people moved south in the past few thousand years, mixing their genes with those of ANC-B people.One way to explore these hypotheses is to find more ancient DNA from other parts of the Americas. But first Dr. Malhi said that he and his colleagues also want to talk with living Native Americans about their histories.Their stories may preserve information about contacts between distantly related peoples in the far past.\u201cBy not just looking at genes but also talking with communities, we might be able to find something,\u201d said Dr. Malhi.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a university that was sued by the Havasupai Tribe. It was Arizona State University, not the University of Arizona.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italian President\u2019s Loyalty to the Euro Creates Chaos", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 He\u2019s been called \u201cgray,\u201d \u201cinvisible\u201d and \u201cgentle to the point of seeming fragile.\u201d Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister, once compared him to \u201ca monk.\u201dMr. Mattarella\u2019s defenders hailed him as the courageous protector of Italy\u2019s democracy, institutions and financial health, while fuming populists sought to make the usually revered figure of the Italian head of state the country\u2019s public enemy No. 1. They called for his impeachment, saying he had overstepped his constitutional bounds with delusions of grandeur, blocked the will of the people and destroyed Italian democracy.In response, Mr. Mattarella privately plugged along.On Monday morning, as markets rose and fell with the whiplashing events in Italy, Mr. Mattarella gave a new mandate to form a government to Carlo Cottarelli, a respected economist, former International Monetary Fund official and Italian government appointee, who told reporters that he would form a caretaker government only with the goal of passing a budget and guiding Italy to new elections.If Parliament votes in support of his caretaker government, elections would take place in early 2019. If it does not, which seems much more likely, he would quit \u201cimmediately\u201d and elections would take place sometime after August.Mr. Cottarelli\u2019s main goal in speaking on Monday seemed to be to assure nervous investors in Italy and abroad that the country was in good hands. He guaranteed, \u201cin the most absolute way, that a government led by me would assure a cautious management of our national accounts,\u201d and that Italy\u2019s \u201ccontinuous participation in the eurozone\u201d was essential.It was Mr. Mattarella\u2019s loyalty to the euro that prompted the 11th-hour collapse of the nascent government of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the anti-immigrant League.He determined that the alliance\u2019s proposed economy minister, Paolo Savona, the co-author of a guide to leaving the eurozone, could lead Italy to abandon the euro without sufficient public debate, being that the parties maintained vague and shifting positions on the issue during the campaign leading up to the March 4 elections.But in deliberately forcing a new election over the euro, which a majority of Italians say they support, the usually careful and measured Mr. Mattarella expressly put an explosive issue with the potential of transforming Europe front and center. And by using his constitutional powers to block the new government in order to protect Italian savings accounts from increasingly wary markets, he also handed the gifted and gleefully hostile populist parties the talking point of a lifetime before the elections.The coming vote \u201cwill be a referendum on Europe, on the euro and on the Italian constitutional model,\u201d Francesco Verderami, a political analyst, wrote in Corriere della Sera on Monday. \u201cBecause it is equally clear that the presidency of the republic \u2014 which has been threatened with impeachment \u2014 during the electoral campaign is sure to be one of the targets of the populist and nationalist forces.\u201dIt did not take long for that to come to pass.Luigi Di Maio, Five Star\u2019s political leader, called on party members to demonstrate their opposition to Mr. Mattarella and \u201cthe darkest night of Italian democracy\u201d by hanging Italian flags out their windows, marching in the streets and flooding the social networks where the party developed its support.In a Facebook post, Mr. Di Maio said that Mr. Mattarella had prompted problems in the markets by creating uncertainty. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave the euro,\u201d he insisted, calling the party\u2019s well-documented ambivalence to the common currency \u201ca lie created by the counselors of Mattarella.\u201dOn Monday, several analysts and politicians accused Mr. Salvini, who rebuffed Mr. Mattarella\u2019s appeal to substitute the proposed economy minister with a top League official, of purposely blowing up the government in order to bank increased electoral support in new elections. He wants to be prime minister.Leading members of the Five Star Movement proclaimed the new technical government dead on arrival and said they would introduce impeachment proceedings against Mr. Mattarella in Parliament.But their efforts to intimidate Mr. Mattarella last week, saying he should not get in the way of Italian voters, failed. Some supporters argued that the potential blowback and risk in coming elections was worth keeping the populists, who have shown disregard for Italian institutions, away from power.Mario Calabrese, the editor of the left-leaning daily La Repubblica, wrote in a front-page editorial, \u201cIf the president had given in, folding before the ultimatums and threats, and if he went back on his only objection, the state\u2019s checks and balances would have broken into pieces.\u201dMr. Berlusconi, the former prime minister and coalition partner of Mr. Salvini, also gave his support to Mr. Mattarella, saying the Five Star Movement was \u201cirresponsible as always, talking about impeachment.\u201d\u201cForza Italia waits for the determination of the head of state, but when necessary will be ready for the vote,\u201d he added, referring to his party.Both he and the Five Star Movement unveiled campaign language in which they accused Italy of being held hostage by Germany, international markets, bankers and the overreaching president who did their bidding.Constitutional scholars debated on Monday whether Mr. Mattarella was within his rights. In Corriere della Sera, Italy\u2019s leading paper, Massimo Luciani, a professor of constitutional law at La Sapienza University in Rome, said Mr. Mattarella \u201cexercised his constitutional rights\u201d because he \u201cbelieved that the choice of a certain minister for a key government position put the interests of our country at risk.\u201dHe added, \u201cThis is an institutional evaluation.\u201dBut Paolo Flores D\u2019Arcais wrote in the political magazine MicroMega that while the president can object to the appointment of a minister if \u201che finds in the candidate\u2019s past behavior something that conflicts with honorability,\u201d Mr. Mattarella\u2019s problem with the economy minister was his position on the euro.\u201cIt falls beyond the powers of the president of the republic to judge the candidates\u2019 political opinions in the single ministries,\u201d he wrote.At first, markets seemed more appreciative of Mr. Mattarella\u2019s rejection of the populist government, but they then fell sharply, with stocks and bonds falling as investors digested the increased uncertainty.\u201cDevelopments in Italy are likely to keep the financial markets on tenterhooks,\u201d analysts at the German lender Commerzbank said in a note to clients Monday morning. Referring to polls that indicate that Italy\u2019s populist parties are likely to win any snap election called this year, they continued, \u201cThe entry into office of an Italian government that is on a confrontational course with the E.U. and disregards its rules is only postponed.\u201dItaly\u2019s benchmark stock index, the FTSE MIB, was down more than 2 percent in afternoon trading in Europe, and the country\u2019s bonds took a beating. The yield on the main 10-year Italian government bond, which moves inversely to its price, rose to as much as 2.69 percent, its highest level since August 2014.The \u201cspread\u201d between Italian government bonds and their German counterparts, in particular, has widened considerably since the start of the year, indicating investors see Italian debt as a riskier investment.That \u201cspread,\u201d a word often uttered with venom by Italian populists, was also the focus of Mr. Mattarella\u2019s remarks Sunday night, and Mr. Cottarelli\u2019s on Monday morning.But it is the coming election, and the promised centrality of the euro in it, that makes many in Europe nervous. Mr. Mattarella, a 76-year-old Sicilian, has shown he is not easily shaken.The son of a government minister, he decided to go into politics after his older brother, Piersanti, then the governor of Sicily, was shot and killed by the Mafia. Mr. Mattarella pulled his bloodied brother out of the car.The first time he ran for office was in the 1970s, when he ran for a position in his university.

{"Headline": "Xiaomi, Chinese Gadget Maker, Opens Floodgates for Hong Kong I.P.O.s", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A gadget maker. An online delivery service. And the electronic payment company tied to the tech giant Alibaba.These are among a spate of Chinese companies expected to open their doors to ordinary investors in Hong Kong over the next year through public listings, after a loosening of rules by the city\u2019s stock exchange. If many of them end up listing in Hong Kong, then China will have accomplished a major goal: keeping its hugely successful tech boom at home.The flurry of big-name Chinese companies potentially choosing to stay home, rather than go abroad, in search of funding is part of a broader push by China, which has sought to develop homegrown champions in an array of sectors. But the new regulations, which allow companies to retain more control, have also been criticized as an encroachment by Beijing on Hong Kong\u2019s legal system and corporate governance standards.Xiaomi, the gadget maker, announced on Thursday that it would list in Hong Kong, the first company to do so after the rule changes.\u201cThere has been somewhat of a campaign to bring companies home and remove them from foreign jurisdictions,\u201d Mr. Webb said.While Hong Kong is officially a special administrative region within the People\u2019s Republic of China, and has a separate legal and financial system, Beijing sees it as a part of the mainland. Some of China\u2019s biggest and most exciting technology start-ups, like Didi Chuxing, the ride-sharing rival to Uber, and Ant Financial, the financial arm of Alibaba, are making plans to go public over the next year.In the past, Chinese entrepreneurs like Jack Ma of Alibaba chose to list their shares in markets, like New York, where they could operate as if their companies were still private. They were able to offer so-called dual-class shares, which give shareholders little say in the operations of the business.Until last week, Hong Kong, which has stricter rules than New York, had not allowed such listings. In its filing on Thursday with Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange, Xiaomi appeared to be taking advantage of the new rules.The company, whose low-cost smartphones have won a loyal following not just in China but in other emerging markets like India as well, said it would raise an unspecified amount from the public in order to fund the development of new smartphones and other devices like household gadgets. The money will also help Xiaomi pursue expansion overseas.It could raise as much as $10 billion, according to two people with direct knowledge of the company but not authorized to speak on the record. That would make it the second-largest listing by a Chinese technology company since Alibaba in 2014.As part of the listing, which could come as soon as June, Xiaomi will offer dual-class shares, which allow for weighted voting rights. This will mean that Lei Jun, Xiaomi\u2019s founder, chairman and chief executive, will have the ultimate say over the company\u2019s operations, rather than investors who buy its shares, even if they end up owning more stock than he decides to hold on to.This share structure will allow the company to benefit from Mr. Lei\u2019s \u201cvision and leadership\u201d while allowing him to maintain its \u201clong-term prospects and strategy,\u201d Xiaomi said in its filing.The decision by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong to allow dual-class shares just one week ago has sparked fierce debate here. For the exchange, not allowing companies to list with such a structure meant it missed out on lucrative listings like Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion initial public offering. Alibaba opted to list in New York, where several large technology companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, operate with dual-class shares.But some in the city\u2019s investor community had pushed hard to prevent Hong Kong from changing its rules, arguing that it will mean less rigorous corporate governance.\u201cThere should not be unequal voting rights as they could allow management or minority share owners to override the wishes or best interests of majority shareholders for personal benefit and compromise accountability, leading to potential entrenchment issues,\u201d Mary Leung, head of advocacy for Asia at CFA Institute, an association of investment professionals, said in a statement.Some big institutional investors have criticized Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange for throwing out tighter regulations in a bid to compete with rivals.There are also longer-term concerns that companies will not be as closely scrutinized in the future in Hong Kong, which was once a British colony. As part of the British handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the territory was promised 50 years of self-administration. But in recent years, the city has experienced encroachment on its independence, and investors have raised concerns that its strong regulatory and legal institutions are slowly being eroded by Beijing.To these critics, Hong Kong\u2019s decision to allow dual-class shares is further evidence of that erosion.\u201cBeijing is much happier raising capital in a city that they can partially control rather than handing over all the listings to U.S. markets,\u201d said Andrew Collier, the founder of research firm Orient Capital Research. \u201cAt the end of the day, the Hong Kong stock market is going to be creeping slowly toward Chinese-style regulation.\u201dMr. Li did not respond to a request for comment. But in his blog post he said the exchange was \u201cintroducing additional safeguards to protect investors against the potential misuse of power,\u201d including more corporate governance requirements and certain limits on founding shareholders in these structures.The exchange\u2019s move to loosen its requirements is expected to trigger a spurt of initial public offerings this year and next amid growing appetite across global public markets for new technology companies.Meituan-Dianping, an online delivery service for food and consumer products, is making preparations for an initial public offering in Hong Kong this year, according to two people with direct knowledge of the company but not authorized to speak on the record.Ant Financial, the electronic financial services firm tied to Alibaba, is going through one final fund-raising round before it also decides whether to list its shares publicly late this year or early next year, according to these people.And the Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing is in talks for its own listing, according to one of these people. It is not clear where it would choose to list.Despite the criticism about corporate governance in Hong Kong, its rules remain stricter than New York\u2019s \u2014 for now.Tencent Music, the streaming service owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent, is in talks with various banks to help it go public. It is expected to choose New York, where companies can use the dual-class share structure even if the founding shareholder is a company and not an individual. This would allow Tencent, the parent of Tencent Music, to maintain control.In Hong Kong, the dual-class share structure is available only for individuals. But the city\u2019s stock exchange has already begun seeking feedback from the investor community about loosening this rule, too.An earlier version of this article misstated the relationship between Alibaba and Ant Financial. They are both controlled by Jack Ma; Alibaba does not own Ant Financial. The article also misstated the given name of the chief executive of Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange. He is Charles Li, not Richard Li.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ireland\u2019s Abortion Referendum Becomes a Test for Facebook and Google", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "Major tech companies took steps to prevent foreign meddling online before voters in Ireland cast ballots on Friday. Here\u2019s how those efforts are working out.Supported byMr. Dwyer, who co-founded an election transparency group, pulled up one anti-abortion YouTube video that had only a few views when it was posted last year. After the video was republished as a referendum campaign ad on Facebook by a group from an unknown location, it attracted more than 1.2 million views, he said. He also showed an anti-abortion ad on Facebook that purported to be from an unbiased organization, but was also purchased by a buyer who couldn\u2019t be traced.\u201cWith social media in this campaign, our democracy is up for sale to the highest bidder and we\u2019re blindfolded at the auction,\u201d said Mr. Dwyer, 28, who runs the Transparent Referendum Initiative, which is pushing for new campaign disclosure laws for digital advertising.Critics warn that if Facebook and Google cannot minimize their negative influence in a country the size of Ireland, which has a population of 4.8 million, far bigger challenges will loom with the midterm elections in the United States this November.Even so, the effectiveness of the companies\u2019 actions in Ireland has not been clear cut \u2014 and it may take months, if not years, to know whether any disinformation campaigns broke through their efforts. That\u2019s especially so since ads are only one part of a larger misinformation problem that also includes organic posts.Mr. Dwyer said Facebook\u2019s ban of abortion ads financed by foreign groups had reduced such ads on the social network. Yet abortion ads from international groups continued to make their way online through other digital platforms, and campaign materials were still being posted and shared on Facebook by users, he said.\u201cThe broader question is what information is flowing through the system and how much of that information is pollution and what is not,\u201d said Gavin Sheridan, a co-founder of the online news outlet Storyful, who tracked foreign ad spending for the Irish vote. \u201cWe can\u2019t really know.\u201dNiamh Sweeney, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy for Ireland, said the company blocked foreign political ads on May 8 after finding some worrisome activity. In one instance, she said, the company found a foreign group paying to increase the visibility of Facebook posts created by Irish campaigners. That violated the spirit of Irish law that bans international campaign contributions. Facebook declined to identify the groups involved.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a small thing to do, but we felt it was the right move to make,\u201d Ms. Sweeney said, adding that Facebook\u2019s team in Ireland recommended the action to the company\u2019s Silicon Valley leadership.Google, which banned all referendum-related ads in Ireland on May 9, declined to comment. The company said in a statement this month that it had stopped running the ads to protect the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the vote.The Irish government committed in January to holding a referendum on whether to repeal a 35-year-old constitutional ban \u2014 known as the Eighth Amendment \u2014 on abortion. If a majority of voters approve the repeal, the amendment would be replaced with a new clause stating the Irish Parliament has the power to make laws regulating abortion.Since then, the issue has been hotly debated, with campaign placards taking over downtown Dublin and the referendum dominating conversation. The vote\u2019s outcome appears too close to call.Mr. Dwyer said he began noticing the flood of online abortion ads almost immediately after starting the Transparent Referendum Initiative in February. The ads came from groups with names like Women Betrayed by Abortion, Chicago for Repeal and Eighth Debate.In one ad that Mr. Dwyer traced as coming from a British religious organization, the message read: \u201cDon\u2019t allow more children to be lost to legalized abortion.\u201d Another Facebook ad, posted by a group from an untraceable location, showed the image of a fetus in a toilet.The pileup of such ads helped lead to Facebook\u2019s blockage of political advertising from groups based outside Ireland. In addition, the company introduced a transparency tool so people can see all the ads an organization is airing across the site.Facebook also deployed an artificial intelligence system developed after the 2016 United States presidential campaign to spot foreign ads. The system flags ads that are suspected of coming from outside Ireland by analyzing billing information, where a website originated, what kind of ad-targeting specifications are used, and if the ad host is using a virtual private network to hide where it is based.The system will play a critical role in the company\u2019s future election efforts. Ms. Sweeney said it was still improving and occasionally produced false positives and other inaccuracies.While many Irish are split on the abortion vote, they have been united in their criticism of Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s roles in the referendum.\u201cFacebook and Google are deciding what to do with our referendum,\u201d said Mr. Sheridan, the chief executive of Vizlegal, a maker of legal software, who supports lifting the abortion ban.Mr. Sheridan is part of a volunteer army that uncovered suspicious ads coming from groups outside Ireland. \u201cWe didn\u2019t elect Mark Zuckerberg to make decisions about how our referendum should be run,\u201d he said, referring to Facebook\u2019s chief executive.Others involved in the campaign said they were upset at the internet companies\u2019 ban of political ads because it deprived them of an avenue of influence. John McGuirk, a spokesman for the Save the 8th campaign, which favors retaining the abortion ban, said the group was preparing to spend 40,000 euros on YouTube ads, or the equivalent of about $47,000. But since Google had stopped taking referendum-related spots, they were no longer able to do that.\u201cIt\u2019s frightening the extent to which they can make a decision on the basis of something and be answerable to nobody,\u201d Mr. McGuirk said.\u201cWe need to know who is running the ads and who\u2019s paying for the ads,\u201d said James Lawless, the legislator who sponsored the bill.Facebook said it supported the Irish bill. Google declined to comment.Mr. Dwyer said governments globally must set stricter rules around disclosures of online campaign ads so voters knew who was paying for the material showing up in their Facebook feeds, in their Google search results and on YouTube.\u201cIreland is definitely not unique,\u201d he said. \u201cNo country has cracked this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Why not just own up to it?\u201d \u201cEverything has to be about men,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the time.\u201d To mock the sexism, she assumed the persona of a wild-eyed beauty influencer, and began filming.

Employees share offices and have few of the perks available in Facebook\u2019s building nearby: The main free amenities here are water, coffee and tea.Yet Ms. Dixon will soon gain vast new authority to investigate and fine Facebook, as well as an array of other technology giants with regional headquarters in Ireland. Amid increased concerns over online privacy, a sweeping new European privacy law could make her one of the world\u2019s most consequential regulators.She is eager to test her newfound power. But the question remains whether her tiny agency is able \u2014 or willing \u2014 to stand up to tech behemoths of Silicon Valley.\u201cThere\u2019s a wave coming toward us that we need to push back against,\u201d Ms. Dixon, who spent the first 10 years of her career working for tech companies, said in an interview.Ireland in particular is taking center stage in the wide-ranging battle. The country is the European headquarters for data-hungry companies including Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn.But for all the tough talk, the reality is that her agency subsists on an annual budget of 7.5 million euros, equivalent to $9 million. That\u2019s roughly as much revenue as the companies she oversees generate over all in 10 minutes. Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has hundreds of people globally working on data protection regulation alone, including lawyers and privacy experts hired in Dublin.The data protection office was once an afterthought. During an effort by the Irish government to move less-critical agencies out of Dublin, it was relocated in 2006 50 miles west to a town called Portarlington, population 8,368. Its power was so limited that it could not publicize investigations.Ms. Dixon, whose father was an army officer and mother a schoolteacher, grew up in a small town in central Ireland before moving to Dublin for university. She worked for companies including the business software firm Citrix Systems before moving into government. She later received a postgraduate diploma in computer science.Since taking over in 2014, Ms. Dixon has successfully lobbied for more funding and got the headquarters put back in Dublin. A move to a bigger office is in the works. She has hired lawyers, investigators and engineers. The staff will total 140 this year, up from 30 when she joined, with plans to reach 200 in the next few years, if budget increases are approved.But if data privacy is truly a priority globally, Ms. Dixon said, more resources are needed. Her office is actually among the better funded privacy agencies globally, but is still a minnow compared with, say, Ireland\u2019s financial services regulator, which has a budget about 40 times greater.\u201cThe question for governments is, how much enforcement do we want to do, how seriously do we want to take the risk to our fundamental rights and freedoms in this area?\u201d said Ms. Dixon, carrying a bound copy of the new law. \u201cWe need the funding and resources commensurate with the level of importance. This office would suggest it should be far more highly resourced.\u201dBudgetary constraints are not new to regulators overseeing powerful industries. But privacy groups worry that without strong oversight, the European rules, years in the making, will do little to crimp the power of Silicon Valley.Ms. Dixon must also contend with skepticism among privacy advocates, stemming largely from Ireland\u2019s history of lax oversight of the technology industry.Advocates of the new law say it is already having a positive impact and that oversight is spread out. A new European Data Protection Board will help coordinate investigations and pool resources across European Union countries, giving regulators outside Ireland the ability to bring action. The data protection regulation also allows private groups to recruit consumers into class-action-style complaints \u2014 not as common in Europe as the United States \u2014 that could result in sizable damages against businesses.\u201cWe should be acting as data protection authorities in the name of data subjects, but you often as a regulator in this space have the feeling that you\u2019re not mandated by the general public,\u201d she said. \u201cEither they don\u2019t care or they actively oppose what we\u2019re doing.\u201dRepresentatives from the technology industry have made regular visits to the converted 18th-century Georgian home used by Ms. Dixon\u2019s team. Aware that a public backlash is putting pressure on regulators to rein in Silicon Valley, Facebook and others have been courting Ms. Dixon, putting forward their case that their data protection policies comply with the new European law.\u201cWe\u2019ve really leapt into explaining what we\u2019ve done and the thinking that\u2019s gone into that,\u201d said Stephen Deadman, Facebook\u2019s global deputy chief privacy officer. \u201cI\u2019ve got faith and confidence that the way Helen Dixon\u2019s office will perform its function will be true to the spirit and requirements of G.D.P.R., rather than being blown around by whatever is happening in the media.\u201dGoogle and Twitter declined to comment.Asked if she had a message for him and other tech executives, she said they should expect her to use her new powers \u201cto the fullest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Children of the Opioid Epidemic", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "FeatureIn the midst of a national opioid crisis, mothers addicted to drugs struggle to get off them \u2014 for their babies\u2019 sake, and their own.Supported byAlicia, who asked that I use her nickname to protect her privacy, was 26 at the time, living with her boyfriend in a tiny apartment just outside Providence, R.I. From the start of their relationship, she had been inspired by his seriousness; he had a job in I.T. that paid $20 an hour. Unlike some of her previous boyfriends, this one wore collared shirts to work and did not use drugs. He had a gangly earnestness that was endearing. \u201cHe grew up as a good boy,\u201d Alicia told me. \u201cHe did what was right, and he was smart. I wish I could have been like that.\u201d She had struggled with drugs and alcohol since age 15. Family life was often painful; her father, a mechanic, was an alcoholic (he quit drinking years ago); she has a mentally ill sibling; and her mother, a secretary who later went back to school and became a corporate manager, held the family together in a suburb outside Providence. As a teenager, Alicia was shy and often depressed \u2014 afraid of saying the wrong thing and looking foolish. \u201cAll of this paranoia and social anxiety, it made me very worked up,\u201d she told me last May. \u201cI could never look normal in a social setting.\u201d At 15, she discovered that being high made her loose and funny. \u201cI had my first drink, I tried weed, I had my first cigarette,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was able to go out and hang out with people. I wasn\u2019t isolating myself and staying home. I created a whole new personality of me.\u201d As an older teenager, she began taking the bus into Providence and hanging out with a crowd of drug-using adults, many of whom were homeless. \u201cAfter 18, 19, I felt like, Whoa, I don\u2019t even know who I am without using stuff.\u201dAround that time, she got what she called a \u201cdream job\u201d at a Macy\u2019s Clinique counter, but she was fired for chronic lateness. She had fallen into abusing synthetic marijuana (plant particles sprayed with chemicals), known in Providence as \u201cmonkey.\u201d At her parents\u2019 insistence, she underwent a seven-day inpatient rehab; later, when she was 22, they sent her for a second, longer rehab for excessive drinking. Toward the end of the 18-month period of sobriety that followed, she met her boyfriend and moved with him into his parents\u2019 house. She was 24; he was 28. He encouraged her to apply to cosmetology school, and she arranged for student loans and enrolled in a two-year program. She saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed medication for her depression and anxiety, as well as for obsessive-compulsive disorder.But other struggles persisted. She had a habit of picking at small lesions on her skin, which, early in her new relationship, worsened a staph infection she acquired from sharing makeup. Alicia went to the emergency room twice, but even as she wept from the pain, \u201cin the back of my head I remember thinking, I wonder what they\u2019ll give me?\u201d She left the hospital each time with a prescription for five-milligram Percocets: oxycodone mixed with acetaminophen.\u201cI started doing it as prescribed, maybe one every five hours when you feel the pain,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then I would think, If I take another half of one, I could get high from it. This is when I really made a bad move: I sniffed the pill, and it gave me a different effect. It was a lot more intense. Everything was so slow. I could see and hear everything going on around me. I could control my reactions. Oh, it\u2019s so powerful \u2014 I don\u2019t know what they put in there.\u201dAlicia prickles with intelligent awareness and self-scrutiny. She has large brown eyes; thick, wavy brown hair that reaches her shoulders; and a few tattoos on her ankles and shoulders. Her voice is mellow, almost purring, as if she is perpetually trying to calm someone down. The person most in need of calming is her; she is prone to obsessive fretting. \u201cEven something as small as: I need to call the dentist. I\u2019ll keep saying it over in my head, but I won\u2019t be able to get it done. I\u2019m so overwhelmed I can\u2019t get started.\u201d These repetitive thoughts make her own mind an uncomfortable place to be; in reaction, she sometimes collapses into self-sabotage. \u201cI\u2019ll be like, Whatever, let\u2019s go get a pill, let\u2019s party. Every paperwork you have, you\u2019re like, I can\u2019t finish this. I don\u2019t want to go to the grocery store today. I can go from zero to extreme quickly, and that\u2019s my weakness.\u201dBy the time the 50 pills from her hospital visits ran out, Alicia had formed a conclusion. \u201cI thought: This is my lifestyle. I\u2019m not the best version of myself unless I\u2019m on it.\u201d She had a friend who also liked pills and had connections to buy them, and she soon found herself immersed in a demimonde of chronically ill and disabled people who supported their own addictions by selling a portion of the pills their doctors prescribed. \u201cIt happened so quickly that I became physically dependent,\u201d she told me. \u201cNo one knew. I had a little pill counter. Everything was divided perfectly by the day, by the milligram. I felt like, I\u2019m a safe user with a pill that a doctor has created, and also supplied.\u201dWhen cutting clients\u2019 hair at school, she found that the pills helped her to be relaxed and personable \u2014 resulting in larger tips. \u201cI would get a 10-milligram pill, and I would split it into three. I would take any sort of wrapper that I could fold in half, and I would put a little bit in, I would rub a lighter over it, and then I would use a credit card and get it all into one perfect little line. I would get a little straw and take it right up my nose, and then I would lick the paper and get every last bit of it, and I\u2019d put it back in my little pouch. I\u2019d have two milligrams before this client, another five after. I was just bouncing around like I didn\u2019t have a problem in the world. This made people want to be around me, and I liked that. When I\u2019m sober, I don\u2019t want to be around people too much. I loved the idea of being a superwoman.\u201d As Alicia\u2019s tolerance to the drug increased, the pressure of feeding a mounting 30-to-40-milligram-a-day habit on pills costing a dollar per milligram on the street began to take its toll. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized: I\u2019m very irritable, I\u2019m becoming like a monster because I can\u2019t find these things.\u201d She began fighting with her boyfriend and acting disrespectfully to his mother, who kicked them out of the house. In a new apartment, with rent to pay, the couple\u2019s troubles escalated. Alicia\u2019s boyfriend suspected her of using drugs and would lurk outside the bathroom while she was sniffing pills inside. Their violent fights prompted calls to the police from neighbors, and Alicia and her boyfriend filed domestic charges against each other. In order to keep buying Percocets, she sold the Adderalls she had been prescribed by her psychiatrist for O.C.D. \u201cI became very selfish,\u201d she told me. \u201cEven if I got a little euphoria, it wasn\u2019t fun. I had to take these things just to not physically be sick. I was thinking, This is a lost cause: I\u2019m spending $30, $40, $50 a day. How am I ever going to keep up with this?\u201dIt was at this point that her sickness and fatigue prompted her to take an at-home pregnancy test. Doubting the positive result, she went to a women\u2019s clinic to be retested and learned that she was in her fourth month. Her joy at the prospect of motherhood was laced with terror. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, Oh, my God, I\u2019ve been using, and I\u2019ve had this baby inside me for three and a half months. So I\u2019m freaking out. I\u2019m thinking, What do I do? How am I going to have an addiction and have a baby?\u201d But the tally of babies born into withdrawal also includes the offspring of a great many mothers who go into treatment in the course of their pregnancies. The standard of care for a pregnant women addicted to opioids is medication-assisted treatment: a long-acting opioid substitute \u2014 traditionally methadone \u2014 that binds to the body\u2019s opioid receptors to prevent withdrawal symptoms, usually without causing the euphoric sensations that commandeer the brain\u2019s dopamine system into a relentless quest for more. Pregnant women on methadone or buprenorphine (a newer opioid-replacement drug) are more likely to bring their pregnancies to term, ensuring higher birth weights and better health for their babies. Federal standards mandate that methadone clinics require pregnant clients to receive prenatal care in order to get their medication. Women stabilized on medication-assisted treatment are in far less danger of relapsing, overdosing or contracting H.I.V., hepatitis C or other infections common among those who inject drugs. They experience less maternal stress, which has been shown to negatively impact the fetus\u2019s epigenetics, or gene expression. But because methadone and buprenorphine are still opioids, a fetus adapted to them is still at risk for withdrawal after birth. Most experts feel that this risk is justified. \u201cAs a society, if we\u2019re thinking about the trade-off, it is much better to get Mom into treatment, for her health and her infant\u2019s health, and then have some risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome,\u201d Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told me. Compared with other babies in the neonatal intensive-care unit, \u201cfor the most part, infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome are just not that sick.\u201dSymptoms of withdrawal in newborns range from relatively benign indicators like yawning, sneezing, mottled skin and a high-pitched cry to more serious problems like diarrhea, difficulty feeding and, very rarely, seizures. Doctors can\u2019t predict which babies will develop the syndrome, although factors like maternal smoking, anti-anxiety drugs and antidepressants have been shown to increase the likelihood. Although there are common practices, there is no uniform protocol on how to diagnose or treat NAS; morphine, methadone and buprenorphine are all currently given to newborns, while some doctors believe that, except in extreme cases, swaddling and skin-to-skin contact with the mother are sufficient. Nor has it been determined what, if any, long-term effects NAS might have on a child; the first longitudinal study, a multisite N.I.H. study begun in 2014, in which 117 babies treated for NAS will receive developmental tests at 18 months, is still underway.Addiction is now widely recognized as a mental disorder, and the medical establishment and communities are more likely to treat people with drug dependency as victims of an illness. But this more generous spirit rarely extends to pregnant women in the grip of addiction, who are still widely seen as perpetrators. In 24 states and the District of Columbia, the use of any illegal substance during pregnancy constitutes child abuse, and in Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, it is grounds for civil commitment: court-ordered institutionalization \u2014 say, to a drug-treatment program \u2014 regardless of the woman\u2019s wishes or needs (using a drug once doesn\u2019t mean she is addicted to it). In just the past few months, authorities in Oklahoma and Montana have announced new initiatives to prosecute pregnant women who use drugs or alcohol. In Alabama, according to a report by ProPublica and AL.com, at least 479 pregnant women were prosecuted \u2014 and some imprisoned \u2014 between 2006 and 2015 under the \u201cchemical endangerment\u201d law originally aimed at parents who risked their children\u2019s lives by cooking methamphetamine at home. This results in a crazy quilt of punitive approaches to pregnant women with drug problems, which vary arbitrarily by region, county and local politics. In New Jersey, a woman on methadone was charged with child abuse in 2011 because her baby had NAS \u2014 an entirely predictable outcome of following the standard of care. In Wisconsin, a pregnant woman who told her doctor she had successfully weaned herself off painkillers was forced onto methadone in 2013 by a skeptical judge who decided she still needed treatment \u2014 thus needlessly putting her baby at risk for NAS. Barry Lester, director of the Brown Center at Women and Infants Hospital in Providence and principal investigator of the Maternal Lifestyle Study, a 16-year landmark longitudinal study of babies exposed to cocaine in utero, told me, \u201cIn the \u201980s and early \u201990s, the initial reports were talking about cocaine causing massive brain damage: \u2018These kids are going to be in wheelchairs.\u2019 Then the real data started coming in, showing that, yes, there are cocaine effects, but you\u2019re looking at something more like A.D.H.D. than heart effects and brain damage. You have to realize that there is a certain amount of prejudice against women who use drugs. The expectation \u2014 almost the wish \u2014 is that there\u2019ll be something wrong with these kids so we can blame these mothers again, like we love to do.\u201dHealth experts deplore the societal impulse to blame and punish drug-dependent women who find themselves pregnant because it discourages them from seeking treatment \u2014 even in the 19 states where a publicly funded drug-treatment program specifically for pregnant women exists. Not only does inhibiting a woman from treatment harm both fetus and mother, they say, it also squanders a rare opportunity to intervene constructively in a woman\u2019s addiction. \u201cSometimes a pregnancy is when women see past their own traumas to have that clarity to move forward,\u201d Dr. Lauren Jansson, director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at Johns Hopkins, told me. \u201cTreatment works, and especially for this population. They have a lot to gain.\u201dOn Monday morning, she registered at Codac, a drug-treatment clinic in Providence, where nearly 2 percent of the clients are pregnant women. \u201cI had no idea what methadone was,\u201d Alicia told me. \u201cBut as long as I could be involved with something that kept the baby safe, that\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d She was prescribed an initial dose of 20 milligrams of methadone to replace the 30 to 40 milligrams of Percocet she had been taking each day, and was instructed to visit the clinic daily between 5:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. There, she would wait in line at a dosing window and be given a small plastic cup of clear liquid. Like all clients at Codac, she would be required to participate in drug counseling and to submit to drug tests, or \u201ctox screens.\u201d If she had consistently \u201cclean urines,\u201d as clients tend to call it, for 90 days, and followed other rules, she would be rewarded with a \u201ctake-home\u201d dose once a week, sealed in a small plastic bottle. After several days, Alicia screwed up her courage and told her boyfriend about her drug problem. \u201cI was all choked up,\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe was really shocked. He said, \u2018I knew something was up, I just hoped it wasn\u2019t that bad.\u2019 I think it was kind of relieving to him that I wasn\u2019t out at a club or at the casino; I was just searching for these pills. But when we get into arguments, he\u2019ll bring up things like, \u2018You\u2019re a dopehead,\u2019 and it\u2019s really hurtful.\u201d She also told her mother, in a Facebook message, and her mother was loving and supportive. After going to Codac, Alicia found an obstetrician in her town and signed a release permitting him to be in direct contact with the clinic, which was required to ensure her prenatal care. \u201cI told him everything that I had been doing, and they did a lot more extensive ultrasounds than they would normally do on your average patient. It was causing me tons of panic attacks: I was thinking, What did I do to the baby already?\u201d Her tendency toward frenetic worry was worsened by the fact that her psychiatrist, on learning she was pregnant, had stopped her anxiety and depression medications. Neither Alicia nor the Codac nurse who works with pregnant clients had been able to find another doctor willing to prescribe them for a pregnant woman on methadone. Alicia smoked marijuana during her pregnancy, she said, to cope with her anxiety and nausea. Each morning, before going to cosmetology school (and, after graduation, to her full-time hair-cutting job), Alicia stopped at Codac to be dosed. She recoiled from the clientele. \u201cI don\u2019t want to judge everybody, but if you can\u2019t put some clothes on by 12:30, you\u2019re still in a bad lifestyle. You can tell from their conversations that a lot of people are still using.\u201d The discovery shook her; she had believed that methadone blocked the potential to get high (it does for opioids, but only to a point), and this new knowledge felt dangerous. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t pregnant, I would be the first one to say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s see if it still works,\u2019\u2009\u201d she told me. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do that, and I don\u2019t want to do it, but I\u2019ve thought about it a million times. It\u2019s scary, because my mind is still being controlled by the pills.\u201d This feature of addiction \u2014 a compulsion to be high that circumvents logic, judgment and self-interest \u2014 is what can prompt relapses even years after the body has been cured of all physical dependence. Early last May, three weeks before Alicia\u2019s due date, I met her at Codac during a gathering of about two dozen of the clinic\u2019s pregnant clients. The clinic sits in the shadow of an expressway, and as the 12:30 dosing deadline approaches, clients can be seen loping from underneath it to reach the doors before they\u2019re locked. Inside, the atmosphere was gritty, with placards in the hall warning that tox screens now included a test for fentanyl.The gathering of women was billed as a baby shower, but mostly it was a chance for pregnant clients to meet one another and talk with representatives of First Connections and Healthy Families America: groups that support high-risk women, including opioid users, and their newborns. Much of the discussion among the women centered on neonatal abstinence syndrome: dread and guilt at the idea of their babies experiencing withdrawal; stories about friends whose babies had to go through it. Alicia chatted with Lyndsey, 31, who had brought along her feisty 8-month-old son. Like Alicia, Lyndsey was addicted to Percocet before switching to methadone, and her son spent three weeks being treated for NAS. \u201cThey took such good care of him,\u201d she said of Women and Infants Hospital, where 80 percent of babies in Rhode Island are born, and where Alicia would soon deliver. \u201cAs soon as he started the medicine, he really didn\u2019t have any symptoms. In the big picture, that was such a small glimpse. I forget that it happened.\u201d Pregnancy had galvanized Lyndsey; drug-free for 16 months, she was assembling student loans to begin nursing school. I struck up a conversation with Elizabeth (her middle name), who was 26, petite and fair, with long straight hair, blond at the ends from grown-out highlights, and an air of apologetic sweetness. She looked impossibly young for someone with her history, which she shared with a trusting openness I\u2019ve found to be characteristic of people in recovery. Her baby girl was due in June. Like Alicia, she had been energized and secretive in the early years of her addiction, working as a day care teacher and also assisting families of children with autism, through a state program that provides helpers in their homes. At the same time, she was addicted to Percocet and ultimately began injecting heroin. In 2015, at age 24, she started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings with her stepfather, a recovered alcoholic. In the two years since, she had been on and off methadone (which she hated) and buprenorphine, but she had relapsed on heroin three times, well before her pregnancy. During one relapse, she shared a needle and contracted hepatitis C, a viral infection of the liver that, according to one study, may afflict as many as 50 percent of pregnant women with opioid-use disorder. Elizabeth returned to Codac just days before the shower, in her seventh month of pregnancy, to begin methadone yet again. Unknown to her family and her obstetrician, she had been taking Percocet since before becoming pregnant, and had hoped to taper off the pills on her own rather than go back on methadone. But weaning off the Percocet without help proved impossible \u2014 she couldn\u2019t do it without going into withdrawal, which she feared would hurt her baby. Now that she was back on methadone, she planned to tell her obstetrician \u2014 which also meant telling him about the Percocet use that preceded it. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she said. Late that afternoon, Elizabeth sent me a text message: \u201cThank you so much for taking the time to listen to my story. ... Too many people dont understand addiction & they are VERY judgmental. They assume all addicts are horrible human beings, im hoping you are able to open people\u2019s minds.\u201dJ. is a brawny, voluble 34-year-old with a reddish, close-cropped beard. He had come straight from his box-delivery job and was still in uniform, a white baseball cap turned backward on his head. He was also exhausted, having spent the previous day moving the couple into a new apartment, more appropriate for a newborn than their former place above a noisy bar. J.\u2019s ultimate goal, he told me, was for his two older children to live with them in a house he planned to purchase with the help of a government loan for first-time home buyers. There was a defensive edge to J.\u2019s ebullience; he gave the impression of a man whose natural optimism had weathered myriad checks. I learned later that J. was not the biological father of Elizabeth\u2019s baby. The couple had dated for a few months the year before, broken up and then reunited by the time she discovered she was pregnant from a brief hookup. Elizabeth was devoted to J.\u2019s 10-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son, whom she called her stepchildren, and J. professed equal willingness to raise her daughter as his own. \u201cI have a gut feeling that physically she\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d he declared to Czynski of the baby. \u201cI feel like we communicate already, so I\u2019m pretty happy. I\u2019m confident.\u201d\u201cShe loves his voice,\u201d Elizabeth said, in a near-whisper. The very need for an appointment to discuss opioid use and NAS seemed almost to crush her, and she clutched J.\u2019s hand. Her fingernails, ragged from torn-off extensions, still bore flecks of sparkling polish. Her blue-and-white striped tank top shifted visibly as the baby, due in less than a week, squirmed inside her. Elizabeth told Czynski that, in addition to methadone, she was taking Zoloft, Klonopin and Keppra \u2014 the last of these for grand mal seizures, which she had experienced occasionally since age 18, although she wasn\u2019t epileptic. Like Alicia and nearly half of adults with substance-use disorder, Elizabeth struggles with other mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. Though her own parents never used drugs, painkillers \u2014 stolen from the medicine cabinets of parents who were often addicted themselves \u2014 were popular in the woodsy town outside Providence where she grew up, the older of two girls. Her father, a salesman, was very strict (her parents divorced when she was a child), but as a teenager, Elizabeth was encouraged to drink and smoke marijuana by an uncle who molested her and several other girls and is now in prison. Her psychiatrist, unlike Alicia\u2019s, advised her to remain on her medications through her pregnancy, and Czynski assured her that she had been right to do so, although he warned that the baby might experience a secondary withdrawal effect from the Zoloft. J. introduced a dilemma: Elizabeth\u2019s family assumed she was free of opioids; no one knew that she had returned to Percocet and now was back on methadone. She wanted to conceal it.\u201cPeople that share with their families tend not to get kicked in the teeth,\u201d Czynski said. \u201cStarting back on methadone is saying: I made a choice not to go back and do something else, because I wanted to be responsible about what was happening in my life.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Elizabeth murmured, her head bowed in shame. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a big girl now,\u201d J. cajoled her. \u201cYou\u2019re about to be a mom. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to be on timeout sitting in the corner.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a timeout,\u201d she said, with a hint of tartness.\u201cYou\u2019re your own woman now.\u201d \u201cMy father is very judgmental.\u201d Czynski led them on a tour of a recently repurposed wing of the postpartum unit where families of infants being observed or treated for NAS can \u201croom in\u201d alongside their babies even after the mothers have been discharged. Of the approximately 9,100 infants discharged from Women and Infants last year, 121 were observed or treated for NAS \u2014 significantly above the national average and reflective of Rhode Island\u2019s high rate of opioid addiction. On any given day, there are usually seven or eight babies being treated in the nursery for NAS. The fact that the babies are in a nursery puts Women and Infants at the vanguard of NAS care; a vast majority of babies in withdrawal around the country are still treated apart from their mothers in NICUs, a protocol that is now widely seen as counterproductive. Though families can visit babies in a NICU, and mothers can breast-feed them, the bright, stimulating atmosphere may worsen a baby\u2019s withdrawal symptoms, necessitating more drugs and longer treatment. At Women and Infants, mothers and families can remain with their babies day and night while the baby is being medicated and tapered off the medication, a period that tends to last from two to three weeks, although once a mother has been discharged from the hospital, she must travel to a clinic to be dosed if she is on methadone. A large hospital team, including a social worker, monitors the progress of mother and baby, gathering for rounds at midday in their room. Rhode Island is one of 23 states that require doctors to alert child-welfare authorities if they suspect or have confirmed that a pregnant woman has used illicit drugs, according to the Guttmacher Institute, and Elizabeth returned to the hospital the next day to meet with one of its social workers. The social worker delivered bad news: Because Elizabeth had waited until her seventh month of pregnancy to enter treatment, the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families, known as D.C.Y.F., would certainly be involved in her case. \u201cIt was so much information at once,\u201d Elizabeth told me on the phone later that day, sounding shaken and confused. \u201cMy boyfriend had to work \u2014 I wish I\u2019d had someone with me. I\u2019m pretty sure the worst-case scenario is that the state takes custody of her,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that happens, I won\u2019t be able to stay at the hospital with her at all. I\u2019ll go in to deliver, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Later, the social worker called Elizabeth to report that she would be allowed to room in with her daughter. D.C.Y.F. would follow up with her at the hospital. Elizabeth was relieved. \u201cMy biggest concern right away is being able to be at the hospital with her,\u201d she said. When she spoke to me of motherhood, she focused resolutely on the practical, as if anything beyond that was too vast to contemplate \u2014 or at least articulate. \u201cBeing born, she needs that. She needs her mother.\u201dThe baby arrived punctually on her due date in late June and soon began showing signs of withdrawal, including stiffness, retraction when she breathed and difficulty feeding. Elizabeth and J. were devastated when the medical team advised beginning treatment for NAS with morphine on the second day of the baby\u2019s life, and later added phenobarbital. \u201cWe started bawling our eyes out,\u201d Elizabeth told me when I visited her in the hospital eight days later, after she had been discharged. At the beginning, she cried every time the nurse squirted the tiny plastic syringe, full of clear morphine, into the baby\u2019s mouth. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry I did this.\u2019\u2009\u201d But during my visit, Elizabeth appeared cheerful and at ease. After six days of morphine, the baby had nearly been tapered off the drug and was set to be released in a few more days. I was struck by Elizabeth\u2019s calm at dealing with her newborn. Even when the baby lapsed into inconsolable crying, she showed no anxiety or impatience. At one point she shimmied out of her sweatshirt, still holding the child, leaving on just her tank top and sports bra. \u201cThey say skin-to-skin helps, especially if I\u2019m not breast-feeding,\u201d she explained. (The hospital had encouraged her to breast-feed, but she was afraid the baby might be harmed by her medications or hepatitis C.) She placed the baby, still grunting and fussing, on her own belly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said gently, as the baby continued to cry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. She\u2019s pushing herself up,\u201d she whispered to me.It was true. The baby huffed and squirmed along her torso with the blind doggedness of an inchworm until their faces were pressed together. \u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d Elizabeth murmured as her daughter burrowed her head into the space between her neck and bare shoulder. At last, the infant relaxed. \u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Elizabeth said, in a soft singsong murmur. \u201cHold on. It\u2019s me.\u201dWhen removing a child from a mother\u2019s care, federal law requires authorities to try to place the child with a willing and suitable family member; failing that, the child will go into foster care with a family friend or a stranger. Among children placed in foster care nationally, a troubling racial inequity persists: In 2016, nearly one-quarter were black. In Chicago, only 12 percent of children in foster care were white; in New York City, the figure was only 6 percent.While there is little doubt that drug and alcohol dependency can compromise a person\u2019s ability to parent, for the child, being separated from a parent is hugely traumatic. Another woman I met in Providence last summer, Ashley, who was then 29, grew up in an affluent Massachusetts suburb where her mother coached her junior high school cheerleading squad. After a car accident, Ashley\u2019s mother became dependent on painkillers, and eventually she and Ashley\u2019s stepfather turned to heroin. An only child, Ashley was placed in the custody of her grandmother at age 12. But she missed her mother keenly, and neither her grandmother\u2019s attentiveness nor her mother\u2019s ultimate recovery could assuage the damage caused by that rupture. \u201cI was so abandoned and so hurt from all the things I had seen and dealt with,\u201d Ashley told me. By her early 20s, she had dropped out of college and was addicted to heroin herself. She fell in love with a man named Jon, 17 years her senior, who had spent more than two decades addicted to heroin, cycling in and out of prison, usually for shoplifting crimes. They spent three years homeless in and around Providence, sleeping outdoors in warm weather, and in winter taking refuge in a vermin-infested crack house whose heat source was an open oven. When Ashley found herself accidentally pregnant, they decided to keep the baby \u2014 over the appalled objections of their families. \u201cThey were like, \u2018We\u2019re not raising your kid,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Ashley, whose rapid, vivid speech is punctuated by silver flashes from a tongue stud. \u201cThey thought I was going to use the whole time, get the baby taken, end up strung out, the baby in foster care.\u201d But parenthood proved transformative for Ashley \u2014 as it did for a surprising number of mothers I spoke to. She began methadone treatment in earnest (in the past, she continued to use drugs while on methadone) and has not touched drugs or alcohol in more than three years. Jon has done the same and now works full time in construction. Their son, Jaxon, now 2\u00bd, is a sweet, lively, flaxen-haired boy. The family lives in a small, neat apartment in Pawtucket, R.I., near a park where they like to walk after Jon gets home from work, so that Jaxon can feed the geese.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the strength to get clean before,\u201d Ashley told me, \u201cbut something in us, when we had the baby, I felt like God was giving us an opportunity. A way out. Like: You guys could be sober and have a baby and have a life. We didn\u2019t think we could do it.\u201d Pregnancy also proved redemptive for Cynthia, whom I met in Philadelphia and who had temporarily lost custody of her four children by the time she became pregnant with her fifth. Born to a Puerto Rican father and a white mother who raised her alone in Kensington, a poor Philadelphia neighborhood, Cynthia fell into street life at age 12, gave birth at 17 and dropped out of high school. She fell in love with Charles, her fianc\u00e9, who is from a Puerto Rican family in North Philadelphia, and they started a family while both of them were addicted to Percocet. During each of her three subsequent pregnancies, Cynthia quit the pills cold turkey; after the babies were born, she drifted back into using. Garrulous and sharp, with golden hazel eyes, she is the first to admit that her habit compromised her parenting. \u201cYou get so wrapped up in the drug use and the lifestyle, everything else gets pushed to the side,\u201d she told me. \u201cThere were days where I was so out of it that I didn\u2019t show them as much affection as I should have.\u201d She temporarily lost custody of her four children in 2013. The oldest daughter, then 8, was placed with relatives; the younger three lived with Charles, who lost custody himself a year later \u2014 at which point his mother became their guardian. Guilt and anguish over the loss of children can be catastrophic for someone already contending with addiction, and Cynthia turned from Percocet to heroin. \u201cOnce the kids got taken, I was so hurt by it that the heroin just kind of \u2014 it was a downward spiral,\u201d she said.Seven and a half months pregnant with her fifth child in 2016, Cynthia was living with Charles in an abandoned house without running water, her arms bruised from shooting heroin after a relapse. She didn\u2019t know it yet, but she was lucky in one respect: Philadelphia is home to one of the oldest drug-treatment centers for pregnant women in America, known as Mater (Maternal Addiction Treatment, Education and Research), founded in 1973 and now housed at Jefferson University Hospital. After going to a local emergency room with stomach pains, Cynthia, very pregnant and withdrawing from heroin, agreed to be transported to Jefferson. She was admitted to the hospital and stabilized on methadone, and then opted to enter Mater\u2019s residential facility for pregnant women and those with young children, where she remained for the next nine months. Charles, who had been snorting heroin, went into treatment 10 days after she did, and they began the process of getting their other children back.Now the family of seven lives in a rented rowhouse in Kensington, Cynthia\u2019s old neighborhood. Charles has a carpentry job, and Cynthia takes the children to school, Girl Scouts and travel soccer. On weekday mornings, she goes to Mater, where her baby, now more than a year old, spends time in the clinic\u2019s child care center while Cynthia receives her methadone, attends parenting classes and therapy sessions and avails herself of counseling about housing, education and career goals. Mater helped her to navigate the child-welfare system and hosted a seminar about healthful infant sleeping. She has taken a 12-week course in mindfulness meditation (Diane Abatemarco, former director of Mater, has published several papers on the efficacy of mindfulness at improving the parenting skills of opioid-dependent women at Mater). Cynthia hopes to become a peer specialist, a trained, paid position that would involve helping other mothers with addictions. Mater\u2019s comprehensive care is funded by the city of Philadelphia and available free to its residents. Such programs are costly, but many experts say that helping families remain healthy and intact is a worthy investment, even from a purely economic standpoint. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay now, or you\u2019re going to pay later,\u201d said Lenora Marcellus, a registered nurse and professor at the University of Victoria in Canada who specializes in treating pregnant women with addictions. \u201cThis population [of children] we\u2019re talking about, especially if they go into foster care: They\u2019re a big part of the homeless population. It all goes around.\u201dCynthia told me: \u201cI thank God every day that I was able to get clean and get my children back and get my life back. In a blink of an eye, that 14 months we\u2019ve been clean can be gone. I\u2019m not going to take that chance.\u201dElizabeth was exhausted; her methadone dose was too high, she said, which made her groggy, and she stayed up much of the previous night trying to organize the new apartment \u2014 where boxes still remained to be unpacked \u2014 for the caseworker\u2019s visit. She often responds to stress with a kind of paralysis that registers as slowness, even confusion; she can spend hours in stores, incapacitated by the question of what to buy. Her stepdaughter, 10, was helping Elizabeth organize piles of laundry into newly purchased netted bags when J. returned from work with his 12-year-old son, who had spent the day riding with him in his delivery truck. J. looked hot and weary, and he retired to a bedroom, where the baby was asleep. Elizabeth began trying to hook up an Xbox for her stepson. When it refused to work, she lapsed into despair. \u201cI ruined it,\u201d she groaned. \u201cYou did good,\u201d her stepdaughter said, trying to reassure her. The boy managed to hook up the Xbox himself and began playing video games. Elizabeth had decorated the sunny front room with seashells, scented candles and a sculpture of the word \u201cBelieve.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to start cleaning,\u201d she told her stepdaughter. \u201cThat lady is coming on Monday.\u201d \u201cAn expector?\u201d the girl asked.\u201cYes. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m very nervous and on edge. How does this look?\u201d She had arranged her Narcotics Anonymous books neatly on a shelf. J. reappeared and said he was taking his children out. His daughter asked if they should bring the baby. \u201cDid you want me to?\u201d J. asked Elizabeth, tersely.\u201cDude, I have to get all this stuff. ...\u201d She trailed off as she wiped the bookshelf with Windex, her eyes lolling shut.\u201cYou have all weekend for that,\u201d he snapped, but he left the room to collect the infant. \u201cNo, leave her,\u201d Elizabeth called after him. \u201cDon\u2019t take her. Never mind.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m taking her!\u201d\u201cNo. You just got all upset.\u201d\u201cYou should probably take a catnap,\u201d her stepdaughter suggested gently, adding, to me, \u201cShe stays up all night.\u201d J. and the older children departed without the baby, who remained asleep; she was still on phenobarbital, which Elizabeth had to give her twice daily and which she thought had a sedating effect. She took the monitor onto the front porch and lit a stub of a Newport 100 she had been nursing for the past several hours. She had nodded off repeatedly while cleaning \u2014 a result, she said, of too little sleep and too much methadone. A woman usually must increase her dose as her pregnancy progresses, then taper back down after the baby is born; the right calibration can be elusive. As we sat on the front porch in the late-afternoon sun, Elizabeth told me, improbably, that she planned to find a job the following week. She was tired of depending on J. \u2014 tired of cleaning up after him and doing his laundry. \u201cI hate him,\u201d she murmured, nodding off again, the cigarette burning, forgotten, between her fingers. \u201cI\u2019m just ... so ... done.\u201d But to my surprise, things had turned around by the time I visited Elizabeth in early September: Not only had the early-intervention visit gone well, she told me, but she had managed to switch from methadone to buprenorphine. The drugs aren\u2019t chemically equivalent; you must partly withdraw from methadone before starting buprenorphine. That transition, which Elizabeth says was made worse by her hepatitis C, caused her to go into full-blown withdrawal \u2014 nausea, shakes, restless legs \u2014 and for days she had done little more than lie on the couch in misery. But the ordeal brought her closer to J., who had been \u201cwicked helpful,\u201d she said, caring for the baby overnight and after work while she stabilized. \u201cHe\u2019s a really good guy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just gets on my nerves sometimes.\u201d Recently, Elizabeth reported more good news by phone: She has a job helping a family whose child has autism. Her grandmother cares for her daughter, now 10 months old and thriving, while she is at work. During a recent snowstorm, she and J. lost power and had to escape their freezing apartment with the baby. They repaired to a hotel, where J. astonished Elizabeth by proposing marriage. She accepted. \u201cIt was very unexpected but very awesome,\u201d she told me.When her baby was dozing in her arms last September, I asked Elizabeth what sort of life she wanted for her daughter. \u201cThe opposite of mine,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cMy biggest regret is not going away to college, living in a dorm. I was too busy partying.\u201d She hoped to work toward her associate\u2019s degree, which would let her assist an occupational therapist. She had picked out a different town she wanted to move to \u2014 one that had good schools she hoped all three children could attend. In her own hometown, hardly anyone went to college. But in the town she had set her sights on, she received dirty looks at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts while heavily pregnant \u2014 from people who, she presumed, mistook her for a teenager. \u201cIt\u2019s that kind of community,\u201d she said approvingly.When the baby woke, Elizabeth began giving her a massage she had learned from an occupational therapist who paid regular visits. She poured sunflower oil into her hands and began to rub them over her daughter\u2019s chubby thighs. The oil glistened on the baby\u2019s soft, fresh skin. \u201cShe\u2019s so ticklish. We\u2019re going to do the legs and the feet. You ready? Is Mommy doing it right?\u201dHer daughter cooed, then grinned. It was the first time I had seen her smile.As it turned out, the social workers\u2019 visit went smoothly; the developmental exam revealed that her baby was in excellent health. But things took a grave turn in the winter, when Alicia\u2019s concern about a ridge in her son\u2019s skull led to the discovery that its bony plates had adhered prematurely and would require a complex operation in late spring to be separated. Fear and stress had hobbled Alicia\u2019s relationship; her boyfriend blamed her methadone therapy for their son\u2019s difficulty (there is no evidence that the two are related), and at one point he moved out of the apartment. By late April, he was back, and they were struggling to put their troubles aside for their son. Through it all, Alicia withstood the temptation to escape back into drugs; in fact, she had cut her methadone dose to 45 milligrams from 160 at the time of her son\u2019s birth, and had gone off her antidepressant altogether. Despite the worries she was facing, she sounded more clearheaded and strong, during a recent phone call, than I\u2019d ever heard her. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll be emotional, but it\u2019s better than feeling like a zombie,\u201d she told me.She had come to believe that the power of her emotions was something to be embraced rather than muffled. \u201cThe surgery makes me feel like running away and soothing myself, but I\u2019ll never fall for the tricks of the disease,\u201d she wrote in a recent text message. \u201cIt\u2019ll have to fight my willpower with all it\u2019s got to knock me down again.\u201d/\u2022/Advertisement"}

They could decide to perform the tests, say, every two years, or allow for an even longer break. During the untested period, the banks could grow complacent about risks. Crucially, the stress tests also help determine a bank\u2019s level of capital, its main defense against losses. As a result, banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets could let their capital levels decline during the untested period, leaving them less protected against losses.

{"Headline": "Facebook Says It Deleted 865 Million Posts, Mostly Spam", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook has been under pressure for its failure to remove violence, nudity, hate speech and other inflammatory content from its site. Government officials, activists and academics have long pushed the social network to disclose more about how it deals with such posts.Now, Facebook is pulling back the curtain on those efforts \u2014 but only so far.Guy Rosen, Facebook\u2019s vice president of product management, said the company had substantially increased its efforts over the past 18 months to flag and remove inappropriate content. The inaugural report was intended to \u201chelp our teams understand what is happening\u201d on the site, he said. Facebook hopes to continue publishing reports about its content removal every six months or so.Yet the figures the company published were limited. Facebook declined to provide examples of graphically violent posts or hate speech that it removed, for example. The social network said it had taken down more posts from its site in the first three months of 2018 than it had during the last quarter of 2017, but it gave no specific figures from previous years, making it hard to assess how much it had stepped up its efforts.The report also did not include all the posts that Facebook had removed. After publication of this article, a Facebook spokeswoman said other types of content had been taken down from the site in the first quarter because they violated community standards, but those were not detailed in the report because the company was still developing metrics to study them.Congress last week released more than 3,000 Facebook ads linked to Russia around the 2016 presidential election, the most comprehensive look at the misinformation campaign mounted on the social network.Facebook also used the new report to advance a push around artificial intelligence to root out inappropriate posts. Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has long highlighted A.I. as the main solution to helping the company sift through the billions of pieces of content that users put on its site every day, even though critics have asked why the social network cannot hire more people to do the job.\u201cIf we do our job really well, we can be in a place where every piece of content is flagged by artificial intelligence before our users see it,\u201d said Alex Schultz, Facebook\u2019s vice president of data analytics. \u201cOur goal is to drive this to 100 percent.\u201dThe new report about content removal was another step by Facebook to clean up its site. Jillian York, the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said she welcomed Facebook\u2019s numbers.\u201cIt\u2019s a good move and it\u2019s a long time coming,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also frustrating because we\u2019ve known that this has needed to happen for a long time. We need more transparency about how Facebook identifies content, and what it removes going forward.\u201dSamuel Woolley, research director of the Institute for the Future, a think tank in Palo Alto, Calif., said Facebook needed to bring in more independent voices to corroborate their numbers.\u201cWhy should anyone believe what Facebook says about this, when they have such a bad track record about letting the public know about misuse of their platform as it is happening?\u201d he said. \u201cWe are relying on Facebook to self-report on itself, without any independent vetting. That is concerning to me.\u201dFacebook previously declined to reveal its content removal efforts, citing a lack of internal metrics. Instead, it published a country-by-country breakdown of how many requests it received from governments to obtain Facebook data or restrict content from Facebook users in that country. Those figures did not specify what type of data the governments asked for or what posts were restricted. Facebook also published a country-by-country report on Tuesday.According to the new content removal report, about 97 percent of the 865.8 million pieces of content that Facebook took down from its site in the first quarter was spam. About 2.4 percent of that deleted content had nudity, Facebook said, with even smaller percentages of posts removed for graphic violence, hate speech and terrorism.In the report, Facebook said its A.I. found 99.5 percent of terrorist content on the site, leading to the removal of roughly 1.9 million pieces of content in the first quarter. The A.I. also detected 95.8 percent of posts that were problematic because of nudity, with 21 million such posts taken down.But Facebook still relied on human moderators to identify hate speech because automated programs have a hard time understanding context and culture. Of the 2.5 million pieces of hate speech Facebook removed in the first quarter, 38 percent was detected by A.I., according to the new report.Facebook said it also removed 3.4 million posts that had graphic violence, 85.6 percent of which were detected by A.I.The company did not break down the numbers of graphically violent posts by geography, even though Mr. Schultz said that at times of war, people in certain countries would be more likely to see graphic violence than others. He said that in the future, Facebook hoped to publish country-specific numbers.The report also did not include any figures on the amount of false news on Facebook as the company did not have an explicit policy on removing misleading news stories, Mr. Schultz said. Instead, Facebook has tried to deter the spread of misinformation by removing spam sites that profit from advertisements that run alongside false news, and by removing fake accounts that spread them.An earlier version of this article, using information provided by Facebook, referred incorrectly to the 3 to 4 percent of accounts on the social network that were fake. It is the percentage of Facebook accounts that were fake even after a purge of such accounts. It is not the percentage of Facebook accounts that were purged as being fake. The article also misstated how often Facebook hopes to publish reports about the content it removes. It is roughly every six months, not every quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Founders Embraced Control Over Companies. This One Is Giving It Up.", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, it was a way to protect themselves from pesky investors interested in short-term gains, even as shareholder advocates blasted the arrangements for creating unaccountable leaders.The founder-empowered structure at the heart of many tech companies is known as a multiclass stock structure, under which those who started the company own a certain class of stock that gives them outsize voting power even after it goes public.At Zynga, Mark Pincus, the company\u2019s founder, has now converted some of his shares that carry more voting clout \u2014 known as Class B and C shares \u2014 into common Class A shares. The conversion reduces his overall voting power at Zynga to about 10 percent from about 70 percent. Mr. Pincus will not see any change in his economic interest in the company from the conversion.In a phone interview, Mr. Pincus said his divorce, which he described as amicable, was \u201cnot part of or relevant to the announcement\u201d of his conversion of his stock.Rather, Mr. Pincus said, he made the decision in consultation with Zynga\u2019s board, partly because of growing criticism of dual- and multiclass share structures. As part of the change, Mr. Pincus said, he will leave Zynga as an employee \u2014 he was executive chairman \u2014 and become nonexecutive chairman of the company\u2019s board of directors.\u201cWe think the company doesn\u2019t benefit anymore from a multiclass structure,\u201d Mr. Pincus said.Dual-class voting structures have been around for decades and have been especially popular at media companies, such as News Corporation and The New York Times Company.The vast majority of companies that go public have a single class of stock, where one share equals one vote. About 81 percent of companies that went public last year had single-class arrangements, according to the Council of Institutional Investors, a nonprofit association of pension funds and other large investors.Charles Elson, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware, said that in his 20 years of tracking issues around multiclass stock structures, Mr. Pincus was the first public company executive he could recall who voluntarily reduced his voting power so dramatically.\u201cIt\u2019s quite an unusual move, but it\u2019s a welcome move,\u201d Mr. Elson said.Multiclass structures are bad for ordinary investors because they make founders unaccountable, he added. \u201cIf a C.E.O. does a poor job, he\u2019s not going to fire himself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problems it creates far outweigh any benefits.\u201dIn response to some of the criticism of multiclass structures, more companies are going public with provisions that automatically convert their shares to a single class after a period of time, anywhere from five to 20 years. Fitbit, the maker of fitness trackers, went public in 2015 with a 12-year provision that sunsets its dual-class stock, while the cloud software company Okta went public last year with a similar 10-year provision.Mr. Pincus said his voting control at Zynga had not given him veto power over outside offers to acquire the company, though it did give him the ability to replace board members. He said he had never exercised that right.When asked if Zynga could consider acquisition offers more easily now that Mr. Pincus had relinquished most of his voting power, Mr. Gibeau said, \u201cThat\u2019s not our mission \u2014 our focus is to grow the company.\u201dMr. Pincus said he intended to devote more time to investing in start-ups. He said he was particularly interested in companies focused on the blockchain, the technology that\u2019s behind electronic currencies like Bitcoin, but could also have broader applications.Giving up his control of Zynga, Mr. Pincus said, will \u201ccreate more space between me and the company whenever I go launch new products.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "50 Years After Their Mug Shots, Portraits of Mississippi\u2019s Freedom Riders", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRace StoriesThe journalist and photographer Eric Etheridge provides visual and oral histories of the courageous men and women known as the Freedom Riders in the 1960s. For seven months in 1961, hundreds of black and white volunteers descended on Southern bus and train stations. These Freedom Riders, as they were called, occupied segregated waiting areas, lunch counters, and restrooms in an attempt to compel the federal government to do what local authorities would not: enforce a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that declared discrimination in interstate public transportation illegal. During their first incursion into the Deep South, as they rode buses through Alabama, the Freedom Riders were met by angry mobs of white people. Many were savagely beaten. Later that month, in Jackson, Miss., hundreds of protesters were arrested and hastily convicted of breach of peace. Most endured six weeks of imprisonment in sweltering, filthy and vermin infested cells. Mr. Etheridge, who grew up in Mississippi, first saw the mug shots after the state\u2019s Department of Archives and History published them online. \u201cI was captivated by these images and wanted to bring them to a wider audience,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI wanted to find the Riders today, to look into their faces, to make new portraits to set against the earlier photographs.\u201d Since he began working on the project in 2005, Mr. Etheridge has tracked down nearly a hundred Riders, visiting them in their homes, conducting interviews and making new portraits. If these mug shots inadvertently captured the humanity and special qualities of their principled subjects, as Mr. Etheridge observed, their intention was nefarious: to publicly impugn and humiliate people whose only crime was to advocate equality through peaceful protest. No matter their purpose, mug shots inevitably imply aberrance or delinquency, whether or not the people they depict are eventually found to be guilty. With this in mind, the current mayor of Jackson, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, issued an executive order in February prohibiting their release in cases involving people killed by the police. \u201cMug shots and sensationalized news narratives create lasting impressions that adversely impact communities and widen the historical divides between police and community,\u201d stated Mr. Lumumba\u2019s directive. \u201cA mug shot is just one snapshot in time, and cannot be presumed to represent the sum total of any individual\u2019s existence.\u201dBy pairing mug shots with contemporary portraits \u2014 and providing stories about individual Freedom Riders \u2014 Mr. Etheridge undoes some of the psychic and social damage perpetrated by these symbols of police malfeasance. \u201cBreach of Peace\u201d corrects the historical record, representing its subjects not as dehumanized icons of criminality but as exemplary citizens and complex human beings.The Freedom Riders were a diverse group. Largely college students at the time, they came from 39 states, were of different races and economic classes, and went on to varied careers: Hank Thomas, then a sophomore at Howard University, now owns fast food and hotel franchises; Peter Stoner, who studied at the University of Chicago, earned a Ph.D. in chemistry and later worked as an auto mechanic; Margaret Leonard, who attended Newcomb College, became a journalist; Hezekiah Watkins, who was a ninth-grade student in Jackson, ran a small grocery store; and Helen O\u2019Neal McCray, a sophomore at Jackson State University, taught elementary school and later writing and literature at Wilberforce University, a historically black institution in Ohio.The diversity of the Freedom Riders affirms the importance of allies in the struggle for racial equality and justice, acknowledging that the support of some in the white majority was necessary to achieve legal and political rights. In the early 1960s, these demonstrators motivated and inspired Americans of all races. \u201cThe courage and tenacity of the Riders electrified large segments of the American public and drew them into the midcentury civil rights movement as no activity had done before,\u201d Mr. Wilkins wrote. \u201cPeople began asking themselves: \u2018What can I do?\u2019\u201dThe solidarity of these activists stands in contrast to the complacency and social and cultural divisions that impede progress today. The period between the initial publication of \u201cBreach of Peace\u201d in 2008 and its reissue in 2018 attests to the volatile and continually shifting fortunes of the struggle for racial equality and justice. A decade ago, the nation made history as a coalition of voters of all colors elected the nation\u2019s first black president. Today, an administration routinely exploits racial anxiety and resentment. There is much to learn from the unity, courage and passion of the Freedom Riders, whose efforts resulted in federal regulations prohibiting segregation in interstate transit terminals. During the 50th anniversary of their demonstrations, many came forward to tell their stories, work that continues to the present day. \u201cThey did not waste their golden anniversary press,\u201d Mr. Etheridge wrote. \u201cThe good news is that since 2011 the Riders have become much more frequent speakers in classrooms, libraries and auditoriums across the country. Once more they are putting their bodies on the road, this time to share their histories, to tell how they resisted, to spread the practice of \u2018good trouble,\u2019 as John Lewis calls it. \u2026 The good news is that the Freedom Riders are still overreaching.\u201dRace Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger. He is a research professor and chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Their Ancestors Were on Opposite Sides of a Lynching. Now, They\u2019re Friends.", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe hanging.\u201dFor years, Karen Branan, a white woman from Georgia, kept at a safe distance the haunting words that her grandmother had spoken. Ms. Branan was an inquisitive journalist, but she refused to explore a hanging that her grandmother had said was one of her most unforgettable memories. She was afraid of what she might learn.But in 1986, when she learned that she was going to have a racially mixed grandchild, Ms. Branan felt compelled to dig up the truth. She discovered that her relatives had been part of a mob that had lynched four black people \u2014 three men and a woman \u2014 in Hamilton, Ga., in 1912.The book eventually made its way into the hands of Jackie Jordan Irvine, an Alabama native and a professor emeritus of urban education at Emory University. Ms. Irvine, who is black, came across the name of her ancestor Milford Moore. He was related to John Moore, one of the lynching victims.The connection caught her by surprise.She had never heard of the lynching or that a relative had been a victim. So Ms. Irvine sent an email to Ms. Branan, and the two have struck up an unlikely friendship: a black woman whose ancestor was lynched, and a white woman whose ancestors did the killing.The two grew up in neighboring cities \u2014 Ms. Irvine, 70, in Phenix City, Ala., and Ms. Branan, 76, in Columbus, Ga. With the racial divide, they lived worlds apart.Ms. Irvine, on her reaction to learning of the lynching:\u201cIt was shocking. I didn\u2019t know how to feel about it. But immediately, I thought about my grandmother, who we just loved dearly, what must have happened when she knew that this event had occurred in this county.\u201cThey lynched them on the grounds of the black Friendship Baptist Church. You can\u2019t get any more horrific than lynching people on the black church grounds. It wasn\u2019t just the four victims, it was an entire black community that was absolutely terrorized by this event.\u201dMs. Branan explained that her distant cousin Norman Hadley, a nephew of the local sheriff, had been murdered. Mr. Hadley was known for chasing after young women, and he was in pursuit of a 14-year-old black girl. The three black men lynched were close to the girl \u2014 her preacher, the Rev. Burrell Hardaway; her father, Eugene Harrington; and her boyfriend, John Moore. They had been accused, without proof, of murdering Mr. Hadley.\u201cThis was an era in which W.E.B. DuBois in The Crisis, the magazine that he edited, was calling for black men to protect black women, and to, quote, risk lynching if need be to do this. So Burrell Hardaway was preaching, calling out Norman Hadley by name.\u201cThey all looked suspicious, but guess what, they were not. Later, we found out that a white man had killed Norman Hadley. He was also chasing this 14-year-old.\u201dMs. Branan said that the woman who was lynched, Loduska Crutchfield, was believed to be the first female lynching victim in Georgia.\u201cShe was not a suspect in Norman\u2019s murder, but she was supposed to be a star witness. She refused, she refused, so she was a martyr.\u201dMs. Branan also learned of a surprising racial back story. Mr. Moore, the youngest of the victims, was a distant cousin of hers because one of her white ancestors had children with a black woman. Her white family members knew they were killing a black family member.\u201cWhat I discovered was that the racially mixed Moore family was very much involved with the so-called white Moore family up to the time of this lynching. This lynching was, in and of itself, a message lynching to say to black and white people: \u2018Segregate. We are changing, the South is changing. You must separate now.\u2019 It was a very violent laying down of a line in the sand to keep us apart from one another.\u201dMs. Irvine said she was eager to meet Ms. Branan. With the South\u2019s widespread, insidious history of racial hatred, Ms. Irvine could not hold anything against Ms. Branan.\u201cI wasn\u2019t angry about it. These things happened. I was very grateful that Karen had given me a gift. She had given me a gift of connecting me to some of my ancestors that I didn\u2019t know much about. I\u2019m angry about racism. I\u2019m angry about racial terror. I didn\u2019t personalize it in terms of Karen being a descendant of the slave owners because, otherwise, I\u2019d be a very mad sister.\u201dTogether, the two women visited the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, a new memorial in Montgomery, Ala., honoring lynching victims.Ms. Branan said that the story of the lynching her family was involved in, along with others, was not just a historical tale.\u201cThe past has not passed. It\u2019s still with us. It\u2019s with us in different forms. Some of those forms are even more pernicious than the old forms. We are living in the past because we have not addressed the past. We have not atoned for the past. We have not even educated ourselves about the past.\u201dMs. Irvine:\u201cBlack lives didn\u2019t matter then in 1912 when they lynched my cousin John Moore. Twenty-one-year-old black men in America, now they\u2019ve been lynched in another kind of way. Even if you didn\u2019t own slaves, even if your family never attended a lynching or watched it or whatever, white people have benefited politically, socially and economically from a system of slavery and oppression from Mississippi to Maine. It\u2019s not to make white people feel guilty, but it\u2019s to accept the privilege that\u2019s been awarded through a system of oppression.\u201dFollow John Eligon on Twitter: @jeligon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fortnite, Freedom of the Press, Cyberbullying and Celebrity Opinions: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events Conversation_________Please note: All the student comments below have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted._________For a lot of people, Fortnite is just a game you can play with your friends when you are caught up with your homework after school, to have fun and relax, right? For others, it is a completely different experience. It becomes a bit of a life or death situation, as extreme as it sounds. You have to trust your squad mates with your life, or else, you\u2019re as good as dead.It\u2019s kind of an awesome feeling: you and your friends all together against multiple other groups of friends. You battle it out in building and gun play to defeat your opponents. Overall it is a very fun game, that builds enjoyment and experience in stressful situations that help you build better relationships with your friends.When I play with my friends, we are all in a party, or a chatroom, constantly talking about whatever comes to our minds. Its nothing too serious, until someone hears a gunshot at our squad.\u201cDid you guys hear about what happened in 3rd block today?\u201d*Gunshot*\u201cShots, 330 NW\u201d someone says. The entire conversation changes. From conversation to callouts, in an absolute instant. Your team gets ready to face the coming threat.The addiction itself comes from winning, in my belief. From dropping Salty Springs to running and gunning around the map with a deadly storm pitting the final survivors against one another, to the final battle atop a great mountain, to seeing the words \u201cVictory Royale!\u201d on your screen. It\u2019s a rush of satisfaction and joy, because you won.An immense topic of discussion is the creeping shadow of \u201cFortnite,\u201d an online multiplayer shooting game. When I first heard of it, I diminished it as a minor and simple video game that might gain some popularity and die off in the duration of a few months. However, the number one thing that my friends talk about aren\u2019t the plot twists of Infinity War, nor the difficulty of the math test on Tuesday, but whether or not they should buy a skin for their character in Fortnite to look decent enough when they\u2019re firing at another player.Video games alone are addicting, but a game such as \u201cFornite\u201d has the potential to become a sort of black hole, an endless void that squeezes the reason and sense out of students like myself. The most appealing aspect of Fortnite is the gameplay of a mode called Battle Royale. Well over 30 characters are set down in a continuously shrinking arena, where they can accumulate weapons and tools, build complex structures, and prepare for the battle that will determine to the be the winner. A laughable model of The Hunger Games, I didn\u2019t and still to this day never did understand why my friends would want to play the game, which, to me, was as addictive and attractive as watching paint dry on a wall. However, to my friends, \u201cFortnite\u201d sees like an island in a sea of mediocre video games; a spark of imagination in a dark time.I can say from experience that Fortnite is in fact a very addicting and enjoyable game. I recently downloaded because of all the hype, and play it on a regular basis with my friend. I wouldn\u2019t say that I personally am addicted to the game, however, I do find myself playing it in my free time. To be quite honest, I\u2019m not even sure why exactly the game is so popular. The graphics are really pretty and the concept is nice, but it\u2019s just one of hundreds of shooting video games that exist. I do think that at my school, Fortnite has become something that consumes a lot of time from nearly all the students. It\u2019s constantly being talked about and played by students (including myself) during class time throughout the day. I\u2019ve even noticed that people will post all of their wins or the \u201cvictory royale\u201d screen on their social media such as on snapchat. Sometimes people will post as much as 4 or 5 pictures of the gaming screen everytime they win, which can end up being really annoying in my opinion. Although this game is so popular and may consume the time of a lot of individuals, I do not believe that it has any truly toxic effects on those who play it. I honestly think it\u2019s just another really hyped up video game that will eventually die down over time.Hello I\u2019m a 15 year old kid here. After reading this article and scrutinizing the comment section, I have come to the conclusion that people generally have two sides in this lively debate.While some people state that Violent Games (Fortnite or other Games in General) tend to lead to violent aggression, there is other people who believe that games lead to social and life skills. I can agree with both sides of the conversation. For example I play video games as well, with a few wins on fortnite myself I can agree that the game itself is very addicting, This game creates a gambling affect that makes it hard for people to stop, I know that when I am told to stop by my parents, I feel anger, and that\u2019s just not normal. The problem with this is, that this anger is just temporary, I wont feel any more later, but like trying to stop a gambler from playing poker, its really hard to get someone to just stop playing video games. There is also the benefits of video games, from being able to cooperate with each other in a similar social settings, to enhance memory, improve coordination and improves problem solving skills. The solution that my parents and I cooperated, We put up a set of rules for the weekday, I cannot play video games without first studying, doing homework, chores, and even then, the most I can play is around 1 hour 30 min. In the weekend the rules are similar but with a few changes. I cannot play without studying and chores, I can play but I also need to go outside.I think that its important to recognize that people socialize different ways, and wanting to engage in an activity that they feel comfortable with. Many young people make friends by playing a sport, or participating in a after school activity, and those are both great ways to make friends if that works for you, but many children are just not interested in those activities, and their participation would not be a positive experience for them. Nobody ever calls a child who loves baseball a \u201cbaseball addict\u201d in a negative way, and I believe that no one should be criticized with the way that they enjoy themselves. Fortnite is a positive outlet for children to play with friends, feel strong, and have something that they can be proud of accomplishing. Fornite does not create addicts, it creates enjoyable experiences.Hello. My name is Mekiyah Hazbin, I go to Liberty Middle school and I am currently in the 7th grade. While I\u2019ve read many news articles and heard many opinions. Some say games like Fortnite and PUBG are addicting and ruin social bonds. I completely disagree. When I began playing Fortnite, it was mid October. I didn\u2019t really play the game. When I did, I did it by myself. Then in late December I went over to a friends house. We played Fortnite together for hours. I really began to like this game and by January, it was one of my top games. But, I still didn\u2019t have anyone to play with. That friend played Ps4 and I was on Xbox. That\u2019s when it hit my school. Fortnite began to be in every conversation. I found people I liked to play with. People I would\u2019ve never met if didn\u2019t play. I met people out of state, and out of country. Yet we still play together and chat together as if we\u2019ve known each other for years. Fortnite is addicting because everyone want to be a winner. They want to feel that sense of accomplishment. They want to say, \u201cI\u2019m better than 100 other people.\u201d If people continue to hate on those who play games, they need to stop. Discouraging someone from completing their goals is wrong. Whether the goal is to become a super star or to finally get that victory royale, no one should think they can\u2019t do something.I have played Fortnite for almost 3 months now and I have never seen violence being an issue in the game play. There are guns in the game, but the game is more like a game of virtual airsoft being that there is no blood and your character doesn\u2019t actually die, but they get teleported off the island. The game is more cartoony and humorous than violent. The characters dance to send taunts and they have weapons like the \u201cboogey bomb\u201d which makes all the players that been hit by the bomb dance for 20 - 30 seconds. For comparison, Fortnite is not much more violent than Tom and Jerry the kids cartoon. Also, kids these days are playing games like Grand Theft Auto where there is much more blood and violence than Fortnite. So I don\u2019t think that Fortnite has too much violence and that it is suitable for younger people._________My experience with envy has changed through my life. It use to be that when I was little, I had fought or tried to get what I wanted from someone, like a toy. Now, when I see someone with something better then me, I either go like good for you, say how lucky they are compared to me, or do my best to get where they are. That last one is how I hope envy is a part of my adulthood when I grow up, because I think it is a responsible way to use envy to your advantage.I think that envy is directly related to competitiveness, but it is often confused with jealousy, which can occur without competition. Under Aristotle\u2019s definition, that envy is the feeling of pain from other\u2019s accomplishments, I only feel that pain when comparing myself to a peer, whom I\u2019m in competition with, and not when comparing myself to a stranger. This distinction is important because I don\u2019t think that a little bit of jealousy of a stranger or peer is a bad thing; it only becomes dangerous when their accomplishments convert into personal feelings of anger or despair. One of the ways to overcome hurtful feelings of envy is not to suppress it, but accept it and realize that any comparison or competition between oneself and others is unnecessary. Once the aspect of competition is relinquished, the envy turns into simple admiration.I think that envy relates to competitiveness mostly in sports. Whenever someone comes before meet in a school cross country meet, it seem that that person get congratulated more. I might have been first for the team last meet but you failed this time and people think better of her. That is how envy feels. Envy continues to grow inside me. Then is spend the next week training harder and harder just to beat so-and-so to get lots of approval. I think that envy is linked to approval or praise in a way. Whenever someone is getting more attention then me, even though we did the same thing, I get envious. It is just our human nature. This is why I agree that envy is related to competitiveness. It might be bad or unsportsmanlike but it is true. At least for me.I completely agree that social media is a huge source of envy because people typically only see or post the best moments, snapshots, of their lives. Social Media has become a platform to brag about the new award you won, the places you traveled to, or the friendships you made or already had. While social media is an amazing place to express one\u2019s individuality, it also leads to people feeling insecure, less than, or extremely envious of a person they know of or a complete stranger. It makes you take a step back when you realize how often people envy other people\u2019s lives and stop living their own because they are attached to their screen.Mostly when envy plays in my life its mostly because of looks. When I see women that looks prettier than me, it would bring me down at time . I would just be like...dang I wish I was like that then get mad jealous.Whenever I envy somebody or something, I am motivated to get whatever I was jealous of. Even when I was little and saw a toy that another little girl had, I saved up, until I got my reward. And now, as a teenager, I use the power of envy as a force in my everyday life. If one of my friends gets a higher grade than me, of course, I would feel envy. So when it came time to take the next exam, I would think back to that moment, and remember what it is that I want: the higher grade. This can be boiled down to competition, because I have a desire to always be on top._________In my opinion, I think art is best experienced in person. Not that it is impossible for art to be appreciated online or in a book, but to really gain the full experience I think it is best to see them in the flesh. Many of the most famous artworks displayed in museums were made long before art was printed into books and posted on the internet. The artist\u2019s intention was for his/her audience to view them in person, so would that not be the best way to appreciate them? A piece of art that I would love to see in person would have to be a Jackson Pollock piece. By looking at pictures of it online, it is impossible to comprehend the sheer size and the presence it holds in a room. This is one huge drawback you see with viewing art nowadays, because so much of the art we see is online. There is absolutely no way to get the full experience of a piece behind a screen. However, with the internet we can quickly and efficiently see art we would never be able to see without spending money on a plane ticket. Still, I think that the digital era is somewhat ruining the experience of viewing art. It has made it more about visiting museums and having the \u201cI was there\u201d picture than actually appreciating and learning about the art.Prompt One: I think art is meant to be experience in person. I think the meaning of the art is magnified in person and captured in a way that couldn\u2019t be otherwise. I think visual art should be seen in museums. That way, the viewer can get a personal impression of the work that isn\u2019t digital. For me, music is the most important form of art. I know that I\u2019d rather see any song in person at a live concert than through my earbuds at home. I think seeing music in person generates more emotion as you get the atmosphere of a crowd and it\u2019s almost as though you get to interact with the artist and their music. I think the type of art depends on whether the media should be viewed with a group or as an individual. I think are is meant to be experience both intellectually and emotionally. I think art is meant to appeal to all types of things. Art can not only make you think about certain messages, but also appeal to several emotions. I think this is what makes art so special; there is a type for every individual.In my opinion, different forms of art are meant to be experienced in different ways. People can have a different outcome of feelings towards a work of art if their experience isn\u2019t the same as another persons. I think works of art like the Mona Lisa are meant to be experienced in person, individually, and emotionally whereas works of art like dances are meant to be viewed online and in a group. This is because so much detail can go into a painting and if its not inspected closely, meaning can be lost. On the other hand, with works like dances, the filming and production of the video can add to the overall routine. Also, a whole group can enjoy and try to participate as the work is playing. Benefits of the digital era with art is editing, production quality, and easier sharing opportunities. The main drawback is people trying to get the experience of art online that is meant to be viewed in person and up close. Overall, I think the digital era is improving the experience of art because technology has opened so many doors and possibilities to create new, groundbreaking types of art.Art is meant to be experienced in whatever way is best for the viewer to fully receive the full effect and understanding intended by the artist. Whether that method is in person, online or in books, depends on the viewer and their accessibility to the artwork. I think the initial power lies in the artist\u2019s hands to choose a format that they believe will reach and impact the most people. Those people then obtain the power to share the art with others to experience it in different ways.Works of art I would like to see in person are the recent presidential portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C. I want to experience this in person because I think that would be the best way to remember and revel in the existence of a black president and first lady of the United States, whose portraits were created by black artists. That kind of art is weighted in such a rich and painful history that I want to say I have seen with my own eyes in real life. I have seen the portraits online, and though it brought me so much joy, it made me yearn to see it in person. The digital images showed people witnessing the art for the first time in real life. Their reactions prove that seeing it in person can have a great impact also. The digital era was given artists the tools to share their creations with larger audiences. Viewers have the right to seek other ways of experiencing art. I would think the goal of artists would be to share it with the masses.One of the most beautiful things about art is the fact that nothing about it is set in stone. There are no definitive laws or theories like there are in the natural sciences. Because of this variability, art isn\u2019t meant to be experienced in any single way. Some types of art are best experienced in a museum, which creates a certain atmosphere of seriousness and formality. Seeing the most famous art works in a museum is a very different experience than seeing them in a book or on a screen, and to some, the former might be the best way to experience them whereas for others it may be the latter. It rests on the preferences of the beholder. I once went to the Detroit Institute of Art, and I could have easily spent innumerable hours there, examining the artwork of different ages and areas. It was a very different experience than seeing a painting on a screen. It became more real, more 3-D. This is definitely a drawback of the digital era. We lose the physicality and dimensions of the world on the flat surface of our screens. How can you ever be sure of the height of a mountain if you only ever see a picture? On the other hand, works of art have never been more accessible than they are now. With simply the touch of a button and a few typed words you can view almost any work of art that you want. With technology, we are able to experience so much more art than if we had to travel to see it. Thus, the impact of the digital age on experiencing art can easily be argued both ways.As the digital age progresses and becomes more influential in our day-to-day lives, art has been forced to change its ways. Originally, a piece of art was meant to be observed in the flesh, allowing us to view each brush stroke on the canvas. Today, art can come in nearly any form. The ability to view art in person is no longer required. Rather, some art is created purely for its online availability. Take a photographer that purely takes photos to be displayed online. Does viewing these photos give us the same experience as viewing them in person would? Probably not, but to say that viewing them would have no worth at all would be to undermine the value of today\u2019s artists. In this way, art isn\u2019t simply meant to be experienced in one specific way. Instead, it takes the form of anything and everything, and the way in which we view it changes our outlook on it.While it\u2019s disheartening to me that many people only choose to experience art by taking pictures of famous works, I think it\u2019s a sign of a shift in how we can view and create art in the 21st century. Physical art done with oil paint on canvas is now joining other mediums like digital art and cartoons, which can be distributed online, along with pictures of traditional works of art. I believe that this has caused us to see the physical works of art as something sacred, that we must see just for the experience, and take pictures to capture the memory. As Li said, \u201cI can see [the Mona Lisa] better in a book or on the internet.\u201d Of course there are countless ways to experience art, but it may be of value for us to take more time to consider what we really look for in art, rather than just notoriety. To summarize, it\u2019s my belief that in a time when art in all of its forms is so accessible, we should look for art that has meaning for us, not just that which has a famous name attached.Everyone\u2019s art experience is individual and experienced differently. Art is not meant to be experienced in any specific way. Your take about a piece of art is always going to be different from someone else\u2019s. I consider Seeing art in person always better, for example it makes me feel closer to the artist. Also when I am looking at a work of art, I know that what I am seeing is unique. Seeing it in person gives value to the piece.I admit that sometimes I do visit museums just because an artwork that I am going to see is really famous. But this does not mean that I can\u2019t appreciate it or that it does not transmit me any feelings.Of course right now there are some huge advantages involving art because of the digital era. There is no need to travel or even to move to see art. It could be a real advantage for someone who is unable or does not have opportunities to visit a museum. But also I think that the fact that you only need a click to see a work of art, takes value away from the artists\u2019 job._________A free press is like a catalyst in a democratic society. Journalism offers a common ground for ideas to be discussed from diverse points of views and promoting a dialog.So that people can form their own opinions, values like impartiality, truth and accuracy should play a key role in the media. If the radio reports that the German government decides to swith off nuclear energy, it has to make sure the facts are right, the opinion reported is not misrepresented and that the pros and cons of this idea are presented to the audience.To support a liberal society that respects diversity, fairness and peace, we need a dissenting press. Demagogues will enjoy impunity with the lack of free press if they are successful in silencing a critical voice in the society. Miss Turkey got into trouble by writing a poem that critiqued Mr. Erdogan. Such instances will continue to happen if press is allowed to be intimidated by these \u201cdemocratators\u201d. Freedom of speech shouldn\u2019t be misunderstood to be freedom to offend. Journalists are accountable to a pluralistic audience that trusts the press as a source of information to form their views. The press thus has a huge responsibility in keeping a healthy discourse alive to keep democracy alive.Though it may be interesting or even entertaining, the foremost value of news is as a utility to empower the informed. The purpose of journalism is thus to provide citizens with the information they need to make the best possible decisions about their lives, their communities, their societies, and their governments. News is that part of communication that keeps us informed of the changing events, issues, and characters in the world outside. Though it may be interesting or even entertaining, the foremost value of news is as a utility to empower the informed.Since the 2016 Presidential Election, I\u2019ve come to realize that the media is incredibly important. Journalism is a line of defense against a powerful government: it is essential to democracy to be aware of what our elected officials are doing! As someone who supports a lot of government regulation, I don\u2019t think news outlets should be censored in any way. My peers insist on the government mitigating news outlets rather than being responsible, aware, and critical of the information they consume online or on television. Censoring the freedom of the press and free speech is also interfering with the first amendment rights of Americans: so what stops the government from stopping people to peacefully protest or worship whichever god(s) they believe in? I do agree that President Trump is a threat to the free press and I don\u2019t think democratic leaders should denounce the media. Leaders should be aware how essential it is to the people they have sworn to serve to be aware of the good and the bad of their policies: not everyone wins in politics, people have to compromise.I think that the freedom of press is important until a certain point, the press does not have to have the freedom to do whatever they want or to say whatever they want to say because everyone knows how harassing some reporters can be, it is true that their work is important to keep us informed about things that happened around the world.In my opinion, the purpose of journalism is offers enough information to all of us. It is important for all people in our country, to know more about what happen in each place. Journalism is a means of information very important. Journalists should have absolute freedom of speech everywhere in the world.Soft censorship by media outlets is a serious problem that does not get enough attention. Sometimes agents of the state and/or corporate entities make it difficult for journalists to report the facts or act impartially.Consider the case of Bela Kosoian, the woman who was handcuffed and fined for not holding an escalator handrail and obstructing police in the performance of their duties. The incident was all over the news in 2009. Journalists at the time sided with the police, saying they were merely enforcing an STM by-law. Had they done their due diligence instead of acting like cheerleaders for the police, they would have discovered there is no regulation requiring commuters to hold the handrail \u2014 not then, not now. Ms. Kosoian contested her tickets in municipal court and won. News of her victory was never reported to the masses, whom to this very day live in ignorance of the injustice that was done to her \u2014 and by extension to themselves. She is currently going the route of social media with a campaign called 1becomesmany to raise awareness of her challenge to the Supreme Court of Canada on a related matter. She has a Wix blog with an entry called \u201cYes. Real life can be stranger than fiction\u201d, which will give you cause to question the integrity of our so-called free press._________Cyberbullying is a nationwide issue and ranges among all ages, not just teenagers. I have never been bullied over the internet but it\u2019s something that most kids my age face everyday. I feel as if social media apps aren\u2019t doing as much as they can for the children and young adults being tormented from cyberbullying. It happens too often for nothing to be changing. The most common apps where people cyberbully would be Facebook and Instagram. Facebook and Instagram can do a lot more then they are now about addressing this problem.Students love to conceal their embarrassment or the shame of being bullied. I honestly believe that snapchat is where most of the cyber bullying take place. Most students ponder that since snap chat post disappear after 24 hours that it doesn\u2019t matter which is false. I do feel as if social media companies should try to filter what is posted or commented. No one should feel harassed on social media, and I think that they should try to remove the negative comments and etc. For example have someone watch over pages. I think that some students are just trying to crack a joke, but takes that joke a little to far. I am aware of cyber bullying knowing the fact that at one point I was a victim of cyber bullying. I know that the act of bullying will not cease, but I think that their should be more that we can do.I think Instagram is doing good recognizing and taking action when cyberbullying is spotted. To do even better, Instagram and other social media platforms should encourage users to report cyberbullying. Personally, I found that people feel intrusive or in other people\u2019s business when they report abusive, hurtful comments. On one specific post, I saw a younger girl getting attacked for supporting a highly disliked celebrity. I reported the comments and they were removed within 24 hours. I feel like most social media is doing really well recognizing and fighting against cyberbullying.I think cyberbullying is a problem for some people. They feel more comfortable doing it behind a screen instead of in person. This does not happen to me, but for many other people it does. It happens on any app where you can talk to another person. People\u2019s feelings get hurt often because others are mean to them. The people that cyberbully have probably been bullied before, so they do it to make them feel better about themselves. A person is most likely to scared to tell someone about it, so the bully takes advantage of that and does not stop. Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and no one should have to go through that!_________My reaction to Kanye\u2019s comments is that of disgust and disregard; I agree with the widespread denunciation. Celebrities\u2019 personal opinions, depending on the topic, do not necessarily influence my opinion of their work, but they do influence my support of them.I\u2019ve stopped listening to many artists because of what they\u2019ve said and what they\u2019ve done regardless of my initial positive feelings about their work. I don\u2019t want to endorse a person who espouses hateful views or plain ignorance. I don\u2019t think separating the art from the artist applies to modern public figures who should understand the significance of their comments and actions. It\u2019s easy for people like Mr. Leibovitz to minimize Kanye\u2019s rhetoric as a mere opinion. But while some have the privilege of ignoring politics, others are affected daily by its consequences, which is why I don\u2019t understand how the endorsement of a man with staunch support from white supremacists should be tolerated and overlooked as simply a different viewpoint. This \u201cfree-thinking\u201d is dangerous because it normalizes the racism Kanye has internalized and gives credibility to those who believe in these ideas. People shouldn\u2019t be given a pass because others perceive them as creative and insightful, Kanye\u2019s pseudo-intellectual comments, especially as a \u201cproud non-reader of books,\u201d are the direct opposite of insight, and they should be held accountable, especially when their \u201cmissteps\u201d aren\u2019t actually mistakes but intentional choices they make.Kanye West has never been the kind of person to withhold what he thinks from the media because it would cause controversy. In the recent TMZ interview that he took part in, he made the comment that looking back now after hundreds of years \u201cslavery is a choice\u201d which immediately caused outrage.Although his comments are unpopular in the public eye, in my opinion it should not harbor an effect on the enjoyment of his musical or fashion endeavors. West has the right to say what he believes and for people to attempt to boycott his music and to cause such an uproar because of the fact that he is in the public eye. I enjoy West\u2019s music separate from whether I agree or disagree with his political or other public views. One of the things that makes Kanye the great artist that he is, is his edge and refusal to keep with the norm. He is entitled to his opinion and in my opinion for Kanye to say something of this nature is not extremely surprising.Although I was surprised by what Kanye West said during his interview, I like hearing what celebrities have to say about topics that don\u2019t have anything to do with their profession. You never know what they are gonna say. Kanye is a musician and an entertainer. I have never unfollowed a celebrity on social media because of their political views. If their beliefs influence their work, I would still follow them. It\u2019s part of who they are.After listening to Kanye\u2019s interview on TMZ, it made me realize that even though Kanye\u2019s comments on slavery were very shocking, he has the right to express his feelings. I understand that some people were offended by what he said. He is famous and he has a lot of influence, but people have the right to criticism him, unfollow him or to boycott his products and music if they want. Freedom of expression is a right of all Americans. Kanye said in his interview that he admires Trump because he proved that anything is possible in America. I can understand how Kanye can relate to Trump as an outsider. Kanye\u2019s interview shows how important it is to have conversations about controversial issues. Everyone has their own opinions, no matter how different they are, we should listen so that we can understand where people are coming from even if we don\u2019t agree with them. Artists and people need to be free to express themselves, it\u2019s one of the things that makes America great, even if we disagree with what they say.Personally, I\u2019m glad that Kanye West is sharing his opinion. The right to free expression is everyone\u2019s and Kanye is not exempt. The public response was unfair; having an unpopular opinion does not make someone crazy, but, the right is entitled to their opinion as well. It\u2019s human nature to put people in boxes.As Mr. West states in his TMZ interview, he is an artist, a musician, and a black person, but his opinions do not have to align with other members of that group. It is not his responsibility to represent anyone besides himself and his company. The most human thing that Kanye or any artist can do is express their unique perspective.A celebrities\u2019 personal beliefs \u2014 their political leanings, philosophical stances, perspectives on the world and their causes, should not be considered when deciding the quality of their work. Simultaneously, artist\u2019s work should not be independent of who they are. If you don\u2019t like what someone stands for, then go find other entertainers. I would never delete a celebrities social media or not watch their performances because their opinions don\u2019t align with mine. I believe it is important to interact with and receive the opinions of people who you don\u2019t agree with. People\u2019s personal beliefs have never changed my feelings about their work. I agree with Mr. Leibowitz\u2019s statement because free expression is a right of all americans.When people say that Kanye is in the \u201cSunken Place\u201d I honestly found it as a joke but now I\u2019m starting to think this statement is true. I feel, as many others do, that he\u2019s only doing this because he has music coming out. Kanye is known for acting a fool when he has something coming out so that it brings him a much attention. But as far as his very surprising remarks on slavery, I am honestly extremely hurt, taken back, and disgust. Being imprisoned is not a choose. We have to keep in mind that many of those slaves made tough decisions like taking their lives and risking running away, killing masters, and rebelling. So the statement about choosing to to be slaves and being mental imprisoned was very reckless.After returning from his one year mental cool down, Kanye West has returned to the public eye in a very thought provoking way. Personally I believe that Mr. West\u2019s comments could offend many people, but I can\u2019t say I feel personally attacked by his ideals. He believes the words he is speaking and he is entitled to his opinion. The public can comment on his views but I believe that nobody should be attempting to conform him because of the influence he holds over people. Kanye West has millions of fans that will listen to what he says but people who challenge his views have no right to say he shouldn\u2019t believe what he wants. West is challenging the social norm and he doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated poorly based off his beliefs, no person does.Just like every other person, Kanye is entitled to his own opinion, but when you\u2019re in a position of status or power, you have to be conscious of the impact of your words. In regards to Mr. West showing his support for Trump, although I do not support Trump in any way, that is his choice and option to do so. However when stating that 400 years of slavery was a choice, there was a clear lack of thought behind what he was saying. He completely dismissed the mental and physical brutality of slavery and the repercussions of it against black people throughout history: from Jim Crow era to police brutality.I wouldn\u2019t have had as big of a problem with it if Kanye offered an explanation, but his statement seemed as if there was little or no thought to back it up. Kanye is a great artist that many look up to, however he has to realize that what he says has an effect on everyone.In general for me, an artist\u2019s work and beliefs go hand in hand. If something they support goes against what I stand for morally, I can not continue to support them, because at the end of the day there are plenty of artists and musicians that I can enjoy. That doesn\u2019t mean they themselves are a bad person or their work is bad, but it would be hypocritical for me to say one thing, while supporting artists with morals that do not align with my own.Kanye West is notorious for speaking out against the norm and having an abstract point of view. After listening to Kanye\u2019s interview, I was intrigued by his mindset and the way he views big political matters. Kanye was recently seen wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and when asked about it, he replied \u201cIt was just what I was feeling that day.\u201d He then said how he likes Trump and how he was considered an outsider in the presidential campaign and ended up becoming president. Kanye enjoyed the fact that an \u201coutsider infiltrated\u201d and won the election. Kanye, unlike many other rappers, likes Trump and is intrigued by the way he handles things. Kanye also likes Trump because of how he uses his platform to speak directly to the people and how the people have no fear in speaking back. Kanye believes that Trump has allowed Americans to speak out and feel comfortable doing so._________GoodbyeMay the rain splash against your umbrellaMay they sit like dew drops or slither awayMay the rain caress our cheeks?But the drops on our cheeks aren\u2019t rain,Are they?Please let me carry your luggage for youMay you find happiness above the cloudsThe people around us hustle alongThe chaos that surrounds useWe reach security, I can\u2019t go furtherThe last time these eyes see yoursThe ticket stamped and I\u2019m given one last glanceA wave of a hand and a bittersweet smileYou\u2019re going to better and brighter places,Far away from meResting on my nightstandA journal, your journalYou\u2019ve forgotten itYou\u2019d never let me read itIt stays with me, daring me to explore your thoughtsBut I mustn\u2019t, I can\u2019t break your trustI can\u2019t break what\u2019s already brokenAnd the drops on my cheeks aren\u2019t rain,Are they?At different locations on this giant green rock, there are personal items being lost. They\u2019re carried from A to B, seeing the world from low and high, in wallets and bags. Their needs not thought about by their owners. Because they\u2019re not living, they dont have feelings, right? Although these seem like lost items, they are just trying to go on their own journey. A book, filled with personal secrets or a schedule wants to read stories. A wet umbrella after a spring storm wants to feel the warm sun. A ticket, going somewhere far or near wants to stay put. And a suitcase, seeing hundreds of faces everyday and then being packed away, when it really wants to see the world. Maybe these items go missing on purpose, so they can be on their own. To be free of boundaries and the \u201cstereotypes\u201d of non living items. The ticket drifts out of a hand, the book drops out of a bag, the umbrella is left at a rest stop 30 miles up the road, and the suitcase is left alone in a florida airport.

He went to the booth, got his ticket, and left everything in his bunk room on the train to go get a drink and find out more about the train\u2019s occupants, only to get back to find all his spy stuff, book, suitcase, and umbrella stewed all over the floor with a ripped up ticket that said, \u201cYou\u2019re on the wrong train.\u201dHeading out from LA for a weekend of fun with friends in San Fransisco, Jim had his necessary travel items packed in his blue carry-on rolling bag, his leather bound diary, rainbow colored umbrella for those unexpected January rain showers, toiletries and a few items he would want to wear.

With anticipation for the upcoming concert Jim took out his ticket for the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, only to see something was not right. It was the date.

It\u2019s straw season.She said that despite all the online chatter about alternatives to plastic straws, no customer had ever requested one. To her surprise, the restaurant ran out of paper straws in a week. \u201cThis is something people wanted more than I anticipated,\u201d Ms. Diamond said.In April, after reading reports about how plastic straws contributed to whale deaths, Mr. Ratnam stopped putting them out at Inday\u2019s flagship.\u201cPeople stopped asking for them,\u201d he said. \u201cStraws are a small, nonessential beverage accessory that we found people aren\u2019t super attached to. We have been able to change customer behavior without being disruptive.\u201d He has since stopped putting out straws at all his restaurants (though customers can get plastic straws on request).The beverage director, Yana Volfson, said that because she carefully chooses the glassware, a straw of any kind \u201cwould take away from that more visceral experience of a cocktail.\u201d Drinks like a margarita, which has a salt-lined rim, she said, are meant for strawless sipping.\u201cWhy have we made it the norm that every cocktail should be served with a straw, even when someone doesn\u2019t need or hasn\u2019t asked for one?\u201d she said.When asked, several customers said they favored doing away with plastic straws, but would stop using them only if restaurants took the lead.At another table, Louise Laage Toft, also 29, said she loved the protection that straws provide. \u201cWhen I have a Coke, I like drinking it with a straw so I don\u2019t touch anything to my teeth,\u201d she said. But if plastic straws were banned, she added: \u201cI would be fine with it. The environment is more important than me and my weirdness.\u201dStill, most establishments continue to hand out plastic straws, which are often cheaper and more durable than their paper siblings. Even some coffee shops, which commonly pride themselves on their green initiatives, seem reluctant to change.But asked about dropping straws altogether, Ms. Bell was aghast. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there weren\u2019t straws, customers would have a meltdown. It would be very hard to get away from them, especially with people commuting.\u201d\u201cActually, if we run out of straws at a condiment station for, like, 30 seconds, there is an uproar,\u201d Ms. Stratigos said. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, too, because if people need room for milk, they will sip the coffee out of the cup, and then they\u2019ll still put on the lid and straw. It\u2019s a force of habit.\u201dThe only way to render straws obsolete is to redesign lids and cups, said Mr. Ratnam, of Inday. \u201cThe onus is on the restaurant owners to work with buyers and manufacturers to come up with a solution that can accommodate the functionality of a straw without using one,\u201d he said. \u201cIf enough restaurant owners came together, you could force innovation.\u201dNew York summers are likely a long way from going completely straw-free, but Ms. Diamond said she was optimistic.\u201cI imagine that one day when you talk to little kids, they might be like, \u2018What\u2019s a straw?\u2019 in the same way that they now don\u2019t know what a typewriter is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Like a friendly shark that needs to keep oxygen-rich water flowing over its gills, Ms. Ray survives on constant motion.\u201cI don\u2019t need help,\u201d she said, moving me away from the ramps she was chopping. \u201cThis is my happy place.\u201dDespite the kind of wealth that allows her to drop more than $80,000 on a private jet so her beloved pit bull, Isaboo, can travel to Italy with her and her husband, John Cusimano, she is still very much the upstate New York kid whose first job was running the dish machine at a restaurant her mother managed.She and Mr. Cusimano, an entertainment lawyer and a rock musician, spend as much time as they can in this house, which they built for $1 million a decade ago from reclaimed barn wood and stone blasted from the 199 acres it sits on. That\u2019s big money here, but less than it cost them to buy a couple of rooms so they could expand their apartment in Greenwich Village.\u201cI just want a place I can die,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Italian in me.\u201dHere in the woods, Ms. Ray has the space to contemplate the next phase of a career arc that, at its zenith, sliced popular food culture down the middle: You either loved Rachael Ray or wanted her to drown in a vat of her own EVOO \u2014 her phrase for extra-virgin olive oil, which was added to the Oxford American College Dictionary in 2007.Ms. Ray rose to fame in the early 2000s, when the Food Network minted stars like the old Hollywood studio system. She was the cute girl next door with a little urban flair who could teach you how to cook dinner in half an hour.Now, facing her 50th birthday in August, she is trying to figure out how to steer a huge media and merchandise ship that is starting to show its age into fresh waters.Ms. Ray, a worrier prone to stress dreams the day before a big meeting, is steeling herself for what could be an uphill climb: making herself relevant to a new generation.Her plan of attack includes pitching digitally streamed shows that have more to do with food, travel and music than cooking. She wants to produce some and star in others. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to go into a meeting where you are not the coolest person in the room,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting, but it\u2019s completely frightening.\u201dShe figures the worst that could happen is that she ends up staying right where she is. That\u2019s a long way from the days when she was so broke that her hands shook when she swiped her debit card at the supermarket checkout, not sure if she had enough in the bank to cover $60 worth of groceries.Now, she has an American Express black card and more than enough money to care for an extended network of relatives in need; she takes her friends with her on vacation and doles out extravagant presents to the people who work for her. Her list of Christmas gift recipients is 30 pages long.She gives away so much money that you almost believe her when she says she doesn\u2019t know if reports that her net worth tops $60 million are true.\u201cI have no idea if there\u2019s $4 in my pocket or $400,\u201d she said. \u201cI never ask about it. That\u2019s why I have bankers. I don\u2019t want to know anything at all about what I\u2019ve got or what I don\u2019t. It\u2019s never motivated me. It never will.\u201dHer marriage has matured, too. Mr. Cusimano, 50, has been her business partner from nearly the start, and remains her closest adviser. Theirs has always been a fiery relationship, often dissected in the tabloids. But the two have settled into a comfortable, solid, middle-aged partnership filled with accommodation, admiration and frequent kisses.He makes her romantic playlists, writes cocktail recipes for her books and does the grilling and the dishes. She is a faithful fan of his music, buys him fancy motorcycles and other toys, and cooks him dinner.\u201cWe\u2019re the same,\u201d Ms. Ray said. \u201cWe\u2019re loud. We don\u2019t have to have dinner at a set time. And he knows he can\u2019t boss me around over how much money I give away.\u201dMs. Ray, who doesn\u2019t sleep much and relaxes with \u201cColumbo\u201d reruns, has two essential operating principles. First, she won\u2019t put her name on anything she wouldn\u2019t want to use at home or hasn\u2019t sketched out in one of the notebooks that never leave her side.\u201cI even have baby notebooks I put in those stupid handbags when you have to go do the red carpet, because I hate being anywhere where I can\u2019t write anything down,\u201d she said.Second, she works hard and trusts her instincts. \u201cMy gut is what got us here,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not going to change what I do or make my decisions any differently.\u201dDespite protests from advisers, her gut led her into the pet food business in 2008. Owners of a small, family-owned Pennsylvania company noticed how much attention animals received in her magazine, and approached her. Ms. Ray agreed to let them use her name, as long as the food was inspired by her recipes and her piece of the licensing agreement went to her foundation for animals.\u201cPeople were like, you can\u2019t put your head on dog food. That\u2019s insane,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Who cares? It\u2019s not like I have a stellar reputation as one of the world\u2019s great chefs.\u2019\u201dOther ideas are in various stages of execution. She is writing a new book that is neither a memoir nor a cookbook, but has elements of both. She is developing a gardening line and designing handbags, both expensive ones with hand-dyed Italian leather and more affordable vegan models aimed at millennials.Still, Ms. Ray made sure her is name is hidden inside the pieces. \u201cThat way, even if you hate me you can still buy it,\u201d she said.She laughs about it now, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. \u201cBelieve me, I cried my eyes out plenty,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t battle mean-spiritedness by answering it with behavior that is less than what you want for yourself.\u201dShe is less confident about her push into the music world. For 11 years, she has staged shows during the South by Southwest Music Festival, in Austin. \u201cMusic is scarier than furniture because I love it so much,\u201d she said. \u201cIf every time I put on a concert and people were whispering things about me, it\u2019d be like an endless prom.\u201dBy 8 a.m. on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, the line wrapped around several city blocks. People close to Ms. Ray\u2019s age, in green leprechaun hats, said they had learned to cook from her. Men in their early 30s recalled her as their first TV crush. College students playing cards on the sidewalk barely knew she had something to do with cooking, but liked her work as a music promoter.Ms. Ray\u2019s superpower has always been her ability to read what Middle America wants and know just when to deliver it, Ms. Broyles said. \u201cI would not call sous vide mainstream until she does it,\u201d she said.As the country struggles with deep cultural and political divisions, the skill could be the very thing that helps Ms. Ray recapture a certain currency.\u201cShe is anti-aspirational, which actually seems refreshing,\u201d Ms. Druckman said. \u201cIf fast casual is a thing, Rachael is fast casual.\u201dMs. Ray has not embraced a digital life, at least not personally. Although she is a prolific texter, it wasn\u2019t long ago that she put down her flip phone. Her brand has nearly 11 million followers spread across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, but she doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time on those platforms.\u201cI don\u2019t take in negative information online,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a constructive use of my time, and I have too much work to do.\u201dAlthough Ms. Ray is a daily reader of The Times, watches MSNBC and listens to Howard Stern, she tries to separate her show from politics. It doesn\u2019t always work.That doesn\u2019t mean she is going to stop advertising on Fox. Late into an evening that she punctuated with several glasses of red wine might not be the best time to talk politics with Ms. Ray, but on this point she was crystal clear: She will continue to advertise her brands and schedule guests without regard to anyone\u2019s political beliefs.\u201cOn the television show, everyone has to be welcome,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our safe space.\u201dTommy Crudup, a CBS talent executive who books guests for her show and spends weekends at her house in the Adirondacks, explained it this way: \u201cRachael is happiest when everyone around her is happy, and she made them that way.\u201dBut her sunny, everyone-in-the-pool approach could also undercut her.\u201cWell, you\u2019re at the wrong show,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cRachael Ray is downstairs.\u201dMs. Ray said that was just Wendy being Wendy, but the comment made it clear that Rachael Ray is an avatar for a certain slice of America that doesn\u2019t know how to throw shade.She did offer a little advice on how to navigate sexual harassment, based on her years of restaurant work, two muggings, a terrifying incident with a stalker and some difficult childhood experiences: Punch back, at least verbally.\u201cWomen should see they need to speak out in the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen something happens, say it out loud and address it immediately.\u201dWith that, Ms. Ray headed to bed. The next morning, she squealed when she saw a photograph of her next to Michelle Obama on \u201cCBS Sunday Morning.\u201d It reminded her of their work together on childhood nutrition and how much ground she feels has been lost.But she is going to keep moving. Even if her place in popular culture slips away, she\u2019ll still find a way to make hay, she said. She always has.\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she said, slicing a speck, cabbage and egg pie she had pulled out of the pizza oven for breakfast. \u201cIf I die tomorrow, I\u2019m good.\u201dMr. Cusimano was loading the dishwasher. \u201cHoney,\u201d he said, \u201cplease don\u2019t die tomorrow.\u201dSusan Beachy contributed research.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are My Friends Really My Friends?", "Date": "2018-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byfuture tenseThe quantity of human interactions has increased, but the quality is arguably diminished.The two-decade-old reference may feel dated, but consider the period the film was set in and the ways its characters interact. Landline conversations are routine. Lengthy answering-machine messages and postal mail play a significant emotional role. Friends gather at bars with no external distractions and little chance of making plans with other people on the fly.In hindsight, the movie\u2019s time \u2014 the \u201990s \u2014 was the last decade that had relatively few technological obstacles to traditional levels of friendship \u201cthickness.\u201d Social media and smartphones spread affection around more easily; friendships may run thin.\u201cMy net is cast wider\u201d now than in the past, said Lucy Schiller, 29, a recent graduate of the nonfiction writing program at the University of Iowa. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier for me to engage casually with a greater number of people. I don\u2019t know if this is a byproduct of aging, but it seems like the parameters of friendships have changed. I\u2019d like to think they involve long walks and talking at length in person and involving yourself in shared activities, but at this point it feels like those structures have been relegated to the past and we\u2019re skating along through very fun but very lightweight interactions.\u201dTwo statistics from the General Social Survey in 1985 and 2004 are often invoked regarding the influence of new technology on close friendships and social isolation. The average number of confidants people said they had dropped from 2.94 to 2.08 over that time, and the number of those who had none at all went from one-tenth to nearly one-quarter.Taken on their own, these numbers are a damning indictment of internet-era connections, even if social networking was in its MySpace-Friendster infancy in 2004 and the iPhone did not exist. The researchers also determined that the network size of \u201ccore discussion confidants\u201d is most strongly associated with two popular social media activities: instant messaging and uploading photos. People who have a mobile phone and engage in these activities have a network 34 percent larger than those who don\u2019t.The oft-cited \u201cDunbar\u2019s number\u201d is an average of 150 casual friends for humans (really, a range of 100 to 200). These are the people who might come to your wedding or funeral. However, digital media channels \u201cdon\u2019t distinguish between quality of relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cThey allow you to maintain relationships that would otherwise decay. Our data shows that if you don\u2019t meet people at the requisite frequencies, you\u2019ll drop down through the layers until eventually you drop out of the 150 and become \u2018somebody you once knew.\u2019 What we think is happening is that, if you don\u2019t meet sometime face to face, social media is slowing down the rate of decay.\u201dThe result, then, can be a glut of old acquaintances that are not as easily forgotten online and which therefore stifle the development of newer, in-person friendships.\u201cYour available social time is limited, and you can either spend it face to face or on the internet,\u201d Dr. Dunbar said. If it\u2019s spent with people who are \u201cremote,\u201d whether geographically or just because they\u2019re represented digitally, \u201cyou don\u2019t have time to invest in new relationships where you are.\u201d \u201cIf my high-school friend posts frequently about her life, it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s celebrity gossip, or it\u2019s akin to me watching a reality show about her,\u201d Ms. Flora said. \u201cOur brains get confused about whether we know celebrities; if we see someone a lot, our brain thinks we know them.\u201dOf course, thinking we know people through status updates (or paparazzi photos) is not the same as spending time with them, just as dashing off \u201cHappy birthday!\u201d on someone\u2019s Facebook wall has less emotional impact than saying it in person or over the phone. Ms. Flora did note the advantages of digital media for introverts and people susceptible to loneliness, namely that it is less risky and enervating to make contact through a text or post than through a phone call or an invitation to meet.With this lower threshold for maintaining friendships, some people strongly favor mediated interactions over in-person interactions, especially millennials accustomed to constant communication via devices. Ms. Schiller, the Iowa graduate, goes out often with friends at night but also subsists on a digital diet of texting (heavily enough that she recently strained her thumb), Google Chat and social media. She said she finds conversation on Google Chat banal, likely because she tends to use it as she multitasks on her computer, but sometimes opens up more to people via the confessional space of a text message than she might across a table. As with many millennials, talking on the phone was never a big part of her routine and is now reserved for the rarest of occasions. \u201cI\u2019ve asked people over Gchat if they want to talk on the phone, and they hem and haw,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can feel draining \u2014 there isn\u2019t a casual component to it.\u201dThere are physiological benefits to face-to-face encounters, however, that do not accrue to digital interactions or the phone. \u201cYour blood pressure goes down, you have synchrony, you mimic your friend\u2019s posture unconsciously,\u201d Ms. Flora said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rapport humans have developed over thousands of years, and you don\u2019t get that when you only follow someone on social media.\u201d (Skype et al. can be comparable, though, Dr. Dunbar observed.)\u201cIf there\u2019s a bunch of guys at a bar together and they\u2019re all on their phones,\u201d Dr. Dunbar said, \u201cthey\u2019re not doing much to trigger the endorphin system to create the sense of bondedness.\u201dBecause members of Generation X such as Ms. Flora based the passionate friendships of their youth primarily on in-person interactions or \u201crambling\u201d phone calls, when they \u201cmake the transfer\u201d to digital friendships they \u201ccan take advantage of the benefits of it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for younger people, I would worry about them compromising that precious face-to-face time, not sensing or adjusting to what their friends are really thinking or feeling.\u201dSpeaking of her generation\u2019s possibly diminished capacity for deep friendships, Ms. Schiller issued an unintentionally resonant qualification.\u201cIt might just be me,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

And they have renewed their efforts to have it removed.\u201cWe are in charge of keeping our most vulnerable people private and protected,\u201d said Heather Ali, who works at the hospital in nursing administration. \u201cNow people wonder, \u2018How much is my privacy protected at a hospital with that name on it?\u2019\u201dMegan Brizzolara, a nurse at the hospital, said the Zuckerberg name \u201cscares\u201d patients.\u201cLook it\u2019s a double-edged sword, and I totally get the loyalty to the name as it was historically, but this is a thing that\u2019s between the donors and the Board of Supervisors completely,\u201d said Brent Andrew, the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital\u2019s chief communications officer.Some on the board at the time now question their decision.\u201cHad we known what we know now, perhaps we wouldn\u2019t have accepted the funds from Zuckerberg,\u201d said John Avalos, the former supervisor.On Saturday, about a dozen current and former nurses held a small demonstration outside the hospital, led by Sasha Cuttler, a nurse.Guy Vandenberg, another nurse, came down in scrubs and on one placard wrote a diagnosis (\u201cmalwareberg\u201d) and on another sketched out a fake prescription: \u201cUninstall Zuckerberg.\u201dAt the end, Mx.

{"Headline": "How an Italian Disco Hit Became Liverpool\u2019s Champions League Anthem", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerLIVERPOOL, England \u2014 In those last, fretful minutes in Rome, when every second felt like an age and the final whistle seemed as though it would never come, Liverpool\u2019s fans sang to stave off the nerves.It was ritual, distraction and prayer: They started with \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone,\u201d the club\u2019s hymn, switched to \u201cThe Fields of Anfield Road\u201d and then, finally, sang, \u201cWe Shall Not Be Moved.\u201dWhen the game ended, when A.S. Roma had fallen just short, there was a moment of something close to silence: as if everyone were checking the math, making sure Liverpool really had beaten its host, 7-6 on aggregate, and had reached its first Champions League final in more than a decade.Liverpool\u2019s fans do not know it as that, of course: In England, it is simply \u201cAllez Allez Allez,\u201d the tune that has provided the jubilant soundtrack to Liverpool\u2019s journey to Kiev this week, to its meeting with Real Madrid in Saturday\u2019s Champions League final.\u201cL\u2019Estate Sta Finendo\u201d did not simply morph into \u201cAllez Allez Allez.\u201d Its journey was circuitous, spreading from L\u2019Aquila, a small city in Abruzzo, in southern Italy, to Turin and Naples and then on, out into the world, to Portugal and Germany, before arriving in Liverpool.What makes \u201cL\u2019Estate Sta Finendo\u201d different, though, is that its dissemination, and its transformation, occurred almost entirely online.\u201cIt was written when I was 20,\u201d Stefano Righi \u2014 better known by his stage name, Johnson Righeira \u2014 said of the song he and his partner, Stefano Rota, wrote in the 1980s.\u201cIt is about the end of the summer, the end of the holidays, the start of school, the start of the year. That is a time when loves come to an end, when you know you will not see people ever again. It is the moment when time passes.\u201dIn 1985, it was a hit in Italy, reaching the top of the charts there and picking up airplay in Germany and Switzerland. Righeira did write songs at the time that were adopted by fans \u2014 \u201cNo Tengo Dinero,\u201d the group\u2019s other major success, was picked up by Roma as a serenade to Toninho Cerezo, a Brazilian midfielder, when the song was first released. But it did not seem that \u201cL\u2019Estate Sta Finendo\u201d would be one of them.Until, that is, Righi performed in L\u2019Aquila, a city devastated by an earthquake in 2009, \u201cthree or four years ago.\u201dL\u2019Aquila\u2019s team plays in the lower tiers of Italian soccer, but it has a loud and loyal ultra group, known (for the team\u2019s colors) as the Red-Blue Eagles. They are widely credited with transforming \u201cL\u2019Estate Sta Finendo\u201d from a forgotten disco hit into a stadium chant in 2014, but confirming that as truth was difficult: A leader of the group told The New York Times the ultra code prevented him from speaking to the news media on or off the record.From there, the song took flight. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid adopted it \u2014 the club\u2019s fans sang it during the Europa League final last week \u2014 and so did Rangers in Scotland. Righi tracks it all as much as he can; friends still send him video they find of new editions. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it sung at basketball games and hockey games, too,\u201d Righi said.As far as Madureira is concerned, Liverpool lifted it directly from Porto: The teams played in the Champions League\u2019s round of 16 this season, and Madureira said he believed Liverpool\u2019s fans took the song up spontaneously in the stadium. The reality, though, is a little more convoluted.A few weeks after Porto played Dortmund in 2016, Phil Howard, a Liverpool fan from Wavertree, watched the video of the Super Dragons in the subway station. He had been in Dortmund for Liverpool\u2019s game there, and was searching for clips on YouTube, \u201ctrying to see if I was in any of the videos.\u201dDisappearing down a YouTube rabbit hole, he came upon the Porto video. \u201cI wanted to do a version of it straightaway,\u201d he said. \u201cAs stupid as it sounds, I didn\u2019t want Manchester United or Chelsea to get hold of it.\u201dIt took the two of them some time to come up with acceptable lyrics: It was not for 18 months, till December 2017, that Malone had a flash of inspiration. For the next few weeks, he and Howard tried to spread the word and popularize their creation: They were both at the game in Porto \u2014 three months later \u2014 where groups of Liverpool fans started singing it on the concourses and in the stands.Jamie Webster, an electrician and acoustic guitarist, was there, too. \u201cI\u2019d heard murmurs of it at Anfield before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in Porto there was a group of lads singing it. People did not know the words, but they were trying to follow them.\u201d He saw the potential in the chant, too. He found the song online, deciphered the lyrics, and started setting it to music. \u201cI wanted to get it out there,\u201d he said.Webster had the perfect stage. He performs regular sets at two venues that have become cornerstones of Liverpool\u2019s match-day scene: at the Halfway House pub near Anfield and at the BOSS Night events, run by a local music magazine. When he gave his version its debut a few days after the Porto game, the reception was rapturous. \u201cIt took four or five times, and the whole pub was up,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m talking women in their 50s on tables, that sort of thing.\u201dThat moment \u2014 in Webster\u2019s mind \u2014 sealed the song\u2019s place in the Liverpool canon. \u201cThese songs breed through success,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had lost against City, maybe the whole thing would have died off.\u201dLiverpool did not lose, though. The song rang out loud and clear in both legs of the semifinal against Roma; you will hear it, again and again, during Saturday\u2019s final in Kiev, the biggest stage club soccer has to offer.That night, Righi will be expecting a slew of new messages from friends, sending him clips of his song booming out in Ukraine, sung by fans of an English soccer team, who picked it up from a YouTube video of Portuguese ultras singing in Germany, who took it from Naples, who borrowed it from L\u2019Aquila.\u201cEvery version gives the song a new life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very emotional for me. It makes me very happy. I always think that songs are like children: When they become big, they leave home, and they go their own way.\u201dThis one has gone farther than most. It has conquered all of Europe. It\u2019s never going to stop.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Ice Core Reveals the Economic Health of the Roman Empire", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA year by year economic history of the Roman Empire might seem as impossible to reconstruct as the lost 107 books of Livy\u2019s history of Rome. Yet something close to such a record has now been retrieved from the unlikeliest of places \u2014 a glacier in central Greenland.The record is written not in Latin but in lead. Lead emissions generated by mining operations in Northern Europe reached Greenland and were washed down in snowfall. The snow accumulated, turned into ice, and preserved a record that stretches back thousands of years.Ice cores from Greenland have long been used to track global climate change, which is recorded in the frozen water\u2019s oxygen isotopes. The project to measure ancient lead emissions in ice cores was initiated by Andrew I. Wilson, an archaeologist at the University of Oxford who studies the Roman economy. A French team tried this in the 1990s but Dr. Wilson believed new technology might allow a more comprehensive approach and reached out to Joseph R. McConnell, a leading expert in ice core analysis at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nev.Deep Greenland ice cores are hard to obtain because it can take three or four years to drill to bedrock. But Dr. McConnell knew of a core that had to be abandoned when the drill got stuck at the 6,500-foot level. Still, the core recorded 40,000 years of annual snowfalls, and the Danish custodians of the core let Dr. McConnell\u2019s lab use a section of some 1,400 feet from its upper portions, corresponding to the years 1235 B.C. to 1257 A.D.In the lab the ice core was cut into rods just over three feet long that were stood on a heating pad and melted from the bottom. Grooves in the pad directed water from the central and purest part of the core to instruments known as mass spectrometers that continuously measured the quantity of lead down to one hundredth of a picogram, which is one trillionth of a gram. When the ice core was set to melt at the rate of two inches per minute, Dr. McConnell\u2019s team found they could take 12 measurements per year throughout the Roman era.The dates of these ice years were verified by synchronizing them with other chronologies, such as those derived from tree rings and volcanic eruptions.The continuous record of lead pollution is not as good as having figures for Roman gross domestic product, which no one knows, but it does seem to reflect the general economic health of the Roman state.Lead was widely used in the Roman economy for making water pipes and sheathing the hulls of boats. Its production was also a proxy for a central economic activity, the use of silver in the Romans\u2019 standard silver coin, the denarius. Silver occurs in lead ores, and the process of separating the silver from lead at high temperatures was a major source of airborne lead. In the early Roman Empire the denarius was 100 percent silver. But under the emperor Nero, starting in 64 A.D., the proportion of silver was reduced to 80 percent and the state made a tidy profit by recycling the all-silver denarii into debased ones.These changes coincided with, and perhaps were caused by, a drop in silver production, and just such a fall in lead emissions is recorded in the Greenland ice core shortly after 60 A.D. Under the emperor Trajan there was a brief return from 103 to 107 A.D. to making coins from newly mined silver and this historical event too is reflected in a brief spike of lead pollution that ends in 107 A.D.Lead emissions, as reflected in the ice core, dropped to an absolute low during the Imperial Crisis of 235 to 284 A.D., when the empire nearly collapsed under the stresses of internal discord, barbarian invasions and the Cyprian plague. Thereafter the economy, to judge by lead levels, recovered a little but entered a final period of decline marked by the withdrawal of Roman legions from Britain in the early 5th century A.D. and the collapse of the western Roman Empire in 476 A.D.Economic historians have tried to reconstruct the Roman Empire\u2019s gross domestic product but have to make too many assumptions, Dr. Wilson said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the lead pollution graph is a close reflection of GDP but it\u2019s probably the best overall proxy for economic health we\u2019ve got,\u201d he said.He and Dr. McConnell are now working to see if the lead isotopes (lead atoms of different weight) in the ice core will help identify the geographic sources of lead production and thus make allowance for the fact that nearby sources of lead, such as in Britain, would have contributed more heavily to the Greenland pollution than distant ones such as the Rio Tinto mines in Spain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Getting a Flood of G.D.P.R.-Related Privacy Policy Updates? Read Them", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixYou have probably noticed a flood of emails and alerts from companies in the last few weeks informing you about changes to their privacy policies.Don\u2019t ignore them.The data regulation law centers on two main principles. The first is that companies need your consent to collect your data. The second is that you should be required to share only data that is necessary to make their services work.Danny O\u2019Brien, a director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, offered this analogy: \u201cA birthday cake company needs your name to put on the birthday cake. If it isn\u2019t essential information, you can deny them consent to use that data and you still have to get the service.\u201dIf companies don\u2019t comply with the new rules, they can be fined up to 4 percent of their global revenue. But you should expect businesses that rely on advertising revenue to work hard to persuade as many of us as possible to give our consent for them to collect as much data as possible. Companies can do that by making it easy for people to give permission, and immensely complicated to opt out.So to ensure you benefit from the new law, it helps to examine the revamped privacy policies we are all getting. Here is what to look for.Let\u2019s start with those pesky emails and notifications. Don\u2019t gloss over them \u2014 some sites are using the emails not only to inform you of their updated privacy policies, but also to \u201cask\u201d for your consent.A Quora spokeswoman said the company complied with the new data law by seeking affirmative consent from users when required. The company said the email explaining the particular changes in its privacy policy was an informational email and did not require consent, but that it would update the language in its email to be less ambiguous. The language has since been updated.Other sites are using pop-up notifications to seek consent. The clothing retailer Taylor Stitch, for example, recently started showing a banner ad that explains how cookies are used for web tracking. The note added that by closing the banner ad or interacting with its website, you were agreeing with the site\u2019s data collection terms. The company did not respond to requests for comment.Here\u2019s the problem: Companies clearly know that we rarely (if ever) read privacy policies. They also know that we find notifications to be annoying, because they pop up just as we are in the middle of another task.But if we ignore them, we may be unintentionally giving consent to more of our data being shared than we actually want to give out.\u201cThat pop-up fatigue is definitely something I\u2019m worried about, now that these pop-ups are really more important than ever,\u201d said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher who follows privacy issues for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.If you skipped reading the emails and notifications, you may have missed out on the new privacy controls that internet companies recently introduced. These typically are not very easy to find, but they are worth exploring because there may be new methods to minimize the amount of data you share.Consider Twitter. The social media company\u2019s recent privacy-related email mentioned that people can now more clearly see and control how their data is shared with its business partners.Here\u2019s how: Near the very bottom of Twitter\u2019s settings menu, there is now a button called Your Twitter data. Here, you can see the number of advertisers that are trying to target you based on your interests. You can also opt out of this so-called interest-based advertising. When I used the tool, I found out that more than 600 advertisers had my contact information, and I chose to no longer share data with the ads program.For example, you can opt out of being shown ads based on information like your relationship status, employer, job title and education history. You can also opt out of being shown ads based on your activity on other Facebook-owned products like the messaging app WhatsApp or the virtual reality system Oculus.Those are just two examples of big social networking sites. What tech products do you use the most? Take a moment to poke around in your privacy settings to see if there are any new restrictions you can put on your data.A big part of the new data law is that it requires companies to offer ways for you to pull your data out and take it to a new service. Google, Facebook and Twitter each offer the ability to download your own data, and some of those capabilities have been expanded ahead of the new data law\u2019s going into effect.Be aware that other internet products you use should soon be offering similar tools to pull out your data. If you disagree with a company\u2019s new data collection policy, try downloading your information to see if you can exercise your right of taking your data to a better product.And if porting your data doesn\u2019t work out, keep in mind that you can delete your account. The new data law requires companies to offer ways for European users to permanently delete their accounts and all their data along with it. Companies may choose not to offer the same option for people outside Europe, but it won\u2019t hurt to try.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teachers Find Public Support as Campaign for Higher Pay Goes to Voters", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter shutting down schools and shaking up politics in six states, teachers are looking to the ballot box in their campaign for better pay and increased school funding. And their demands are meeting with widespread public support.A survey conducted in early May for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey found that nearly three in four adults \u2014 71 percent \u2014 considered teacher pay too low, while just 6 percent felt it was too high. And two-thirds said they supported increasing the salaries of public-school teachers even if it meant raising taxes.The teacher walkouts began in deep-red states such as West Virginia and Oklahoma, where teacher pay has tended to be lower than in other states, and spread quickly to Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina, racking up a list of concessions from conservative lawmakers. The movement has the potential to influence congressional, gubernatorial and state legislative races, and could catch fire in additional states when the new school year begins.Idaho has some of the lowest teacher pay and per-student education funding in the country, according to federal data, and Mr. Nebeker, 61, said he worried that the state was losing educators as a result.\u201cWe never waste our money when we put it there for good teachers,\u201d Mr. Nebeker said.Such broad-based support is unusual. In the Times survey, for example, 84 percent of Republicans approved of the tax law that Congress passed late last year, compared with 19 percent of Democrats. Similarly, 78 percent of Republicans said they favored Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, but just 27 percent of Democrats did. Partisanship even affects voters\u2019 assessment of the economy: 58 percent of Republicans said they were better off financially than a year ago, versus 17 percent of Democrats.National Democrats are hoping to capitalize on the education funding consensus during this fall\u2019s midterm elections, especially in states with key House and Senate races, like Arizona and West Virginia. Though most school funding comes from state and local sources, not the federal government, congressional Democrats have released a plan to repeal the Trump tax cuts for the top 1 percent of earners in order to spend $50 billion on teacher pay and recruitment and another $50 billion on school infrastructure needs.\u201cTeachers have huge impact in their communities, and they are mobilized and they realize the Democrats are on their side and Republicans have not been,\u201d said the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York. \u201cThe No. 1 way you can get better teachers is teacher pay. Even some Republicans realize that. It\u2019s sort of a free-market concept.\u201d\u201cFirefighters around the station that I talked to looked at it negatively,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe that the teachers used it as a last-ditch effort.\u201dMr. Brown, a conservative who voted for Mr. Trump, said he believed the local teachers\u2019 union was too far to the left. But even as he opposed the walkout, Mr. Brown said he approved of efforts to impose a sales tax in Phoenix to fund city services, including schools.\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe city\u2019s grown to a certain size, and they don\u2019t have the taxes.\u201dThe leaders of Arizona\u2019s walkout movement are collecting signatures for a ballot initiative that would raise income taxes on individuals with income over $250,000 and couples with income over $500,000. Noah Karvelis, an Arizona music teacher and an organizer of the protests, said that such a measure would raise more funds than a sales tax, and that the need for school funding \u201ccuts across a lot of anti-union propaganda that has been steeped into people for decades.\u201dArizona, like Oklahoma, is a traditionally conservative, anti-tax state that spends relatively little on education. But new arrivals could change that equation.Regina Blecher left New York after Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and now lives in Maricopa, outside Phoenix \u2014 where, she said, the grocery store\u2019s parking lot is full of license plates from California and other states. Many of the teachers come from out of state, too, and have different expectations for pay.Ms. Blecher, 48, who has a son in fifth grade, said that after class sizes ballooned, her community approved a property-tax increase last year to hire more teachers.\u201cI was very much for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s enough realization that teachers are underfunded, the classrooms are underfunded.\u201dArizonans, Ms. Blecher said, might never be willing to pay the $12,000 a year in property taxes that her brother pays in Rockland County, N.Y. But she said she saw attitudes shifting.\u201cYou get what you pay for \u2014 that\u2019s the way I think about it,\u201d she said.About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 10,167 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from May 7 to May 13. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bread Pudding Sheds Its Sweet Image", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenWe seldom had dessert after dinner when I was growing up \u2014 that was for company or holidays. Sometimes there was red Jell-O, considered a weeknight treat. My favorite Jell-O product, though, was the pudding mix, preferably the chocolate one. I can still see the four little pudding bowls chilling in the refrigerator, each one covered in plastic wrap.That was my utterly American concept of pudding: a sweet, custardy substance, eaten with a spoon. Somehow rice pudding or tapioca pudding were never part of my mother\u2019s repertory.In England, however, the word \u201cpudding\u201d simply means dessert \u2014 any sort of dessert. \u201cWhat\u2019s for pudding?\u201d is a classic refrain.And what a marvelous assortment of puddings there are: rhubarb tarts; gooseberry fools; luscious concoctions of berries, meringue and whipped cream; and all manner of trifles. Some puddings are layer cakes. Others are dense and fruitcake-like, filled with dried candied fruits and spices. There are steamed puddings, too, like the famous Christmas pudding, cooked over steam rather than baked in the oven, and served warm with a jug of pouring cream or boozy hard sauce.Just to confuse things, British pudding may also be savory, like Yorkshire pudding, the puffy batter cake that often accompanies roast beef, baked in the roasting pan with some of the beef drippings. And there\u2019s black pudding (blood sausage) or pease pudding, made from dried split peas.Some puddings can go either way, such as bread-and-butter pudding. (We call it bread pudding here.)Sweet bread-and-butter pudding, an old-fashioned frugal dessert, is made from stale bread, combined with a mixture of milk, eggs and sugar, then baked until set. Though far from posh, it\u2019s a good way to use up bread that would otherwise be wasted. An added handful of raisins or dried apricots takes it up a notch.The fact is, however, that bread-and-butter pudding, given a salt-and-pepper spin, makes a fine savory lunch or light supper, one that I prefer to the dessert version.I like to use day-old tender buttery brioche; day-old challah works well, too. I don\u2019t remove the crusts, but simply cut the bread into one-inch chunks. Some grated Gouda or Gruy\u00e8re cheese and strips of ham are layered with the bread in a buttered baking dish. The \u201ccustard\u201d in this case has no sugar, just a dash of black pepper and a pinch of cayenne, along with half-and-half and a few eggs.It couldn\u2019t be easier to make.The result is really rather like a quiche, and though a bit rustic, has a similar delicacy. It smells heavenly and looks gorgeous as it emerges from the oven. Everyone loves it \u2014 even those who expect a pudding to be sweet.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexa? Please Ignore My Husband", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveMarriage is long. Sometimes spouses stop listening to each other. Enter the virtual assistant.My husband and I were in Wabash, Ind., visiting my mother-in-law\u2019s hometown, when we had an argument. It was our second day there, and I\u2019d like to attribute the fight to the stress of travel, but Bruce and I can argue in a box, with a fox, on a stair or anywhere.The fight, as usual, was about how he doesn\u2019t listen to me. I don\u2019t remember the specifics, but what typically happens is he\u2019ll ask me about something I just told him minutes earlier, revealing that he wasn\u2019t listening. Or he\u2019ll start talking about a completely different topic while I\u2019m still speaking. Or I\u2019ll ask him a question \u2014 \u201cDo you want dessert?\u201d or \u201cAre the Knicks playing tonight?\u201d \u2014 and he won\u2019t answer.At least once a day, I find myself saying, \u201cI just told you that.\u201dIf it happened occasionally, O.K., but this is chronic. The passage of time tends to dissolve the discord like running warm water over a bucket of dried plaster, but sometimes the conflict feels insurmountable and I start to think I can\u2019t possibly spend the rest of my life with someone who doesn\u2019t hear me.That\u2019s how I felt that morning when I said, \u201cWell, I want to make this clear, for the record. I hate that you don\u2019t listen to me. It\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not fair, and if I one day leave you because of it, don\u2019t say I never warned you.\u201dAs soon as I said it, I knew I shouldn\u2019t have. My saving grace? He probably didn\u2019t hear me.My husband and I have argued for so long it has become part of the fabric of our relationship, like a bunion \u2014 though our squabbles don\u2019t stop us from having a relatively normal relationship. People can walk on bunions for years. We have family dinners, weekly dates, watch TV together, exchange Christmas gifts. In fact, this past Christmas he bought me Alexa, which I have just started using.\u201cAlexa, play holiday jazz music,\u201d I\u2019ll say. And she does.\u201cAlexa, what is the temperature outside?\u201d And she\u2019ll tell me.After a few days, I realized that Alexa hears everything I say and responds each time \u2014 something I have failed to get from my husband over the last 20 years.\u201cAsk her anything,\u201d my husband said. \u201cLike this. Alexa, what\u2019s 14,300 divided by 25?\u201dAlexa said nothing.So I said, \u201cAlexa, what\u2019s 14,300 divided by 25?\u201d\u201c14,300 divided by 25 is 572,\u201d she said.I looked at my husband. \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t say it very nicely.\u201dAlexa not only listened to me, but she provided an added bonus: She didn\u2019t seem to listen to my husband. He got to feel how I have felt for most of our relationship.Even the cashier at the diner sympathized. \u201cI tell my husband a thousand times to do something, and he doesn\u2019t hear me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I bother. I wind up doing it myself.\u201dThat evening I was sitting in the living room listening to the jazz holiday music Alexa had put on for me, when I said, \u201cAlexa?\u201dThe music stopped. I paused. \u201cJust wanted to see if you were listening,\u201d I said.The light on the top of the machine turned bluish green and the speaker made a clunky sound, as if to say, \u201cIndeed.\u201dThe other day, as I sat in the dining room working, I could hear my husband in the kitchen sniffing as he made my son\u2019s lunch.\u201cSounds like you\u2019re getting sick,\u201d I said.\u201cI can\u2019t hear you,\u201d he said, his voice trailing off as he moved to the far side of the kitchen.One might think there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You can\u2019t fault someone for being too far away. But what\u2019s revealing to me is the matter-of-fact way he says it, the way he shows no curiosity to find out what I said. If real life had subtitles, his line from that exchange would read: \u201cI can\u2019t hear you, and I\u2019m absolutely fine with that.\u201dMy husband\u2019s inability to hear me takes all forms. The other day I wanted to tell him I would not be going to my son\u2019s soccer practice as I had said I would, and I tried calling him, texting him and leaving him a voice mail message, to no avail.At times like that, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s a fortress and no mode of communication \u2014 not swimming the moat, flying overhead, dropping a note nor sending a fiery missive over the fortress wall \u2014 will reach him.Sometimes when Bruce doesn\u2019t hear me these days, I look over at Alexa to see if her blue and green light will go on, an indication that she is listening \u2014 though in situations like that morning, I don\u2019t want her to be. I\u2019m embarrassed by my anger.A few months ago, Bruce and I went out to breakfast and began talking about where to take our six-year-old son for spring break.\u201cHow about Disney?\u201d I said.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the right week for it,\u201d he said, and then he picked up his phone and began reading a text.\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe we should go in September.\u201dHe continued to read his phone as I spoke.\u201cOr maybe we should bring a dead dog to Disney,\u201d I said, to see if he was listening. Some people can multitask. My husband is not among them. He didn\u2019t even look up.\u201cAnd if the dog isn\u2019t dead, you can always kill one so you have a dead dog to bring. To Disney.\u201dNothing.Finally, without looking up, he said, \u201cMy father\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d\u201cOh my god,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cMy sister says he may have had a stroke.\u201dI felt like a self-centered heel. But that\u2019s the thing about relationships. When your partner does something chronically, like being a bad listener, we always think they are doing that annoying thing even when they\u2019re not. We\u2019re not seeing them. We\u2019re seeing who we think they are \u2014 which means that in those moments we\u2019re just seeing an extension of ourselves.When I was in analysis, I would sometimes say something to my therapist, ponder it, and then say, \u201cI think you think I\u2019m stupid\u201d \u2014 when in fact she had said nothing. If she were my husband, I would probably say, \u201cI think you think I\u2019m boring.\u201dIt turns out my father-in-law had suffered a stroke that day \u2014 two, actually, in a short period of time \u2014 but he has almost fully recovered and is as chipper as ever. My husband now calls him nearly every morning on his way to work, and if the conversations go as they always have, my father-in-law will listen intently for a couple of minutes and then move on to another topic, despite my husband being midsentence.While this pattern should have made my husband more empathetic to my plight \u2014 what Bruce\u2019s father does to him, he does to me \u2014 it has had the opposite effect, confirming for him that everyone gets interrupted, no one gets to be heard all the time \u2014 except bratty women who demand it.Which brings me back to Alexa. She listens better than any partner I have ever had, but that\u2019s not hard, because I thought all of them were poor listeners \u2014 especially the one who was hearing-impaired. He didn\u2019t hear a thing I said.It made me wonder: Do I seek out partners who don\u2019t hear me so I can keep having to deal with my problematic territory in order to fix it, like one might practice a skateboard jump over and over again until he masters it? Or were all my partners perfect, more or less, but because of my wound, I wind up not feeling heard? That is, I could be with the best listener on earth and I would still feel unheard.I decided to ask my electronic friend.\u201cAlexa? Do we look for partners who do that thing we hate so we can try to fix it, or do we \u2014 \u201dShe interrupted me midsentence and said, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know that one.\u201dSorry, I don\u2019t know that one? As if I were asking her to identify a song? If she had let me get my whole thought out, she may have understood what I was talking about.I knew it was too good to last.Advertisement"}

But he agreed to plead guilty \u2014 he was young and afraid, and his court-appointed lawyer told him it was the only sure way to avoid prison.For Mr. Sadler, the only way to regain the right to vote was a pardon from the governor of Pennsylvania. So he did what anyone with limitless energy and a very good pair of shoes would do: He hand-delivered a clemency petition, walking from Orlando to the governor\u2019s office in Harrisburg. Over 32 days in the dead of summer, he walked 1,178 miles, dawn to dusk daily, sleeping on benches and subsisting on whatever food he could afford along the route. He grew a beard and lost 25 pounds. \u201cThat walk was like my pilgrimage to manhood,\u201d Mr. Sadler said. \u201cI looked like Forrest Gump.\u201dWhen Mr. Sadler tried again for a pardon, Mr. Gray gave him some advice: \u201cDon\u2019t make any noise this time. Don\u2019t walk; don\u2019t do anything.\u201d Instead, Mr. Gray said, lie low. In 2011, it worked. \u201cI say it\u2019s my rebirth,\u201d Mr. Sadler said. \u201cIt took me 16 years, but I got it.\u201dThat\u2019s not a political platform, exactly, but it speaks to Mr. Sadler\u2019s basic message, which is, he said, \u201cto restore hope and self-worth through faith.\u201d His hope, in the immediate future at least, is to energize the tens of thousands of eligible voters in the 25th District who don\u2019t usually turn out \u2014 many of whom may be able to vote for the first time since having a criminal record, thanks in part to his efforts. (He\u2019s not giving up the stunts, though: he said his campaign plans to carry a sofa to cities around the district and invite voters to sit down and talk.)Jerome Gray, the political organizer, has no illusions about the challenge Mr. Sadler faces, but he declined to count him out.\u201cHe came to Alabama with no car, and now he has a transportation service,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cHe owns his own home. He has a fleet of cars. That guy, I don\u2019t write him off, because he won\u2019t go away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meghan Markle and How the British Monarchy Became a Matriarchy", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Castor is a historian.LONDON \u2014 The role of royal wives has changed remarkably little since the Middle Ages.Anyone who has observed Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, for the seven years of her marriage to Prince William, or has witnessed the scrutiny applied to Meghan Markle in the weeks leading up to her wedding on Saturday to Prince Harry, can recognize the job description. The women of the royal House of Windsor are expected not only to provide an \u201cheir and a spare\u201d but to show unimpeachable morals and irreproachable behavior, to be decorative as well as decorous, and to do good works, putting their altruism on public display. What has changed is the level of attention that they get for taking up these duties.There is a sense in which we live in an age of the monarchy as matriarchy. Medieval royal women knew that, on the royal stage, they were the supporting players. They may have been required to conduct themselves impeccably, but their husbands and sons \u2014 kings and princes \u2014 would be the ones in the spotlight.Now, however, it\u2019s women who are the stars, and not just because the present sovereign happens to be female. For the past few decades, royal women have captured the public\u2019s imagination and affections. It was Harry and William\u2019s mother, Diana, who gave the royal brand a cover-girl-glamorous face and an emotional warmth, making headlines and winning hearts across the world \u2014 even if the unhappiness of her marriage also rocked the royal boat almost to the point of capsize.The Duchess of Cambridge has helped to steady the ship: she\u2019s as photogenic as her mother-in-law was, but appears genuinely content in both her marriage and her public role. And Ms. Markle \u2014 also strikingly beautiful and who, as a divorced, biracial woman with a successful career as an actor, would have been a controversial choice of bride for a British prince until shamefully recently \u2014 promises to bring a breath of 21st-century air into the deeply conservative royal establishment. By comparison, the men of the family \u2014 even the approachable Harry and William \u2014 can seem a little dull; they are consorts to the main attraction, rather than standing center stage themselves.What are we to make of this shift in the prominence of royal women when the fundamentals of their roles \u2014 to be decorative, nurturing and virtuous \u2014 have remained consistent? In Western culture, female forms have always embodied abstract ideals, from Liberty to Justice to Victory \u2014 not, as the cultural historian Marina Warner points out, because women have been free, or sat as judges, or won battles, but precisely because they haven\u2019t. We therefore instinctively understand female figureheads \u2014 whether mounted on ships or as the embodiment of the ship of state \u2014 as static and symbolic, rather than active and individual.His sons William and Harry have both occupied themselves with military service (as Charles did before them), but what they might do next \u2014 beyond, in William\u2019s case, wait for a job that can be his only once his grandmother and father die \u2014 is far from clear. As the line of succession stands, Britain\u2019s next three monarchs will all be male, since William\u2019s eldest child is a boy; but it remains to be seen how easily a king, rather than a queen, might embody the symbolic functions of the 21st-century crown.If the monarchy has transformed into a female-dominated institution as it has lost its grip on government, power in Britain \u2014 as in the rest of the world \u2014 remains predominantly male.In the 16th century, Elizabeth I wore the English crown for 45 years, but her message was not that a woman could exercise power just like a man: \"I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman,\u201d she told her subjects, \u201cbut I have the heart and stomach of a king\u201d \u2014 and thus she was special, a gloriously unique female exception to the rule of male sovereignty.We\u2019ve since made our peace with increasingly disempowered crowns resting on female heads: between them, Queens Victoria and Elizabeth II have sat on the British throne for 130 of the last 200 years. But, despite the embattled presence of Prime Minister Theresa May, a quick head count in the Houses of Parliament or the boardrooms of major corporations shows the problems we still have with the reality of women with actual power.Our newest royal bride, meanwhile, has already shut down her blog and deleted her Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts. From now on, even as her image becomes increasingly ubiquitous, her voice will be heard less and less. Like Blanche of Lancaster before her, Meghan Markle appears to know exactly what she\u2019s letting herself in for, and all the indications are that she will do her job in the royal \u201cFirm\u201d with style and grace. We can wish her well and at the same time question the job description: the recent prominence of royal women might make for splendid pageantry, but when it comes to the story of gender and power, it\u2019s the antithesis of real change.Helen Castor is the author of \u201cShe-Wolves: The Women Who Ruled England Before Elizabeth,\u201d and \u201cElizabeth I: A Study in Insecurity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No customers were negatively impacted, no data left the company, and no products or services were sold as a result.\u201dBut a bank doesn\u2019t have to harm customers to get into trouble with its regulators. Much of what regulators do is aimed at ensuring banks have systems in place to make sure they are complying with regulations. As scandals have hit Wells Fargo over the past two years, regulators have been pressing the bank to tighten up its controls. But the missteps reported by the Journal occurred as recently as the early part of this year, suggesting Wells Fargo is still struggling to improve its compliance and its workplace culture.It is not clear how widespread the purported abuses are. But the documentation was reportedly related to controls aimed at spotting money-laundering, an area of compliance where regulators tend to hold a hard line. If the documentation missteps in the business bank are significant, regulators could be ready to take tough action. In its enforcement action, the O.C.C. stated that it:\u201c\u2026expressly reserves its right to assess future civil money penalties, or take other supervisory and/or enforcement actions, including in circumstances where the O.C.C. determines that the bank is not making sufficient and sustainable progress towards implementation of an effective and sustainable enterprise-wide compliance risk management program.\u201dIf more problems crop up at Wells Fargo, the public will be more likely to believe that the bank is too big to manage \u2014 and that regulators are not up to the task of reining it in.- Peter EavisChina\u2019s banks continue to dwarf those in the West.The only change from last year among the 10 largest banks came at the No. 10 spot, where France\u2019s Credit Agricole leapfrogged Wells Fargo. Here\u2019s a look at the top 25.Chancellor Andre Bouchard of Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery rescinded a temporary restraining order against Shari Redstone\u2019s National Amusements, handing her a victory in an unusually vicious battle between the broadcaster and its controlling shareholder.In his ruling, Chancellor Bouchard said that it wasn\u2019t necessary for the court to grant the restraining order \u2014 one CBS argued was necessary to prevent Ms. Redstone from replacing directors, to the harm of other shareholders \u2014 because Delaware law allows the company to challenge such board removals.From the ruling:I am not convinced that the harm plaintiffs fear would be irreparable. To the contrary, the court has extensive power to provide redress if Ms. Redstone takes action(s) inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations owed by a controlling stockholder\u2014 Michael de la MercedShares of CBS declined 6 percent after CBS\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order against Ms. Redstone was denied. The stock was recently down 4 percent.What could happen when Chancellor Bouchard rules, as soon as today:\u2022 He blocks Ms. Redstone\u2019s bylaw amendment; CBS\u2019s board proceeds to neuter its controlling shareholder; a big new precedent is set.\u2022 He lets Ms. Redstone\u2019s bylaw change stay; CBS\u2019s insurrection is defeated; and the fate of its board and its C.E.O., Les Moonves, becomes cloudy. (Ms. Redstone has said she doesn\u2019t want to oust the board.)\u2022 Something else we haven\u2019t thought of. Stay tuned.Should CBS ultimately prevail in what would be a highly unusual attempt to dilute a controlling shareholder, a bevy of dual-class companies will no doubt be scrambling to rewrite their bylaws. The conflict is magnified in this instance because Ms. Redstone is the controlling shareholder in both parties to the proposed merger.Charles Kushner, head of the Kushner Companies, is in advanced talks with Brookfield Properties over a partnership to take control of the 41-story aluminum-clad tower 666 Fifth Avenue in Midtown, according to two real estate executives who have been briefed on the pending deal but are not authorized to discuss it. Brookfield is a publicly traded company, headquartered in Canada, one of whose major investors is the Qatar Investment Authority.Mr. Kushner and his son Jared, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and one of his key advisers, bought the office tower, which is between 51st and 52nd Streets, 11 years ago for a record-setting $1.8 billion. But the building today only generates about half its annual mortgage payment, and 30 percent of the 41-story tower is vacant.In late 2016, Mr. Kushner and his son were close to a much different kind of deal with Anbang, a giant Chinese insurance company with ties to the country\u2019s ruling elite, and with a billionaire from Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani. That plan involved demolishing the existing building at 666 Fifth and erecting a $7.5 billion luxury super tower.\u2014 Charles V.

The information added varied from social security numbers to addresses to dates of birth for people associated with business-banking clients, the people said.\u201d\u201cThe behavior took place in 2017 and early 2018 as Wells Fargo was trying to meet a deadline to comply with a regulatory consent order related to the bank\u2019s anti-money-laundering controls, the people said.\u201dFor investors, there was perhaps no number in Walmart\u2019s earnings report that mattered as much as the giant retailer\u2019s e-commerce sales, or more specifically the growth of those sales.Walmart said this morning that its digital sales grew 33 percent in its fiscal first quarter and that it expects online sales to grow 40 percent for the year.But the transformation has had its bumps. After three quarters of more than 50 percent growth, e-commerce sales increased just 23 percent in the fourth quarter. Jet was supposed to be Walmart\u2019s answer to Amazon, but analysts said Jet\u2019s growth had slowed in the fourth quarter.

Her swing was quick as a bee\u2019s wing, sending the ball skyward as a gaggle of kids \u2014 mostly Filipino, some white \u2014 cheered and elbowed to bat next.The game, played on a recent afternoon, was a typical mixed gathering for Pyramid Hill, a one-pub town of around 500 people in central Victoria that has become a model of rural revival and multicultural integration.\u201cI\u2019m still surprised they\u2019re as open to us as they are,\u201d said Abigail Umali, 39, a veterinarian from Manila who works at a local pig farm, and whose daughter, Maria, was the girl at bat.\u201cThis school wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for them,\u201d said Kelvin Matthews, 36, the bowler, as he watched the children interact.It\u2019s called small-town living.\u201cPeople in the country mix, and need to mix,\u201d said Tom Smith, a pig farmer who inadvertently started the town\u2019s revival in 2008 when he sponsored visas for four workers from the Philippines. \u201cIt\u2019s just different out here; it\u2019s the only way to survive.\u201dRural collapse is a familiar tale, seen across the American Midwest and in many areas of Europe, where small communities have been squeezed by globalization. It\u2019s no different in Australia: an urbanizing country, as physically large as the United States, where towns of a few hundred people are fading like puddles in the sun.But the success of Pyramid Hill \u2014 and many other small Australian towns \u2014 suggests that there are opportunities being missed and lessons to be learned. At a time when politicians in Australia, and around the world, are calling for restrictions on immigration, small towns in Australia are asking for more immigrants.\u201cThere\u2019s a real network of people who know how to make this work, who make it work in their community and can share it with others,\u201d said Jack Archer, the chief executive of the Regional Australia Institute, a government research organization. \u201cThis is something we should really be thinking about scaling up.\u201dPyramid Hill is a quiet drive of about 240 kilometers, or 150 miles, from Melbourne, finishing with a stretch of land that is mostly empty except for golden wheat fields and lint-gray sheep.The community took its name in 1836 from a granite outcrop on the town\u2019s edge. From its peak, I had little trouble seeing newer landmarks, which rose above the countryside and hinted at local despair: grain silos that are no longer used; a pet food factory that shut down in 2008.Residents still talk about the era before the Filipinos came as one of quiet desperation. Streets without children. Homes decaying. The town\u2019s population bottomed out at 419 in 2011, down from 699 in the 1960s.\u201cWe were in dire straits,\u201d said Cheryl McKinnon, the mayor of Loddon Shire, the municipality that includes Pyramid Hill. \u201cWe needed our population to grow.\u201dEconomists often discuss immigration in terms of a multiplier effect. Newcomers don\u2019t just fill jobs, they also create them, by bringing demand for new products and services.This is especially true in Australia, where the minimum wage is 18.29 Australian dollars an hour ($13.70) and most migrants are skilled workers or students.Places like Pyramid Hill offer an alternative.\u201cThere just has got to be some employment opportunity,\u201d said Mr. Archer of the Regional Australia Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s more of that than people think.\u201dStatistics from the institute suggest that many rural communities suffer not from a lack of employment, but a lack of employees.Labor market participation in regional Australia \u2014 the areas outside major cities \u2014 is well above the national average. And since rural populations tend to be older, that means many people continue to work well after they might have wanted to retire.Mr. Smith, the pig farmer, rejected that pattern. He flew to Manila in 2008 to interview job applicants for his Kia-Ora piggery after placing a help wanted ad in a local newspaper.Two of his four original hires still work at Kia-Ora. Mr. Smith, 66, a taciturn farmer who warms up to strangers at the pace of an autumn morning, has retired from managing the piggery.To understand the town\u2019s revival, he told me, I would have to visit.One morning before 7 a.m., I found myself donning a paper jumpsuit and tall rubber boots for a day of pork production with Kia-Ora\u2019s mostly Filipino work force.We started in the breeding area, a series of long metal warehouses filled with tiny newborn piglets and pregnant sows big enough to knock a small car off the road.Gail Smith, the mating supervisor, was guiding Raymond Mabulac, one of the Filipino workers, on the latest methods of artificial insemination.\u201cWhen you\u2019re done, you need to hop in the pen and record them,\u201d she said.\u201cEasy,\u201d Mr. Mabulac said. \u201cNo worries.\u201dThat breezy rapport took time. It wasn\u2019t that Mr. Mabulac didn\u2019t speak English; he did. It was just sayings like \u201crightee-o\u201d that took him awhile to work out. \u201cAt first,\u201d Ms. Smith said, laughing, \u201cI don\u2019t think he had any idea what I was saying.\u201dKia-Ora adjusted and expanded slowly, bringing in new employees (and their families) over several years. Many of the new hires were old friends of the early ones, or attended the same university in the Philippines, studying veterinary medicine or animal husbandry.Some were already in Australia, like Ms. Umali, the vet, who moved to Pyramid Hill four years ago from Sydney with her husband and two children.\u201cIt was a big change,\u201d she said.Despite the hard work, there has been little turnover among the employees.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how warm the people are here,\u201d Ms. Umali said. Her voice seemed to crack with emotion. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned to adapt.\u201dResearch from the Regional Australia Institute shows that the areas reviving most quickly tend to offer new arrivals not just well-paying jobs but a sense of community.In the Shire of Dalwallinu, a town in Western Australia\u2019s Wheat Belt that is coming back to life thanks to migrants from the Philippines and elsewhere, residents helped workers move their families from abroad.In the small town of Nhill, in northwestern Victoria, locals have managed the arrival of ethnic Karen refugees from Myanmar since 2010, helping them find housing, learn English and engage in social activities.Pyramid Hill\u2019s evolution has been just as personal. Neighbors regularly meet to share food and learn about each other\u2019s cultures.\u201cEvery month there\u2019s one Australian speaker and a Filipino speaker, and we cook for each other,\u201d said Helen Garchitorena, 47, a leader of the exchange. \u201cWe explain the importance of the food, and we talk.\u201dCompared with those in many cities and suburbs, people in Pyramid Hill seem to have more time and interest in building bonds across ethnic boundaries. An annual Filipino \u201cfiesta\u201d was added to the town\u2019s events calendar in 2015, and every week seems to include an opportunity to socialize.A short walk away from the cricket match at St. Patrick\u2019s, for example, teenagers gathered for a trivia night at Pyramid Hill College, the public school where Ms. Garchitorena now works.The town has welcomed the Filipinos in part because families bring energy. But it also helps that, like the locals, many are Catholic, and they arrived in Australia already speaking some English.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to mesh together,\u201d said Ms. Garchitorena\u2019s daughter, Fionne, 15. \u201cI think it mostly works.\u201dStill, she said, there are growing pains. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I have rice for lunch and they\u2019ll say \u2018You\u2019re so Asian\u2019 \u2014 and I\u2019m like, well, yes, I\u2019m very aware of that.\u2019\u201dDuke Caburnay, 16, whose father works at Kia-Ora, said that he runs up against racism when his team plays Australian rules football in other small towns. White players sometimes hurl racial insults at him.Some of Pyramid Hill\u2019s adult Filipino residents also say they are expected to outperform white counterparts just to be considered equal.\u201cThey generalize a lot \u2014 Asians are like this, Australians are like that,\u201d said Fritzie Caburnay, 46, Duke\u2019s mother, who has a master\u2019s degree in public administration. \u201cSome people say the Filipinos have invaded.\u201dStill, she said, \u201cwe feel at home here.\u201dIt\u2019s a sentiment widely shared.Ms. Umali eventually explained why she has grown so loyal to the town. Last year, she said, her husband was at Kia-Ora working his usual shift when he collapsed in one of the pig pens.He died suddenly of a heart attack. He was 44.An outpouring of support followed for her and her two children, Raphael, 12, and Maria, 10, the cricket batter. Every day, friends and even total strangers would appear at the wood-frame home she rents beside St. Patrick\u2019s, smiling, carrying meals and money, or just offering emotional support.The principal of St. Patrick\u2019s, Colleen Hampson, had to fight back tears when discussing the tragedy and the community\u2019s response. So did Ms. Umali.\u201cWhat happened to me here, I can\u2019t even compare it to what would have happened in the Philippines,\u201d she said, looking away to gain composure. \u201cIt\u2019s actually overwhelming.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron Vowed to Make France a \u2018Start-Up Nation.\u2019 Is It Getting There?", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet a year after Mr. Macron unveiled an aggressive agenda to turn France into \u201ca start-up nation,\u201d it is unclear if reality has kept pace with his rhetoric. While the country has quickly become one of the most talked-about destinations in Europe for tech companies and start-ups, France still faces an uphill path in its bid to usurp London as the region\u2019s technology leader.The French president has carefully cultivated a tech-savvy image, promoted a steady drumbeat of high-profile events, and even pushed through a raft of economic and labor reforms to make his country more appealing to investors. But France continues to lag Britain in tech-related investments and in the business of artificial intelligence. Start-ups still face challenges in scaling up. And a lot of seed funding comes from the French government itself.Companies have been pledging to do more in France. In January, for example, the chief executives of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies announced 3.5 billion euros, or $4.1 billion, in new investments and the creation of at least 2,200 jobs in the next five years.Those figures are minuscule compared with investment in Silicon Valley, and even London. Mr. Macron nevertheless sought to build on France\u2019s momentum on Wednesday, when he convened 60 tech chief executives for meetings in Paris. The French president met individually with the Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and with the leaders of IBM, Microsoft and Uber later Wednesday at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.Facebook has faced a barrage of public criticism over its handling of user data and vast powers, points Mr. Macron intends to press further on Wednesday. The president\u2019s office also said that Mr. Macron would have frank discussions with the various chief executives over the taxation of tech companies and fighting the proliferation of rumors and misinformation spreading online. The meetings come as French lawmakers are expected to debate additional transparency measures for social media companies like Facebook.But Mr. Macron president is also expected to seize the moment to announce more tech-related investments in France.\u201cClearly there has been a Macron effect,\u201d said Franck Sebag, a Paris-based partner at the professional services firm Ernst & Young, who has studied France\u2019s digital trajectory.\u201cFew people were even talking about France as a tech country a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Sebag said. \u201cHe\u2019s ignited a willingness to invest.\u201dAs President Trump pursues an increasingly protectionist agenda for the United States, and Britain veers away from the European Union, Mr. Macron has promoted a policy of open borders and being business-friendly in a country that has long had a reputation for being anything but. Multinationals are venturing to create more jobs in France as Mr. Macron overhauls French labor laws, despite protests by French workers.\u201cThe U.K. is no longer the undisputed capital of European venture capital,\u201d Dealroom said in a recent report. \u201cContinental Europe is catching up, while France is almost on par already.\u201dFor all the hype, France must confront a number of longstanding hurdles.The trend here is shifting, though.Big businesses are increasingly tallying the advantages, especially since Mr. Macron convened 140 chief executives of global companies at an ornate gathering at the Palace of Versailles in January. He told them that he was pursuing a strategy to make France more productive and competitive, and announced more than \u20ac3.5 billion in foreign investments, including a large chunk for tech.Fujitsu of Japan is one of several Asia-based companies that plan to invest in expanded artificial intelligence research here. After the gathering in Versailles, the Fujitsu president, Tatsuya Tanaka, was named a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur by the French government, one of France\u2019s highest honors.\u201cThe new image of France,\u201d the company said in a statement, \u201cis attracting foreign investors again.\u201dElian Peltier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Reliever Gets a Game\u2019s First Three Outs, and Then Some Backlash", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExtra BasesAfter Sergio Romo was asked to set up the Rays\u2019 two starters last weekend instead of setting up their closer, at least one opponent said it was bad for baseball.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of how I\u2019ve done everything,\u201d said Romo, the veteran pitcher for the Tampa Bay Rays. \u201cNot necessarily carefree, because I definitely care. I\u2019m not reckless. But I\u2019ve had to let go of certain things in my life, and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get out of certain spots without living free.\u201dSo when Rays Manager Kevin Cash asked him on a recent road trip if he\u2019d like to start a game \u2014 after nearly 600 games in relief \u2014 Romo readily embraced the unconventional. He had always wanted to start, just to see how far he could go. Maybe he could last six innings, he mused, and possibly qualify for a quality start.That was never the plan. The Rays, without many experienced starters, have used other relievers to start games this season, working two or three innings to begin a bullpen relay. But for Romo, whose sweeping slider gives him a distinct edge against right-handed hitters, they offered a fresh twist on his usual job.\u201cI got asked to set up the starter instead of the closer,\u201d Romo said. \u201cIn my head, I did exactly the same thing that I normally do. I get asked to pitch against predominantly righties in situations that my manager feels are high leverage. And by the stats, the toughest inning is the first.\u201dHe is right about that: Through Wednesday, major league teams had scored 816 runs in the first inning, the most for any inning. The sixth inning \u2014 when tiring starters often face hitters for a third time \u2014 produced the second-most runs, with 780.\u201cIf anything, it\u2019s just respect,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to fall behind to a team that\u2019s known to score runs in the first inning. They\u2019re studs. I\u2019m not trying to ruin anything. I\u2019m not trying to change anything. All I\u2019m trying to do is what\u2019s asked of me by my team. I don\u2019t understand the negativity it\u2019s gotten. We\u2019re not here to make things easy on anybody.\u201dChaim Bloom, the Rays\u2019 senior vice president for baseball operations, said the idea was not motivated by finances \u2014 only logic. The plan gave the Rays a better chance to win, he said, and Romo was the right fit to execute it.\u201cHe was a good guy for those matchups, but with his personality and experience, we had a feeling this was something he was not just going to tolerate, but embrace \u2014 and when Kevin presented him with the opportunity, that\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cHe was really excited about it, and that\u2019s important. You can think that you\u2019re putting your players in a good spot to succeed all you want, but if they don\u2019t think that, then it\u2019s got to mitigate some of that effect.\u201dThe Rays, who lost starter Jake Faria to an oblique injury on Tuesday, gave Romo another start on Friday, against Baltimore. He struck out Jonathan Schoop with two outs, but the third strike was a wild pitch and Schoop reached first base to extend the inning. The next batter, Danny Valencia, doubled in a run to chase Romo from the game.The Rays went on to lose, 2-0, but chances are Romo will continue to serve happily when called.\u201cObviously, I have no shame in being the guinea pig,\u201d Romo said. \u201cIt\u2019s outside the box, and that\u2019s kind of fitting with me, because there isn\u2019t much in my life that I\u2019ve done inside the box.\u201dLast year on May 14, Arizona Diamondbacks center fielder A.J. Pollock left a game with a strained right groin and missed seven weeks. The Diamondbacks had withered without Pollock when he missed most of 2016 with an elbow injury, but they thrived in his absence last season, going 31-13 on the way to the playoffs.When the Diamondbacks arrived at Citi Field last weekend, they reinserted third baseman Jake Lamb \u2014 an All-Star last season \u2014 into their lineup after a shoulder injury. But Manager Torey Lovullo seemed to sense that Pollock\u2019s absence would still hurt. He could miss eight weeks.\u201cThere\u2019s lineup continuity that we\u2019ve missed because Jake has been out, but now we\u2019re still weeks away from A.J. returning,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cWhen you put the whole group together, hopefully we\u2019re going to be clicking on all cylinders by then and we can just add A.J. and we become a really good offensive team.\u201dAlas, the Diamondbacks scored just 10 runs in their six losses to the Mets and the Brewers, and Paul Goldschmidt, their five-time All-Star first baseman, entered the weekend with a .200 average and a National League-high 65 strikeouts.\u201cHe had a lot of moving parts that were kind of charging at the pitcher rather than slowly moving back and getting in the hitting position, and he probably started to get frustrated and anxious and started to swing at pitches out of the zone,\u201d Lovullo explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole cycle. By his standards, he\u2019s not swinging the bat well. The numbers indicate that, but I feel like he\u2019s 10 days away from having it back where he\u2019s going to start crushing it. I think he\u2019s getting close.\u201dGoldschmidt did homer once in New York and again in Milwaukee, but otherwise was 1 for 19 with 10 strikeouts in those series.The numbers were striking: In 2016 and 2017, Chatwood had a 6.07 earned run average and a .303 opponents\u2019 average in the thin air of Denver. Everywhere else, he had a 2.57 E.R.A. and a .195 opponents\u2019 average.So far, it seems, the Cubs should have paid more attention to a different statistic: walks. Of the 72 pitchers to make at least 50 starts in the 2016 and 2017 seasons, Chatwood averaged the most walks per nine innings, with 4.33. After his first nine starts this season, he was leading the majors in walks, with 40, and has averaged 7.88 walks per nine innings.To put that in context, just one pitcher since 1950 has made at least 25 starts in a season while averaging 7.8 walks per nine innings: Bobby Witt, who did it with Texas in 1986 and 1987.\u201cI\u2019m fighting myself,\u201d Chatwood told reporters after Tuesday\u2019s loss, when he walked six in two and two-thirds innings. \u201cI\u2019m trying to force pitches, rather than just letting it happen and trusting my stuff. A little mechanical thing: I\u2019m drifting on the mound. I don\u2019t know where I created that bad habit, but it\u2019s hard to break right now.\u201dThe good news is that Chatwood does have reason to trust his stuff. When he is not allowing walks, he has been very hard to hit, allowing just 6.7 hits per nine innings, the best mark of his seven-year career.As usual, there was one game in the past week that fans could not watch on television or the MLB.com AtBat app: the weekly Facebook-only game, which featured the Los Angeles Angels and the Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday afternoon. The Facebook game has been a source of frustration for some fans \u2014 those without Facebook or those who would rather watch on TV \u2014 but Major League Baseball believes that the exclusivity of the broadcast is the only way to accurately test the idea.\u201cHow are you going to learn whether this platform is viable?\u201d said Tony Petitti, deputy commissioner for business and media. \u201cWe have to think about how we reach our fans, not only in the next year or two years, but how are we going to reach them in the next five to 10 to 15 years? We want these platforms to be tested now, and we have over 2,000 games. We have the luxury of being able to test it in day games. This is a sport that should be able to test a package like this.\u201dThe league carried some games on Facebook last year, too, but Petitti said it gained no useful information from that venture because the games were not exclusive to Facebook. This year\u2019s offerings, produced by the league and featuring local broadcasters, have provided more interaction with fans, who give the questions for in-game manager interviews and comment on the action in real time \u2014 for better or worse.\u201cThere\u2019s lots of venting. There\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Petitti said. \u201cBut at the same time, there\u2019s also lots of real, meaningful engagement. We\u2019re not looking to curtail either of it.\u201dWhile the medium mandates the use of Facebook, Petitti, who said he was \u201csensitive to the disruption,\u201d pointed out one positive.\u201cWe\u2019re not asking customers to write us an additional check to have access,\u201d he said. \u201cI can remember when games went from broadcast to cable and people felt like, \u2018Wait, now I have to go get a cable subscription?\u2019\u201cThings are changing, and we\u2019re moving into this world where these over-the-top packages are becoming another way for people to engage with content. I think we owe it to our fans to see whether we can deliver content to them on these platforms.\u201dChicago White Sox catcher Welington Castillo failed a drug test and earned an 80-game suspension on Thursday. While there is certainly no honor in that, Castillo at least deserves credit for his statement in response. While others \u2014 most recently Seattle\u2019s Robinson Cano \u2014 have given vague excuses for positive tests, Castillo, who tested positive for EPO, simply acknowledged that he got caught.\u201cThe positive test resulted from an extremely poor decision that I, and I alone, made,\u201d his statement said. \u201cI take full responsibility for my conduct. I have let many people down, including my family, my teammates, the White Sox organization and its fans, and from my heart, I apologize.\u201dCastillo hit a career-high 20 home runs for Baltimore last season and then signed a two-year, $15 million contract with the White Sox.Advertisement"}

As frequent diners know from sad experience, it is, in fact, possible to cook in an acclaimed restaurant without picking up any of the qualities that it\u2019s acclaimed for. Even when actual skills have been learned, they are not always obvious. Or, occasionally, they\u2019re all too obvious, and you\u2019ll catch somebody in a two-person kitchen trying to replicate dishes originally assembled by a team of 40.It\u2019s also apparent, when you look around the dining room, that in his earlier jobs Mr. Lim spent most of his time in the kitchen; the lineage you taste in his cooking doesn\u2019t show up in the design. Soogil (SOO-gil) doesn\u2019t evoke a rambunctious Korean pub the way Hanjan does. Nor is it a carpeted and tableclothed luxury liner, like Daniel.Under the guidance of Mr. Lim\u2019s wife, Sasook Youn, the dining room has been done in what we now recognize as the all-purpose Modern Asian style \u2014 a long banquette of blond wood against one wall, a dining counter facing another wall, and a long communal table with benches running down the middle, all of them sitting on a plank floor. A few framed prints by Suzy Taekyung Kim, a New York artist from South Korea, are suspended over the banquettes. French windows on the street can be thrown open if the weather ever cooperates.Hanging in the back is a curtain. Once in a while it parts just wide enough for Mr. Lim\u2019s face to appear while he scans the tables. Sometimes they are full.They should be full all the time, because cooking like this does not just sprout up through every crack in the sidewalk, particularly at prices that, with one or two exceptions, don\u2019t go over $20.The care the kitchen pays to technique is obvious in the seafood dishes; I\u2019ve never had one that wasn\u2019t perfectly cooked. Monkfish, which can come off as a rubber replica of some part of the anatomy I\u2019d rather not think about, gets wrapped in a cabbage or lettuce leaf, gently poached, and sliced into neat little wheels. Arranged over stir-fried vegetables in a sea of fermented chile sauce, it\u2019s terrific, and about as French as Korean cooking should be allowed to get.An almost silky consistency marks the mackerel that Soogil serves, nigiri-style, over wads of rice that have been seasoned with ssamjang (standing in for wasabi?) and wrapped in chard leaves.The tender Manila clams, squid and shrimp in the spicy tofu-seafood stew kept more of their natural juiciness than usual, although very firm shellfish isn\u2019t necessarily a defect in that dish. Mr. Lim herds all the soft tofu into a flan at the bottom of the bowl, rather than letting cubes of it fend for themselves in the broth \u2014 a move that nicely heightens the contrast of tofu and chiles.The least Korean thing on the menu must be the foie gras terrine, and it\u2019s also one of the only disappointments, with its crumbly Melba toasts and washed-out green-plum jelly. A dish called nurungji gras is something else entirely: a fine seared hunk of foie gras laid over spinach and pickled mushrooms on a springy, crunchy sizzled rice cake.Slabs of pork belly are braised until the fat streaks are nearly liquid. Then they\u2019re given a meaningful sear and served alongside a stripe of a sauce I\u2019ve never had before, made with fermented shrimp and green plums and fresh red peppers: spicy, salty, sour and hot.After which you should probably investigate something that goes by the name Jenga Tower. Cigarettes of fried dough, chewy like rice sticks, are stacked like a log cabin, then dusted with sugar and misugaru, the powdered grain and bean blend Koreans use as an instant breakfast drink. You pull out a stick at the time until the tower falls and brings down the scoop of honey-and-chestnut gelato balanced on top.The dining room could take a few lessons in balance from that dessert. The lights could be dimmed by a few clicks. The pop music, while not actively awful, is just odd enough to be subliminally distracting. Soogil can\u2019t seem to find the right tone for service, either. Some nights it\u2019s very familiar and on others, peculiarly fussy \u2014 a server insisted on giving the book I\u2019d brought a chair of its own.These are minor snags, but sorting them out is tricky, especially for first-time restaurateurs. Somewhere in the middle is a relaxed, confident style that will match the spirit of Mr. Lim\u2019s cooking.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Celebrities and Chicken Salad: The Lure of Freds at Barneys", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd yet, there is a case to be made.I was reminded of this on a recent visit for lunch one rainy Monday afternoon. My friend had arrived early and, displaying the healthy sense of self-importance necessary to psychological survival in Manhattan, demanded a table better than the dark one in a corner we were going to be given.Mr. Strausman flunked out of various colleges before rising to prominence in the late 1980s, serving Tuscan food to East Side plutocrats. The Pressman family, which had established Barneys as a men\u2019s wear outlet in downtown Manhattan in the 1920s before eventually turning it into something far more ambitious, brought him in to develop a restaurant similar to those at Harrods or Harvey Nichols in London where, with great novelty at the time, you could have sushi served to you from a conveyor belt.The department store evolved in the early 20th century into a place of leisure, intended to transform the consumer\u2019s understanding of shopping as an experience rooted in pleasure rather than duty. In 1914, Lord & Taylor opened in Manhattan with a manicure parlor for men, a mechanical horse and three places to eat. By the middle of the century, the department store had become a more overtly gendered environment, and the sort of restaurant you would find in it bore few traces of masculine inclination.Freds, which eventually spawned branches downtown, in Chicago and in Beverly Hills, Calif., was in its own way revolutionary because it extended itself to both sexes, to the enterprising and busy, refusing to encode female indolence. \u201cI have always hated the term \u2018ladies who lunch,\u2019\u201d Mr. Strausman told me.Absent were the pastels and aviary themes that distinguished similar ventures. The portions were \u2014 and remain \u2014 quite large to match the appetites, symbolic if not literal, of those who come.On the day I visited most recently, the dining room was busy and full, as it has been every time I have gone over the past decade. My friend and I were flanked by two Argentine tourists. There were tables of businessmen; a table of women in head scarves; a table of women who looked as if they had watched \u201cJersey Shore\u201d and not been frightened.Mr. Strausman no longer presides over the day-to-day operations of the dining room; instead it is Alfredo Escobar who stands in the role of executive chef, having come to this country from Mexico when he was 16 and worked his way up from a job as a line cook. This, in the end, is New York.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Aggro-Texting From the Syrian Jihad", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Asne Seierstad\u2019s 2003 book, \u201cThe Bookseller of Kabul,\u201d sold more than a million copies and landed the author in court. In the book, Seierstad portrays the inner workings of an Afghan family with whom she lived for several months: the patriarch\u2019s acquisition of a second wife, the perils of flirting in a conservative society, the tyrannical behavior of men and the suffering of women. The patriarch \u2014 the bookseller of the title \u2014 claimed that Seierstad misrepresented him as a brute, violated the sanctity of his household and jeopardized his family\u2019s lives. \u201cSurely it is the Afghan culture that puts these young women at risk,\u201d Seierstad said at the time. One of the bookseller\u2019s wives sued Seierstad for invasion of privacy, though she was eventually cleared of the charges. These were the days after Sept. 11, during the American invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. The Islamic world was suddenly something that needed to be penetrated and understood. Two civilizations had clashed, and everyone was confused. But for a long time, only one bore the burden of having to explain itself, and of watching itself be explained.Fifteen years later, the wars begun after 9/11 continue in spectacular and gruesome new forms. The books about them have also changed, at least a little. In her new book, \u201cTwo Sisters: A Father, His Daughters, and Their Journey Into the Syrian Jihad,\u201d Seierstad, the author of several other works, including \u201cOne of Us,\u201d about the 2011 massacre of dozens of Norwegians by a far-right terrorist, again takes on conservative Islamic culture, war zones and fathers. But this time the mystery she\u2019s exploring is the appeal for Muslims of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Seierstad wants to know: Why did thousands of Europeans leave their homes in the West to join ISIS in Syria?As in \u201cBookseller,\u201d the main character in \u201cTwo Sisters\u201d is the patriarch of a large family: Sadiq Juma, who moved his wife and children (eventually he had five) to Norway from Hargeisa, Somaliland, after fighting in the Somali civil war. In Norway he found work in a Coca-Cola warehouse, but when the book opens he is injured and on sick leave, and the family is being supported by NAV, the Norwegian welfare authority. Sadiq has embraced his Norwegian life, whereas his wife, Sara, didn\u2019t want to learn the language. She speaks Somali with her children, and as the years pass she has fretted about them becoming \u201ctoo Norwegian,\u201d particularly their son Ismael. He was more rebellious than her daughters, Ayan and Leila, who \u201casked for permission for everything.\u201dThen, in October 2013, the two girls disappear. A farewell email arrives from an unknown location in Sweden: \u201cMuslims are under attack from all quarters, and we need to do something,\u201d the sisters write. They apologize for hurting their parents but promise to make it up to them in the afterlife. Hours later, another email follows, this time from Adana, Turkey, where the girls are having their last meal in Europe, waiting for someone to bring them to the war zone: They suggest that their family read \u201cDefense of Muslim Lands: The First Obligation After Iman,\u201d by Dr. Abdullah Azzam, who inspired Osama bin Laden to finance the mujahedeen in Afghanistan and is known as the \u201cfather of modern jihadism.\u201dSadiq immediately flies to Turkey to intercept his daughters. He\u2019s too late. At the Syrian border, parents from Kuwait, Qatar and Britain have come looking: \u201cHunched figures. Desperation in their eyes.\u201d A Turkish taxi driver connects Sadiq to a Syrian smuggler, who arranges his trip across the border to the town of Atmeh. Sadiq\u2019s travails in Syria \u2014 including 12 days in a bloody, excrement-filled ISIS prison \u2014 are among the most well-executed scenes in the book. \u201cWhat sort of hell is this?\u201d a Syrian cellmate asks before he is beheaded. Meanwhile, Sadiq\u2019s daughters, who have been taken in by ISIS in a nearby town, send messages to Ismael back in Norway complaining about their father\u2019s pestering of ISIS leaders to release them and bragging about \u201cnot having to lift a finger\u201d for \u201ca house, water, electricity, the lot!!!\u201dAyan and Leila did not respond to Seierstad\u2019s requests to speak to her for this book. As a substitute for firsthand interviews, she quotes the girls\u2019 surreal internet chat-speak. \u201cSo we\u2019re probably never going to see each other again?\u201d Ismael says, deploying a crying emoji. \u201cDon\u2019t ever think that, we always have Skype, haha,\u201d Leila replies. Ismael descends into depression, and the girls become meaner. \u201cSad to see my sisters offering their bodies to retards fighting to get killed, otherwise it\u2019s all good,\u201d Ismael writes. \u201cHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA better to die than to live life like a loser,\u201d Ayan writes back. The sisters figure in the family\u2019s life as disembodied aggro-texters. They speak in the language of the Facebook update, and unsurprisingly it makes everyone else feel awful. \u201cThey had chosen a life without him,\u201d Sadiq thinks. \u201cThey were making pancakes in Raqqa.\u201d Without Ayan and Leila\u2019s testimony, \u201cTwo Sisters\u201d is less a portrait of why two European women joined ISIS than one of those they left behind.Even without the sisters\u2019 voices, the passages in which Seierstad attempts to piece together how the girls were radicalized are absorbing. As the oldest and her father\u2019s favorite, Ayan dominates the account. When she was 13, she and her friends wore Kiss T-shirts and skinny jeans. Her favorite author was Knut Hamsun. Ayan is herself a good writer, with an impressive imagination; in a short story she wrote for school, she conjures the interior life of an American soldier in Vietnam: \u201cWe are on night patrol doing a recon. Those sly gooks could be hiding just about anywhere.\u201d The soldier recalls taking part in massacres in which women and children were coated with oil and set on fire. \u201cHow can the sky be so beautiful when the world is so sickening?\u201d Ayan writes. From an early age, she was a feminist, \u201ctough and self-confident,\u201d and \u201cindignant at the oppression of women, the focus on body image.\u201d She thought Islam sometimes oppressed women, too.Then came three crucial developments: Ayan\u2019s mother hired a Quran teacher for her brood, who held radical views; Ayan discovered an organization called Islam Net, which she joined for the religiosity as much as for the cute boys; and she and her friends met a group of charismatic thugs who longed for jihad abroad. Seierstad portrays Islam Net, inspired by Saudi Salafism, as the crucial catalyst for the girls\u2019 initial radicalization; its leaders demand that Ayan devote more time to its activities, prying her from the grasp of her advanced Norwegian high school. The group preaches peace to non-Muslims they hope to convert, but the first Islam Net gathering in Norway is devoted to a discussion of how the American government and the Jews planned the Sept. 11 attacks.Sept. 11, and the subsequent embrace of \u201cus vs. them\u201d rhetoric by the United States, come up often in \u201cTwo Sisters.\u201d Muslims in Norway feel threatened by the anti-Islamic rhetoric of the war on terror, lumped together into one inherently suspect group. Teenagers \u201cstuffed all their setbacks and growing pains in the same bag: It\u2019s because I\u2019m a Muslim,\u201d Seierstad writes. Then came the war in Syria, an opportunity for self-definition: \u201cWhy be a second-class Norwegian when you can be a first-class Muslim?\u201d Muslims, Ayan and Leila agreed, \u201cneeded some form of defense.\u201dSuzy Hansen\u2019s \u201cNotes on a Foreign Country: An American Abroad in a Post-American World\u201d was a finalist for a 2018 Pulitzer Prize.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ukraine, Seeking U.S. Missiles, Halted Cooperation With Mueller Investigation", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut in Ukraine, where officials are wary of offending President Trump, four meandering cases that involve Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, have been effectively frozen by Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor.The cases are just too sensitive for a government deeply reliant on United States financial and military aid, and keenly aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s distaste for the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into possible collusion between Russia and his campaign, some lawmakers say.The State Department issued an export license for the missiles on Dec. 22, and on March 2 the Pentagon announced final approval for the sale of 210 Javelins and 35 launching units. The order to halt investigations into Mr. Manafort came in early April.Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament who is an ally of President Petro O. Poroshenko, readily acknowledged that the intention in Kiev was to put investigations into Mr. Manafort\u2019s activities \u201cin the long-term box.\u201d\u201cIn every possible way, we will avoid irritating the top American officials,\u201d Mr. Ariev said in an interview. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t spoil relations with the administration.\u201dThe new government established a special prosecutor to pursue corruption in the former administration. By late last year, the prosecutor, Serhiy Horbatyuk, had opened about 3,000 cases, including four related to Mr. Manafort\u2019s consulting for the former president and his political party.The order issued in April isolated these four investigations. The cases were not closed, the prosecutor general\u2019s office said in a statement, but the order blocked Mr. Horbatyuk from issuing subpoenas for evidence or interviewing witnesses.\u201cWe have no authority to continue our investigation,\u201d Mr. Horbatyuk said in an interview.One inquiry dealt with possible money laundering in a single $750,000 payment to Mr. Manafort from a Ukrainian shell company. The payment formed one part of the multimillion dollar transfers to Mr. Manafort from politicians in Ukraine that underpin indictments filed by Mr. Mueller in federal court in Washington and Virginia. Before the case was frozen, prosecutors had subpoenaed records from Ukrainian banks.Another concerned a former chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s foreign relations committee, Vitaly Kalyuzhny, who had signed nine of 22 entries designated for Mr. Manafort in a secret ledger of political payoffs uncovered after the 2014 revolution. The ledger showed payouts totaling $12.5 million for Mr. Manafort.The handwritten accounting document, called in Ukraine the Black Ledger, is an evidential linchpin for investigating corruption in the former government. Mr. Manafort denied receiving under-the-table payments from the party and his spokesman said the ledger might be a forgery.Two months before Ukraine\u2019s government froze the cases, Mr. Horbatyuk reached out to Mr. Mueller\u2019s office with a formal offer to cooperate by sharing evidence and leads. Mr. Horbatyuk said that he sent a letter in January and did not receive a reply, but that the offer was now moot, since he has lost the authority to investigate.In another move seeming to hinder Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, Ukrainian law enforcement allowed a potential witness to possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to leave for Russia, putting him out of reach for questioning.In Kiev, the missile sale was seen as a political victory for Mr. Poroshenko, indicating American backing for his government in the war in eastern Ukraine against Russia-backed separatists and against the threat of a wider Russian intervention in the country. After Ukraine announced on April 30 that it had received the missiles, Mr. Poroshenko posted on Facebook that \u201cthe long-awaited weapon arrived in the Ukrainian Army.\u201dApart from the missiles, the Ukrainian government is propped up with about $600 million in bilateral aid from the United States annually. Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.David Sakvarelidze, a former deputy prosecutor general who is now in the political opposition, said he did not believe that the general prosecutor had coordinated with anybody in the United States on the decision to suspend the investigations in Ukraine, or that there had been a quid pro quo for the missile sale.Ukrainian politicians, he said, concluded on their own that any help prosecuting Mr. Manafort could bring down Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath.\u201cCan you imagine,\u201d Mr. Sakvarelidze said, \u201cthat Trump writes on Twitter, \u2018The United States isn\u2019t going to support any corrupt post-Soviet leaders, including in Ukraine.\u2019 That would be the end of him.\u201dLast summer, another member of Parliament, Andrey L. Derkach, initiated an investigation into leaks to the news media about Mr. Manafort\u2019s dealings from Ukrainian law enforcement, saying they put at risk vital American aid to Ukraine. He has openly opposed any Ukrainian role in aiding the special counsel\u2019s investigation.Ukraine, Mr. Derkach said in an interview, would be taking grave risks if it assisted in what he called a politicized investigation in the United States. In Ukraine, he said, \u201ceverybody is afraid of this case.\u201dIuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, and Mark Mazzetti from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Capital or Labor Winning at Your Favorite Company? Introducing the Marx Ratio", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your InboxWho benefits the most when a company is successful: its shareholders or its employees? Capital or labor?It is a question that speaks to some of the oldest debates in economics. But now, thanks to a minor provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, we have a tool for measuring, in rough terms at least, how much any given publicly traded firm rewards its shareholders relative to its rank-and-file employees.Behold, the Marx Ratio.We named it for the 19th-century economist and philosopher Karl Marx, who argued that the interests of capital and labor are inherently in tension. His intellectual adversaries argued that those interests are in fact aligned, as successful companies inevitably reward both capital and labor.We take no stand in that debate. But we have come up with a simple way of calculating how the fruits of any given company\u2019s success are distributed.The Marx Ratio, as we\u2019re calling it, captures the relationship between a company\u2019s profits \u2014 the return to capital, on a per-employee basis \u2014 and how much its median employee is compensated, a rough proxy for the return to labor.Companies with high Marx Ratios offer particularly strong rewards to their shareholders relative to workers. For example, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer had a Marx Ratio of 2.64, meaning the per-employee earnings captured by shareholders were about 2.6 times as high as the compensation a typical employee received. Numbers below 1 signal the reverse: a more favorable return to labor. The  Marx Ratio of 0.498 for the health insurer Aetna means that it earned only half as much per worker for its shareholders as it paid its median employee.Companies with high Marx Ratios also included the tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris International; consumer products companies like Kraft-Heinz and Colgate-Palmolive; fast food giants McDonald\u2019s and Yum Brands (parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut); and almost all real estate investment trusts.Those that favored workers more tended to be in labor-intensive industries. They included the huge retailers Walmart and Amazon, hotel companies like Marriott and Hilton, and both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.Companies that record a net loss consequently have a negative Marx Ratio. For those companies, which in 2017 included General Electric and Citigroup, shareholders lost money while workers still got paid.Of the 394 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 that had reported their median compensation number by May 3, the median Marx Ratio was 0.82, meaning at a typical company the median pay was higher than the profit generated per worker.Beginning this year, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies in the United States to disclose their median employee compensation: how much pay the person in the middle of their distribution receives. The research firm MyLogIQ compiled the data; the remaining companies have more time because of the dates of their fiscal year. We spell out the math, and its limitations, below.Median compensation is an imprecise measurement of how much of a company\u2019s returns flow to labor. Among other things, it can be distorted by companies\u2019 use of contract and part-time labor, and a median pay number inherently fails to capture the full range of how a company\u2019s workers are paid.Given those flaws, the Marx Ratio isn\u2019t some definitive measure of how a company affects the economy and society. Rather, it is a tool for understanding the differences between companies and industries. In particular, the more a company\u2019s ability to generate profits is driven by things shareholders own \u2014 patents, a well-known brand or capital goods like machines and real estate \u2014 the higher its Marx Ratio will tend to be.To see how the Marx Ratio can help you understand the competitive dynamics and economic structure of an industry, consider how the numbers vary across well-known companies in some prominent industries.Wall Street may be the ultimate bastion of capitalism. But some of the highest Marx Ratios in the financial industry aren\u2019t found at the companies stocked with cutthroat traders and deal makers. Rather, the business of commercial banking \u2014 accepting deposits and making loans from branches around the United States \u2014 features a higher return to capital relative to labor.So for example, Wells Fargo has a Marx Ratio of 1.4, and JPMorgan Chase came in at 1.2. By contrast, Goldman Sachs\u2019s number was only 0.9 and Morgan Stanley\u2019s was 0.8.In effect, the profitability of those commercial banks is driven by things the company controls: their network of branches, their information technology systems, their brand reputation. Their employees, who include lots of bank tellers and loan officers, have little leverage with which to demand high pay; the median compensation at Wells Fargo was around $60,000.By contrast, the investment banks employ a lot more highly compensated, highly sought-after professionals, who in turn can demand premium salaries. The median compensation at Goldman was about $135,000. Those workers were more successful at claiming the value the organization created.Meanwhile, BlackRock, the giant asset management company, pays Goldman-esque salaries (median compensation: $141,987)  but manages to have a higher Marx Ratio than either commercial or investment banks, as it is able to manage a huge $6.3 trillion with a lean 13,900 workers.You see similar divides among the most powerful giants of the technology industry.Facebook is wildly profitable, generating almost $635,000 in earnings per employee for shareholders. It also pays those employees extremely well, with median compensation of $240,340, for a Marx Ratio of 2.64.More of Facebook\u2019s success accrued to capital \u2014 to the company\u2019s owners \u2014 than to labor. Its profits are driven by the network effects that keep both users and advertisers wedded to it, which are owned by shareholders. Rank-and-file software developers and advertising sales workers have less ability to extract a big chunk of the value being created.By contrast, Amazon is not very profitable \u2014 it is plowing most of the earnings from its mature businesses into longer-term investments in emerging ones. And its core retail business has low profit margins and requires vast armies in distribution centers and, with the acquisition of Whole Foods, grocery stores.With earnings per employee of only $5,359 and median compensation of about $28,000, Amazon has a Marx Ratio that is a mere 0.19. So far, neither the median Amazon worker nor Amazon shareholders are being rewarded very handsomely.Other prominent tech companies are somewhere in between. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, generates a healthy $158,000 in profit per employee, but like Facebook has a high median pay of $197,000. That\u2019s good for a Marx Ratio of 0.8. Other notable tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have not yet reported a median compensation number, but are also likely to end up in that middle ground once they do \u2014 Apple had earnings per employee in the most recent fiscal year of $393,100, and Microsoft came in at $171,000.The highest Marx Ratios were found at real estate investment trusts: companies with a favorable tax structure devised to invest in real estate. Publicly traded REITs in the sample had a median Marx Ratio of 4.13, higher than any other category of companies.This makes sense, as these companies work more as vehicles through which to deploy capital toward real estate than as conventional operating businesses. The highest Marx Ratio, for example, at 38, was for Duke Realty, an Indianapolis-based company that manages $6.2 billion worth of industrial real estate with a mere 400 employees (who, we might add, are well compensated, with median pay of $109,695).Some of the highest Marx Ratios \u2014 as well as some of the lowest \u2014 are to be found at oil- and gas-related businesses. This also makes sense. Energy companies are making huge bets, often with borrowed money, the success of which depends on the future market price and on their ability to extract petroleum.That explains how EQT Corp., a Pittsburgh-based natural gas producer, had one of the highest Marx Ratios among non-REITS (7.1), while Houston-based oil giant Marathon Oil had the lowest in the sample (-18.9). Marathon\u2019s $5.7 billion loss was due mainly to the sale of a Canadian oil sands business.Low oil and gas prices were bad news for many energy shareholders. Over all, the energy sector accounted for four of the five lowest Marx Ratios, a list that also included Hess, Noble Energy and NRG Energy.It is a good business for shareholders to be in when things are going well, but the risk they are taking on is real.Here are the calculations behind the Marx Ratio \u2014 and some of the limitations to the underlying data that make it an imperfect measure of how a company rewards capital versus labor.The numerator is the net income of the company in question per employee. Note that net income is subject to big year-to-year fluctuations, and doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect a company\u2019s continuing operating performance in any given year.Note what the numerator isn\u2019t \u2014 this isn\u2019t about the returns shareholders could earn through stock price appreciation, or dividends. This is focused on the underlying economics of the business; returns through the stock market can fluctuate for all kinds of reasons.The denominator is the compensation to the median employee, as disclosed in the company\u2019s proxy statement, which can create distortions in representing rank-and-file employees.Companies also have some degree of flexibility in how they calculate median pay, so comparisons are not necessarily apples-to-apples. For example, they may choose to use statistical sampling instead of actual payroll records, and may exclude non-U.S. employees depending on privacy rules in overseas markets.A better number for the idea we\u2019re really trying to get at would be average compensation for nonexecutive employees, but companies aren\u2019t required to report that publicly.We intentionally kept the math of the Marx Ratio simple. But if you want to make it a little more sophisticated, there are options.For one, you might adjust the calculation based on how much capital a company required to make its money. Shareholder\u2019s equity, for example, captures the book value of a company\u2019s assets minus its liabilities. If two companies generate similar profits but one requires much less equity to do it, it is essentially more efficient at generating returns for capital.You also might consider adjusting the measure of profitability to smooth out a company\u2019s returns to shareholders. After all, when a company records some enormous loss, it is frequently because the company is marking down the value of an earlier acquisition for which it paid too much, meaning it is capturing a past bad decision rather than providing information about future operating performance.Given all those limitations, the Marx Ratio should not be used as a definitive measure of how a company does or does not contribute to inequality. Rather, think of it as an important clue about how it is organized, how its economic structure works, and to whom its greatest rewards tend to flow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Running Uphill: The Challenge of Unseating Dianne Feinstein", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOXNARD, Calif. \u2014 Kevin de Le\u00f3n is one of the most prominent Democratic figures in the nation\u2019s most Democratic state. He has drawn national attention from the Democratic left for a spirited challenge to Senator Dianne Feinstein and for the aggressive legislative challenges to President Trump\u2019s policies advanced by the State Senate under his leadership.But these days, Mr. de Le\u00f3n is struggling for a toehold as he tries to negotiate the fraught and complicated terrain of trying to topple someone widely seen as a California institution. At 84, Ms. Feinstein is a five-term senator who began her political career as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969, when Mr. de Le\u00f3n was just 3 years old.Mr. de Le\u00f3n, 51, represents what many party members see as one of the leading faces of the next generation of California Democratic leadership amid calls for Ms. Feinstein to step aside to make room for the next class of leaders.But Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s struggles suggest that this moment of transition remains a work in progress. He would seem to have the right political makeup to lead the party to its next chapter. He is more liberal than Ms. Feinstein at a time when the left is on the rise. He is Latino in a state where the power of Latino voters continues to grow. And he is coming off almost four years as president of the Senate, giving him a platform to present himself as one of the state\u2019s most aggressive leaders in opposing Mr. Trump.Yet he is running against a powerful remnant of California\u2019s old guard who enjoys strong historical, cultural and sentimental ties to many Democrats who have followed Ms. Feinstein\u2019s career over the decades. Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s run is exposing the challenges for a candidate who at any other time \u2014 or against another opponent \u2014 would seem to be a potentially powerful competitor.Mr. de Le\u00f3n is not, for the most part, facing questions on his record; rather, in the view of many of Ms. Feinstein\u2019s supporters, she is a highly successful senator and foil to Mr. Trump, especially on national security issues, and there is simply no reason for her to go.\u201cI am not delusional,\u201d he said over an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl at a diner in San Diego. \u201cListen, I am not na\u00efve to the fact that people are not shouting my name all over the state of California. What we\u2019ve identified is after 25 years of unchallenged incumbency, people in California want a change. And a new voice representing them. I want to be that voice.\u201dBut, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a tough race.\u201dSo it was that Mr. de Le\u00f3n could be found one recent Saturday driving himself around in his blue Chevy Volt from rally to picnic, singing along to Morrissey on the radio, in a one-car campaign caravan that took him from downtown Los Angeles to Thousand Oaks to Oxnard.Mr. de Le\u00f3n has earned applause from some Democrats for leading the Senate as it challenged Mr. Trump.He has hammered Ms. Feinstein for showing a willingness to work with Mr. Trump and he has taken positions on issues \u2014 military intervention, health care, tax cuts, among them \u2014 that stand in contrast to the more moderate and measured senator.More pointedly, he made a point of contrasting his background with Ms. Feinstein, portraying her as the wealthy doyenne of San Francisco Democratic politics and himself as the working-class son of a San Diego barrio seeking to become this state\u2019s first Latino senator. Mr. de Le\u00f3n recently took a reporter on a tour of Logan Heights, the San Diego neighborhood where he grew up, and lingered at a single-room apartment where he shared a bed with his single mother who worked as a housekeeper. The tour was memorialized by an aide for a Facebook Live feed.\u201cI try to deal with the poverty gap \u2014 to do policies for all of us, rather than only for the wealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cShe votes for two wars without a way to finance the wars, votes for a Republican tax cut that as a billionaire, she benefits greatly from. That is a gross abuse of power.\u201dIt is a measure of Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s standing in the polls \u2014 and the fact that as of now, at least, he is not viewed as a real threat to the senator \u2014 that Ms. Feinstein has while campaigning avoided engaging Mr. de Le\u00f3n.Her campaign manager, Jeff Millman, defended her performance. \u201cRather than responding to political cheap shots, Senator Feinstein is responding to the everyday needs of Californians by opposing Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy, his attempts to repeal Obamacare and his attacks on Dreamers,\u201d he said.There is clearly an audience who share Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s view that it is time for Ms. Feinstein to step aside.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to push someone not to run,\u201d Ryan Skolnick, 25, a speech coach from Simi Valley, told Mr. de Le\u00f3n as he moved through a crowd of supporters at a restaurant in Oxnard.R. L. Miller, the chairwoman of the environmental caucus of the California Democratic Party, nodded vigorously when asked if she thought Ms. Feinstein should retire. \u201cOh my gosh \u2014 where do I start?\u201d she said. \u201cWe can upgrade. She\u2019s reliable. But he has the heart of an activist \u2014 she does not.\u201dGraciela Soliz Ventura, 68, a retired schoolteacher, said that she had long been a \u201cbig supporter\u201d of Ms. Feinstein, but that the senator\u2019s time had passed.\u201cShe\u2019s not listening to California and our values,\u201d she said. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201dStill, Ms. Feinstein is widely respected, if not necessarily revered, which complicates Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s task. In interviews, he repeatedly said he is not suggesting she is too old to return to Washington, but rather that she is ideologically out of step.It is not an easy case to make.\u201cYou are disrupting the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are challenging the establishment authority that has been out of touch with California voters. Times have changed.\u201dMr. de Le\u00f3n suggests that Ms. Feinstein is treated deferentially, by the press and the public, because of her stature. \u201cShe gets passes,\u201d he said. \u201cShe constantly gets passes.\u201dMr. de Le\u00f3n said he decided to challenge Ms. Feinstein after she called for \u201cpatience\u201d with Mr. Trump.\u201cAs Democrats we will never be fooled into believing that if we are patient enough, that Donald Trump could be a good president,\u201d he said to applause from a group of voters ambling under the sun on a patio at a Mexican restaurant in Oxnard. \u201cThis is not a time to be polite or patient.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified R.L. Miller of the environmental caucus of the California Democratic Party. Ms. Miller is a woman, not a man. An earlier version also misstated Kevin de Le\u00f3n\u2019s age at the time Dianne Feinstein was entering politics. He would have been 3, not 4. The error was repeated in a photo caption.Advertisement"}

Afterward, she struggled to meet new people. \u201cI remember her complaining that on the Upper West Side, it was all strollers and dogs,\u201d Ms. Smith said.Ms. Shull joined Social Circles, a now-defunct networking company, and signed up for a group golf outing in July 2002. Each golf cart held two people and everyone scrambled for a partner. To Ms. Shull\u2019s surprise, a slim economist, William T. Long, appeared by her side. \u201cShe seemed very confidant and very vivacious, very noticeable,\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cI made a point of trying to get in the same golf cart as her.\u201dHe met her three main requirements in a boyfriend. He had a graduate degree (a master\u2019s in economics from Duke). He was in therapy. (\u201cYou gotta know yourself or you don\u2019t have a chance,\u201d she often says.) And, he had been divorced, in 1990. (\u201cI wanted someone who knew relationships are hard,\u201d she said.)While her divorce was friendly \u2014 \u201cWe went to lunch together afterward,\u201d she said \u2014 his was not. \u201cLots of drama,\u201d said Mr. Long, who is 62 and grew up in Clemmons, N.C., surrounded by a large extended family. Ms. Shull, who was adopted, grew up as an only child in Akron, Ohio.During their golf outing, she gave him her card, which he uncharacteristically misplaced. Friends describe him as organized and detail-oriented, unbeatable at word games, well-read and funny. At the time, he worked in New York City developing tax compliance software at KPMG, the accounting firm, and spent his weekends competing in road bike races. He lived in a studio apartment that was furnished mainly with bikes and biking equipment, all meticulously maintained.Weeks later, he came upon her card and called. By then, she was preparing to move to St. Louis, partly to be closer to a half brother, John Kluge, who lived there. She and Mr. Kluge share the same biological father and first learned of each other\u2019s existence in 1999 after Ms. Shull met her biological parents.Before she left, they went on one date and found they have many of the same interests yet very different personalities. \u201cDenise looks like an impulsive rock star to Bill\u2019s chess-playing composure,\u201d said Contessa Joret, a good friend of the couple.They continued dating, traveling back and forth from New York to St. Louis and taking trips together. \u201cShe was easy to fly with, the easiest woman to travel with I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he said. \u201cShe just has this laid-back attitude.\u201dMs. Shull recalls first seeing Mr. Long\u2019s apartment full of bikes. \u201cI loved it!\u201d she said. \u201cOn top of being cute and super smart, he\u2019s a crazy good athlete in crazy good shape.\u201dIn spring 2003, he persuaded her to move back to New York, which she did without hesitation. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any problem picking up and leaving,\u201d he said.Over the next several years, the two lived in a high-rise building in Hell\u2019s Kitchen; a house in Greenwich Conn.; an apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Roosevelt Island; and another in Long Island City, Queens. In 2003, she founded ReThink, and in 2004 they acquired two Yorkshire Terriers. She taught him to ski and he encouraged her to go on long bikes rides with him, promising brunch somewhere along the way.They even briefly discussed trying to have children together (neither have children from their first marriages) but decided against it. She regrets that. \u201cWhat I know is that even in situations where there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it, you admit to the whole spectrum of feelings and the regret becomes less debilitating,\u201d she said.The year 2012 was great for them. Mr. Long began working at ReThink, where he is now the chief of staff, and Ms. Shull\u2019s book, \u201cMarket Mind Games: A Radical Psychology of Investing, Trading and Risk\u201d (McGraw-Hill Education) was published.But 2014 was terrible. They argued constantly, which upset Mr. Long more than Ms. Shull, who has a higher tolerance for emotional conflict. \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel like the relationship was working,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hate seemed to be outweighing the love.\u201dThey decided to separate and he moved to Charlotte, N.C., while she plunged into dating. She estimates she went on 50 dates in the months after their breakup, some arranged through Tinder. \u201cIn no time flat, in every situation, I would think, \u2018They are not as smart as Bill, they are not as handsome as Bill, they are not as much of a gentleman as Bill,\u2019\u201d she said.Mr. Long was not particularly happy, either. \u201cThe single life didn\u2019t turn out to be as satisfying as I expected it to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt finally dawned on me, \u2018Let\u2019s work it out.\u2019\u201dIn the summer of 2015, he moved back to New York. He proposed to Ms. Shull a little over a year later, presenting her with a screen shot of a ring he thought she might like.Organizing a wedding seemed like a daunting time commitment to Ms. Shull, who everyone describes as a workaholic, but getting married made perfect sense. \u201cThere may be times when we can\u2019t stand each other but we can\u2019t live without each other,\u201d she said.On April 12, the couple were married at the Aspen Mountain Club in Aspen, their favorite ski town. It was so windy that riding the gondola up to the club, atop Aspen Mountain, seemed more like a leap of faith than marriage.The ceremony was small but not subdued. Eleven guests huddled together on the club\u2019s outside deck, facing the Elk Mountains and shivering. The couple dressed neither warmly nor practically. \u201cWe are going all out, overboard, in terms of clothes and food,\u201d the excited bride said. Mr. Long wore a morning suit while Ms. Shull appeared in a pink strapless organza and tulle gown, pink faux fur shawl, and a tulle veil that occasionally flew perpendicular. She was escorted onto the deck by Mr. Kluge, her half brother, who later said he was amazed to discover, upon first meeting Ms. Shull, that their feet and hands were nearly identical.In Colorado, no particular authorization is required of wedding officiants so the couple chose Bill Smith, Ms. Smith\u2019s father and a longtime friend, to lead them through the vows. He cried more than they did.Afterward, everyone returned inside for a feast at one long table, amid the club\u2019s mix of mounted antlers, abstract paintings, antique wood tables, cushioned banquettes and windows the size of highway billboards.The bride, who is always monitoring her own emotions closely, later said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t the least bit nervous. I was just really happy. It was just so darn joyful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Flannery said last fall that he wanted to sell off $20 billion in assets.Since the end of the financial crisis, G.E. has sold roughly $200 billion of assets. The company has moved to exit its finance arm, sold NBCUniversal and divested its appliance business that most people associated with G.E.Here\u2019s a timeline of some of G.E.\u2019s biggest transactions since the financial crisis.Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund lost when it took on Samsung three years ago. But the activist investor has claimed victory in its latest battle with a South Korean conglomerate, or chaebol.Here\u2019s how the hedge fund prevailed.The contextElliott said that the restructuring plan showed management \u201chas failed to act in the best interest of the companies and their respective shareholders.\u201d It instead proposed turning Hyundai Motor into a holding company that it said was more tax efficient and sustainable.Why Elliott could win this timeIn a presentation earlier this year, the hedge fund noted that Hyundai\u2019s proposed transaction was similar to what Samsung wanted to do in 2015, where the company sold an affiliate to the chaebol\u2019s holding company. There, Samsung was able to rally individual investors, who accounted for nearly a third of its shareholder base, to its cause.By contrast, retail investors comprise some 5 percent of Hyundai\u2019s shareholder base. Big international institutions, which make up the bulk of Hyundai\u2019s investors, are likely to be more immune to the entreaties of companies under attack from an activist if the campaign makes sense financially.\u2014 Michael de la MercedStock markets are up so far this month, suggesting in part that investors were betting that tensions between the United States and its largest trading partners would ease.That seemed to occur this weekend. The United States and China issued a joint statement on trade and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said planned tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods were on hold. China did not seem to commit to much that is concrete to gain a reprieve from the tariffs, a notable achievement for the country\u2019s negotiators.The joint statement said China would significantly increase its imports from the United States, but it did not say how much more it would buy and over what time period. The parts of the statement about investing in each other\u2019s country and protecting intellectual property were even vaguer.President Trump on Monday nevertheless promoted the statement as a win. But influential members of his administration who are still spoiling for a big trade fight will no doubt want to keep up the pressure on China \u2014 and Mr. Trump may at times share their desire in the coming months. Still, the events of recent weeks show that the United States was largely isolated in its trade fights and the Trump administration may have lacked the resolve or unity to keep up its hard-edged approach. The Trump administration can, of course,reintroduce the threat of tariffs if it believes China is failing to make concessions in the proceeding trade talks. But after stepping back this weekend, it will be harder for the Trump administration to make an aggressive stance appear credible.Indeed, the big question hanging over the Trump administration: Why did it withdraw its tariff threat now, before exacting hard, quantifiable concessions from China? One reason may be that the United States needs China\u2019s help in dealing with North Korea ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s summit with Kim Jong Un planned for June. Another reason may be that China was up for a long fight with the United States and signaled so. Whatever the cause, the takeaway for investors is that the Trump administration passed up an opportunity to show China that it meant what it said.Still, investors may not want to relax too much. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity has been rising even as he made combative moves on the trade front that at times roiled the market. In other words, there does not appear to be much political risk domestically, if any, to taking on China, and so Mr. Trump may use belligerent trade talk to stir up his base ahead of the midterm elections in November.But as long as he steps back from taking tough actions, investors will most likely take his rhetoric in stride. That stance has served them well. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is now up from where it was in mid-February when the Trump administration outlined its case for steel and aluminum tariffs.- Peter EavisAnalysts over at Goldman Sachs are out with a report on Monday looking at the holdings of 848 hedge funds with a combined $2.3 trillion in stock market bets.Here are some takeaways:Individual stocks\u2022 Hedge funds added bets on Facebook more than any other stock during the first quarter, followed by Microsoft, Aetna and Monsanto.\u2022 Amazon had the biggest reduction in wagers on it, followed by Apple, McDonald\u2019s and Citigroup.Sectors\u2022Tech remained the biggest holding among hedge funds but their holdings overall decreased during the first quarter.\u2022 Hedge funds boosted their bets on the energy sector.\u2022 They remain the most bullish on shares of consumer discretionary companies.\u2022 The hedge funds cut their exposure to financial stocks.The vote was 5 to 4, with the court\u2019s more conservative justices in the majority. The court\u2019s decision on the matter could affect some 25 million employment contracts.She tweeted:Steven Mnuchin said this weekend, \u201cWe\u2019re putting the trade war on hold.\u201d S.&P. 500 futures were up on the news. But the pressure is on the Trump administration to back up its tough talk on China \u2014 a task that may be more difficult without the leverage of potential tariffs.The fight inside the White House is still real. Free-trade supporters like Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, are still slinging arrows at hard-liners like the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro. (While Mr. Mnuchin said the tariffs were \u201con hold,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said they were still possible.)The two sides have agreed on a \u201cframework\u201d under which China would increase its purchases of American goods, while putting in place \u201cstructural\u201d changes to protect American technology and to make it easier for American companies to compete in China.G.E. was advised by Morgan Stanley and Dyal Company, the boutique investment bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs deal maker Gordon Dyal, as well as the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. Wabtec was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Jones Day.The chief executive of G.E., John Flannery, has pledged to reduce the company\u2019s byzantine structure and focus on its fastest-growing core businesses. Making train engines isn\u2019t part of that equation.Even for a private company like Theranos, disclosure is the bedrock of American capitalism \u2014 the \u201cdisinfectant\u201d that allows investors to gauge a company\u2019s prospects.

I Don\u2019t Regret It.", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Abu\u00a0Artema helped organize the Great Return March.This article has been updated.Palestinians long have held onto the dream of Jerusalem as our own capital, or at least as a shared capital in a country that offers equal rights to everyone. The feeling of betrayal and distress in Gaza was palpable. To clear my head, my friend Hasan and I took a walk along the border, which we do every now and again.\u201cThere lies our land,\u201d I said to Hasan, as I looked at the trees on the other side of the barbed-wire fence that confines us. \u201cIt\u2019s just a few kilometers away from here.\u201d And yet, because of that fence and the soldiers who guard it, it is so far away. Most people my age have never been permitted to leave Gaza, since Egypt controls the southern land exit and Israel restricts access to the north \u2014 as well as forbids use of our sea and airport (or at least what\u2019s left of it after three wars).My hatred of borders is both universal \u2014 in the sense that all Palestinians suffer from them \u2014 and very personal. My grandparents and their grandparents were born and raised in the town of Ramla, in the center of what is now Israel. On my walks, I imagined my family\u2019s ancestral land.On that day in December, as I watched the birds fly over the border I could not cross, I found myself thinking how much smarter birds and animals are than people; they harmonize with nature instead of erecting walls. Later that day, I wondered on Facebook what would happen if a man acted like a bird and crossed that fence. \u201cWhy would Israeli soldiers shoot at him as if he is committing a crime?\u201d I wrote. My only thought was to reach the trees, sit there and then come back.Young people in Gaza reacted to my post immediately, sharing it and adding their own ideas. Just a week later, it seemed as if hundreds of people were talking about it. We established a youth committee and met with local agencies and institutions. We also met with the national political parties: We wanted to offer all sectors of society in Gaza the opportunity to be involved.What has happened since we started the Great Return March is both what I hoped and expected \u2014 and not. It was not a surprise that Israel responded to our march with deadly violence. But I had not expected this level of cruelty. On the other hand, I was heartened by the commitment to nonviolence among most of my own people.A couple of years ago, people here would have dismissed the idea that peaceful demonstrations could achieve anything significant. After all, every other form of resistance has produced nothing concrete. What amazes me is the transformation we are seeing in the way we resist. Our struggle previously was between armed Palestinian fighters and Israeli snipers, tanks and F-16s. Now, it is a struggle between the occupation and peaceful protesters \u2014 men and women, young and old.The Great Return March reminds the world about the origin of the conflict \u2014 our uprooting from our lands and our lives, beginning in 1948 and sustained since then. We have chosen May 15 as the culmination of our protests because that is the day that Palestinians mark the \u201cnakba,\u201d the Arabic word for catastrophe, which is what we call the expulsions from our homes 70 years ago. Whatever solution we negotiate in the future to allow our two peoples to live together peacefully and equally must start with a recognition of this wrong.We have also tried to discourage protesters from attempting to cross into Israel. However, we can\u2019t stop them. It is the action of an imprisoned people yearning for freedom, one of the strongest motivations in human nature. Likewise, the people won\u2019t go away on May 15. We are intent on continuing our struggle until Israel recognizes our right to return to our homes and land from which we were expelled.Desperation fuels this new generation. We are not going back to our subhuman existence. We will keep knocking at the doors of international organizations and our Israeli jailers until we see concrete steps to end the blockade of Gaza.Update: The byline on this essay has been changed to reflect the author\u2019s preferred transliteration, Ahmed Abu Artema, instead of Ahmed Abu Ratima.Ahmed Abu Artema is a freelance journalist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Microsoft Antitrust Case Taught Us", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Blumenthal is a Democratic senator from Connecticut.\u00a0Mr. Wu is a law professor who who specializes in antitrust.Twenty years ago today, Microsoft was sued by the Department of Justice and a coalition of 20 state attorneys general (including one of us, Mr. Blumenthal, of Connecticut) for violating federal antitrust law.Microsoft, the world\u2019s dominant software firm, and Bill Gates, the world\u2019s richest man, faced a challenge from the upstart company Netscape and its internet browser, Netscape Navigator. The suit accused Microsoft of illegally protecting its operating-system monopoly and seeking a new monopoly for its own browser, Internet Explorer. The fear was that Microsoft would kill Netscape, monopolize the browser market and use that point of control to dominate the coming age of the web.After a tough fight, the government won the case. There is now no browser monopoly, and the world has come to rely on the many apps, firms and ideas that were born after Microsoft\u2019s control was broken. Microsoft has become a gentler giant, and Mr. Gates has become a philanthropist.Yet it is worth remembering that at the time, challenging Microsoft was not a popular decision. Microsoft was a well-liked company and Mr. Gates was widely heralded as a visionary genius. Many, Microsoft most of all, argued that enforcing the antitrust laws against Microsoft would damage innovation and impede the economic growth fueled by the technology sector.This view turned out to be wrong. Innovation surged in the newly opened markets and the United States continued to spearhead growth in the technological world. The enduring lesson of the Microsoft case was that keeping markets open can require a trustbuster\u2019s courage to take decisive action against even a very popular monopolist.Imagine a world in which Microsoft had been allowed to monopolize the browser business. Holding a triple monopoly (operating system, major applications and the browser), Microsoft would have controlled the future of the web. Google, the tiny start-up, would have faced an unfair fight against Bing. Microsoft-Myspace might have become the default social network instead of Facebook. And who knows whether Netflix or any other online video service would have been started?It took the power of law enforcement to rebut Microsoft\u2019s claims that everything it was doing was pro-competitive, innovative and innocent. The discovery of candid internal company memos, a famously revealing deposition of Bill Gates and a full trial made it clear that Microsoft saw the internet as a major threat to its monopoly rule and was seeking to tame it.The presiding judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, was right to propose that Microsoft be broken into two companies \u2014 one for the Windows operating system, one for other products. In the end, unfortunately, Microsoft was kept whole.Some limitations were placed on Microsoft\u2019s behavior, such as a requirement that it share certain programming information with third-party companies. The appropriateness of that remedy is still debated. But what we do know is that the remedy pushed Microsoft to act with more caution, creating an essential opening for a new generation of firms.It might seem like a cruel irony that the immediate beneficiaries of the Microsoft antitrust case \u2014 namely, Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 have now become behemoths themselves. But this is how the innovation cycle works: It creates room for saplings to grow into giants, but then prevents the new giants from squashing the next generation of saplings. (Microsoft was itself, in the early 1980s, the beneficiary of another antitrust case, against IBM, the computing colossus of its time.)Which takes us to the present day. Unfortunately, ever since the Microsoft case there has been remarkably little oversight of the technology sector, despite the obvious signs of corporate consolidation and outsize market power. Enforcement of the antimonopoly laws has fallen: Between 1970 and 1999, the United States brought about 15 monopoly cases each year; between 2000 and 2014 that number went down to just three.Antitrust efforts have become too fixated on the idea that the only real harm consists of raising of prices for consumers. Yet in the Microsoft case, Internet Explorer was \u201cfree,\u201d even though Microsoft was bent on destroying competition with it. Today, both Google and Facebook offer products that are free. Society has grown to rely on them, but because they have no dollar price, antitrust regulators have been hesitant to take action.Any American can tell you that there is no free lunch. Everything has a price. We pay for these products and services with our time and our data. And like Microsoft, these firms have come to exert too much control over our shared technological future.At a hearing before the Senate, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, was asked to name Facebook\u2019s biggest competitor \u2014 a company providing a similar service that consumers can go to if they are unhappy with Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg could not name one. Part of the reason for this is that Facebook bought its most obvious competitors, Instagram and WhatsApp, and continues to acquire upstart companies before they can reach that point.The pattern is familiar. And if the Microsoft case showed us anything, it is that we should not trust any one company to decide our future.Richard Blumenthal is a Democratic senator from Connecticut.

The group, one of several in Myanmar\u2019s frontier areas that have long battled government forces, said in a statement that it was retaliating for a push by Myanmar\u2019s military against another ethnic insurgent group, the Kachin Independence Army.A spokesman for the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army, known for its campaigns against drug production and distribution, said it had targeted soldiers and militia members who ran a casino.\u201cMany civilians go to casinos and it causes many social problems; that\u2019s why we launched a major assault,\u201d said the spokesman, Col. Tar Aik Kyaw. He called the casino a \u201cgateway for distributing drugs.\u201dThe attack appeared to be a setback for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader, who has said she wants to bring an end to conflicts with ethnic militias that in some cases have continued for decades.A government spokesman denounced the attack, saying the high civilian death toll was unacceptable.\u201cThis is not the ethnic rights movement,\u201d said the spokesman, Zaw Htay. \u201cThis is a terrorist attack.\u201dMr. Zaw Htay was quoted by Reuters as saying that the attack had involved about 100 insurgents, with small arms and artillery.Photos posted on Facebook showed several dead who appeared to be civilians. The images could not be immediately verified.Mr. Sai Kyaw Thein said that 20 people had been wounded and sent to a hospital in Muse, and that two who were severely injured had been sent to a hospital in the Chinese city of Ruili. Several civilians also fled across the border into China.A statement on the official Facebook page of the commander in chief of Myanmar\u2019s military, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, said that the attack \u201cleft innocent civilians dead.\u201d\u201cNow government military are clearing the area by fighting back to terrorists,\u201d it said.This year, the government had warned that the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army and the Kachin Independence Army were preparing to attack the town of Lashio, which is about 75 miles south of Muse.The Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army and the Kachin Independence Army are among the groups that blame the government for continuing the oppression of ethnic minorities and refuse to enter peace talks.Saw Nang reported from Mandalay, Myanmar, and Austin Ramzy from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Advertisement"}

Disaster seemed the only possible outcome.Then, to the nimble rescue on the streets of Paris on Saturday evening, came a young man whom some French people have started to call the Spider-Man of the 18th, referring to the arrondissement of Paris where the episode unfolded.Finally, after scaling four balconies, the man reached the child and pulled him to safety. And suddenly, an act of individual courage and resourcefulness began to play into Europe\u2019s fraught and polarized debate about outsiders, immigrants and refugees.The man, identified as Mamoudou Gassama, 22, is a migrant from Mali, a troubled former French colony in northwest Africa, who journeyed through Burkina Faso, Niger and Libya before making the dangerous Mediterranean Sea crossing to Italy and arriving in France in September, without documentation.On Monday, after his heroic rescue of the boy, he met with President Emmanuel Macron. Now, he will get the requisite documentation to live legally in France.On Monday, sitting across from Mr. Macron in one of the palace\u2019s many gilded rooms, Mr. Gassama, wearing jeans and a short-sleeved shirt, told the French president about the rescue. \u201cBravo,\u201d Mr. Macron said, as the two men sat before TV cameras.Mr. Macron said in his statement that the Paris firefighters were \u201ceager to welcome\u201d Mr. Gassama into their ranks. He added that he had \u201cinvited\u201d Mr. Gassama to apply for French citizenship, \u201cbecause France is built on desire, and Mr. Gassama\u2019s commitment clearly showed that he has that desire.\u201dMr. Macron has said repeatedly that France could welcome only those with legitimate grounds for asylum, a point he reiterated in his meeting with Mr. Gassama, according to Agence France-Presse.\u201cWhen they are in danger, we give asylum, but not for economic reasons,\u201d Mr. Macron said of immigrants, according to the news agency. \u201cBut in your case, you did something exceptional.\u201d\u201cAn exceptional act does not make a policy,\u201d Mr. Macron later told journalists at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, the news agency reported.Some, including groups that help undocumented migrants, criticized the government as hypocritical for praising Mr. Gassama while pushing to deport others like him, calling Mr. Macron\u2019s \u00c9lys\u00e9e invitation a public relations stunt.As France struggled to cope with the terrorist attacks at the supermarket and at the offices of the satirical news weekly Charlie Hebdo, his actions provided much needed solace. Mr. Bathily, a Muslim from Mali, was granted French citizenship later that month, and he currently works at Paris City Hall.Even Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front party offered to support Mr. Gassama\u2019s bid for residency \u2014 but only in return for the expulsion of all the other migrants living in France without official consent.The boy saved by Mr. Gassama was alone in the apartment while his father went grocery shopping, said Fran\u00e7ois Molins, the Paris prosecutor. The boy\u2019s mother was not in Paris at the time.\u201cHe is devastated because he realizes what he did, and the tragic consequences that it could have led to,\u201d Mr. Molins said.The father was taken into police custody on Sunday, and an investigation has been opened for \u201cfailure to meet parental obligations.\u201d A conviction on that charge carries a sentence of up to two years in prison. The parents have not been identified, as is customary in French criminal inquiries.The father has been released pending trial.\u201cI saw all these people shouting, and cars sounding their horns,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I crossed the road to go save him.\u201d\u201cI felt afraid when I saved the child,\u201d he said, according to French news reports. \u201cI started to shake, I could hardly stand up. I had to sit down.\u201dAurelien Breeden reported from Paris, and Alan Cowell from London. Elian Peltier contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica to File for Bankruptcy After Misuse of Facebook Data", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe embattled political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica announced on Wednesday that it would cease most operations and file for bankruptcy amid growing legal and political scrutiny of its business practices and work for Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.But the company\u2019s announcement left several questions unanswered, including who would retain the company\u2019s intellectual property \u2014 the so-called psychographic voter profiles built in part with data from Facebook \u2014 and whether Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data-mining business would return under new auspices.\u201cOver the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company\u2019s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said.The company, bankrolled by Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who invested at least $15 million, offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. Those modeling techniques underpinned Cambridge Analytica\u2019s work for the Trump campaign and for other candidates in 2014 and 2016.But Cambridge Analytica came under scrutiny over the past year, first for its purported methods of profiling voters and then over allegations that it improperly harvested private data from Facebook users. Last year, the company was drawn into the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.Facebook has since announced changes to its policies for collecting and handling user data. Its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testified last month before Congress, where he faced criticism for failing to protect users\u2019 data.The controversy dealt a major blow to Cambridge Analytica\u2019s ambitions of expanding its commercial business in the United States, while also bringing unwanted attention to the American government contracts sought by SCL Group, an intelligence contractor.But no candidates for federal office in the United States have disclosed paying Cambridge Analytica during the 2018 cycle. A Republican congressional candidate in California did report voiding a $10,000 transaction with the company in early March, according to federal election records.The company also unsuccessfully tried to court some major commercial clients in the last year, including Mercedes-Benz and Anheuser-Busch InBev, the global brewer, according to one former employee. Cambridge pitched AB InBev by claiming that it could position Bud Light as the beer for the young party crowd and Budweiser for old-school conservatives, according to the former employee, who asked not to be named because the person was restricted from speaking about the company\u2019s business.Cambridge and SCL officials privately raised the possibility that Emerdata could be used for a Blackwater-style rebranding of Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group, according two people with knowledge of the companies, who asked for anonymity to describe confidential conversations. One plan under consideration was to sell off the combined company\u2019s data and intellectual property.An executive and a part owner of SCL Group, Nigel Oakes, has publicly described Emerdata as a way of rolling up the two companies under one new banner. Efforts to reach him by phone on Wednesday were unsuccessful.The former Cambridge Analytica employee said that staff members were originally told there would be an all-hands meeting in London on Tuesday, but that it was pushed back a day. Then, after assembling at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, they were kept waiting through the morning and much of the afternoon before Julian Wheatland, the company\u2019s chief executive, delivered the news.The damage to the company\u2019s reputation was simply too severe, and it was \u201cfutile\u201d and \u201cpointless\u201d to try to rebuild amid investigations in the United States and Britain, Mr. Wheatland said, according to the former Cambridge Analytica employee, who was informed by those in attendance.Employees in Washington were notified during a conference call later in the day. They were then told to turn over their identification cards and any company property and to go home. By 2 p.m., Cambridge Analytica offices on Pennsylvania Avenue were empty save for a single man, who refused to answer questions from a reporter.Ben Protess and Adam Goldman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Things Have Changed Since Sandy Hook", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Swartz is\u00a0an executive editor at Texas Monthly and a contributing opinion writer.SANTA FE, Tex. \u2014 The makeshift memorials were growing larger by the hour outside Santa Fe High School on Saturday, the balloons holding up valiantly while the floral bouquets were already beginning to wilt in the early summer heat. In the aftermath of the murder of eight students and two adults at the school by Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, the familiar yellow caution tape had been wrapped around the school\u2019s perimeter. On a weekend night, there were still some cars in the school parking lot, eerily unaccounted for. There were the usual blood drives and fund-raisers for funeral expenses, and it seemed as if every church and bank sign in town, from those made with old fashioned magnetic letters to retina-searing LEDs, was offering a single message: Pray for Santa Fe.You could almost conjure the whole scene in your mind without visiting the place, the aftermaths of school shootings having become so familiar. The only thing that made Santa Fe different was the hypocrisy of major Texas politicians \u2014 the ones who have never wavered in their push for more guns on college campuses, showy open-carry laws and laws that have made it easier for the mentally ill to buy guns.By now you have heard of our Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick\u2019s dubious suggestion that schools should reduce the number of entrances and exits to prevent more shootings \u2014 and that divorce, abortion and video games are to blame. Then there was Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s promise to \u201cdo more than just pray for the victims and their families,\u201d by holding round-table discussions to stop the violence. He promised to speed up background checks and keep guns away from those who pose \u201cimmediate danger.\u201d But if history is any indication, both men will be more obsessed with keeping transgender kids from using the bathroom of their choice than keeping all kids safe in their schools.The most effective breach in the bloviation came from the Houston police chief, Art Acevedo, who wrote a Facebook post that went viral, taking on \u201cthe elected officials that ran to the cameras today, acted in a solemn manner, called for prayers, and will once again do absolutely nothing.\u201d Let\u2019s hope he has grander ambitions.Still, it\u2019s no wonder that most Americans cite the lack of change since the murder of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 as evidence that we are locked in a toxic stasis, thanks mostly to our politicians\u2019 love affair with the National Rifle Association.And yet change has come, albeit slowly. And it has come not from the top, but from grass-roots campaigns often driven by women \u2014 the infuriated-mom equivalent of #MeToo that has joined with older organizations like The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and Michael Bloomberg\u2019s Mayors Against Guns. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America was started by Shannon Watts in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, and now as a part of Everytown for Gun Safety has over four million members. Then there are smaller groups like Survivors Empowered, started by Sandy and Lonnie Phillips after their daughter was killed in the mass shooting in 2012 in Aurora, Colo.These people have no fear of the N.R.A. \u2014 despite its steady targeting of people, especially women, who speak out against them. These are the volunteers who have gone door to door with petitions and who speak before state legislatures. And it works: They have brought significant change to eight states, forcing stronger background checks, limiting gun access to perpetrators of domestic violence, and creating \u201cred flag\u201d laws to allow the local police and families to take guns away from relatives who are at risk to themselves or others \u2014 laws that might have prevented at least some of the mass shootings in the last decades.These are the people who forced change in Vermont, persuading Gov. Phil Scott to require a criminal background check for every gun sale in the state, and who, in Florida, successfully pushed for a red flag law and raised the minimum age to buy a gun to 21. In the same state they managed to close the so-called Charleston loophole, which allowed gun sales after three business days, even if a background check was not completed. (Dylann Roof, who murdered nine African-Americans at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, got his weapon this way.)Thanks to pressure from these groups, Maryland, Vermont and Oregon have passed laws meant to take guns away from domestic abusers, with Kansas and Pennsylvania set to do the same. Ditto the five states that now have laws prohibiting bump stocks, the attachments that allow semiautomatic weapons to work like machine guns, like the one used by Stephen Paddock to kill 58 people and wound hundreds more in Las Vegas.Then there is Survivors Empowered, which not only has a rapid response team to help victims and survivors of mass shootings \u2014 they showed up in Santa Fe, too \u2014 but also started a campaign of buying billboard ads to shame politicians the group feels are beholden to the gun lobby. In Alabama, it ran a billboard ad, in bold black type on a blood-red background, that announced: \u201cCongresswoman Martha Roby has received over $14K from the N.R.A. Enough is enough.\u201dSo it\u2019s not that nothing has been done since Sandy Hook. It\u2019s that nothing has been done by the likes of the governor of Texas, or the president of the United States \u2014 who can\u2019t seem to move beyond round tables and tweets to actually make the country safer. Yes, our gun laws vary from state to state \u2014 some places are far safer than others. And yes, so much more needs to be done.\u201cI\u2019ll get downtime after we\u2019ve voted all of these N.R.A. shills out of office,\u201d a Moms Demand Action member told me last weekend. Spoken like someone with the will to keep kids from getting shot in art class.Advertisement"}

Another, an exchange student from Pakistan, was preparing for her return home, asking that her mother cook her favorite dinner. Others had ordinary teenage plans ahead \u2014 for Xbox and tennis games, for bickering with siblings, for a new bedroom.After the shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas, relatives and friends were mourning the loss of 10 people \u2014 eight students and two teachers \u2014 and preparing for funerals and memorials.Lost, too, were all the plans.Cynthia Tisdale, one of the teachers who died, had planned one day to retire and be a \u201cfull-time grandmother,\u201d John Tisdale, her brother-in-law, said.\u201cIt will never happen.\u201dHere are the stories of the people who perished following the shooting at Santa Fe High School.Jared Black\u2019s favorite class was art, his family said, and that was where he was on Friday morning. He had turned 17 earlier in the week, and he couldn\u2019t wait for his birthday party on Saturday.Elizabeth McGinnis, a family friend, said Jared\u2019s father, Robert Black, had wondered aloud how this could happen to someone like Jared. \u201cHe would never hurt anyone,\u201d she recalled Jared\u2019s father saying.Nick Black, Jared\u2019s half brother, said he wished he could see him one more time.\u201cMy brother loved to play Minecraft on Xbox, play Pokemon Go on his cellphone, and loved art,\u201d Mr. Black said, in a statement he wrote with a close friend. \u201cWe miss him so much.\u201dShana Fisher, who was also in the art room at the time of the attack, had just turned 16.The family waited and searched and hoped, all of Friday.Kyle Harris, a sophomore, said he and Ms. Fisher had been close since they were children. She loved art and music, he said, and would show him photos of artwork she liked when they rode the bus to school together.\u201cShe stood up to bullies for me when we were little,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s always done what she felt was the right thing to do.\u201d\u201cShana I love you sweet girl,\u201d Ms. Whalen wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t help you.\u201dA Texas pastor, Keenan Smith of Crosby Church, posted the image on Facebook. He said that he had baptized Christian years ago and that Christian had grown up in the church.\u201cTonight we all mourn,\u201d the pastor wrote, \u201cbecause of the senseless unexplainable loss that sweeps through our nation, and certainly our area.\u201dAaron Kyle McLeod, a 15-year-old freshman whose friends called him Kyle, had the sort of cheery kindness about him that crosses generational lines. Other teenagers saw it, but so did adults.Cassandra Garza, 16, had played tennis with him. He was \u201cso sweet, so considerate,\u201d she said.Kyle\u2019s next-door neighbor Harry Monych, a retired newspaper editor and publisher, said Kyle was always quick with a wide smile.\u201cI always saw him get off the bus every day, and I\u2019d see him wave at us,\u201d Mr. Monych said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great kid, a very friendly person.\u201dA multicolored bouquet and a cluster of red, white and blue flowers sat on the sidewalk outside Kyle\u2019s house over the weekend, along with two candles.Glenda Ann Perkins was a substitute teacher at Santa Fe High School \u2014 which meant, in a way, that she was everybody\u2019s teacher.\u201cShe really connected with the kids,\u201d Kyle Harris said. \u201cShe was an absolute angel.\u201dZachary Muehe, another sophomore, said Ms. Perkins was \u201ceveryone\u2019s favorite substitute,\u201d even among students who had graduated.Mr. Muehe was in art class on Friday morning when the shooting began, and he said he saw Ms. Perkins in the classroom next door as he tried to escape.In a statement, Ms. Perkins\u2019s relatives offered advice they said she would have wanted to give in this moment. \u201cWe know Ann would want the students and faculty of Santa Fe High School, to whom she lovingly dedicated so much of her time, to remember to keep their hearts open, to discuss their feelings with family members, friends, and counselors in order to successfully conquer this tragedy.\u201dFamily and friends called Angelique Ramirez compassionate and funny, a loving older sister with a contagious smile.\u201cWith a broken heart and a soul that just can\u2019t process all this right now, I have to announce my niece was one of the fatalities,\u201d her aunt, Sylvia Pritchett, wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cPlease keep all the families in your thoughts, and hug your children tightly.\u201dSabika Sheikh, 17, was supposed to return home to Pakistan in a matter of weeks. After months at Santa Fe High School as part of an exchange program sponsored by the State Department, Sabika had asked her mother to cook her favorite meal when she was to get back on June 9. She had asked her younger brother, Ali, to straighten up her room for her arrival. She had spoken to her younger sister on the telephone just hours before the shooting started.\u201cShe was thinking big, at such a young age,\u201d her father, Abdul Aziz Sheikh, said from his home in Karachi. \u201cSabika was a very talented and obedient child.\u201dHe said he learned of his daughter\u2019s death after seeing news reports and trying \u2014 again and again \u2014 to dial and text his daughter\u2019s telephone. \u201cThere was nothing I heard back from her,\u201d he said.Mr. Sheikh eventually heard from exchange program leaders that his daughter had died in the shooting. He called on American officials to enact stronger gun regulations, and said he hoped no other family would have to experience such pain.\u201cI knew the pain of losing a child,\u201d he said, \u201cand pray to God, no parent would go through this situation.\u201d\u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with Sabika\u2019s family and friends,\u201d the ambassador, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, said.\u201cAs an exchange student, Sabika was a youth ambassador, a bridge between our peoples and cultures,\u201d Mr. Hale said on Facebook on Saturday. \u201cAll of us at the U.S. Mission in Pakistan are devastated by and mourn her loss. We will honor her memory.\u201dAt 17 years old, Christopher Stone was the baby of the family, the youngest of three siblings. But he still played the role of protector to his sisters, Angelica and Mercedez, as if he were the oldest, said his father, who is also named Christopher.\u201cBeing a brother was his best job,\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cHe was always there if someone needed someone to listen or some cheering up.\u201dChris was adventurous beyond his years, the life of the party, up for any thrill. He hiked mountains in Colorado. Zip-lined in Alabama. Parasailed in Mexico.He was a football player for Santa Fe High School. Not the biggest guy on the team, his father said, \u201cbut he had lots of heart.\u201dOn Twitter, Chris\u2019s friends mourned his death, remembering his easy charm and happy nature. At a quincea\u00f1era, one friend wrote, Chris danced up a storm. \u201cWe both had two left feet,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou were always smiling.\u201dMs. Tisdale, a teacher, was a member of Anchor Bible Baptist Church in Pharr, Tex., her family said.Mr. Tisdale, her brother-in-law, asked friends to pray for Ms. Tisdale\u2019s husband, the Rev. William Recie Tisdale, and their children.\u201cWe never know when our death will come,\u201d he wrote.Rhonda Hart wrote on Facebook that her daughter, Kimberly Vaughan, was one of the victims, a student in first-period art class.She hashtagged her message with #fightforkim and #oneof10.\u201cFolks \u2014 call your damn senators. Call your congressmen,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need GUN CONTROL. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR KIDS.\u201dJacey Fortin, Susan C.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The yield on the 10-year is back above 3 percent.\u2022 Apple\u2019s Tim Cook talks tariffs, taxes, immigration and Apple Music\u2022 What gun control advocates could do with Remington.\u2022 Uber changes its policies on mandatory arbitration and sexual misconduct cases.\u2022 What\u2019s next in CBS\u2019s war with Shari Redstone.The world is more indebted than perhaps it has ever been \u2013 and now a new tool makes it easier to track the borrowing habits of governments, companies and households around the globe.In 2016, global debt totaled $164 trillion, which was equivalent to 225 percent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product, according to the I.M.F. In 2009, global debt was 213 percent of G.D.P.We used the I.M.F. database to measure the change in debt levels at six countries from 2006 until 2016, and then, using other I.M.F. statistics, we looked at their average G.D.P. growth in that decade. Notably, average growth in that period was slower than in the preceding 10 years, sometimes by a lot. The slowdowns were no doubt largely due to the negative impact of the financial crisis. But this exercise may also show that the added debt has failed to sufficiently stimulate the economies \u2013 and problems may lie ahead.\u2014 Peter EavisMore from Katherine Peralta, Rick Rothacker, Jourdan Rodrigue and Joseph Person of the Observer:Tepper, 60, is the richest of the known bidders who sought to buy the Panthers, with a net worth of $11 billion, according to Forbes. He\u2019s also the only known bidder already vetted by the NFL, as he is part-owner of his hometown team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.Several key details about Tepper\u2019s deal remain unknown, including whether he will have any minority partners, what he plans to do with Bank of America Stadium and permanent seal license (PSL) owners, whether he will move to Charlotte and what his staffing plans are. A spokesman for Tepper declined to comment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhile AT&T is trying to buy Time Warner, its biggest rival is pursuing a different path \u2014 a strategy Verizon is apparently sticking with despite flirting with CBS and 21st Century Fox.Here\u2019s what Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Lowell McAdam, told David Faber of CNBC on Tuesday morning:Look, I can just say that we have looked at these assets over the period of time. We\u2019ve made the decision that digital is the way for us to go. We have no interest in a linear content company.The contextMs. Redstone told the C.E.O. of a potential acquirer of CBS that he should not make such an offer, thereby depriving CBS stockholders of a potentially value-enhancing opportunity that the board or the special committee should have been free to evaluate.Verizon was also said to have been sniffing around Fox assets at the same time that Walt Disney and Comcast were, though it quickly dropped out.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond rose to its highest level in seven years, throwing the recent stock market rally in doubt.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are down 0.7 percent in recent trading. If the Dow finishes down, it would end an eight-session rally that was its longest since September.The yield on the 10-year Treasury recently hit 3.06 percent. The yield first surpassed 3 percent last month.With interest rates at historic lows in recent years, investors pushed into riskier assets like stocks in search of better returns. The concern for investors is that higher yields could make riskier assets like stocks less attractive.As the gun maker nears the end of its bankruptcy proceedings, Andrew asks if some investor could work with its creditors to buy the company \u2014 and turn it into an exemplar of safer firearms policies.What would happen, for instance, if a consortium were to come together so that the banks offered the buyer a below-market loan, giving a socially responsible investor the advantage of a lower cost of capital? What would happen if one of the big retail chains like Walmart and Dick\u2019s \u2014 both of which have already established that they only want to sell guns in a responsible way \u2014 were to guarantee distribution, sales and marketing support?The challenge: Who would have the courage to stand up to the N.R.A. and pro-gun government officials?We saw Bill and Melinda Gates, Ray Dalio, Marc Benioff, Oprah Winfrey, Jerry Seinfeld, Steve Cohen and Bill Ackman.More from Amanda Gordon of Bloomberg:Jennifer Lopez sang \u201cJenny from the Block,\u201d an anthem about not forgetting one\u2019s humble origins, after taking off a plush white coat, and [Paul Tudor] Jones, in his Robin Hood get-up, crooned \u201cHe Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother,\u201d by the Hollies. The lyrics are about treating \u201canyone that holds their hand out for help like they\u2019re family,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think of poor people as the others, they can never be your sister or your brother.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 The company won\u2019t require arbitration for claims of sexual assault or harassment by riders, drivers or employees.\u2022 Any settlements won\u2019t limit what people can say about their experience.The context: CBS and Viacom had been making progress in merger negotiations. But they were still far apart on management of the combined company.Tom Rogers, the chairman of the mobile sports betting start-up WinView (and former TiVo C.E.O.), told Michael that broadcasters like ESPN could use online betting to bolster falling ratings:Those players are the ones hurting and are dealing with declining metrics. This provides a possible opportunity. We\u2019ll be talking with them.For a firm which likes to clear out its bottom 5 percent of performers annually, Goldman seemed strangely wedded to its underperforming senior partners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lamb Stew, Now Lighter and Brighter", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenSometimes making dinner is an exercise in spontaneity. You may have certain ingredients on hand and a general notion of the outcome, but not necessarily a plan for getting there.That\u2019s part of the fun of cooking: leaving room for spur-of-the-moment ideas, or even a shift in direction.What I really wanted, though, was something brothy and stewlike. I appreciate soups, stews and braises year-round, but warmer weather calls for a lighter approach.I cut the lamb into rough 3-inch chunks, seasoned them well and put them into a soup pot with a cup of dried chickpeas I had soaked the day before. I stuck some cloves into a couple of onion halves, added them to the pot, and then covered the meat with water and simmered it for an hour or so, until completely tender.I could have stopped right there, so succulent were the meat and chickpeas, so flavorful the broth they produced. It would have been a fine meal, but it would be even better with lots of vegetables. And my market bag was bulging with leeks, green garlic shoots and glorious colorful chard, fat yellow carrots and fava beans.So, in a separate pot, I softened the leeks in olive oil, let the garlic shoots sizzle, splashed in some broth and instructed the carrots to braise themselves. Then I added a pound of chopped chard leaves, another ladle of broth and some salt. Stirring with a large wooden spoon helped wilt the greens. Finally, I tossed in the fava beans, turned off the heat and kept everything in the pot to meld for a few minutes.On a big platter, I arranged the meat on one side, and the vegetables on the other, along with a healthy sprinkling of roughly chopped mint.

{"Headline": "9 French Fry Styles, Ranked", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJulia Moskin sizes up the field for taste, texture and architecture.There\u2019s no time of year that isn\u2019t good for French fries, but summer is the best. On the boardwalk, at a county fair and on road trips, where they\u2019re the best thing to eat while driving, one hand in the paper cup, other hand on the wheel. They\u2019re the best thing when you\u2019re chilled to the core and starving because you stayed in the lake or the ocean too long.They\u2019re the best hot and crispy counterpoint to squishy lobster rolls, to frozen lemonade, to steamers. French fries, like soft ice cream, are not for eating In. You have them when you\u2019re Out. And in the summer, Out is where you want to be. (Note that the French-fry family includes only deep-fried potatoes. Home fries are not French fries.)All fried, no potato. This is a sneaky mouthful of hot hay, self-identifying as \u201cfries\u201d but lacking the starchy potato goodness of an actual French fry. You may as well go get a funnel cake.At the opposite end of the pendulum swing, steak fries are too much potato, not enough crunch. They are an unholy union of baked potato and French fry, with the most unfortunate qualities of each.Long before spiralizers, there was the curly fry, or Suzi-Q, a fry that goes on way too long. Fries should be eaten in bites, not lowered into the mouth like a drone payload. Once upon a time, they were cut fresh and cooked plain, but now they usually sport an orange dust of paprika, cayenne, onion and garlic powders. The only reasons to eat them: Either you eat regular French fries often enough to get sick of them (in which case, be careful), or you\u2019re under 12.The lattice pattern makes them both crisp and clingy, with just the right balance of potato and crunch for breakfast. (I like them as a base for sunny-side-up eggs.) And because you can eat them with a fork, waffle fries are prime real estate for add-ons like pulled pork and melted cheese, or cheese curds and gravy, or minced herbs and grated Parmesan if you are into that sort of thing. (Sprinkling garnishes on regular French fries is a fool\u2019s errand; they slide right off.)Cue the white paper cone and springy metal holder. Euro-style frites are usually fried twice for maximum crispness. The ideal restaurant fry, these are what you want to soak up the dregs of a hanger steak or a pot of mussels, preferably eaten outdoors with les pieds dans le sable (toes in the sand, a French term used for beachside restaurants). They are cut \u215c- to \u00bd-inch thick, have an evenly medium-brown exterior and enough fluffy starch inside to taste definitively of potato.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Czech Brewer Mocks #MeToo, Calling It a \u2018Pathological Campaign\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA social media posting by a major Czech brewery that appeared to mock the #MeToo movement has prompted strong reactions, drawing praise, criticism and some soul-searching on sexism in this former communist republic.The Facebook post by the Bernard Brewery in Humpolec, about an hour\u2019s journey from Prague, features the likeness of a nearly toothless old woman with the hashtag #MeToo superimposed in white. \u201cThe world\u2019s gone crazy,\u201d reads the Czech-language text on the post, which is also emblazoned with the brewery\u2019s logo. \u201cBrace yourselves.\u201dA Czech nongovernmental group, Nesehnuti, holds an annual vote called \u201cSexist Piggy\u201d to choose the most sexist advertisement of the year. Petra Havlikova, who coordinates the vote, said Bernard was a regular nominee.The brewery\u2019s owner, Stanislav Bernard, defended the Facebook post, calling #MeToo a \u201cpathological campaign\u201d that bordered on hysteria. \u201cThe whole campaign has one major problem,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201c \u2018Innocent until proven guilty\u2019 is ignored.\u201d That reminded him of the communist era, he said.\u201cIf we continue like this,\u201d he added, \u201cwe may find ourselves in a situation where a guy will be scared to ask a girl out for a coffee and tell her that she looks beautiful.\u201dSo far, the Czech public reaction on Facebook has been overwhelmingly supportive of Bernard\u2019s posting. The top-rated comment was by a woman who wrote that she appreciated what she called Bernard\u2019s sense of humor.\u201cSexual harassment is something I, too, have of course experienced,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut I took care of it with the party in question right away.\u201dThrough its Facebook page, the brewery responded to several users\u2019 reactions, saying that its stance was to sympathize with the \u201creal\u201d victims, while also suggesting that there may be \u201cvarious reasons\u201d a woman would participate in the #MeToo campaign.\u201cEven if the accusation isn\u2019t necessarily well-founded, it can ruin a person\u2019s life. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t like the campaign and decided to be against it,\u201d one response from the Bernard account reads.Bernard has routinely reacted to criticism by publishing ads that are even more provocative, Ms. Havlikova said. After objections last spring to an advertising campaign that used scantily clad women to portray different styles of beer, the company produced a \u201cfeminist edition\u201d in which the women\u2019s faces were replaced with Mr. Bernard\u2019s own.Such advertising may remind many Czechs of the 1990s, when highly sexualized imagery proliferated after the fall of communism. Helena Skalova, the director of the Prague-based nonprofit organization Gender Studies, remembers visiting her mother at work as a young girl in the early \u201990s and seeing pictures of naked women on the walls.\u201cAfter the fall of the previous regime, naked images were among things we swiftly imported from the West,\u201d Ms. Skalova said. \u201cIt was very much in vogue and seen as progress.\u201dThe communist system left Czechs with \u201ca very specific situation\u201d on women\u2019s rights, Ms. Skalova said. \u201cWomen here are quite emancipated, meaning in terms of economic activity: It\u2019s normal for a Czech woman to work.\u201d However, she said, it\u2019s also normal for child care and household matters to be a woman\u2019s responsibility on top of those she may already have at work.Such attitudes seem to be reflected in recent polling data. The Eurobarometer survey, which assesses social attitudes across the European Union, found in 2017 that more than three-quarters of Czechs believe the most important role of a woman is to take care of her home and family. In the same survey, the Czech Republic was found to have Europe\u2019s second-widest gender pay gap.\u201cThe average Czech woman knows nothing of feminism,\u201d said Ms. Skalova. \u201cShe lacks the sensitivity to see what consequence tolerating such advertising might have. She does not admit to or see the limits it poses in other areas of life, such as equal conditions in the workplace.\u201dMs. Skalova said that in general, Czechs were willing to support economic equality between men and women. When it came to feminism and movements like #MeToo, however, most found the topics disagreeable.Mr. Bernard is one of those people.\u201cWith the way this campaign is being led we are on our way to destroying any grain of spontaneity between men and women,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a symptom of a sick society.\u201dHana de Goeij contributed reporting from Prague.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Lost\u2019 Immigrant Children? That\u2019s a Different Story", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis, in and of itself, was not that unusual. What was unusual was that the article had been published nearly a month before. Still, I brushed it aside and didn\u2019t think about it again until I got to work. An editor there told me it had been seen hundreds of thousands of times.It was a month-old story! In my New York Times career, I have seen a stray retweet of a story a month later, or an email from a reader thanking me or to heap on belated criticism. But I had never seen a resurrection quite like this. Interest in my article was revived by a misunderstanding: It was read as evidence that children had arrived at the border with their parents, were separated from them by the Department of Homeland Security and then lost in government bureaucracy. It was a case of something I and other reporters often learn the hard way: Articles have a way of taking on a life of their own.So what happened? The report had been about the federal government\u2019s inability to locate nearly 1,500 children who had been placed with sponsors after the kids showed up alone at the border. But somehow, that story had been conflated with another: the Trump administration\u2019s new \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy at the border intended to deter new migrants with the threat of jail sentences. Migrant parents who are referred for criminal prosecution will be separated from their children.It all began in April, with a tip from a source that government officials were going to testify before a Senate homeland security subcommittee that they were unable to say with any degree of certainty the location of nearly 1,500 migrant children who had been placed with sponsors.Children who show up at the border alone are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement. That had hit home for Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. His staff had investigated the placement of migrant children with sponsors in 2016 and found that several had been placed with people who forced them to work on an egg farm in his state. Mr. Portman argued that the government has a responsibility to keep track of the children so that they are not abused or trafficked. The government argued that once it releases the children to a sponsor, its responsibility ends. We posted my article hours before a hearing on the matter. Afterward, I updated it to include questions and comments from the senators and testimony from witnesses. Then I moved on. That is, until last weekend.In this case, I\u2019m not sure what happened. But here\u2019s an educated guess: Several days before my story ran, my colleague Caitlin Dickerson discovered that the Trump administration had taken more than 700 children from adults claiming to be their parents since October, including more than 100 children under the age of 4. The Department of Homeland Security initially denied those numbers, but later confirmed them.The mix-up, however, had an unexpected consequence: The coverage did force the Trump administration to address several issues surrounding its handling of migrant children. Senior officials held a call with reporters not only to address the separation of children from parents and the government\u2019s responsibility for them afterward; they also had to explain, or at least try to, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet putting the blame for the problem on a law that does not exist. When my original article ran, there was little to no comment from officials other than congressional testimony.In the end, I\u2019m not sure what could have been done to prevent a situation like this. But the ordeal did emphasize one thing: the value of digging as deeply as possible for the facts. I will continue to report on stories like this. For a hot-button topic like immigration, that\u2019s all I can do.Advertisement"}

But onboard computers will increasingly augment drivers and take over city driving.

Perhaps it would set his mind at ease to know a little more about the House of Windsor and the British aristocracy in general. I\u2019m sure they can seem strange and intimidating from a distance. For those of us who have observed them for longer, however, there is not only nothing to be afraid of \u2014 there is plenty to be amused at.And Ms. Markle\u2019s mother, Doria Ragland, will not be the first royal mother-in-law to have worked as a flight attendant. The Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s mother, Carole Middleton, was also a flight attendant \u2014 reportedly given the nickname of \u201cDoors to Manual\u201d by rude young aristocrats. If Ms. Ragland is ever called the same, she and Carole Middleton can commiserate with each other and, ideally, fight back with shoes.Isabella, the wife of Edward II and, many believe, a conspirator in his murder, was probably the worst. Anne of Cleves, the fourth wife of Henry VIII, was considered too ugly to be made love to and was divorced \u2014 by an obese king with a bad leg (no one has suggested it was fair). She is thought by some to have been one of his most successful wives. Caroline, wife of George IV, was accused of adultery and forbidden to attend his coronation at Westminster Abbey, but she went anyway. The doors were barred to her and she died shortly afterward.The British establishment remembers all this and it likes the idea of Ms. Markle, who cannot at this stage be more than an idea. They like her mixed-race heritage because \u201cthe firm,\u201d as the royal family calls itself, must mirror the nation; they like her humanitarian-speak, which sounds good on Twitter, even if the concept of a humanitarian princess is absurd; and they like her real or pretended warmth and wokeness.Mr. Markle can assure the wedding guests that, guided by his bride, Prince Harry will never again wear a swastika armband to a fancy-dress party and that he is a feminist now. No British prince has been called a feminist before, not even as an insult.If Mr. Markle\u2019s doctors give him the all-clear, he should walk his daughter down the aisle. If he insists on trying to impress the royals, he can realistically proceed in one of two ways: He can smile, nod and listen \u2014 he can, essentially, behave like a woman \u2014 or he can play a satirical version of himself for his audience. The Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s uncle, Gary Goldsmith (\u201cUncle G\u201d), who owns a house in Ibiza called La Maison de Bang Bang, chose this path. That might be more successful. It will definitely be more fun to watch.Tanya Gold is a writer for The Spectator.An earlier version of this article misstated where Thomas Markle lives.

{"Headline": "No Luck Finding the Right Nursing Home? Maybe Yelp Can Help", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by The New Old AgeCan you really select a quality nursing home by reading Yelp reviews?There\u2019s a nursing home the next town over from me, for instance. Nine reviewers have given the place both laudatory five-star ratings (\u201cShe has a far greater quality of life than she would have living at home\u201d) and outraged one-star complaints (\u201cThe nursing staff, RN\u2019s and CNA\u2019s are caring but overworked\u201d).Overall, the place gets three stars. It\u2019s a highly flawed measurement, of course. Nine reviewers for a 300-plus-bed facility? Over four years, in an industry known for such sky-high turnover that many of the hands-on staff have undoubtedly left since the first online critic weighed in? Reviewers can deplore the food, but can they know how often residents fall?Yet gerontologists at the University of Southern California have been looking into Yelp nursing home reviews and think they make a useful addition to the homework any prospective resident or family member needs to undertake.\u201cWe had a growing sense of how disappointing those measures have been,\u201d Dr. Rahman said of Nursing Home Compare. \u201cAfter 20 years and all the money spent to create it, it\u2019s become a marketing tool. But most people don\u2019t realize how little it measures. It\u2019s garbage in and garbage out.\u201dA primer: Nursing Home Compare made its online debut in 1998 and added the starred ranking system in 2009, after a senator complained at a congressional hearing that it was easier to shop for a washing machine than a nursing home.The site contains a trove of information about nursing homes, for those willing to click through to findings like hours of staff time per resident per day, deficiencies discovered during the most recent inspections, and how many residents have bedsores and other indications of poor care. This year, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services anticipates that the tool will be used 2.4 million times.Those on-site inspections, which Medicare requires every 12 to 15 months, constitute a key component of the ratings. But the two other categories contributing to the ratings \u2014 staffing and quality measures \u2014 are reported by the homes themselves. Critics have charged for years that the metrics are untrustworthy and prone to manipulation.\u201cI would never use it for quality measures because I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said John Schnelle, director of the Center for Quality Aging at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cI think they\u2019re distorted.\u201dDr. Schnelle, note, serves on the expert panel that advises C.M.S. on its nursing home rating system.Researchers also have discovered that even if the star ratings were accurate, they don\u2019t bear much relationship to how residents and families feel about these facilities.In Ohio, which conducts its own statewide nursing home surveys, \u201cplenty of times residents really liked a facility with a low star rating, and vice versa,\u201d said Robert Applebaum, a gerontologist at Miami University in Ohio.\u201cIt excludes the most important element,\u201d Dr. Applebaum said. \u201cThe problem is, it\u2019s really expensive to do. Collecting data from families and residents is no small task if you do it systematically.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not measuring the same things,\u201d Dr. Rahman said. In fact, they rather complement one another.You wouldn\u2019t want to rely too much on Yelp and other online platforms. Relatively few nursing homes, assisted living facilities and retirement communities have Yelp reviews at all. The 51 California nursing homes in Dr. Rahman\u2019s study had garnered just five reviews on average \u2014 a tiny, probably unrepresentative sample.And the great majority were polarized \u2014 either five-star reviews or one star. \u201cNursing homes inspire a lot of emotion,\u201d Dr. Rahman said.That bimodal response isn\u2019t typical in most Yelp categories, but \u201cyou\u2019d expect that to normalize over time\u201d as more users post reviews, said Luther Lowe, the company\u2019s senior vice president for public policy.For now, only 7 percent of Yelp\u2019s roughly 150 million total reviews concern health care: doctors, dentists, hospitals, acupuncturists and reiki practitioners, along with assisted living and nursing homes.Now, Yelp users see a small ProPublica box reporting each nursing home\u2019s size, how many serious deficiencies showed up on its most recent inspections, fines levied and whether the facility is so troubled that C.M.S. has suspended payments. The box also identifies \u201cspecial focus\u201d facilities flagged for serious quality problems.Nursing Home Compare is also making changes. Most importantly, C.M.S. now requires nursing homes to submit timecards quarterly, a more auditable staffing measure than annual self-reporting. \u201cA big improvement,\u201d Dr. Schnelle said.So experts advise starting your investigation online, using Yelp and other consumer reviews \u2014 and Nursing Home Compare and Nursing Home Inspect, and talking to friends and relatives who\u2019ve had recent experience with local facilities.Then, inescapably, you\u2019ve got to show up at the nursing home, walk around, talk to residents and family and staff, ask a zillion questions. Then, go back and do it again.Still, online consumer reviews can become part of the effort, and the more we post, the more useful they\u2019ll become.\u201cYou want to use as many sources as you can,\u201d Dr. Applebaum said. \u201cEverybody has a different piece of the elephant to touch.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anti-Gun Backlash From School Shooting? Probably Not in Texas", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTA FE, Tex. \u2014 One mile from the scene of the shooting that left 10 people dead at her school, Monica Bracknell, a senior at Santa Fe High School, approached Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in the lobby of Arcadia First Baptist Church here Sunday morning.Her message was simple: The violence was not \u201ca political issue,\u201d she told Mr. Abbott, explaining to reporters afterward that schools needed to be safer but restricting the availability of guns was not the way to achieve it.After the February rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., students there helped ignite the most successful push for action on gun control in decades in that state. There is little indication of anything similar in Texas, a place where guns are hard-wired into the state\u2019s psyche, Republicans control virtually all the levers of power, and where the victims of Friday\u2019s rampage in a conservative rural area are showing little of the anti-gun fervor that followed the Parkland shooting in a more diverse, suburban one.In the wake of the tragedy, gun issues are likely to take on a new urgency in a few Texas political races, including Republican congressional districts that Democrats are trying to flip, but the debate is far more muted and dominated by support for gun rights than it had been in Florida post-Parkland.\u201cFlorida is a swing state,\u201d said Calvin Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \u201cYou start with the understanding that Florida is a purple state in which Democrats and Republicans are both competitive. Texas is a deep-red state, in which the Republican Party is in complete and total control. They don\u2019t feel that partisan electoral heat.\u201dWhat played out instead was a reminder, as happened after 26 people were killed in a church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Tex., in November, that major gun violence often does not produce a backlash against guns. The differences in how the issue has played out in Texas and Florida illustrate just how hard it can be to establish a consensus on gun issues in America. For gun control advocates, what works in one part of the country does not work in others, even down to the vocabulary used. Some pro-gun Texans question the phrase \u201cgun violence\u201d and avoid using it, saying it is as arbitrary as talking about knife violence.\u201cPeople like to say on Facebook, \u2018Oh, you shouldn\u2019t be able to buy a gun,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bracknell told reporters at the church on Sunday, two days after police said a 17-year-old student used a shotgun and handgun, apparently belonging to his father, to kill 10 people, including a substitute teacher, Glenda Ann Perkins, whom Ms. Bracknell had known for years. \u201cThat kid was 17. He\u2019s not able to buy a gun anyway. It\u2019s not like a gun-law issue. This kid is obviously mentally unstable and he knew that there were flaws in the school system to get into the rooms.\u201dThe differences between the fallout from the Florida and the Texas shootings begins with the communities where they occurred.In Florida, parents and students put emotional and public political pressure on lawmakers, and legislators responded just three weeks after the Parkland massacre. The Republican governor of Florida, Rick Scott, signed into law several measures, including raising the minimum age and adding a waiting period to purchase a gun. In Texas, there is no widespread vocal pressure and activism from the families and students themselves. Many Santa Fe students\u2019 views on guns track Ms. Bracknell\u2019s.Hours after the shooting on Friday at a prayer vigil, Madilyn Williams, an 18-year-old senior, tearfully told Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, how she and a friend had fled their astronomy class and rushed to a gas station when the shooting started.While some students from Parkland had angrily confronted their pro-gun elected representatives after their school was shot up, Ms. Williams quietly told a nodding Mr. Cruz that she wanted her teachers to be armed. It was a refrain in the candlelit park that night: Stricter gun control laws would not have prevented the shooting, several students said. But they believed that arming qualified teachers could have.\u201cIf one of the teachers had a gun, we would have been a lot better off,\u201d Ms. Williams said in an interview.Sid Miller, the state\u2019s Republican agriculture commissioner and a former rodeo roping champion, said he wanted to apply \u201ca little cowboy logic\u201d to the gun debate. While Texas may be receptive to certain measures, such as strengthening security in schools, Mr. Miller said, officials will continue to resist other policies championed by national gun control advocates.\u201cAt this stage, any stricter gun control laws passing in Texas, that\u2019s just not going to happen,\u201d said Mr. Miller, a rancher who has a state-issued handgun license and whose combative social media commentary has outraged Democrats. \u201cYou can\u2019t protect yourself by taking guns away from the good people.\u201dThere are signs of gun control support in Santa Fe. Students held a small post-Parkland march in February. On Sunday outside the school, near where Mr. Abbott laid flowers in memory of the victims, one handwritten sign read, \u201cMore peace and love and less guns in this world.\u201dTyler Cruz, 18, a senior, said he would support any gun control movement that arises at his school now, but he knows his classmates will be divided. \u201cOur community is really pro-gun here,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI\u2019m pro-gun, but I\u2019m not. I get the Second Amendment, but I just believe it\u2019s gotten too far with all this happening.\u201dMr. Cruz has drawn support from the shooting survivors in Parkland and has been messaging with four of them on Twitter.Republican leaders in Texas, including Mr. Abbott and Mr. Cruz, have been criticized by Democrats for failing to act in response to the Santa Fe shooting, accusations they dispute. Instead, they and gun advocates nationally talk about a need to act \u2014 but not by restricting guns.Since the shooting, gun rights advocates have called for arming teachers, redesigning school buildings and promoting safer gun storage at home to keep firearms out of the hands of children and teenagers.Mr. Abbott has proposed holding round-table discussions, saying he wanted to work on laws that will protect Second Amendment rights while making schools safer. Oliver North, the incoming president of the National Rifle Association, Sunday on Fox News blamed mass shootings on violent movies and overuse of psychiatric drugs like Ritalin.The Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, has called for reducing the number of entrances and exits at schools. On the CNN program \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Mr. Patrick on Sunday also called on parents to strictly control their guns to keep them out of the hands of children, but he stopped short of calling for specific legislation mandating that.Santa Fe is a largely rural town in a part of southeast Texas that is home to oil refineries and working-class Republicans who own guns and routinely hunt. The town is only about 40 miles southeast of downtown Houston, but it is closer in its political and social culture to Southern-tinged East Texas. At least a handful of Confederate flags fly around town, on trucks, porches and businesses.Polling shows the state\u2019s voters are more split on guns than popular culture might indicate. According to an October poll by the University of Texas and The Texas Tribune, more than half of the registered voters surveyed said gun control laws should be stricter. Only 13 percent said the laws should be less strict than they are now, and 31 percent would prefer to leave current gun laws unchanged.But, for now, the pro-gun forces are firmly in control, and deeply conservative voices are not hard to find.As Mr. Patrick greeted parishioners at Arcadia First Baptist Church on Sunday morning, he got an enthusiastic greeting from Robert Ross, 69, who has lived in Santa Fe all his life and has a nephew who once played football with the gunman. Mr. Ross said he believed the solution to school violence was not gun control, but faith. He blamed the shooting on what he called a cultural decay exemplified by legal abortion, gay marriage and the separation of church and state.\u201cWe wonder why this is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cSatan\u2019s right there. He\u2019s always putting his foot in everything.\u201dManny Fernandez and Jack Healy reported from Santa Fe, Tex., and Dave Montgomery from Austin, Tex.

{"Headline": "2016 Dry German Rieslings: Graceful, Resonant, Delicious", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesPeople have complained forever about the complexity of German wine labels. Aside from the unfamiliarity of the language, the terminology is used almost nowhere else and does not always make intuitive sense.Paradoxically, the traditional labels have a precision to them that, if you take the time to learn the lingo, communicates almost exactly what is in the bottle. But that did not prevent complaints.So over the years, the German wine authorities and individual producers have tried to simplify things. Many producers now either use brand names for their moderately priced bottles, which cuts through the jargon, or at least have eliminated the gothic fonts that made labels hard to decipher even for those who were able to translate the meaning.The rise of dry riesling in Germany over the last 20 years gave the authorities an additional incentive to make wine labels friendlier to the public. Rather than seize this chance, the Germans appear to have made their labeling rules even more confusing.It used to be that those seeking dry German rieslings needed to keep an eye out for the word \u201ctrocken,\u201d which means dry. But many producers, not without good reason, wanted to make distinctions between the quality of vineyard sites, so they created a Burgundy-inspired overlay that might at least suggest a geographical hierarchy for dry wines.The problem is, the newer terminology is not consistent through all German regions. Many producers who belong to certain growers\u2019 associations have adopted the term \u201cgrosses gew\u00e4chs\u201d to indicate dry wines from individual vineyards deemed exceptional. But that phrase is not employed in the Rheingau region, where the preferred term is \u201cerstes gew\u00e4chs.\u201dMeanwhile, erstes gew\u00e4chs should not be confused with \u201cerste lage,\u201d which indicates wines from sites that aspire to grosses gew\u00e4chs status but have yet to earn the designation. Nor should grosses gew\u00e4chs be confused with \u201cgrosse lage,\u201d indicating wines from top sites that are not dry. And definitely don\u2019t confuse grosse lage with grosslage, an old term meaning that a wine comes from several vineyards in a particular town rather than one vineyard, or einzellage.Not surprisingly, many producers choose to use the simpler trocken designation.Perhaps it is unfair sport to remark on the confusing nature of German wine labels. But I mention it because the wine panel recently tasted 20 bottles of dry German riesling from the largely excellent 2016 vintage. The tasting was blind, which spared us from the daunting label verbiage. But anybody examining the list of our 10 favorites will require a decoding device.Although Germany\u2019s sweet rieslings are singular and among the treasures of the wine world, its dry rieslings can be equally wonderful and are likewise unlike those from anywhere else.If I can speak generally about dry German rieslings, which can vary considerably depending on which region they come from, they are often far more delicate in texture than the others, precise and jewel-like rather than rich.By many accounts, difficult weather made the 2016 vintage tough to manage for many growers, but it produced wines of exceptional balance that amplify many of the best traits of dry German rieslings. The wines we liked best were deep and profoundly mineral, while also resonant and refreshing.What do I mean by resonant? These are wines that feel three-dimensional in the mouth. They have length \u2014 their flavors proceed in a linear fashion and last long after you swallow \u2014 and depth, which suggests the sort of complexity that makes you want to taste the wine again and again in an effort to unravel the flavors.But these are also young wines, and the more ambitious among them will benefit from aging five to 10 years to allow these complexities to uncoil while mellowing the rippling acidity. Sabra wondered whether some of them would ever relax, and suggested that maybe 20 years would do it. I don\u2019t think it will take that long, but the best of these wines are well worth giving some time.Not all of the wines were exceptional, however. Balance was sometimes an issue. We rejected some wines that were overbearingly acidic \u2014 punishingly tart and lacking charm. That\u2019s an old complaint about dry German rieslings, and one I was surprised to find might still have legitimacy.It\u2019s important to emphasize that this was a fragmentary tasting, simply a cross-section of the 2016 vintage. We did not have many bottles from the Nahe region, where the \u201916s have been especially lauded; and in a land of many small producers, you can look well beyond our top 10 to find wonderful bottles.Just know that they are well worth seeking out. And, if you are uncertain about which words indicate that a wine is dry beyond the all-purpose trocken, the alcohol level is often a dead giveaway. The sweet wines, in which all the sugar in the juice was not converted to alcohol in fermentation, are usually less than 10 percent alcohol. These dry bottles were 11.5 to 13 percent.Lively and multidimensional, with complex aromas and flavors of spices, citrus and earth.

{"Headline": "Free Cash to Fight Income Inequality? California City Is First in U.S. to Try", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "Long plagued by poverty and desperation, Stockton, Calif., is testing universal basic income as a means of improving the lives of its residents.Supported bySTOCKTON, Calif. \u2014 This town in California\u2019s Central Valley has long functioned as a display case for wrenching troubles afflicting American life: The housing bust that turned Stockton into an epicenter of a national foreclosure disaster and plunged the city into bankruptcy. The homeless people clustered in tents along the railroad tracks. Boarded-up storefronts on cracked sidewalks. Gang violence.Now, Stockton hopes to make itself an exhibition ground for elevated fortunes through a simple yet unorthodox experiment. It is readying plans to deliver $500 a month in donated cash to perhaps 100 local families, no strings attached. The trial could start as soon as the fall and continue for about two years.As the first American city to test so-called universal basic income, Stockton will watch what happens next. So will governments and social scientists around the world as they explore how to share the bounty of capitalism more broadly at a time of rising economic inequality.Will single mothers use their cash to pay for child care so they can attend college? Will people confronting choices between buying school supplies or paying their electric bills gain a measure of security? Will families add healthier food to their diets?Basic income is a term that gets thrown around loosely, but the gist is that the government distributes cash universally. As the logic runs, if everyone gets money \u2014 rich and poor, the employed and the jobless \u2014 it removes the stigma of traditional welfare schemes while ensuring sustenance for all.That a city in California has made itself a venue for the idea seems no accident. The state has long tried fresh approaches to governance. Ahead of the state\u2019s political primaries in June, much of the conversation has centered on concerns about economic inequality.In various guises, the idea has captivated activists and intellectuals for centuries. In the 1500s, Thomas More\u2019s novel \u201cUtopia\u201d advanced the suggestion that thieves would be better deterred by public assistance than fear of a death sentence.In more modern times, Milton Friedman, darling of laissez-faire economics, embraced the idea of negative income taxes that put cash in the hands of the poorest people. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. advocated \u201cthe guaranteed income.\u201dDr. King\u2019s legacy has currency in Stockton, which is now led by a history-making mayor, Michael Tubbs. At 27, he is the youngest mayor of a sizable American city, and the first African-American to hold the job here.Mr. Tubbs grew up in South Stockton, where payday lenders and pawn shops exploit the desperation of working poor people. His father was in prison for gang-related crime. His mother worked in medical customer service and struggled to pay bills, relying on welfare and food stamps.His mother kept him inside, his nose in his school books, fearful of the pitfalls beyond the door.He recalls standing at the mailbox tearing open a college acceptance letter while police cars massed down the block, lights flashing, as a neighbor\u2019s son was arrested for dealing drugs.Many of the adults around him were juggling multiple jobs, yet still living under the tyranny of unpaid bills.\u201cPeople were working themselves to death,\u201d Mr. Tubbs said. \u201cNot working to live a good life, but working just to survive.\u201dHe enrolled at Stanford University. In his high school yearbook, friends scribbled congratulations for his having \u201cmade it from here.\u201dHe was an intern in President Barack Obama\u2019s White House. After graduating from college in 2012, he taught ethnic studies, government and society at a charter high school while serving on the Stockton City Council.On the same day that President Trump was elected, voters in this city of 300,000 people put Mr. Tubbs in charge.Forged as a supply hub during the Gold Rush of the 19th century, Stockton evolved into a center for migrant workers who toil in the fruit and vegetable farms of California\u2019s Central Valley.By the new millennium, it had become a bedroom community offering affordable homes for people who worked in unaffordable places like San Francisco and Silicon Valley, as far as two hours away.The crash in housing prices played out savagely here. The local unemployment rate reached 19 percent in early 2011. Stockton descended into bankruptcy.As Mr. Tubbs took office, nearly one in four local residents was officially poor. The median household income was about $46,000 \u2014 roughly one-fourth below the national level. Only 17 percent of adults 25 and older had graduated from college. People were perpetually vulnerable to mundane calamities like auto troubles that kept them from getting to work.\u201cPoverty is the biggest issue,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cEverything we deal with stems from that. There\u2019s so many people working incredibly hard, and if life happens, there\u2019s no bottom.\u201dOnce he took office, his staff recommended basic income as a potential means of attacking poverty, one that was starting to gain traction around the world.In contrast to government programs that stipulate how money must be spent, basic income is supposed to deliver regular payments without restrictions. It amounts to a bet that poor people know the most appropriate use for a dollar better than bureaucrats. Rather than filling out forms and waiting to see case workers, people can devote their effort to looking for work, gaining skills or spending time with their children.Still, as the traditional promise of work breaks down, unconventional ideas are emerging from the political margins to gain a serious airing.At a conference in San Francisco last spring, Mr. Tubbs was introduced to Natalie Foster, a co-founder of the Economic Security Project, an advocacy group formed to advance the concept of universal basic income. The project included Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder.Within the Silicon Valley crowd, basic income had become a fashionable idea for addressing collective angst over the social consequences of technology. The masters of innovation were becoming stupendously rich via creations poised to make working people poor, replacing human labor with robots. Basic income was posited as compensation.The Economic Security Project was keen to demonstrate another aspect of basic income \u2014 its potential to help communities facing problems in the here and now. It was shopping for a city that could serve as staging ground.\u201cIt\u2019s important that people see this as possible,\u201d Ms. Foster said. \u201cCities are laboratories of democracy.\u201dStockton was diverse, with more than 40 percent of its residents Hispanic, some 20 percent Asian, and 14 percent African-American. More than half of the working-age people in surrounding San Joaquin County earned the minimum wage. The city was in the hands of a social media-savvy mayor who could help spread the word.Ms. Foster\u2019s group agreed to deliver $1 million for a new project \u2014 SEED, for Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration.The sum was nowhere near enough to finance universal anything. It would not cover the basics of any critical need.Still, it could produce a glimpse of what a guaranteed cash program might look like.The city commissioned artists to paint murals in the center of town, celebrating basic income as the next phase of the civil rights struggle advanced by Dr. King.As city leaders formulate the details of the project, they are wrestling with a foundational question: Are they running a legitimate social science experiment, or engineering a demonstration of basic income\u2019s virtues?The answer directs how they distribute the cash.If it is primarily a display, then only the most responsible people should be given cash. But if it is about science, the money must be dispensed more randomly, with the likelihood that some people will waste it on drugs.At a meeting at City Hall, the SEED project manager Lori Ospina urged that the program be designed to yield valid scientific data. That involves choosing participants on the basis of narrow demographic criteria \u2014 perhaps their age, their race, their income.But that approach could expose the city to charges that the program is not inclusive enough. \u201cThe trolls I\u2019ve been dealing with on social media and in real life have very racialized views of how this is going to work,\u201d Mr. Tubbs said. \u201cAs the first black mayor of this city, it would be very dangerous if the only people to get this were black.\u201dHe wants to select participants who are most likely to spend their money wisely, generating stories of working poor people lifted by extra cash.People like Shay Holliman.As a child, her mother was incarcerated. She was raised by her grandmother, along with nine other children. They crammed into apartments full of cockroaches, moving from state to state to stay ahead of the bill collectors.She had a baby. She worked at McDonald\u2019s, but she lacked reliable child care, making the job impossible. She could not pay rent on her $600 a month welfare check.One night, she found herself walking the Stockton streets, her infant daughter in a carrier against her chest, pulling two suitcases full of everything she owned.Taking shelter with a sister consumed by drug addiction, she fell into a vortex of violence. She served 11 years in prison for killing a man who she said had attacked her sister.She emerged with a problem that confronts many people in Stockton: She was eager to work, yet she was vulnerable to criminal background checks that deny jobs to convicted felons.She worked inside commercial freezers and as a driver. Recently, she took a job at a nonprofit that helps people released from prison set up lives on the outside.\u201cI\u2019m finally living my dream,\u201d she said.In some quarters, the basic income experiment has provoked talk that free money will prompt people to ditch work.\u201cOh, my,\u201d said Ms. Holliman, who still carries credit card debt of more than $500 and does not earn enough money to regularly buy fresh fruit. \u201cWhen you\u2019re struggling, you\u2019re going to rush and pay your bills.\u201dStockton\u2019s trial is meant to deliver examples of that sentiment, challenging the notion that people needing help have not tried hard enough.\u201cIt\u2019s about changing the narrative around who\u2019s deserving,\u201d the mayor said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australian Officer Suspended After Police Car Hits Aboriginal Man", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPERTH, Australia \u2014 A senior sergeant in the Western Australia Police Force was suspended Thursday after an Aboriginal man was struck by a police car in Perth.The move came after the release Thursday of video footage on NITV News showing the man, William Farmer, 18, being closely followed by a female police officer in a yellow jacket as he walked across the road Sunday in a suburban area of south Perth.As she continues to follow him, a white car backs out of a driveway, makes an abrupt turn and hits Mr. Farmer, who collapses in what appears to be a seizure. A male police officer then leaves the car and grabs Mr. Farmer, turning him over.Mr. Farmer had been wanted for questioning over a caller\u2019s complaint of \u201csuspicious activity\u201d in the area, the police statement said. In the police account of the episode, they said that after a scuffle in which one officer was injured, Mr. Farmer fled and was arrested \u201cafter colliding with a police vehicle involved in the search.\u201dThe officer, who was not identified, will be suspended from all operational duty pending the outcome of an investigation by the police force\u2019s internal affairs unit, the police said.The family of the young man is extremely upset, said George Newhouse, a lawyer from the National Justice Project who is representing them. They are considering litigation, he said.Mr. Farmer, who was taken to a hospital for treatment, did not have a previous history of seizures, Mr. Newhouse said, adding that he had been \u201cseriously injured.\u201d\u201cThe WA police have one of the worst track records in this country for discrimination and prejudice against Aboriginal people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe commissioner of police needs to come out with a very clear statement that violence against and harassment of Aboriginal people is not acceptable in his police force.\u201dWest Australia\u2019s police minister, Michelle Roberts, told reporters Tuesday that what happened was \u201cvery disturbing,\u201d and pledged a thorough inquiry.Others said the episode reflected a pattern of police mistreatment.\u201cThis is not a singular incident. It has been going on for a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Eades, chief executive of Ngalla Maya Aboriginal Corporation, adding that if it had not been caught on video, it would have never been made public.\u201cThis is systemic racism, and my people have been bearing the brunt of it, and we are sick of it,\u201d he said.Giovanni Torre reported from Perth, and Isabella Kwai from Sydney, Australia.

{"Headline": "When the Landlord Tries to Break Up With You", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRentersThis winter, Eugenia Forteza and Mimi Klipstine faced a common inconvenience for those living in apartment shares: a departing roommate.\u201cWe were like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a pain.\u2019 We were so comfortable with each other,\u201d said Ms. Forteza, a 28-year-old opera singer who became close friends with Ms. Klipstine, a 25-year-old actress and singer, after moving in two years ago.But while they were dumbfounded that their roommate would want to leave their large and lovely three-bedroom in Washington Heights to move farther uptown, the apartment\u2019s charms made it easy to find someone new, and Ms. Forteza quickly found a college acquaintance to fill the room. There was just one glitch: They hadn\u2019t yet received their renewal lease, usually sent out months in advance.\u201cI just wanted the rent number so I could tell the new girl what her share would be,\u201d said Ms. Forteza, who emailed the management company. \u201cAnd they were like, \u2018Oh, we have to talk on the phone.\u2019\u201d\u201cOn the phone!\u201d Ms. Klipstine said, to add emphasis.The news was ominous: Their apartment was slated for renovation \u2014 it was being reconfigured into a four-bedroom \u2014 and they would have to move out when their lease ended in a month.This, understandably, came as a shock. Not only do many landlords wait to renovate until tenants move out of their own accord, but their housing luck had, up to that point, been so good.First, there was the apartment itself, which Ms. Klipstine and a friend had found after a leaky ceiling necessitated a departure from a cramped three-bedroom a few blocks away. And then there was the fact of their meeting.Ms. Forteza had braced herself for a long and possibly unpleasant apartment hunt as she neared the end of a graduate program in New Jersey. But on her first week of looking she came across a video tour that Ms. Klipstine had posted on Gypsy Housing, a Facebook group where people post room and apartment listings.\u201cI thought, \u2018I like this girl! This girl is so chill,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Forteza, recalling how funny she had found Ms. Klipstine\u2019s ravings about the huge closets and radiator covers. \u201cAnd it was a beautiful apartment in a good location.\u201d\u201cWe were like, \u2018This is too easy!\u2019\u201d Ms. Klipstine said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why when we had to leave, it was so horrifying. And it was out of the blue.\u201dThe management company softened the blow by offering them a choice of two other empty apartments in the building: a three-bedroom on the ground floor or a two-bedroom down the hall. Both had been recently renovated, from a two- and one-bedroom respectively, and had new kitchens. But the generously sized layouts were gone.\u201cThe three-bedroom was terrible,\u201d Ms. Klipstine said. \u201cIt was right on the street, with these tiny bedrooms.\u201d\u201cAnd then we were like, \u2018If we have the opportunity to live together \u2014\u2019\u201d Ms. Forteza said.\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d Ms. Klipstine said, finishing the sentence.They told the management company they would take the two-bedroom, so long as they could keep the same per-person rent of $970 each. The company agreed.They moved into the two-bedroom in March, a process that entailed culling quite a few possessions. They got rid of much of their furniture, though Ms. Forteza\u2019s keyboard and several paintings by Ms. Klipstine\u2019s grandmother made the cut, as did Ms. Forteza\u2019s opera gowns and musical scores, a collection she augmented significantly when she worked at the Juilliard bookstore.That they are both in the performing arts, but not the same performing arts \u2014 Ms. Klipstine performs in plays, musicals and cabarets, but not operas \u2014 makes them ideal roommates. They understand each another\u2019s career challenges, but can offer an outside perspective.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d love to live with another opera singer,\u201d Ms. Forteza said.And as Ms. Klipstine pointed out, being able to find support and a soothing atmosphere at home is important when you are in a stressful calling that involves regularly going on auditions.As for the new apartment, Ms. Forteza admitted that \u201cit was stressful at first, but overall it was a pretty good situation.\u201d\u201cThey could have just said, \u2018We\u2019re not renewing,\u2019 and then we would have had a month to find another place,\u201d she said.Ms. Klipstine confessed that the first week she lived in the new apartment, she doubted her decision, given the tighter quarters.\u201cBut then you set up your stuff, and you\u2019re like, \u2018O.K., this is our place.\u2019\u201dKnow a renter with an interesting story?

{"Headline": "Is Gov. Greitens Truthful? It\u2019s a Question for the Jury, if They Can Seat One", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. LOUIS \u2014 The potential jurors stole curious glances at Gov. Eric Greitens, the defendant, whose famous face usually appeared in glossy campaign ads. They told the courtroom they had already heard about the case before them, picking up scraps about his indictment in break rooms at work, on the Channel 5 news, watching YouTube videos and scrolling through Facebook feeds. Some seemed not to need to hear more.\u201cYou believe Governor Greitens isn\u2019t truthful?\u201d Scott Rosenblum, a lawyer for the governor, asked a prospective juror who said she got her news mostly from local television. \u201cHow long have you held that opinion?\u201d\u201cSince the case has come up,\u201d she answered.Minutes later, she was sent home.For hours on Thursday and Friday, Judge Rex Burlison and two teams of lawyers meticulously questioned St. Louis residents in a search for an impartial jury that had not already decided on the guilt or innocence of their embattled governor. It was no simple task. Publicity may be the highest aspiration of politicians seeking voters; less so, it turns out, for a criminal defendant in search of jurors.Mr. Greitens, whose brief governorship has been consumed with scandal and the threat of impeachment, is to be tried next week on one felony count of invasion of privacy. Prosecutors contend that in 2015, he took an explicit photograph of a woman without her consent; the two were having an extramarital affair. If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison.But finding jurors whom the judge deems suitable promised to stretch on for at least several days. Mr. Greitens\u2019s lawyers repeatedly argued for removing jurors who had formed an opinion about him and might hold a bias that would cloud their judgment. In turn, frustrated prosecutors objected that removing jurors just because they knew about the charges against Mr. Greitens would rule out too many people.Ronald S. Sullivan, a professor at Harvard Law School who is assisting the prosecutors, told the court that excluding people who know about the case or the potential impeachment \u201cwould exclude the entire state, in effect.\u201dPotential jurors wrote on questionnaires and spoke from the witness stand about their impressions of the governor, their media habits and their conclusions about the case, often sprinkled with information that was sketchy, vague or unflattering to Mr. Greitens.Moments of jury selection felt a little like an especially unvarnished political focus group. A woman said she had seen a campaign ad for Mr. Greitens that she didn\u2019t like \u2014 \u201cI thought it was kind of a jerky thing to do,\u201d she said of the commercial, without going into detail. But she promised that she could set aside her negative impression to be a fair juror.A man said he heard of charges against the governor and discussed the case with his wife.\u201cThe detail of the accusations I\u2019ve read is enough to sway me,\u201d he said. Asked which direction he had been swayed, he answered: \u201cAgainst Governor Greitens.\u201dFrom the witness stand, a tall man in jeans said matter-of-factly that he had heard about the governor\u2019s affair.\u201cHe took a photo of a female,\u201d he said.Then he glanced at Mr. Greitens. \u201cMy opinion is that he\u2019s guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not in jail because he\u2019s got money.\u201dJudge Burlison told all three that they were dismissed from jury duty.Mr. Greitens, who is 44 and wore a navy suit and purple tie on Thursday, sat focused but nearly expressionless, paging through juror questionnaires and whispering with his lawyers.He had fought for a bench trial, arguing that the widespread news coverage of the case had tainted a potential jury in St. Louis, but Judge Burlison denied his request.Other potential jurors said they had picked up only fragments of news. A young lawyer who was summoned to jury duty said she had searched online about the case once, and read an article in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, but didn\u2019t have a strong opinion about it. The judge asked her to return for more questioning on Monday.One white-haired man said that he had heard something about Mr. Greitens and business deals while he watched the news.\u201cI think I heard about it one time between \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 and \u2018Face the Nation,\u2019\u201d he said. A judge asked him to come back on Monday for more questioning.One middle-aged man who walked to the witness stand toting a plastic grocery bag said that he knew about the case from the news and from conversations with neighbors.\u201cI just see it on the front page of the paper all the time,\u201d he said.Pressed on whether he could put his opinions aside to be an impartial juror, he indicated that he could not.\u201cI think once I lean one way, I\u2019m stuck that way,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much from my neighbors.\u201dHe was eliminated.By the end of Thursday, the first day of jury selection, 17 of 40 prospective jurors had been asked to return on Monday for further questioning. Scores of others were still waiting to be screened. Opening statements in the trial are expected to take place next week.The occasional juror claimed not to know of Mr. Greitens, a former member of the Navy SEALs who was elected governor in 2016.One man in a frizzy gray ponytail told Judge Burlison that he had only heard Mr. Greitens\u2019s name once \u2014 on Wednesday, the day before he was expected to appear for jury duty at the Civil Courts Building in downtown St. Louis.\u201cI\u2019ve seen him once,\u201d he said, looking a little sheepish. \u201cI don\u2019t watch news.\u201dHe was asked to come back to court on Monday.Advertisement"}

Some acknowledged the new privacy rules with large disclaimers and other information to explain what information was being gathered when a reader visits the site.\u201cWelcome to USA Today Network\u2019s European Union Experience,\u201d the news organization posted at the top of its website, explaining that the company would not collect personally identifiable information or other data commonly used to sell online advertising.Andrea Jelinek, chairwoman of the new European Data Protection Board, which will coordinate enforcement of the new law, criticized the blackout and said that companies had been given a long time to prepare. For weeks, businesses as varied as Uber, bike shops and restaurants have been sending notes to alert people to updated privacy policies as a result of the law, known as G.D.P.R.\u201cIt didn\u2019t just fall from heaven,\u201d Ms. Jelinek said in a statement. \u201cEveryone has had plenty of time to prepare.\u201dNews organizations were not alone in erecting barriers for European users. The American television broadcaster A&E Networks cut off the websites of its A&E, History and Lifetime channels. The digital advertising company Drawbridge, the social media tracker Klout and the save-it-for-later reading app Instapaper also stepped back.Europe\u2019s new privacy measures allow people to limit the information they leave behind when browsing social media, reading the news or shopping online. Businesses must detail how someone\u2019s data is being handled, and clear a higher bar to target advertising using personal information.The law had been seen as focusing on Silicon Valley tech giants like Facebook and Google, but publishers and advertising companies have warned that it will harm their businesses in particular because it restricts how information is packaged and shared to sell advertising. It is common for websites to use tracking software to gather information about visitors in order to better target ads.Digital advertising is an important source of income for many news organizations, particularly as print readership and advertising fall, but policymakers in Europe argue the practices have become intrusive and ripe for abuse, with personal information shared far beyond what most people realize.\u201cAt least in the short term, it pushes publishers to these large platforms that dominate the market already,\u201d Ms. Shullman said in an interview.The law requires \u201cinformed\u201d consent from users, but Mr. Schrems, who has successfully sued Facebook in the past and leads the nonprofit group None Of Your Business, said the companies were using \u201cforced\u201d consent because users must accept a blanket privacy policy in order to continue using the service.The complaints were filed in Austria, Belgium, France and Germany, and will now be reviewed by the European data protection authorities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s New Face in Foreign Affairs", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs.\u00a0Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.Berlin \u2014 On May 23, Germany\u2019s new foreign minister, Heiko Maas, will meet his American counterpart, Mike Pompeo, for the first time. The meeting will take place in rough times for trans-Atlantic relations, amid European worries over Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and a looming trade war. If Germany truly is the centerweight of Europe, then it matters enormously what its leading figure on foreign policy thinks. The thing is, no one knows.Mr. Maas is no stranger to politics, but he is a novice when it comes to foreign policy. During Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s last term, the 51-year-old Social Democrat served as the minister of justice and consumer protection, his first federal office. Before that, he spent nearly 20 years as a representative and government minister in the Saarland, a small state along the French border.And yet, in just the 10 weeks since Mr. Maas took charge, he has already begun to leave his mark.On March 26, only two weeks after he took office, Germany joined 28 other countries in expelling Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of a Russian-British double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter.A few weeks later, Mr. Maas flew to Moscow for his inaugural visit with Sergei Lavrov, his Russian counterpart. Mr. Lavrov is one of the world\u2019s most experienced diplomats, and someone known to bring the proverbial gun to every knife fight. One can only imagine the flurry of briefing papers and meetings at the German Foreign Ministry to get their new guy up to speed.But by all accounts, the meeting went well. Despite years of acrimony between Russia and Germany \u2014 and especially between Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Maas\u2019s predecessors \u2014 the Germans came away promising to support a veterans\u2019 hospital, and the Russians committed to the so-called Normandy Format, an effort to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine involving France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.The day after meeting Mr. Lavrov in Moscow, Mr. Maas traveled to Lithuania for a meeting with the foreign ministers of the three Baltic States. It was a meeting with friends, and yet the whole drama of German foreign policy was in this visit, too: With Britain leaving the European Union \u2014 along with its sizable military \u2014 the three small states, in fear of Russian aggression, are looking to Germany to fill the security void. Mr. Maas left them feeling reassured, without yet making the sort of concrete commitments the Baltics are looking for.And all of this \u2014 Russia, Ukraine, the Baltics \u2014 account for just one part of Germany\u2019s foreign policy portfolio. As the representative of a country that is only now figuring out its leadership role, Mr. Maas is walking a narrow line \u2014 but he seems to be relishing the challenge. \u201cI still have to get used to not going to the office but to the airport every morning,\u201d he joked on the flight back.Mr. Maas is energized by his new office, almost boyishly excited by it. In public he is reserved and, well, diplomatic; in one-on-one meetings he\u2019s more casual, leaning back deeply into the seat of the plane, holding a pretzel stick between two fingers like a cigar, as if discussing world politics in some fancy Berlin bar.The Foreign Ministry has changed Heiko Maas. But how will he change German foreign policy?The list of past foreign ministers includes some of the leading figures in German politics, from Willy Brandt to Joschka Fischer, and each of them left a significant imprint. It\u2019s early still, but Mr. Maas will likely follow them. He has strong policy convictions and knows how to make himself visible, how to use the news media not just to get out information, but to tell a story.As minister of justice, Mr. Maas made the fight against populism his trademark. He worked out a controversial bill that levies fines on Facebook and other networks if they don\u2019t remove hate speech and fake news quickly enough from their sites.He is carrying this same narrative into his new job. In his inaugural speech as foreign minister, Mr. Maas sketched a world divided between those who believe in international cooperation and those who see the world in zero-sum terms. These division lines, he said, reached \u201cdeeply into the West,\u201d certainly hinting at, though not naming, Mr. Trump.At the same time, and unlike his immediate predecessor, Sigmar Gabriel, he sees value in continuing strong trans-Atlantic ties, regardless of Mr. Trump. He once took a road trip around the United States, and he draws optimism from the energy of American civil society.In this he resembles the French president, Emmanuel Macron \u2014 and, perhaps not coincidentally, he also holds a strong emotional bond to France. He likes to tell an anecdote about his grandmother, who over the course of her life in the Saarland held five passports, in part because the region changed hands between France and Germany. In fact, his first visit as foreign minister was to Paris, the very day he took office.A third close emotional relation is with Israel. In his inaugural speech, Mr. Maas said that he has entered politics because of Germany\u2019s crimes at Auschwitz, and the need for his country to atone for them by supporting the Jewish state.Strong ties with France and Israel and a belief in the trans-Atlantic relationship are conventional positions for a German foreign minister; what matters, now, is his commitment to strengthening them.Where he truly differs from the recent norm is on Russia. While Ms. Merkel has always been clear in condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine, her Social Democratic foreign ministers, Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Sigmar Gabriel, tended to be more ambivalent. Many Social Democrats still feel nostalgic about Brandt\u2019s \u201cEntspannungspolitik,\u201d or d\u00e9tente.Mr. Maas, in contrast, has called Russia \u201cincreasingly hostile\u201d; despite his constructive meeting with Mr. Lavrov, we should expect Germany to become even more critical of Russia, and even more supportive of efforts to check it abroad.It will be months, if not years, before we know what a \u201cMaas Doctrine\u201d looks like. But the outline is clear: activist, strongly European and anti-populist. He will insist on Germany getting a place at the table alongside the United States, France, China and Russia, and he will not be quiet in pursuing his goals. For a Germany long used to foreign policy half-steps, we can expect a bracing change of pace.Anna Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

And as he would come to find out, he would also need a significant amount of strangers\u2019 blood to survive it.After he had recovered and as soon as he became an adult, Mr. Harrison felt compelled to pay it forward, he said. For the next 60 years he suppressed his strong distaste for needles \u2014 he says he has never watched one go into his arm \u2014 and gave blood every few weeks at locations across Australia.They said more than three million doses of Anti-D, as the medication containing Mr. Harrison\u2019s blood is called, have been issued to mothers since 1967.\u201cThe end of an era,\u201d Mr. Harrison, a retired railway administrator, said on Sunday from his home in New South Wales. \u201cIt was sad because I felt like I could keep going.\u201dThe value of his contributions is hard to overstate.The Red Cross estimates that around 17 percent of Australian women who become pregnant need Anti-D injections to keep their babies healthy, and the injections can be made only from donated plasma, which, in Australia, comes from what officials describe as \u201ca tiny pool\u201d of around 160 donors who have the special antibody in their blood.His blood was exactly what they were looking for. His body naturally produces the antibody that prevents the hemolytic disease. Mr. Harrison said he was still not sure exactly why, but believes it might have something to do with the blood he received as a teenager.\u201cThe Red Cross and Australia can never thank a man like James enough,\u201d said Jemma Falkenmire, a spokeswoman for the Australian Red Cross Blood Service. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely we will ever have another blood donor willing to make this commitment.\u201dMr. Harrison has been widely praised and has received the Medal of the Order of Australia for his longtime support of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service and the Anti-D program. Ms. Falkenmire said researchers were even working on what they have called a \u201cJames in a Jar project,\u201d with the goal of synthetically creating a mixture of antibodies that matches what Mr. Harrison produces naturally.According to Ms. Falkenmire, medical professionals are able to stimulate production of the antibody in donors, but the process can lead to a flulike reaction. Complicating matters, she said, not every potential donor \u2014 even those with the right blood type \u2014 are able to create the antibody as Mr. Harrison can.On Sunday, Mr. Harrison said he had enjoyed meeting the mothers, nurses and others who had gone out of their way over the years to find and thank him.Even his daughter, Tracey Mellowship, was one of those to benefit from his blood.Mr. Harrison deflected most of the praise with humor and humility.\u201cBlame me for the increase in population,\u201d he said.As for how he processes the idea that he has saved millions of babies, he said: \u201cSaving one baby is good. Saving two million is hard to get your head around, but if they claim that\u2019s what it is, I\u2019m glad to have done it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019ve always been close with my mom, but since the separation, she\u2019s hard to take. My dad definitely behaved badly, but my mom spends all day on the phone repeating his bad behavior to anyone who will listen. When the phone calls are over, she starts complaining to me. It\u2019s calmer when I stay with my dad. (We don\u2019t talk about anything deep.) But my mom gets mad when I go there \u2014 like I\u2019m being disloyal to her. Summer vacation is coming, and I\u2019d rather spend more time with him. Would that be wrong?ANONYMOUSThe truest thing I will tell anyone this week is that it\u2019s not your job to take care of your mother, your father or their marriage. In fact, I\u2019m upset that they\u2019re not looking out for you! You\u2019re still (partly) a kid, and you\u2019ve been through a lot. What makes this complicated is that, at 15, you\u2019re also old enough to see that your mom is deeply hurt and your dad behaved badly. But that doesn\u2019t excuse their selfishness.Stay with your dad for the time being. It\u2019s a more neutral environment with fewer stressors for you. But don\u2019t give up on your mom. You were close; and, sad but true, there are times we all fall down on the job. (This sounds like her time.) Keep in touch with her, but be prepared: She may lash out at you for your decision. Say, \u201cMom, I know this separation has been hard on you. But I need a break from hearing about it.

And if there are counselors or teachers at school you like, drop by to talk. They can help with a lot more than college admissions and trigonometry.My wife and I were invited by friends to stay at their beach house for the long weekend. When we arrived, the bedrooms were occupied. The wife showed us to the laundry room where she had set up two air mattresses. She acted as if this were normal. We stayed for one night (of the proposed three), then I begged my wife to let us leave. She relented, and I made up a story about not feeling well. Is it wrong for houseguests to assume that they will have a bed?R.F.Your question stinks of entitlement \u2014 which, sadly, I share 100 percent. I have heard of magical air mattresses and pullout sofas, but have yet to encounter a good night\u2019s sleep on one. Unless we warn houseguests in advance, give them beds.

Why make your hosts offer to shuffle bedrooms by complaining? Someone was always going to end up on an air mattress. I drove two friends of my tween daughter on a school field trip. Neither of them greeted me or thanked me on getting out of the car. I was raised with much higher expectations of courtesy to adults. But I wonder what\u2019s reasonable these days?

{"Headline": "The Next Privacy Battle in Europe Is Over This New Law", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new European data privacy legislation is so stringent that it could kill off data-driven online services and chill innovations like driverless cars, tech industry groups warn.If the current draft prevails, the law will require Skype, WhatsApp, iMessage, video games with player messaging and other electronic services that allow private interactions to obtain people\u2019s explicit permission before placing tracking codes on users' devices or collecting data about their communications.Industry and consumer advocates are essentially fighting over a contentious issue central to the post-Cambridge Analytica online economy: whether data-driven digital services represent more of a boon to consumers or the kind of surveillance that can threaten democracy.The ePrivacy Regulation will replace and broaden an older European Union directive \u2014 which covered traditional telecommunications like voice calls \u2014 by also covering digital communications like text messaging and video chat apps.The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users\u2019 electronic communications: obtaining consumers\u2019 explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.\u201cDo you really want that app to use your metadata? Do you really want them to read your content on a dating app?\u201d Ms. Sippel asked. \u201cConsumers need to get back control over what is happening with their lives and their data.\u201dBut tech industry groups and their supporters argue that ePrivacy\u2019s consent requirement and other provisions are so onerous that they would hinder innovations like smart cars, which automatically transmit safety information back to the manufacturer. And requiring companies to provide equal communications services to people who opt out of data mining, they say, could cause sites or apps that rely on data-driven advertising to start charging fees or close down.\u201cEvery stakeholder I have talked to from industry, from all sizes from the very biggest to the very smallest businesses, are unanimously opposed to this,\u201d he said.Tech companies and trade groups have waged a furious, multipronged lobbying campaign to shut down, or at least weaken, the legislation.Cisco, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, the American Chamber of Commerce, DigitalEurope and the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe, a digital advertising industry group, have all lobbied officials at the European Commission about ePrivacy, according to a lobbying database created by Transparency International EU, a nonprofit research group in Brussels.How much they are spending on the effort is unclear. While companies and trade groups that lobby European Commission officials must provide financial details on annual lobbying expenditures, they do not have to break out the spending by issue.Industry associations have also lobbied the Council of the European Union, whose leadership rotates every six months. For the ePrivacy law to be enacted, the Council must first come to its own consensus on the bill before negotiating the law\u2019s final language in a three-way discussion with the European Parliament and the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm.Elitsa Zlateva, a spokeswoman for the permanent representation of Bulgaria to the European Union, said her country\u2019s officials were committed to the bill\u2019s progress. She declined to provide names of other trade groups that the country\u2019s representatives had met with on ePrivacy.The \u201cBulgarian presidency acts as an honest broker,\u201d she wrote in an email, and works to balance the interests of European member states, citizens and business.Christian Borggreen, vice president for the computer industry group in Europe, said he hoped that the ePrivacy Regulation would not conflict with the G.D.P.R. and that it would \u201cadd meaningful privacy protection without unduly hurting digital innovation.\u201dMichela Palladino, director of European policy and government relations at the Developers Alliance, said of the ePrivacy bill\u2019s restrictions on handling user content and metadata: \u201cThat is something that is too extreme and will really cut potential business opportunities\u201d for many industries that rely on data.Ms. Sippel said hewing to industry opinions was impeding progress on the ePrivacy effort.\u201cIn my view, we have some weak governments on the Council that are not willing to get into trouble with industry,\u201d she said, emphasizing that she was expressing her opinion and not stating an official parliamentary position. \u201cSo, for the time being, they haven\u2019t found a common position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Photographing a \u2018Punk\u2019 Priest in Rural Russia", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSWhen Ekaterina Solovieva traveled to a remote lake town in northern Russia, she encountered an Orthodox priest with a decidedly unorthodox manner.Anyone overwhelmed by city life, work or family, knows the fantasy of escaping to a distant and simple place where life unfolds according to the seasons. The siren song can beckon louder than the noise that\u2019s left behind.Her decision to travel to Kolodozero was a much-needed break, even if she didn\u2019t know what to expect. But she had been drawn there by the story of Father Arkady, an Orthodox priest with decidedly unorthodox manner.Father Arkady was a \u201cpunk\u201d priest, whom she described as wearing \u201ca torn T-shirt, with sawdust in the beard and with a burning gaze.\u201d He had gone there shortly after finishing seminary studies in 2000 to search for life\u2019s meaning along with two other big-city friends. Though rife with alcoholism, the town \u2014 with one school, a library, a post office, three shops and a farm \u2014 enticed him and was a needed break from his native Tallinn, Estonia\u2019s largest city and capital. The priest and his friends rebuilt an old church that had burned down and started inviting the locals to services.\u201cIt was important for me to understand what drives a man seeking solitude, running away from the world,\u201d Ms. Solovieva said.She was also interested in the younger generations who have embraced faith as a reaction to the history of antireligious campaigns under the Soviet Union\u2019s communist rule. \u201cFor 80 years, the country was living with the ideology of God-fighting and atheism,\u201d she explained. \u201cLeninist and Stalinist rules were consistently destroying the best representatives of Russian clergy. In the 1990s, after the collapse of U.S.S.R., the spiritual life in Russia began its revival.\u201dIt was not difficult for Ms. Solovieva to settle into the village. \u201cIn a couple of years I was already going with a tractor to collect cranberries, checking fishing nets at the neighboring lake and bringing a neighbor with my car to pick strawberries,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring all this I was listening and trying to remember their stories about Kolodozero life and Farther Arkady.\u201dYet, as she grew to understand the situation further, it became clear that things were not as they seemed. \u201cThe locals were complaining to me, \u2018The father drinks, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t go to his church!\u2019\u201d said Ms. Solovieva. \u201c\u2018But you drink yourself,\u2019 I replied. \u2018He is a priest, he should be better than us,\u2019 was their answer.\u201dAs she watched Father Arkady\u2019s decline, her fantasy that this quaint place might save her from her life in Germany faded.\u201cSlowly, I began realizing that living in the northern Russian province is not a fairy tale, that the mere existence there is possible only through hard everyday labor,\u201d she said. \u201cMy attitude to the whole story also started to drift. Farther Arkady\u2019s everyday deeds and his solitude, even though hidden behind carelessness and gaiety, became more and more clear to me.\u201dIf anything, those revelations were a premonition of something that was inevitable: Father Arkady\u2019s funeral, earlier this year. \u201cWhile he was on vacation, some people with a criminal background settled down in his house,\u201d Ms. Solovieva said. \u201cThey were drinking vodka there for a few days. One day, a local man, Yurka, went in the house. He had a conflict with the strangers and they killed him. Beat him to death with some heavy object. For Arkady it was a very heavy strike. He returned from the vacation, washed Yurka\u2019s blood off the walls, and died.\u201d\u201cI started this story being an excited girl in a fairy tale,\u201d she said. \u201cI finished it being a wise person, that had understood the depth of Father Arkady\u2019s exploits. He abandoned his habitual city life for the solitude of a Karelian village. I went all the way from a superficial travel photographer to a documentarist that created a book about the unrealized hopes of a particular Orthodox priest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Facebook Just a Platform? A Lawyer to the Stars Says No", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBELFAST, Northern Ireland \u2014 Paul Tweed made his name suing news organizations like CNN, Forbes and The National Enquirer on behalf of Hollywood movie stars, winning high-profile cases for celebrities like Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake by hopscotching among Belfast, London and Dublin to take advantage of their favorable defamation or privacy laws.So it was telling last year when Mr. Tweed stopped by the Dublin office of a lawyer for Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants \u2014 many of which keep their non-United States headquarters in Ireland for tax reasons \u2014 with some half-playful questions.Was public sentiment turning against the companies? Mr. Tweed wanted to know. Was a groundswell building over fake news, hate speech, revenge porn, online sex trafficking, defamation and privacy rights?\u201cIt was odd,\u201d the Dublin lawyer, Richard Woulfe, recalled. \u201cHe wanted to sound me out, to find out my view on whether there were going to be more cases like this in the future.\u201dYes, indeed. Having enjoyed two decades of legal immunity on both sides of the Atlantic, social media giants are suddenly under growing pressure from regulators and lawmakers, especially in Europe. Lawyers are after them, too, filing lawsuits that seek to chip away at the legal protections afforded the social media companies and to extract financial payments for defamation, privacy rights violations and data breaches.Since the early years of the internet boom, American and European rules and regulations have deemed social media companies to be neutral \u201cplatforms\u201d or \u201chosts,\u201d and thus immune from the liabilities faced by traditional publishers. But a series of scandals over their content has put the companies under a new assault \u2014 and the broad question of whether they should be seen as publishers rather than agnostic platforms has sweeping legal ramifications.\u201cI say to Facebook, \u2018What is the difference between you and a national newspaper being responsible for the letters they publish on their letters page? Why do you have to be treated differently?\u201d Mr. Tweed said in an interview in his walk-up office across the street from City Hall in Belfast, where he is based. \u201cFacebook can\u2019t say, \u2018We are not a publisher; we are just a platform.\u2019 I have been hearing that from them for years, and I never believed it.\u201dLegal scholars say the volume of litigation against the companies has spiked but the number of lawsuits or the size of the payments is difficult to quantify. Companies quickly settle any case that passes the preliminary stages in order to avoid negative precedents or publicity.Mr. Tweed certainly saw an opportunity. Soon after his Dublin visit, he gave up his partnership at a major British law firm to found a new one dedicated to suing companies like Facebook and Twitter.Amid the public backlash, the British information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has told Facebook, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a platform anymore; there are some legal and social responsibilities, too.\u201dGermany is now requiring social media companies to remove any hate speech within 24 hours after their notification of its posting, forcing teams of Facebook employees to evaluate the content almost as editors do. A new European Union regulation to protect online privacy that goes into effect this Friday is providing new opportunities for lawyers to sue. Congress is weighing legislation to require internet companies to disclose the buyers of political advertising, just as traditional news media outlets have to do.But compliance with the varied demands of different jurisdictions \u2014 whether about hate speech in Germany or privacy in Britain \u2014 is already weakening arguments that the companies could never feasibly regulate their content, legal experts say. Even their staunchest supporters now agree that their protected status as platforms is more vulnerable than ever.\u201cWe are going to look back at the mid-2010s as the high-water mark of free speech online, and it is only downhill from here,\u201d said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and a champion of those legal protections.Irish law is much stricter against defamation than that of either the United States or Britain, while British law is much stricter about protecting personal privacy. In 2013, Northern Ireland rejected a measure passed by the British Parliament to deter foreign plaintiffs from so-called libel tourism, making the Belfast courts uniquely welcoming to Mr. Tweed and his American and international clients.In the past, he has filed lawsuits in Belfast courts against The National Enquirer on behalf of Ms. Spears and the singer and actress Jennifer Lopez (over false reports of marriage trouble for one and of a drug scandal linked to the other). In London, he sued the MailOnline website on behalf of the actor couple Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis (over paparazzi pictures of their baby on a beach in Santa Monica, Calif.). And in Dublin, he has sued the German magazine Heat on behalf of Mr. Timberlake and his wife, Jessica Biel (over false suggestions of trouble in their marriage).Like most of his celebrity cases, all those claims were settled out of court.With a mane of wavy blond hair, open-collared shirts and a manner other Belfast lawyers describe as \u201cimpish,\u201d Mr. Tweed often says he feels as much at home in Los Angeles as in Belfast. But in recent years, he said, he has found a growing number of less famous clients also seeking to protect their reputations from embarrassment or insults on social media, or from threats to post the information.\u201cA threat used to be somebody leaving a pig\u2019s head in a bed,\u201d Mr. Tweed said. \u201cNow it is \u2018I am going to put this on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube or Periscope!\u2019 \u201dMany of his new clients are rich businessmen or officials from the Middle East and Africa hoping to exploit the British and Irish court systems. One of them, the exiled Palestinian strongman Mohammed Dahlan, now based in the United Arab Emirates, is suing the online publication Middle East Eye, as well as Facebook and Twitter, over allegations that he participated in an attempted coup in Turkey.Over the past year, Mr. Tweed said, he has also handled more than 20 cases involving so-called revenge porn \u2014 the posting on social media of sexually explicit images of a former lover, one of the most politically sensitive issues for the companies. He declined to disclose how many had ended in financial settlements, citing confidentiality agreements.Then, in January, another Belfast lawyer reached a settlement with Facebook in a case about the posting online in 2014 of naked photographs of a 14-year-old girl, which reappeared repeatedly even after her family had asked Facebook to remove them. Facebook agreed to a financial payment, which typically would include a confidentiality agreement. Her lawyer, nevertheless, told local journalists in a brief statement that the settlement \u201cmoves the goal posts.\u201d\u201cIt now puts the onus on the provider to look at how they respond to indecent, abusive and other such images put on their platform,\u201d the lawyer, Pearse MacDermott, said at the time. \u201cHad these images been put in a newspaper or on TV, there would be serious repercussions.\u201dMr. Tweed, under no confidentiality agreement, spoke out about the significance of the case and now represents the victim. In a February debate over revenge porn televised on the Irish national broadcaster, Mr. Tweed squared off against Niamh Sweeney, Facebook\u2019s policy chief for Ireland. Ms. Sweeney said that one way Facebook was trying to address the issue was by inviting individuals to preemptively submit naked or other embarrassing pictures of themselves so the company\u2019s software could block efforts to post the images. (A pilot program is underway in Australia.)Absurd, Mr. Tweed countered in a later interview. How could Facebook ask individuals to volunteer their own compromising pictures? \u201cAre you gonna?\u201d he asked.Responding to widespread criticism over the Russian use of Facebook to influence the American election, the company recently announced it would block foreign advertising related to a coming Irish referendum on abortion.Mr. Tweed responded to that by attacking Facebook from the opposite direction, for censoring too much. He has taken on at least three clients who complain that Facebook wrongly blocked them, either because the clients were Irish or, in one case, an aggregator of mainstream news reports whose entire site was blocked because it carried some articles on the referendum.\u201cIf a traditional media company was doing this, there would be all hell to pay for censorship,\u201d Mr. Tweed said. \u201cThis is just another example of Facebook the publisher.\u201dThe social media companies, he argued, have a responsibility to block offensive content without censoring legitimate debate, regardless of the costs, just like traditional publishers. \u201cIf they can\u2019t do it, they should get out of the kitchen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Programs to harvest the giant\u2019s caviar and sell it have helped to create a model for sustainable fishing. Supported byCatching a giant paddlefish weighing 50 or 100 pounds is an altogether different pursuit. And in an unusual twist, the end result is a bounty of an unusual delicacy: roe sold around the country as caviar. \u201cIt winds up on cruise ships, it winds up in restaurants, it winds up everywhere,\u201d said Dennis Scarnecchia, a professor of fisheries at the University of Idaho. He supervises paddlefish caviar programs in Montana, North Dakota and Oklahoma, the proceeds of which are funneled into research and monitoring of these freshwater leviathans. He considers the programs \u201ca model for sustainable recreational fishing.\u201d The highly regulated season for snagging paddlefish on the Yellowstone River, near the North Dakota border, opened on May 15, some 15 miles from this small town. Dozens of fishers, sitting in lawn chairs and standing in waders, crowded the tree-lined bank below Intake Diversion Dam, which provides water for irrigation.It\u2019s a festive affair, with signs greeting paddlefish enthusiasts who come from all around the country. They park trailers and tents beneath the brilliant green canopy of newly leafed trees, and the smell of campfire smoke hangs in the air. Instead of flies, these fishers tie a large treble hook on the end of a heavy line on a large rod, the kind used for saltwater fishing. Below that they tie a quarter-pound of lead, or sometimes a sparkplug or piece of chain from a chain saw, to pull the hook down in the rapidly flowing water.Then they spend a long day casting the heavy rig as far out into the river as possible, rapidly reeling the line back in, giving it an occasional jerk in hopes of setting the hooks in the flanks of a paddlefish. When they do, they pull it in.Last year, 273 paddlefish were caught on opening day. This year just 39 fish were taken on the first day because of the high-water conditions. The largest was 89 pounds.As of Friday, the number of paddlefish caught was 275; the biggest so far weighed 99 pounds. The river flow had swelled even more, to 56,000 cubic feet per second.When a fish is hooked, a cry goes up: \u201cFish on!\u201d People look to see who has a deeply bent rod. It can take five or ten minutes of intense, high-tension reeling to bring in the heavy fish. Once it slides onto the gravelly bank, the hooks are removed. \u201cIt was a fight,\u201d said an excited 15-year-old, Matthew Klima of Belgrade, Mont., who cradled a 46-pound fish he had just caught. \u201cIt felt like a log \u2014 I thought, \u2018I\u2019m snagged.\u2019 Then it just took off.\u201dPaddlefish are one-of-a-kind, in the same family as sturgeon. They are silvery gray with tiny eyes, extremely large gills and a toothless mouth. They are filter feeders with large comb-like \u201cgill-rakers\u201d in their gaping mouths that filter zooplankton, their main food, from the water.Their signature feature is the unusual flat paddle, or rostrum, that extends from the snout and can be half as long as the fish. It\u2019s part of a unique, highly sensitive electro-sensing system that, in concert with tens of thousands of tiny sensors on its head, functions like sonar to detect zooplankton. Sharks and platypus have similar systems for locating food. It\u2019s an adaptation to the murky, sediment-choked water of the muddy rivers paddlefish thrive in. The rostrum is so sensitive that researchers say it can detect the movement of a single microscopic creature. \u201cThe paddle also provides hydrodynamic lift and stability in the water column,\u201d said Dr. Scarnecchia. \u201cIt\u2019s a really unusual adaptation.\u201dOccasionally a fish is found without a paddle, usually cut off by prop strikes from boats.While a big trout in Montana might weigh four or five pounds, the record paddlefish caught in this state in 1973 weighed 142.5 pounds. The national record is 198 pounds. An old trout is one that is near 10 years old; paddlefish live to be 50 or 60 years old. The paddlefish season runs here until June 30 but may end earlier if the 1,000-fish quota is reached. Last year, it was over in five days. An archery season opens in July: People hunt the fish with lights from boats at night.Then he snips a piece of jawbone and counts the layers like tree rings to determine the age of the fish \u2014 something he has done with every paddlefish caught in the caviar programs in the three states. His collection of jawbones go back to 1990, an unusually rich trove of scientific data. Fish that he tagged many years ago as juveniles are often caught these days at this event. \u201cYou see these fish grow up, just like your kids,\u201d he said.After they are soaked in brine, the eggs are quickly frozen to be sold as caviar. \u201cYou have to get them into the brine as fast as possible or they\u2019ll break,\u201d said Kayla Allen, one of the egg washers.\u201cCooking the fillets are like grilling pork chops,\u201d said Bryan Arp, of Cheyenne, Wyo., as he was casting his treble hooks along the shore. \u201cI slice them and marinate them in butter, salt and lemon.\u201dThe fishers donate the paddlefish roe to the Yellowstone Caviar Program, run by the Glendive Chamber of Commerce. Last year the nonprofit program produced 1,300 pounds, and in 2016, 2,000 pounds. Wholesale, the price varies from $60 to $200 a pound. Prices have been depressed, said Christine Whitlatch, director of the chamber of commerce, because of large amounts of farm-raised caviar coming from China.After expenses, 30 percent of the proceeds goes to fund research and monitoring efforts by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. The rest goes to the Caviar Grant Program, which donates to a variety of nonprofits in 15 rural counties for purposes ranging from playground construction to building preservation. The program has handed out almost $1 million since its inception in 1990.Wild paddlefish are found in 22 states. The species have declined across the United States and virtually disappeared in the only other country in which they were found, China. A chief threat to the dinosaurlike fish is dams.

{"Headline": "\u2018Next Year in Jerusalem!\u2019 In Israel, Eurovision Win Is Seen as a Diplomatic Victory, Too", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel, confronting a host of contentious political and military issues, was struck by a wave of national euphoria this weekend after the country\u2019s contestant won the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday night with a defiant anthem about female empowerment.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among the first to get in on the celebrations, echoing Ms. Barzilai\u2019s words as he exulted on his Facebook page: \u201cNext year in Jerusalem!\u201dIn line with Eurovision protocol, the winner dictates the host of next year\u2019s contest. So in 2019, it will be held in the holy city that Israel is battling to have recognized internationally as its capital.The words \u201cNext year in Jerusalem,\u201d traditionally sung by Jews at the end of the Yom Kippur fast and after the Passover feast, have almost religious significance, with connotations of redemption.Israeli elation could be short-lived, of course. The country is bracing for mass Palestinian marches with the potential for bloodshed along the Gaza border and in other areas on Monday to protest the embassy move, among other issues.But at least for a while, Ms. Barzilai, a pop star with powerful vocals who celebrates difference and is now world famous for her clucking sounds and viral chicken dance, made Israelis feel good.\u201cI think what\u2019s special about this competition is that people are here for the music and the fun,\u201d said Elad Lahmany, a die-hard Eurovision fan who traveled to Lisbon from his home in Tel Aviv for the competition.\u201cNobody thinks about politics I hope,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m glad we were able to show the beautiful side of Israel.\u201dMr. Netanyahu briefly performed the chicken dance on Sunday, as seen in a Twitter post.Even sweeter for Israelis, Ms. Barzilai, 25, had led Eurovision betting sites for weeks before being edged out by Cyprus\u2019s contestant. The victory was all the more astonishing because she was catapulted into first place by the popular vote after the competition judges from other countries placed her third.Israel had won the Eurovision three times before \u2014 in 1978, 1979 and 1998 \u2014 and has hosted the contest twice at the International Convention Center at the western entrance of Jerusalem. (It passed in 1980 and did not participate in that year\u2019s Eurovision event in The Hague because it fell on Israel\u2019s national Remembrance Day for its fallen soldiers.)Though the old Eurovision fever had faded here a little over the years some Israelis said the victory helped bolster, even momentarily, a sense of belonging to a small but plucky country that punches above its weight and has outsize influence in the world.That image has been tested by international grumbling about the 50-year occupation of the Palestinian territories and the policies of Israel\u2019s current government, including its campaign to expel African asylum seekers.Some high-profile artists protesting the country\u2019s policies toward the Palestinians have canceled appearances related to Israel. And hundreds of actors, musicians and artists critical of Israeli\u2019s actions against Palestinians have endorsed the so-called B.D.S. movement, a pro-Palestinian campaign that calls for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel.But Ms. Barzilai\u2019s victory comes as an additional lift to a country already riding high on diplomatic achievements. On Sunday, in remarks at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting, Mr. Netanyahu said: \u201cThese days, Jerusalem is being blessed with many gifts. We received another one last night with Netta\u2019s thrilling and suspenseful victory. The gift is that Eurovision will come to Jerusalem next year; we will be very proud to host it.\u201dIf next year\u2019s Eurovision is held, as planned, in Jerusalem, it will further burnish Israeli ambitions at a time when many of the 28 member states of the European Union have been pushing back against the United States\u2019 decision on Jerusalem.By midday Sunday, fewer than half the 86 foreign ambassadors and charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires invited to a celebratory reception at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the eve of the embassy opening had confirmed their attendance. The only European Union members among them were Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania.The Trump administration\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the opening of the embassy on Monday have upended decades of American policy and bucked the international consensus that it prejudged the outcome of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations about the future status of the contested city.Nevertheless, Mr. Netanyahu and his conservative Likud party are soaring in the polls after reaping credit at home for Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the deal to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which the hawkish Israeli government vehemently opposed.Ben Rothenberg contributed reporting from Lisbon.Advertisement"}

When Mr. Lazor told people he was writing a book about low-alcohol cocktails, the most common response was a snort: \u201cWell, what\u2019s the point of that?\u201d His answer: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a drink that will knock you on your butt after one to be big in flavor or interesting.\u201dIn that spirit, Ms. Esmon serves several refreshingly low-kick cocktails.

{"Headline": "Never Mind the News Media: Politicians Test Direct-to-Voter Messaging", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders seemed nervous. In just two hours, he would conduct a live-streamed town hall event on the Iran nuclear deal, and he still hadn\u2019t nailed his opening.\u201cDid you mention to somebody doing a history of U.S.-Iranian relations?\u201d he asked aides who had gathered in his Senate office to help him prepare. \u201cWhat do you think about starting with that?\u201d Then he wanted to say something about Saudi Arabia. Then Israel.In another room, staff members rushed to finalize last-minute details. \u201cWe convert into a small production company,\u201d one aide joked.The town hall meeting in mid-May came off seamlessly, before a modest live audience at the Capitol Visitor Center. Mr. Sanders scripted the evening\u2019s event, interviewed panelists and directed the conversation. There were no nettlesome questions from television or newspaper reporters. And over the next two weeks the real target audience \u2014 online viewers \u2014 would show up in droves, with some 800,000 people watching it.The event provided a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the grass-roots efforts Mr. Sanders has become known for, as his team revved up its campaign engine: A week later, Mr. Sanders would announce his bid for re-election to the Senate. The democratic socialist from Vermont is also widely believed to be considering another run for president in 2020.But the Iran discussion also reflected the kind of direct-to-voter messaging strategy that has become increasingly common among politicians \u2014 both as a way to shape information about their goals and to avoid difficult questions from the news media, particularly in the midst of scandal or controversy. From Washington to Texas to California, politicians are road-testing their political messaging strategies, searching for the best way to reach voters in ways that often bypass the traditional media gatekeepers.The Iran town hall event would be the third Mr. Sanders has held this year; more than one million people viewed the first, on health care, and roughly 2.5 million watched the second, on inequality, according to Mr. Sanders\u2019s team.These media methods have obvious appeal: Politicians can appear accessible but remain insulated from the press. They are also not altogether new. President Trump eschewed traditional television advertising during the 2016 campaign and can now overshadow even his own party\u2019s message at the drop of a tweet. And many politicians have long made a practice of ducking reporters.\u201cBernie and others are trying to find other ways that they can more directly connect with people,\u201d said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, a Democratic \u201csuper PAC.\u201dMany politicians blame the news media for the shift, claiming dishonest coverage has left them no other choice.\u201cPoliticians have always wanted to control the message \u2014 they\u2019ve always wanted to dominate the talk,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a media environment where you have all kinds of platforms on which to play \u2014 only a few of which you have to submit yourself to questions by reporter \u2014 then sure, you\u2019re going to use those platforms.\u201dThen there are the politicians who talk mostly, if not exclusively, to friendly reporters, in a different kind of direct appeal to voters.In an interview before his town hall meeting, as he shuttled between his office and the Senate chamber for afternoon votes, Mr. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, stressed the need for the party to rely less on the news media.\u201cThere\u2019s Tim Kaine talking to some of the Beltway media, and that\u2019s good,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, exiting an elevator. \u201cYou\u2019ll see people like me going on CNN Sunday, yesterday \u2014 blah blah blah \u2014 all of that\u2019s useful.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cI think Democrats have got to understand that some of the most important issues facing our country are not going to be really talked about on television in the way that they should be.\u201dHis personal style of connecting with voters outside the traditional party apparatus has endeared him to many enthusiastic, young supporters. But it also affords him the patina of approachability while allowing him to evade tough questions from the news media.For all of his dissatisfaction, Mr. Sanders has often acknowledged the power of traditional media \u2014 he wondered aloud if the Iran event would be picked up by CNN or MSNBC. On stage that night this month, however, he was back to pooh-poohing the press.\u201cThe reason we do these town meetings is we think the American people are a little bit smarter than the corporate media thinks they are,\u201d he told a crowd of more than 150 supporters, who had braved a raging thunderstorm to attend.He did not take questions.Advertisement"}

Notice. 2. Interest. 3. Like. 4. Love. 5. Marriage.\u201cYou mean to tell me that you have this five-prong approach and yet you\u2019re 44, you\u2019ve never been married and you have no children?,\u201d Ms. Cunningham asked. \u201cDoes this thing really work?\u201dMs. Cunningham and Mr. Harris first met in October 2014, through Barbara Augustin, a mutual friend who arranged for the three of them to have dinner at a Brooklyn restaurant.\u201cBoth Elizabeth and Michael are really gracious, hospitable and friendly people, each with a wacky sense of humor,\u201d Ms. Augustin said. \u201cThey are also very much grounded in their Christian faith, which is why I thought they would be perfect for each other. But as it turned out, the timing just wasn\u2019t right for them as both were going through difficult times, so there was absolutely no spark.\u201dMs. Cunningham, who grew up in Roosevelt, N.Y., received a bachelor\u2019s degree in theater arts from N.Y.U. and a master\u2019s degree in acting at Columbia before heading to Los Angeles in June 2004, in the hope of becoming an actress. Though she found some work, she abandoned her dream in September 2013 when she returned home to be the primary caretaker for her mother, Herma Cunningham, who had cancer.\u201cI thought Michael was a good-looking guy, but I was so distracted by my mother\u2019s situation that when I got to the restaurant, I\u2019m not even sure I shook his hand,\u201d Ms. Cunningham said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a paragraph of sentences spoken between us that night.\u201dMr. Harris, who is now 45, grew up in Detroit and graduated from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He went on to receive an M.B.A. from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. During his last semester at North Carolina, he completed a four-month graduate-level study-abroad program at the Stockholm School of Economics. Mr. Harris, who is also a chartered financial analyst, was single and working as a controller at a data center in Manhattan when he met Ms. Cunningham.That sparkless meeting did nothing to enhance Mr. Harris\u2019s self-confidence, as he was in the middle of a midlife crisis.\u201cIn some respects of my life, I felt I had achieved what I wanted to achieve,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I saw that a lot of my friends were getting married and having kids and they all started disappearing on me.\u201cNew York might be filled with eight million people, but for me, it felt more like I had become a part of a certain kind of crowded loneliness, and all of the glass half-empty things about New York really started getting on my nerves.\u201dThey moved on, but kept limited tabs on each other through Facebook and other social media platforms.In July 2015, Mr. Harris moved to Denver, and took a year off work. He began looking for a job in February 2016, after falling off his snowboard and dislocating a shoulder. In July, he landed a job as an investment banker there.Five months later, Mr. Harris returned to New York to attend a friend\u2019s annual Christmas party and crossed paths with Ms. Augustin. She told him that Ms. Cunningham\u2019s mother had only weeks to live. Saddened, Mr. Harris reached out to Ms. Cunningham via text message, setting in motion the first of five prongs.Ms. Cunningham was a bit shocked to hear from Mr. Harris again. \u201cIt was really out of the blue,\u201d she said.They agreed to meet for drinks. Mr. Harris arrived early, but the noise inside the bar seemed like the wrong setting for a sober catch-up conversation that would include a dying mother.As he waited for her, the client for his first-ever investment banking deal called from Los Angeles. He was still answering questions when Ms. Cunningham arrived, creating an awkward situation where she was now waiting for him to get off the phone.\u201cIt\u2019s too noisy in there,\u201d he mouthed to her as he led her outside to the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 36th Street, where Ms. Cunningham continued to wait patiently, this time in the bitter cold.Mr. Harris was still talking five minutes later when he looked at Ms. Cunningham, and noting \u201cher patience and grace,\u201d gave her an unexpected peck on the cheek.Ms. Cunningham, a very conservative Christian, called it \u201ca shocking moment,\u201d but a nice one.\u201cI had never kissed him before, and now we\u2019re out in the cold and he\u2019s on the phone and just comes up to me and kisses my cheek. I was like, \u2018Who is this guy?\u2019\u201dMr. Harris finally ended his call and they walked across the street to another restaurant, the Archive. This time around, sparks flew, while getting caught up on the two previous years since they last saw each other.\u201cI thought he was very smart, very funny and a gifted conversationalist,\u201d Ms. Cunningham said. \u201cI felt like he was really into who I was and interested in me outside of the realm of being a caretaker. By the time we left, I wanted to get to know him more but I wasn\u2019t sure if it would happen. I called Barbara and said \u2018O.K., who is this Michael dude, what\u2019s his story. Does he have a girlfriend.\u2019\u201dA month later, Mr. Harris was back in Denver, where he works as an associate with the investment bank W.G. Nielsen & Company, and talking with Ms. Cunningham most nights via FaceTime. (There were times when he could hear her ailing mother, who was in pain, in the background.)\u201cMichael became a gift of comfort,\u201d Ms. Cunningham said. \u201cI had friends who prayed for me and asked God to send me some comfort during this rough time in my life, and until I met Michael, I didn\u2019t know that comfort would come in the form of a man. He was keeping my spirits up in the midnight hour, and I felt truly blessed.\u201dIt was during those late-night conversations that Mr. Harris came to see that he too had been blessed, and that he too had found comfort, his in a woman.\u201cI truly valued her love and dedication to her mother and I admired how calm she was during such a tragic time in her life,\u201d he said.In February 2017, Ms. Cunningham\u2019s mother died, and Mr. Harris went to New York for the funeral. \u201cDuring the burial, he took my hand and my entire family was like, \u2018What, who is this person?\u2019\u201d Ms. Cunningham said. \u201cMuch like that first time he surprised me with a kiss, he had shocked me again, but deep inside, I wanted him next to me.\u201dMr. Harris, whose mother, Bertha Harris, died in 1998, said, \u201cI grabbed Elizabeth\u2019s hand because I had walked this same painful road before, and I know how difficult it is to cope with, so I wanted to share that pain with her.\u201dA month after the funeral, Ms. Cunningham joined Mr. Harris and his friends on a ski trip in Keystone, Colo. They visited Pikes Peak near Colorado Springs, but the peak was closed because of snow and ice, and they could only ascend to about 12,000 feet. While up in the clouds, Mr. Harris surprised Ms. Cunningham with what he called a \u201cproposal,\u201d asking her to be his girlfriend.When she said yes, he presented her with a diamond-encrusted heart-shaped silver necklace as a way of symbolizing that she now owned a part of his heart.\u201cAt that point in my life, I was in need of a certain level of softness, and Michael provided it,\u201d Ms. Cunningham said. \u201cI came to realize that he is a loving guy with an amazing level of detail and thoughtfulness.\u201dThey soon embarked on a long-distance relationship.In November of that year, Ms. Cunningham suffered another emotional setback with the unexpected death of her father, Donovan Cunningham.\u201cLosing both of my parents in the space of nine months was really devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cIn many ways I\u2019m a strong and independent woman, but sometimes you just need to cry and have someone hold and comfort you, so I thank God that I had Michael to lean on at that point in my life.\u201dBy then, Ms. Cunningham and Mr. Harris had already began discussing their future together. Though she assumed that they would not get engaged until 2018, Mr. Harris, who by now owned a condo in Denver, had other ideas.He went to great lengths to surprise her with a proposal on the one-year anniversary of their meeting. On Dec. 20, 2017, Mr. Harris got down on one knee and gave Ms. Cunningham a canary-yellow heart-shaped engagement ring. They were back in front of the Archive, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 36th Street, the same corner he had shocked her with a first kiss.Friends and family had waited patiently inside the Archive and then surprised the bride with loud cheers and applause when the couple stepped inside.\u201cIt was the best surprise of my life,\u201d Ms. Cunningham said. \u201cHaving seen many of those same people at the funerals of my parents, it was quite a stark difference, a completely exciting moment created by Michael that I will never forget.\u201dThe couple were married April 14 at Trinity Lutheran Church in Brooklyn, and exchanged vows before Pastor Patrick Boatwright and Ms. Augustin, who served as co-officiant.The groom made seven vows to the bride, and it was his fourth that wowed the 175 guests, some from Canada, Kenya, Norway, Spain and South Africa.\u201cThere have been so many upgrades to my life, relative to my midlife crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, you are my life\u2019s ultimate upgrade. So in return, I vow to seek to upgrade your life. Be it a five-carat purple five-year anniversary ring, be it the last piece of bread in the house if on hard times, be it a kind supportive word that\u2019s meaningful.\u201dPastor Boatwright couldn\u2019t resist on the five-carat promise. \u201cFive years from now,\u201d he announced, \u201cI will remind Elizabeth about that ring.\u201dLaughter filled the old church on 46th street in Sunset Park, and moments later there was more, when told to kiss his new bride, he covered his lips several times over with a lip balm, and then did so.Later that evening, a van carrying the 18-person wedding party pulled up to the curb at nearby Warehouse Studios, where the reception was held. They made their way up an iron staircase where the guests \u2014 including Mr. Harris\u2019s 75-year-old father, Herman Harris \u2014 were enjoying music while feasting on chicken and empanadas, black-eyed peas, plantains and macaroni and cheese.Kaddu Luyombya, one of the groom\u2019s two best men, noted that \u201cMichael was doing pretty well when he was single. He had a great job, a new condo and a new car. But he didn\u2019t start living the life he dreamed of living until Elizabeth came into his life.\u201dAsked if the groom\u2019s five-prong approach had ultimately worked, the bride said: \u201cI never really looked at it as a test or a quiz, but more of an emotional roadmap. It was basically five levels of honesty in terms of where we were at as a couple, and at the end of the day that\u2019s a good thing because every woman wants to know where they stand in a relationship.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hours later, when those ferocious winds died down, the first thing Ms. Mart\u00ednez heard outside her home was the tiny Puerto Rican tree frog named the coqu\u00ed for the sound of its quizzical call. Now, Ms. Mart\u00ednez heard the coqu\u00ed\u2019s call differently. But not all of the obstacles are physical. Supplies were slow to make it to the island in the days and weeks after the hurricanes. Contractors with little experience in disasters of this magnitude were hired, further slowing recovery. Driving west from the center of Cayey along the R\u00edo de la Plata, you find numerous pockets that were without power as recently as mid-March. One such area is Calle Don Amado, a narrow, winding road that gets steeper the higher you go. Almost at the top lives Mildoel Rodriguez. In his 60s and disabled, he lives alone on the plot of land his family passed down through generations, where they used to raise animals and grow tobacco and subsistence crops. In late February, he sat in his living room as the day faded. Without power since Maria, there is little he can do. He has no generator, so he cannot watch TV or listen to his favorite music on his stereo. Neighbors check in on him and charge his phone. At twilight, the sounds of generators echo through the valley and Mildoel lights a single candle to punctuate the bluish darkness in his small home. \u201cIt feels like going back 40 years,\u201d he said. His power was finally restored in early April. But as one community cheers, others still wait.As the coqu\u00ed signals yet another night of darkness, Sylvia Mart\u00ednez sees from her kitchen window the glowing lights of San Lorenzo in the valley. She takes advantage of the last bit of daylight to reheat the dinners her family prepares for her. She puts a bag of ice in a cooler.Later, she and her fianc\u00e9, Reggie, will spend their evening under the glow of LED lanterns. Their lives have become a carefully choreographed routine of boiling water for bathing, charging phones and changing batteries. On weekdays they awake at 3:30 in the morning to prepare for their long commute to San Juan, on a route where many traffic lights lack power. As frustrating as it is, she is resigned to waiting another six months for power. To this day they live without light. Advertisement"}

We lived about five minutes away, and I\u2019d sometimes see black men on horses at various intersections waiting for the light to change, particularly on Sundays. Some of the emails I received that week came from rural communities in states like Iowa, Montana and North Dakota, where, according to the most recent census, in some places less than 5 percent of the population is African-American, and others from places like Ohio and Tennessee, which are geographically far removed from Compton.

We asked the Fire Department to set the record straight.Open fires are prohibited in New York City.The open burning of wood \u2014 as in a campfire or fire pit you might see on a beach \u2014 is a hard no in all five boroughs.There are certain exceptions, though, said Frank Dwyer, a Fire Department spokesman, including portable barbecues and some areas in city parks that have been given the green light by the Parks Department.Not all grills are created equal.Certain types of barbecues are permitted on apartment terraces, balconies and rooftops, but they are not allowed on fire escapes, and the rules vary between residential and commercial spaces.Standard backyard barbecues \u2014 with one or two 20-pound propane tanks, and a grate area of not more than 10 square feet, Mr. Dwyer said \u2014 are allowed only at one- and two-family dwellings. Smaller, hibachi-style propane barbecues are allowed on apartment terraces, balconies and, where occupancy is allowed, rooftops. Propane barbecues are not allowed in commercial spaces.Charcoal, electric, and piped natural gas barbecues (when installed properly and legally) are also allowed on all three types of premises, Mr. Dwyer added, as long as standard fire safety measures are observed.Who needs permits, and when?No permit is needed if you\u2019re using a portable barbecue allowed by the fire code. You\u2019ll just need to follow standard fire safety requirements, like keeping water or a portable fire extinguisher close by.\u201cSummer or winter,\u201d Mr. Dwyer added, \u201cmake sure you have a working smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm inside your home.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:The rest of the week is looking wonderful and warmer.

{"Headline": "They Shared Drugs. Someone Died. Does That Make Them Killers?", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "Prosecutors are increasingly treating overdose deaths as homicides, but they aren\u2019t just going after dealers. Friends, family and fellow users are going to prison.Supported byHIBBING, Minn. \u2014 In West Virginia, a woman woke after a day of drug use to find her girlfriend\u2019s lips blue and her body limp.In Florida, a man and his girlfriend bought what they thought was heroin. It turned out to be something more potent, fentanyl. She overdosed and died.In Minnesota, a woman who shared a fentanyl patch with her fianc\u00e9 woke after an overdose to find he had not survived.None of these survivors intended to cause a death. In fact, each could easily have been the one who ended up dead. But all were charged with murder.As overdose deaths mount, prosecutors are increasingly treating them as homicide scenes and looking to hold someone criminally accountable. Using laws devised to go after drug dealers, they are charging friends, partners and siblings. The accused include young people who shared drugs at a party and a son who gave his mother heroin after her pain medication had been cut off. Many are fellow users, themselves struggling with addiction.Such cases are becoming more common even as the role of the criminal justice system in combating drug abuse has become hotly contested, and even as many prosecutors \u2014 including those who pursue overdose death cases \u2014 say they embrace the push to treat addiction as a public health crisis rather than a crime.Overdose prosecutions, they say, are simply one tool in a box that should include prevention and treatment. But there is no consensus on their purpose. Some believe they will reduce the flow of drugs into their communities, deter drug use or help those with addiction \u201chit bottom.\u201d To others, the cases are not meant to achieve public policy goals, but as a balm for grieving families or punishment for a callous act.\u201cI look at it in a real micro way,\u201d said Pete Orput, the chief prosecutor in Washington County outside Minneapolis. \u201cYou owe me for that dead kid.\u201dWho owes whom for what is less clear in the case of the Malcolm family in Breckenridge, Colo., where Michael Malcolm\u2019s younger son was charged in the overdose death of his older brother, with whom he shared drugs purchased on the internet. The cost of prosecution and incarceration, Mr. Malcolm said, would have been better spent on addiction treatment that the family could not afford. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like blaming the leaves on the tree, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about the roots?\u201dIn 15 states where data was available, The New York Times found more than 1,000 prosecutions or arrests in accidental overdose deaths since 2015. Between 2015 and 2017, the number of cases nearly doubled. Dozens more cases were documented in news reports. In all, overdose prosecutions were found in 36 states, with charges ranging from involuntary manslaughter to first-degree murder.In Minnesota, the number of such cases \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cmurder by overdose\u201d \u2014 quadrupled over a decade. Pennsylvania went from 4 cases in 2011 to 171 last year after making it easier to prosecute.A few cases hinged on whether one person injected the other. But in others, the accused may not have even been present when the drugs were taken. Some defendants had tried to save the life of the victims by calling 911, attempting C.P.R. or administering naloxone, an overdose-reversal medication. Prosecutors need not show that the death was intentional, only that the accused provided the drugs or helped the victim obtain them.In Pennsylvania two years ago, Caleb Smith, an aspiring doctor who had just completed a master\u2019s degree in biomedical sciences, gave his girlfriend what he thought was Adderall, purchased on the internet, but was actually fentanyl.After he was charged in her death, he committed suicide.When Kimberly Elkins needed relief from chronic pain, her fianc\u00e9, Aaron Rost, would tape a fentanyl patch to her chest or upper arm.But when the couple wanted to get high, they shared the patch, swallowing the gel inside. Both were unemployed in Hibbing, a town in the remote Iron Range of northern Minnesota whose economy is bound to the global price of ore. On Facebook, Mr. Rost listed his job as \u201cgetting my life straight.\u201dOn a Saturday in December 2015, Ms. Elkins tore off a piece of patch, and Mr. Rost tucked it in his mouth as he left the house to go hunting. That afternoon she woke up in the hospital. The couple had overdosed \u2014 she in the laundry room, he at the door, dressed in bright orange and still holding his bow.Mr. Rost, she learned, had not survived. He was 36. When the police came to take her statement, it never occurred to her that his death would become a criminal case.Back home, mourning Mr. Rost, she took all the pills she could find and washed them down with vodka. At the hospital, Ms. Elkins promised her adult son she would get sober, then checked in to a nearby crisis center.When the police came there to arrest her, two months after Mr. Rost\u2019s funeral, on murder charges, she thought it was a mistake. \u201cWhat are they talking about?\u201d she asked a friend. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill Aaron.\u201dMark S. Rubin, the county attorney who brought charges against Ms. Elkins, compared overdose prosecutions to fatal collisions, saying that prosecuting those involved was \u201cpainful\u201d but \u201cpart of our responsibility.\u201d\u201cPeople agree, you know, there\u2019s nobody forcing someone to take the controlled substance. But somebody might agree to take it from their friend or their boyfriend or girlfriend and they end up dying because of it,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cWe feel that constitutes a crime of possibly murder in the third degree, but at least manslaughter in the second degree.\u201dMs. Elkins, now 49, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and is serving a four-year sentence at a prison in Shakopee, 200 miles from home. She arrived out of breath for an interview in the visiting room, apologizing for being late. The dark hollows that circled her eyes in her arrest mug shot had faded, and her initial bewilderment at being accused had given way to the reality of prison drabs and a metal bunk.\u201cI was like no, this isn\u2019t a mistake anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I struggle really hard with this, is trying to find my responsibility in it.\u201dAfter her arrest, family and friends debated that very question on Mr. Rost\u2019s Facebook page.\u201cHow the hell can u sit there and blame her for it all considering whether she gave it to him or not he still had the choice,\u201d one wrote, calling Mr. Rost\u2019s sister, who supported the prosecution of Ms. Elkins, \u201cheartless.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m heartless?\u201d the sister responded. \u201cI had to plan a funeral for a 36-year-old man.\u201dThe concept of overdose prosecutions took hold after the cocaine-related death in 1986 of Len Bias, the college basketball star, two days after he was drafted by the Boston Celtics. A friend, who called 911 when Mr. Bias collapsed, was accused of providing the cocaine, but was acquitted.Soon after, states began passing so-called Len Bias or \u201cdrug delivery resulting in death\u201d laws. Louisiana made it second-degree murder. Pennsylvania created a crime punishable by up to 40 years in prison. Congress passed the sweeping 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which included a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years for federal cases in which drugs resulted in death or serious injury.The Len Bias laws were supposed to go after drug dealers \u2014 \u201cgreed-soaked mutants,\u201d Howell Heflin of Alabama called them on the Senate floor.But the role of dealer is far less clear cut than lawmakers envisioned. The legal definition of drug dealing, or \u201cdistribution,\u201d typically covers behavior that is common for even casual users, including sharing, giving drugs away or getting reimbursed for a buy. Under complicity laws, helping to arrange a deal can be treated the same as dealing.Unlike child endangerment or \u201csocial host\u201d laws aimed at holding parents responsible for underage consumption, Len Bias laws make adults criminally liable for the actions of other adults.Among groups of regular drug users, on any given day the role of \u201cdealer\u201d might be filled by whoever happens to have gas money, a connection to a supplier or a working phone.In order to gain a better sense of where defendants fit on the user-dealer continuum, The Times looked to Pennsylvania, where overdose prosecutions have soared since a change in the law in 2011 made it unnecessary to prove that the accused had malice toward the victim. The Times examined drug-related death cases filed in criminal court in the first half of last year \u2014 82 cases in all, with 80 defendants.At least 59 of the accused were drug users themselves, according to police reports, court filings and interviews with law enforcement officials and defense lawyers. Roughly half had a relationship with the victim other than that of dealer. That group included six boyfriends, one girlfriend, a cousin, a brother and a son.A few of those charged had tried to save the victims. (Good Samaritan laws protect those who call for help from drug possession charges, but generally not homicide charges.)And while some people say there is never a good reason to help someone obtain drugs, particularly someone with addiction, others insist that there are many, including preventing withdrawal sickness or protecting them from the danger of a street buy.In one Pennsylvania case, a woman was headed for detox, but knew she would not be admitted unless she tested positive for drugs. Her boyfriend told the police he had not wanted her to drive to Baltimore to buy heroin alone, so he helped her arrange the deal and promised her $40 if she brought him along.He was not with her later that night when she overdosed and died, but he now faces a charge of drug delivery resulting in death.Pete Orput raised a coffee mug that proclaims, \u201cI am a ray of sunshine,\u201d with an expletive embedded therein. A recovering alcoholic, former Marine and now the prosecutor in Washington County outside Minneapolis, Mr. Orput is not given to sugarcoating.The opioid manufacturers he is suing are \u201ccorporate schlockmeisters.\u201d Prosecutors he deems overzealous are \u201cpolitical hacks.\u201d And as to whether overdose prosecutions have had an impact on the street, the answer is simple: \u201cNo.\u201dHe has found no reason to believe that such cases deter users or dealers, and says they rarely lead to high-level suppliers.But Mr. Orput still prosecutes in overdose cases. He has filed third-degree murder charges against three high school students who sold synthetic drugs to a classmate; a 21-year-old with a drug addiction who sold pills to a National Guardsman; and a woman who gave her husband methadone.He recognizes the shortcomings of this approach even as he feels compelled to take action. Each time his phone rings late at night with word of another death, he takes half an Ambien, smokes a couple of cigarettes in the bathroom, thinks about the grieving family he will soon meet \u2014 and then considers who will pay.Overdose prosecutions picked up steam under the Obama administration. In 2015, the National Heroin Task Force recommended that cases against heroin dealers whose drugs proved fatal should be prioritized for three reasons: the product might be particularly potent, the prosecutions would serve as a deterrent, and the attention would educate the public about the \u201csevere harm caused by heroin.\u201dDavid Hickton, co-chairman of the task force and a former United States attorney in the Western District of Pennsylvania, said he resisted attempts to make exceptions for drug distributors who suffered from addiction. \u201cYou\u2019re either a trafficker or you\u2019re a user,\u201d he said in an interview, adding, \u201cBut it\u2019s really not a bright line in the real world on the streets, I recognize that.\u201dIn recent years, the overdose prosecution idea has spread from district attorney to district attorney. One PowerPoint presentation instructed investigators to \u201ctreat an overdose scene as a homicide scene from the beginning\u201d; to look for remnants of naloxone, the revival agent, as evidence that someone was there when the victim died; and to use the victim\u2019s cellphone to set up another deal before the supplier finds out the victim is dead.Some cases are handed off to federal counterparts as the basis for larger takedowns, but more often the cases begin and end with bottom-rung sellers.Even hard-liners like John Walters, the director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George W. Bush, question the use of overdose homicide prosecutions without more systematic proof that they reduce drug use and emergency room visits. \u201cIn the absence of that, this is all gestures,\u201d Mr. Walters said.But many law enforcement officers hope that the cases act as a deterrent. When five people overdosed in two months in Twin Lakes, Wis. (population 6,000), the police charged 10 with reckless homicide. \u201cWe kind of want to put a bubble around our community and say we don\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019re not going to accept this here,\u201d said Adam Grosz, the chief of police.But one of his detectives, Katie Hall, said that the arrests had little effect on supply and demand: \u201cIf we can take one off, well, then they just go to the next one.\u201dParadoxically, the punitive approach to overdoses is underpinned by the same rationale as the push to treat addiction as a public health issue. In the prosecutorial worldview, a criminal investigation dignifies victims by treating their deaths as crimes instead of sad inevitabilities.\u201cThe analogy for me is the dead prostitute,\u201d Mr. Orput said. \u201cYou know, years ago, the cop would look and go, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what happens,\u2019 and that\u2019s what they\u2019d say with the junkie: \u2018That\u2019s why we don\u2019t do drugs.\u2019\u201dThe case of Nick Klamer and his childhood friend, Chase Thistle, shows just how hard it is to untangle the knot of blame in a fatal overdose.Mr. Klamer\u2019s death from heroin sent his father, Don Klamer, into a torture of regret and self-reproach. \u201cI was the one that dropped the ball,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the one that was supposed to be keeping him alive.\u201d Because of his addiction, the Klamers had long feared that Nick \u2014 dark-haired, green-eyed and lip-pierced, trailed by a cloud of Axe body spray and Acqua di Gio \u2014 would die young.And yet the prosecution of Mr. Thistle, who was with Mr. Klamer when he scored and used, has helped the family cope, organizing an incomprehensible loss into a story in which Mr. Klamer is the victim. Addiction is a slippery adversary that cannot be held to account. But Mr. Thistle can be.Mr. Klamer, 26, had been doing well in the months before his death in August 2015, living with his father in the rural Wisconsin town of Lodi, where their lawn backed right onto the lake. He worked the 6 a.m. shift with his father at a tool and die shop, and kept himself isolated from old friends and old habits by having no phone and no car.But then, Mr. Thistle came home.\u201cIt was only like a month,\u201d said Melissa Klamer, a sister, \u201cbetween when Chase started coming around again and when Nick died.\u201dChase was the first friend Nick made when he moved to Wisconsin as a young teenager. The Klamers say they thought he was a bad influence, but it was Nick who first injected Chase with heroin in high school, not the other way around, and Ms. Klamer says her brother felt responsible for his friend\u2019s addiction.And it was Mr. Klamer who woke his father after midnight one night, asking for a ride. On the way, he asked for $200, telling a cooked-up story about a friend with a broken-down car. Credulous, his father drove the two friends to a parking lot in Madison, where they met up with friends and used the money to score. When they got home at 3 a.m., Nick said that he was going to stay up and go fishing before work.Instead, the two young men shot up in a cinder-block boathouse at the edge of the Klamers\u2019 backyard. Don Klamer went to work alone. In the afternoon, he came home and found his son\u2019s body on the cracked boathouse floor.Mr. Thistle later told the police that he had left his friend alive and snoring and walked back to his grandparents\u2019 house, where he shot up again and overdosed himself.In all, four people from the parking lot were charged in Mr. Klamer\u2019s death. All pleaded guilty \u2014 two to reckless homicide, one to distribution. Mr. Thistle alone went to trial. He was convicted of reckless homicide and sentenced to three years in prison.The Klamers say Mr. Thistle, after he was revived, could have done more to save Mr. Klamer, like telling the police, who went to the Klamer home to do a welfare check but got no answer at the front door, to look in the boathouse.But Mr. Thistle\u2019s mother, Melinda, said it made as much sense to blame her son as it did to blame her, as the person who gave birth to him. Other people, she said, had played at least as big a role. \u201cNick\u2019s dad gave them $200 \u2014 two drug addicts, recovering drug addicts,\u201d she said.Don Klamer had told the police much the same thing, sobbing and slamming his fist into a table.\u201cI drove them right to his drug dealer,\u201d the police report quoted him saying. \u201cI killed my own son.\u201dSara Simon and Susan C.

Urges Boycott of a Dallas Restaurant Supporting \u2018Reasonable\u2019 Gun Laws", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe National Rifle Association asked members attending its annual convention in Dallas on Friday to boycott a nearby restaurant after learning that it would be donating a portion of its proceeds to help end gun violence.The restaurant, Ellen\u2019s, began including a message on the bottom of its receipts on Friday morning, ahead of the N.R.A.\u2019s weekend gathering.\u201cThanks for visiting Ellen\u2019s!\u201d said the receipt, which went on to explain that some of the proceeds earned that week would be donated to organizations \u201cdedicated to implementing reasonable and effective gun regulations.\u201d\u201cWelcome to Dallas!\u201d it added.It was even more daring when stated in proximity to about 80,000 members of the country\u2019s most powerful gun rights group, who gathered at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center for the organization\u2019s four-day annual meeting. Events included a leadership forum featuring President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, country music performances and a national prayer breakfast.Once word got out about the receipts, the N.R.A. on Twitter advised everyone to \u201csteer clear\u201d of the restaurant.The post spawned thousands of comments, and while many were rallying cries to boycott Ellen\u2019s, others expressed support for the restaurant.The restaurant modified its receipt to clarify its position, with the new one saying that it is \u201cdedicated to implementing reasonable and effective gun regulations that protect citizens\u2019 2nd Amendment rights and also help reduce needless gun violence.\u201d But by then, the restaurant said in its statement, \u201cthe situation had become viral.\u201dJoe Groves, the owner and founder of Ellen\u2019s, did not respond to a request for comment.Over the weekend, the restaurant\u2019s Facebook page was flooded with negative comments and one-star reviews.In its Facebook statement, the restaurant said: \u201cNo one wants children to die in their classrooms. No one wants police to be killed in the line of duty. The differences we have are in our approach. But we can fix it if we breathe, calm down, and listen to one another. As Americans, that\u2019s what we are supposed to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Poetic Portraits Explore Gender Identity in a Community in Mexico", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLensWhen Nelson Morales began to photograph members of Oaxaca's muxe community, he discovered his own identity as one of them.But in 2015, Mr. Morales took a workshop with Antoine d\u2019Agata, a Magnum photographer, that pushed him to get to the heart of himself and his practice.\u201cI didn\u2019t have any models and I had to make self-portraits,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd then the next day, I went out with some muxes and in that moment, something happened because I became part of that scene.\u201d Though muxes historically have commanded respect in some parts of Zapotec culture, Mr. Morales said he had grown up rejecting the muxe community and any possibility that he might be part of it. Still, he found himself drawn to document them. In 2010, he was asked to photograph a muxe beauty pageant, and afterward he continued photographing the community out of curiosity. \u201cI wanted to know more about them,\u201d he said.Maybe it was the self-portraits, but something was different the day he went out with the muxes. \u201cI entered with a camera and there something changed,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething exploded, something happened, and from that moment, I have not stopped making self-portraits, nor being a part of the scene.\u201d In that instant, Mr. Morales found his own identity as a muxe, and his voice as a photographer.Though the resulting photographs are far from documentary, they seem to reflect a truth that is more elusive than a simple declaration of fact, in the same way poetry can teach us something the news cannot. His work captures the surrealism, grace, eroticism and mystery that defines his lived experience as a muxe and that of everyone else he knew, but which has been left out of the images made by photographers from outside the community. \u201cYou know, the reality of life is subjective,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes those levels of reality are augmented a little bit by this world of fantasy. I have lived in the muxe culture, in those nights of parties and going out, of fantasy, of sex, of freedom of the muxes \u2014 I\u2019ve been there. And it makes me interpret it in this way.\u201dHis subjects are friends, people he meets at parties, or others who find out about the project and ask to participate. He estimates he is in about a third of the pictures in the series, and making them is often a collaborative process. In one such photo, two bodies, both anonymous, seem to merge amid fields of blue and red. Mr. Morales directed the picture and put himself in the frame. \u201cIn that moment, I said, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re going to do things that aren\u2019t common \u2014 we\u2019re going to mix our bodies, we\u2019re going do strange things, as if our bodies were only one body.\u2019\u201d Then his boyfriend clicked the shutter.\u201cI had found a special place in that muxe space, in that complete world of fantasy, eroticism, contradictions \u2014 of many things I didn\u2019t know and which I have discovered and continue discovering and searching for,\u201d he said. And so it\u2019s important to Mr. Morales that the pictures, shrouded in mystery and punctuated by vibrant splashes of color, remain somewhat opaque to the viewer, at least at first. He wants his viewers to do a little work, for the images to make them a little uncomfortable, and he excludes straightforward narratives by design. \u201cI like that the viewer wonders or maybe becomes a little uncomfortable,\u201d he said. He knows it may not be for everyone, but that\u2019s O.K., too. \u201cI have to defend that idea, to show them in this way. I have to trust what I believe.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "And for His Next Act, Ev Williams Will Fix the Internet", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftFor years, Ev Williams was saddled with doubts.As a co-founder of Blogger and Twitter and, more recently, as the chief executive of the digital publishing platform Medium, Mr. Williams transformed the way millions of people publish and consume information online.But as his empire grew, he started to get a gnawing feeling that something wasn\u2019t right. High-quality publishers were losing out to sketchy clickbait factories. Users were spending tons of time on social media, but they weren\u2019t necessarily happier or better informed. Platforms built to empower the masses were rewarding extremists and attention seekers instead.\u201cI think I was a little bit ahead of some people in seeing the dark side,\u201d Mr. Williams told me recently.But while other tech leaders enter the confessional booth, Mr. Williams, 46, seems to be emerging with a new outlook \u2014 a blend of old-fashioned Silicon Valley optimism tempered with the caution of a tech veteran who has seen well-intended products hijacked by horrible people.Many of Mr. Williams\u2019s most recent thoughts have to do with how the digital advertising business, coupled with the rise of social media, has trapped publishers in a vicious competition for people\u2019s attention. That quest, which naturally favors loud and extreme voices, has in turn driven more media organizations to publish low-quality and sensational stories.\u201cWhen a publisher makes their money only from ads, they are incentivized to spend as little money as possible while maximizing attention,\u201d he wrote.Echoing Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony before Congress last month, Mr. Williams said he now believed that he had been too optimistic during social media\u2019s early days, and had failed to appreciate the risks of putting such powerful tools in users\u2019 hands with minimal oversight.\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve seen in the past few years is that technology doesn\u2019t just accelerate and amplify human behavior,\u201d Mr. Williams wrote. \u201cIt creates feedback loops that can fundamentally change the nature of how people interact and societies move (in ways that probably none of us predicted).\u201d\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know my answer to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably right.\u201dBut if Mr. Williams isn\u2019t ready to denounce social media, he is at least muting its effects in his own life. He still uses Twitter, but he has turned off most mobile notifications, and he tries to leave his phone behind when he\u2019s with his friends or his kids. He is reading less daily news these days, he said, and more books and long-form articles.\u201cThat\u2019s been healthy for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel the effects of that.\u201dRight now, his focus is Medium, the digital publishing company he started in 2012. For years, Medium\u2019s strategy was to design a sleek blogging platform, attract a crowd by enticing celebrities and established writers to use it, and hope that advertising would pay the bills.Last year, after that strategy failed to catch on, Medium laid off a chunk of its staff and turned to a subscription model. Users can now pay $5 per month for access to premium stories, and writers can earn small amounts of money when their stories get positive feedback (known as \u201cclaps\u201d) from other users. (Disclosure: Several years ago, I wrote a few freelance stories on Medium, so I periodically get a few cents when someone \u201cclaps\u201d for one of my old posts.) The company has also hired human editors in order to elevate substance over fluff.\u201cThat\u2019s a very particular problem that was caused by the economic model of publishing on the internet,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem I\u2019m trying to fix.\u201dIn social media\u2019s early days, Mr. Williams said, \u201caddiction was the goal.\u201d\u201cNot in the cigarette sense \u2014 it wasn\u2019t as cynical,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was just a game, like: \u2018This is fun. How do we make it more fun and addictive?\u2019\u201dBut he is not convinced that the problems with social platforms can ever be fully solved, nor does he believe it\u2019s entirely incumbent upon tech companies to solve them. Ultimately, Mr. Williams said, it will be up to users to choose, and stick to, their own information diets.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge buffet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you eat whatever\u2019s put in front of you, you\u2019re not necessarily going to be making the best choices.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Shares of Match Group, the company that runs Tinder and other popular dating apps such as OKCupid, plummeted more than 22 percent \u2014 the largest one-day drop in its history \u2014 after Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement.

When you create a profile for the dating service, they said, it will not be visible to your existing Facebook friends. And communications within the dating service will remain separate from the company\u2019s existing messaging services, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.Privacy advocates, however, questioned whether it was wise for a company that had recently faced a public loss of trust over its handling of people\u2019s data to enter the sensitive world of dating preferences.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Tries a New Role: Moral Leader", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen there\u2019s Microsoft, a giant that spent most of the 1990s and early 2000s as tech\u2019s biggest company and villain. It now seems to be auditioning for a different role: the industry\u2019s moral conscience.Among the five most valuable tech companies, Microsoft is the only one to avoid sustained public criticism about contributing to social ills in the last couple of years. At the same time, Satya Nadella, its chief executive, and Brad Smith, its president, have emerged as some of the most outspoken advocates in the industry for protecting user privacy and establishing ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.Echoing a theme he talked about at the conference last year, Mr. Nadella said the industry had a responsibility to build technology that empowered everyone.\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d he said.Microsoft\u2019s new role is partly due to the fact that the company isn\u2019t a major player in social media, video streaming and smartphones \u2014 the products behind the current dark mood around tech. It no longer squeezes the oxygen out of markets as Amazon can.But while the company\u2019s power has diminished since a couple of decades ago, when it controlled computing through Windows, Microsoft remains an influential voice. On Monday, its market capitalization of $733 billion made it the third most valuable technology company, behind Apple and Amazon and ahead of Google parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook.\u201cThe irony for Microsoft is that they lost in search, they lost in social networks and they lost in mobile, and as a consequence, they have avoided the recent pushback from governments and media,\u201d said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cThis has given Microsoft the freedom to take the high road as the ethical leader in technology.\u201dSince taking the reins at Microsoft in 2014, Mr. Nadella has brought a more sensitive style of leadership to the company than his two predecessors, Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. That shift has proved to be more suitable for Microsoft in this era.In a phone interview, Mr. Smith, who is also Microsoft\u2019s chief legal officer, called its legal problems in past decades a \u201cgut-wrenching experience\u201d that had shaped Microsoft in its current form. \u201cIt made Microsoft a better and more responsible company,\u201d he said.\u201cNot only did Microsoft learn from its mistakes, Satya is a unique and caring individual,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Reilly, a tech industry publisher and conference organizer. \u201cHe understands deeply that Microsoft must help others to succeed.\u201dFacebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have defended their advertising businesses for allowing them to deliver services for free. They\u2019ve promised to add more human moderators and invest in software tools that can screen out misinformation and other prohibited content.Mr. Cook has not turned his ire toward Microsoft, which gets most of its revenue from software, hardware and cloud computing services. The company has investments in internet services that are supported in part by advertising, including its Bing search engine and LinkedIn, the social network for professionals it acquired in 2016.Mr. Nadella has been more hesitant than Mr. Cook to publicly criticize other technology companies, turning to more subtle types of persuasion. A low-key leader, Mr. Nadella peppers his speeches and interviews with references to literature, warning that careless creators of technology could contribute to a dystopian world of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d or Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World.\u201d His lieutenant, Mr. Smith, has become a ubiquitous ambassador for Microsoft on the big social issues facing technology in Washington, in Brussels and on the conference circuit.Still, the Microsoft of 2018 is a long way from the company that was once portrayed as a corporate predator.\u201cMicrosoft lived through negativity that these companies are experiencing now, and it doesn\u2019t want to go back to those days,\u201d said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Silicon Valley campus.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said the greater scrutiny on the tech sector would not always fall on the same companies.\u201cAt any given moment, there may be one or two companies in the spotlight,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think one should assume the same one or two are always going to be in the spotlight or always on the defensive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kelly and XXXTentacion From Playlists, Stirring a Debate", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile their music will remain available for streaming by choice, it will no longer appear in Spotify\u2019s influential curated packages, which often appear on the service\u2019s front page. \u201cWe don\u2019t censor content because of an artist\u2019s or creator\u2019s behavior, but we want our editorial decisions \u2014 what we choose to program \u2014 to reflect our values,\u201d Spotify said in a statement. \u201cWhen an artist or creator does something that is especially harmful or hateful, it may affect the ways we work with or support that artist or creator.\u201dOronike Odeleye, a founder of the #MuteRKelly campaign, said she was \u201cjust dumbfounded and awe-struck\u201d that Spotify had \u201cdecided to take this moral stance against R. Kelly\u2019s amoral behavior.\u201d She added, \u201cHopefully it\u2019s a domino effect with the other streaming services.\u201dIn a statement on Thursday, representatives for R. Kelly denounced what they called an \u201congoing smear campaign against him, waged by enemies seeking a payoff,\u201d and called Spotify\u2019s decision \u201cunfortunate and shortsighted.\u201d\u201cSpotify has the right to promote whatever music it chooses, and in this case its actions are without merit,\u201d R. Kelly\u2019s management team said. \u201cIt is acting based on false and unproven allegations. It is bowing to social-media fads and picking sides in a fame-seeking dispute over matters that have nothing to do with serving customers.\u201dUniversal Music, which oversees XXXTentacion\u2019s distributor, Caroline, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. R. Kelly\u2019s label, RCA Records, a division of Sony Music, did not immediately comment either.\u201cAs you can imagine this is a complicated process with room for debate and disagreement, so we can\u2019t get into an artist-by-artist discussion,\u201d a spokesman for Spotify said in response to follow-up questions. \u201cIn general we work with our partners and try to make decisions on a case-by-case basis.\u201dOfficial playlists can be a huge platform, especially for developing artists, on streaming services such as Spotify, which counts more than 70 million paying subscribers worldwide, and on competitors like Apple Music and Amazon Music. Streaming has become the dominant mode for music consumption in the United States \u2014 with hip-hop/R&B representing the most popular genre \u2014 and digital plays are directly correlated to royalty payouts from the services.While R. Kelly, who has not had a Top 40 hit in more than a decade, was unlikely to have appeared recently on a flagship Spotify playlist like Rap Caviar (9.5 million subscribers) or Today\u2019s Top Hits (nearly 20 million), a young artist like XXXTentacion may stand to lose more. His song \u201cSad!,\u201d which had been a popular playlist staple since its release in March, is currently No. 15 on Spotify\u2019s United States Top 50 chart.As of Thursday afternoon, the track still appeared on Apple Music\u2019s premiere rap playlist, \u201cThe A-List: Hip-Hop.\u201d Apple declined to comment on its editorial decisions.Observers on social media were quick to question where exactly Spotify was drawing the line on conduct. The singer Chris Brown, who was convicted in the 2009 felony assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna and is the subject of a restraining order by a subsequent ex-girlfriend, currently appears on Today\u2019s Top Hits as a featured artist on Lil Dicky\u2019s \u201cFreaky Friday.\u201d Other artists who have been accused (but not convicted in court) of violence against women, including Rich the Kid, Famous Dex and YoungBoy Never Broke Again, remained on influential playlists like Rap Caviar on Thursday.Terrence Henderson, the executive known as Punch from Top Dawg Entertainment, home to Kendrick Lamar and SZA, wrote on Twitter: \u201cWhoa. Are they censoring the music? That\u2019s dangerous.\u201dDon Gorder, the chairman of the music business and management department at Berklee College of Music, called Spotify\u2019s decision \u201ca big deal\u201d given the influence of its playlists, but warned that \u201cit is a slippery slope.\u201d\u201cThere are lots of bands in history that have been accused of bad behavior, but they\u2019re not taking the pummeling that R. Kelly is taking,\u201d he said in an interview, adding that while he found R. Kelly\u2019s reported behavior \u201cdeplorable,\u201d the singer had not been convicted in court. Spotify \u201ccreated this new moral standard \u2014 what is it? Where is the line?\u201dSpotify said the decision to no longer promote an artist would be made by an internal committee led by Jonathan Prince, Spotify\u2019s vice president of content and marketplace policy. The company said it had also partnered with advocacy groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center, Glaad and the Anti-Defamation League to help identify hateful content.In its announcement on Thursday, Spotify acknowledged that it was now entering thorny territory when it came to monitoring lyrics and artist behavior. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that cultural standards and sensitivities vary widely,\u201d the company said. \u201cThat means there will always be content that is acceptable in some circumstances, but is offensive in others, and we will always look at the entire context.\u201dAdvertisement"}

America\u2019s opioid crisis? Toxic social media? The legacy of the Confederacy? How about a man who falls in love with a bear and is completely serious about it? No one said this was going to be pretty, but there are some very fine reads out there this year.

It tells of how the impoverished Louise falls into the orbit of the fabulously debauched Lavinia, who adopts her as an instant bestie and gives her clothes, a room, a complete makeover \u2014 everything but the keys to Lavinia\u2019s family manse. Louise moves in, but Lavinia retains control. Sort of. To use one of the book\u2019s favorite phrases, here\u2019s the thing: Lavinia isn\u2019t going to live very long. We\u2019re told that from the start. But the book builds enormous suspense around the questions of how, when and why she will die. And what will happen after that.He writes of how his father\u2019s stubborn nature, profligacy and addiction destroyed the family\u2019s stability. He also writes of his own addiction issues, and the overlap between father\u2019s life and son\u2019s. Simple description does not do Pardlo\u2019s story justice; only his own sublime words can achieve that. \u201cMy father\u2019s example is the storm on the horizon I don\u2019t want to lose sight of and can\u2019t let myself get close to,\u201d he writes. \u201cA lifetime of calibrating these perils of proximity gives me credentials in a kind of metaphysical math, a telemetry of spiritual disaster.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We watch as she pumps breast milk, soothes her baby to sleep atop a humming dryer and lets out a primal scream in a parking lot. Then a night nanny named Tully shows up, promising to make it all better.Some women quickly identified with this messy, uneven portrayal \u2014 because, as any mom will tell you, early motherhood is not about being blissed out and #blessed, it\u2019s a lattice of complex emotions.In the movie\u2019s big reveal, we learn that Tully was a figment of Marlo\u2019s imagination. Though her condition is not named, Marlo appears to be suffering from postpartum psychosis, a rare and dangerous temporary mental illness that affects about one in 1,000 women after they give birth and requires immediate help.\u201cIt just made me feel sick,\u201d said Ms. Whitman, who explained that she had severe anxiety during her first pregnancy and depression afterward. \u201cHad I went to see it, I know that it would have triggered me and upset me quite a bit.\u201dThe film paired Ms. Cody with the director Jason Reitman, whom she also collaborated with on \u201cJuno,\u201d a darkly funny award-winning film about an unplanned pregnancy.Ms. Cody said writing \u201cTully\u201d after the birth of her third son was a \u201cdeeply personal\u201d emotional exercise.\u201cI do think I\u2019m transparent about the fact that I have had mental health issues,\u201d Ms. Cody, 39, said in a phone interview. \u201cMy heart goes out to anyone who\u2019s dealt with this, honestly. Because it\u2019s so ignored.\u201dDiana Spalding, 35, a midwife and pediatric nurse who lives outside Philadelphia and saw the film at an advance screening in April, said it ought to include a warning.Ms. Spalding said she had wanted to see Marlo in treatment, and for the film to make it clear \u201cthat there\u2019s no shame in getting help.\u201dBut the failure to help Marlo is exactly what Ms. Cody intended to portray.\u201cThe movie is actually about her lack of treatment,\u201d Ms. Cody said. In the film, neither Marlo nor her son, who has special needs, receives a diagnosis. (Jonah, Marlo\u2019s son, is mainly described as \u201cquirky.\u201d)Answers to questions about depression screening and maternal mental illness, following new recommendations saying that women should be screened for depression during pregnancy and after childbirth.\u201cSometimes what you're desperate is for someone to say: \u2018Hey, I actually see what\u2019s going on here. This is serious, we need to deal with it and there\u2019s a name for it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Cody said. \u201cAnd Marlo doesn\u2019t get that comfort in this film. Because the film is meant to be uncomfortable.\u201dThose who have come to the filmmakers\u2019 defense agree.\u201cIt seems like we live in a day and age where everything causes a trigger for somebody or is Politically Incorrect in one way or another,\u201d Mercedes Tiffany Murphy, 44, of Hudson, Mass., wrote on Facebook. She, too, has experienced postpartum depression, but that didn\u2019t influence her feelings about the film. \u201cIt is art and an expression of creativity. There have been many times where the movie has nothing to do with the advertisements and trailers.\u201dMs. Cody, who was not involved in the editing of the trailer, admitted that dramedies like \u201cTully\u201d can be difficult to promote.\u201cI\u2019m frankly not surprised that the studio chose to emphasize the warmer, more relatable comedic elements of the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cThe purpose of marketing is not to educate or to responsibly inform the consumer. They\u2019re trying to sell tickets.\u201dJason Cassidy, the president of marketing at Focus Features, the film\u2019s distributor in the United States, said, \u201cIt was our challenge when marketing the film to find that balance between telling the story of 'Tully\u2019 without giving away the ending.\u201dAfter watching it, they said the early scenes portrayed depression beautifully but they found the ending upsetting.These disorders \u201ccan be overwhelming, destructive to families and potentially life threatening if not treated,\u201d Ms. Smith said in a statement. She hopes the film prompts a nationwide discussion.Ms. Cody, when asked if she had spoken with any experts on maternal mental illness before writing the script, said she \u201cabsolutely did not\u201d and stands by that decision.\u201cI have had my own experiences and my own research,\u201d she said.One movie cannot possibly tell everyone\u2019s story, she added. \u201cSo why can\u2019t we have 10 more movies?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Like Jeffrey\u2019s Grocery and Joseph Leonard, its name comes from a relative \u2014 in this case, Mr. Stulman\u2019s 6-year-old son, who apparently received an impressive collection of whale-decorated baby gifts.Also familiar to Mr. Stulman\u2019s regulars will be the style of the servers. They\u2019re young, talkative, fresh-faced, enthusiastic, as if they are new to the city and haven\u2019t yet grown the protective exoskeleton of the hardened New Yorker.Our waiter one night showered us with recommendations for dishes, all of which he loved. We asked him about things he hadn\u2019t mentioned. He loved those, too. He loved the cocktails, a Happy Cooking strong suit, and was especially keen on one made with mezcal. \u201cMezcal never hurt anybody,\u201d he said brightly. Extensive personal research suggests this is untrue.One place where Simon & the Whale allows itself to spread out beyond the normal boundaries of the Stulman kingdom is breads and desserts. The restaurant shares a baker, Zoe Kanan, and a pastry chef, Charmaine McFarlane, with the hotel\u2019s second-floor cafe, Studio, also run by Happy Cooking. Both are very good at their jobs.Ms. Kanan makes the black, thick-crusted barley-rye bread flecked with anise seeds that comes with a halfhearted taramosalata and, more excitingly, a swipe of butter creamed with seaweed powder. The long thin toast, crackling with grains and seeds that sits under cured and smoked Arctic char and smoked sour cream? Hers. The poppy-seed torpedo roll that helps lift the fish sandwich with carrot-squash slaw above the ordinary? Also hers, although to be fair the long, flat fries also do their part.I can\u2019t say I\u2019m as taken with crunchy knotweed-rhubarb compote as a topping for a buckwheat cake as Ms. McFarlane seems to be, but the same dessert offers one of the most astonishing ice creams around. Made with beeswax, it is as deeply aromatic as honey but not as sweet, and its texture is intensely creamy but not at all waxy.The rest of the menu is in the hands of Matt Griffin, until recently in charge of the food at Fedora and Bar Sardine. He does a neat balancing trick here, giving his adventurous side free rein at times while more often using it to add interest to the standards a hotel restaurant probably needs.A winningly over-the-top recent special was a custard-soaked pain perdu under bacon jus, pickled cabbage and speck, like some kind of demented Reuben-croque monsieur hybrid. Liver and onions turned out to be a less thrilling snack: pickled onions with deep-fried and overcooked chicken livers.Until it swam off the menu, there was an intriguing sideways version of squid ink risotto that had beech mushrooms and very tender squid confit over a black porridge of barley. Now there are spring peas, swirled with mint into a sauce for just-firm shrimp; the combination suggested pasta, but I was glad to have it without any starch getting in the way of the clear, sweet flavors.If it\u2019s pasta you want, Mr. Griffin has a glossy, chile-speckled bowl of spaghetti acqua pazza with littleneck clams and cherry tomatoes, and while the sauce is thicker and glossier than a normal acqua pazza, it is very good. What he calls a pork-collar Milanese is maybe a few millimeters too thick for the name, but I\u2019ll take it. The cut is more flavorful than a normal cutlet, and the apricot mostarda makes a pungent and welcome counterpoint.If you can\u2019t finish the whole thing, it will be taken away and replaced by a plastic action figure of a New York sports hero. This is your claim check. Mine was Don Mattingly, and I wondered if maybe the applause was for him.No, Mr. Stulman said on the phone a few days later. The woman he bought Fedora from, who has since died, was 89 when she sold it and was still showing up each night. When she entered, people clapped. \u201cWe turned that into clapping for our friends,\u201d he said.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bridging the Gap Between Mothers and Daughters in Iran", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn her project \u201cThe Wall,\u201d Mojgan Ghanbari sought to start a dialogue between Iranian mothers and daughters.\u201cI came to this realization that young women are influenced by their parents,\u201d Ms. Ghanbari said. And yet, she added, \u201cI felt like there might be a border, there might be something like a wall we create at a certain age between ourselves and our parents.\u201dThat invisible barrier is a universal aspect of young adulthood, one that surfaces the moment we realize we inherit so much from our elders, yet lead completely different lives. For many young Iranian women today, that gap is widened by several factors, the most obvious being the Islamic Revolution. Her latest project, \u201cThe Wall,\u201d explores that generational tension as it aims to answer two vital questions: \u201cHow does this gap influence our relationship with our mothers as the first feminine figures we see in life?\u201d \u201cHow could we communicate better with each other?\u201d \u201cI wanted to talk about generations but in an intimate, poetic way,\u201d Ms. Ghanbari said, emphasizing that she aimed to highlight underlying similarities across cultures rather than apparent differences.Under the Pahlavi dynasty, which reigned from 1925 to 1979, women experienced relative freedom in the region: The hijab, the Islamic head scarf, was banned; the minimum age for marriage was raised; and unjust divorce laws were made slightly fairer.But the 1979 Islamic Revolution reversed decades\u2019 worth of progress toward gender equality, imposing a political ideology that restrains women through discriminatory religious laws and limits their societal roles to mothers and housewives. As a result, many women today don\u2019t relate to some of their mothers\u2019 experiences growing up before the revolution. \u201cFor years I was so jealous of what my mom had in her young age,\u201d Ms. Ghanbari, 28, said. While leafing through her mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s photo albums, she yearned for experiences her generation never had: walking through the streets of Tehran in colorful skirts instead of compulsory veils; strolling along the Caspian Sea coast in bikinis. \u201cIt sounds surreal more than anything else,\u201d Ms. Ghanbari said. She later came to think that those liberties comprised a \u201ckind-of\u201d freedom. \u201cPatriarchal power, sexism, was still there,\u201d she said.Combined with the changes brought by globalization and the digital age, Ms. Ghanbari says those positive steps have inspired young women to seek more opportunities than their mothers could have. But they have also created barriers between the generations. Ms. Ghanbari says she has seen many young Iranian women keeping things from their mothers not out of fear of retribution, but out of fear of misunderstanding or judgment. She set out to examine, and possibly bridge, that gap with \u201cThe Wall,\u201d a series of mother-daughter portraits, photos from family albums and detail shots capturing her subjects\u2019 daily lives. She concluded that mother-daughter relationships in traditional societies the world over are most affected by the values the women do or don\u2019t share. Those differences \u201ccreate a wall between them,\u201d Ms. Ghanbari said. But, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think that wall is going to be there forever.\u201d All women have to do is let each other in.Advertisement"}

Some consultants, such as McKinsey & Company and the Boston Consulting Group, carried blue chip pedigrees, while SCL, founded in 1993 as Strategic Communication Laboratories, was known for its clandestine work.The notion that the company\u2019s psychological research played a role in plotting out the Saudi reform efforts could fuel renewed debate about the intentions of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The prince is variously seen as his region\u2019s most important social and economic reformer, a ruthless opportunist or some combination of the two.SCL\u2019s work was shrouded in secrecy, but one former analyst at the company, James Lovell, who listed the Saudi project on his LinkedIn profile, said he \u201canalysed focus group data, contributed to presentations and wrote reports for a research project on economic reform in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d A project manager at Cambridge Analytica, Alexandra Wicksell, wrote in her profile on the same site that the work was \u201cfocused on developing the national reform initiative for the country\u2019s drive to diversify its economy away from its oil dependency.\u201dOthers who saw the work described it less benignly.One Western consultant, who was not involved in the project but who viewed SCL\u2019s report, referred to the firm\u2019s finding as \u201cMachiavellian,\u201d calling it a manual for the royals to manage popular sentiment by figuring out where they should loosen their grip. The consultant said the report used dozens of focus groups to examine levels of frustration and satisfaction, as well as the legitimacy of the royal family and the political structure, and showed there was widespread discontent.The consultant\u2019s account was consistent with that of a former employee at SCL. The company\u2019s work, said the former employee, was aimed at conducting a behavioral analysis of the population and then creating strategies to keep the government viable in an era of declining oil prices.A company executive referred to the work as advancing human rights but declined to comment further. The Saudi government declined to comment.The research by the consultancy was taking place against a bleak new reality. Oil fell to below $30 a barrel in 2016 from more than $100 in 2014. That presented severe economic risks in a country where 70 percent of the population is under 30.SCL had worked in Saudi Arabia before. It was listed among the countries where the firm had clients on a 2014 PowerPoint presentation obtained by The New York Times. Its most recent work was commissioned by the Saudi Ministry of Economy and Planning, one of the ministries carrying out the Vision 2030 plan.To what extent the company influenced the kingdom\u2019s plans is hard to say. But in Prince Mohammed\u2019s telling, winning over the population has been a critical first step.An earlier version of this article misstated when SCL Group conducted a project in Libya. It was after Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was no longer in power, not during his tenure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Data Protection Law Is a Big, Confusing Mess", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Cool is a professor of anthropology and information science at the University of Colorado, Boulder.There\u2019s just one problem: No one understands the G.D.P.R.The law is staggeringly complex. After three years of intense lobbying and contentious negotiation, the European Parliament published a draft, which then received some 4,000 amendment proposals, a reflection of the divergent interests at stake. Corporations, governments and academic institutions all process personal data, but they use it for different purposes.There\u2019s another reason for the regulation\u2019s complexity and ambiguity: What are often framed as legal and technical questions are also questions of values. The European Union\u2019s 28 member states have different historical experiences and contemporary attitudes about data collection. Germans, recalling the Nazis\u2019 deadly efficient use of information, are suspicious of government or corporate collection of personal data; people in Nordic countries, on the other hand, link the collection and organization of data to the functioning of strong social welfare systems.Thus, the regulation is intentionally ambiguous, representing a series of compromises. It promises to ease restrictions on data flows while allowing citizens to control their personal data, and to spur European economic growth while protecting the right to privacy. It skirts over possible differences between current and future technologies by using broad principles.But those broad principles don\u2019t always accord with current data practices. The regulation requires those who process personal data to demonstrate accountability in part by limiting data collection and processing what is necessary for a specific purpose, forbidding other uses. That may sound good, but machine learning, for example \u2014 one of the most active areas of research in artificial intelligence, used for targeted advertising, self-driving cars and more \u2014 uses data to train computer systems to make decisions that cannot be specified in advance, derived from the original data or explained after the fact.In 2017, the year after the regulation was approved, I interviewed scientists, data managers, legal scholars, lawyers, ethicists and activists in Sweden. I learned that many scientists and data managers who will be subject to the law find it incomprehensible. They doubted that absolute compliance was even possible.Many of the law\u2019s broad principles, though they avoid references to specific technologies, are nevertheless based on already outdated assumptions about technology. \u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that they imagined some company that has your data physically stored somewhere, and you have the right to take it out,\u201d a law professor told me of the G.D.P.R.\u2019s approach to data portability. But in the era of big data and cloud services, data rarely exists in only one place.What the regulation really means is likely to be decided in European courts, which is sure to be a drawn-out and confusing process.Still, the G.D.P.R. is not a lost cause. We do need rules about data. But legal frameworks, particularly when they are long, complex and ambiguous, can\u2019t be the only or even the primary resource guiding the day-to-day work of data protection.If the ultimate goal is to change what people do with our data, we need more research that looks carefully at how personal data is collected and by whom, and how those people make decisions about data protection. Policymakers should use such studies as a basis for developing empirically grounded, practical rules.In the end, pragmatic guidelines that make sense to people who work with data might do a lot more to protect our personal data than a law that promises to change the internet but can\u2019t explain how.Alison Cool is a professor of anthropology and information science at the University of Colorado, Boulder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hand-Me-Down Plane That Crashed Reflects a Cuban Air Industry in Crisis", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Almost 40 years old by the time it crashed on Friday just outside of Havana, killing 110 people, the aging Boeing 737 had changed ownership nearly a half-dozen times, passing from operators in the United States to Canada, from Cameroon to the Caribbean.\u201cI actually flew that exact plane,\u201d said John Cox, the head of the consultancy Safety Operating Systems, who traced the aircraft\u2019s ownership back to 1979, when it was new and belonged to Piedmont Airlines, his former employer.Though the cause of the crash has not been determined, the plane itself is a powerful symbol of Cuba\u2019s troubled aviation industry. As tourism to the island surges, Cuba\u2019s national airline finds itself struggling to acquire enough planes to meet the demand and maintain its decrepit fleet.Cuba\u2019s economy has long been in shambles, and experts say the troubles plaguing its aviation sector stem from the same obstacles that have bedeviled the country for decades: economic mismanagement and the United States embargo of the island.Cuba\u2019s problems have gotten so bad that, a few weeks ago, the country grounded most of its domestic flights because of safety concerns over its fleet. To continue flying, officials have been forced to lease planes from foreign outfits that sometimes use decades-old planes, like the one that crashed and burned right after takeoff on Friday, killing nearly everyone on board.The old Boeing 737 had been leased to Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n, the state airline, by a relatively unknown Mexican company with just three aircraft in its fleet.Some aviation industry analysts were taken aback at the plane\u2019s advanced age.\u201cThat\u2019s one of the oldest passenger jets I have heard of that is still in service,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, an aviation and aerospace consulting company in Fairfax, Va.Though Mexican officials said the plane had passed safety inspections as recently as November, it is one of just 100 of its model still in circulation across the globe, reflecting the limited options the Cuban government has in order to continue operating its state airline.\u201cWhether the airline is going to survive is an open question,\u201d said George Farinas, a retired Delta pilot who works as a civil aviation inspector and is writing a book about the history of Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n. \u201cThey are in a major crisis right now.\u201dMr. Farinas said that Cuban officials even decided in the past against working with the Mexican company, Damojh Aerol\u00edneas, also known as Global Air, after the flight crew that came with the lease got lost in the air on one trip. But they eventually reversed the decision, he said, \u201cprobably out of desperation.\u201dAdel Yzquierdo Rodr\u00edguez, Cuba\u2019s transportation minister, said Saturday that Cubana had been renting the plane for less than a month from Damojh, and that under the rental arrangement, the Mexican owner was responsible for the aircraft\u2019s maintenance.Analysts sometimes disagree about which is more to blame for Cuba\u2019s troubled aviation industry: the American embargo of the island or the country\u2019s own history of economic mismanagement.Some experts say the sanctions have crippled the nation\u2019s ability to gain access to the vendors and financing needed to get new aircraft. The Cubans themselves have made the case numerous times, blaming the decades-old sanctions for their aging planes, which include Russian-made aircraft that are difficult to find parts for.\u201cIf it were not for the embargo, they would be able to access a robust capital market for financing Western aircraft,\u201d said Samuel Engel, the senior vice president at ICF Consulting and an expert in the international airline industry.But many analysts say that, while a process is involved, Cuba can indeed get access to such markets, as well as planes.\u201cThe embargo does play a role in inhibiting business with Cuba, but there are policies to promote the sale of aircraft,\u201d said Dallas Woodrum, an associate at Akin Gump in the firm\u2019s Washington office. \u201cWhether businesses decide to take advantage of that is a different question, and a matter of their risk tolerance and what type of reward they see.\u201dCuba also suffers from a cash flow problem that further hinders the purchase of international goods \u2014 a product of the sanctions but also, critics say, its poor stewardship of the economy.\u201cThe challenge is that they don\u2019t manage the industry well,\u201d said Emilio Morales, president of the Miami-based Havana Consulting Group, which focuses on the Cuban economy. \u201cThe business requires capital; it requires financing to maintain the planes.\u201dFounded in 1929, Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n was once the pride of the Caribbean, replete with modern planes and top-flight maintenance. But as with so many elements of Cuba\u2019s infrastructure and transportation, that progress began to slowly, and then suddenly halt, following the revolution, economic sanctions and, later, the fall of the Soviet Union, which had helped keep the nation afloat financially.Cars hailing from the 1960s roll down pockmarked streets, past unpainted buildings and under worn bridges. And while the government has maintained its commitment to social services, whether free health care or education, money has grown scarce.That reality has set in for the airline industry, leaving the state airline with limited options to upgrade old planes or get new ones.Cubana has struggled with a spotty safety record in the past \u2014 including several crashes in the late 1990s that left scores dead. The tragedies include crashes in Ecuador, Guatemala, Venezuela and off the island\u2019s southeast coast.Friday\u2019s crash occurred just after noon, following the plane\u2019s departure from Havana for the eastern city of Holgu\u00edn. Emergency workers and nearby residents raced to the scene, where the battered remnants of the plane kicked up plumes of thick smoke, trying to rescue survivors.Ramiro Santana Mart\u00ednez, 46, a construction worker who lives about 50 yards from the crash site, said he was near his house when he heard an explosion, quickly followed by a second one.He joined neighbors and strangers who converged on the smoldering husk of the plane, looking for survivors. Mr. Santana said charred bodies, some dismembered, were scattered across the site; some had been thrown clear of the wreckage.A volunteer rescuer spotted movement under some fallen branches: a woman\u2019s hand. Mr. Santana and others rushed to help pull the crying woman out and get her to an ambulance. She was burned and bloodied but conscious.Mr. Santana said he also helped pull out two other people, both men, who were breathing at the time but inert. Cuban officials said three women ended up surviving the crash, though they were in listed in \u201cextreme critical\u201d condition on Saturday.Mr. Yzquierdo, the transportation minister, said that among the 110 dead were 99 Cuban passengers, two Argentine passengers and two passengers from a disputed area of the Western Sahara.Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Yzquierdo, said that 15 victims had been identified so far, including 10 adults and five children.Those on board the plane included five crew members, all Mexican. As part of its contract, Cubana hired them to operate the aircraft, an agreement known as a wet lease. There was no specific mention of their condition as of Saturday afternoon, but the three survivors identified by the Cuban government did not include the crew members.Leticia Nu\u00f1ez, the sister of the flight\u2019s captain, Jorge Luis Nu\u00f1ez Santos, said that her family had only heard the information reported in the media, and had not received any further details from Mexican authorities. Ms. Nu\u00f1ez said she assumed the worst, but was still waiting for official confirmation.\u201cSometimes crew members change, someone gets in late \u2014 we don\u2019t lose hope, we can\u2019t,\u201d she said in an interview over Facebook.Abigail Hern\u00e1ndez, another Mexican crew member, posted a picture on her Facebook page last February in which she is seen standing and smiling in front of a red telephone box, with the comment: \u201cHappy to get to know the world.\u201dThe transportation minister explained that it was \u201cnormal\u201d for the Cuban government to rent airplanes.\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cBecause it\u2019s convenient and also because of the problem of the embargo we face, which means we sometimes can\u2019t buy planes, the planes we need, and we have to rent them.\u201dFrances Robles contributed reporting from Key West, Fla., and Paulina Villegas from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "75-Year-Old Mayor Is Attacked in Greece, and Nationalists Rejoice", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHESSALONIKI, Greece \u2014 The 75-year-old mayor of Greece\u2019s second-largest city was brutally assaulted by a far-right mob at a public gathering over the weekend, an attack that brought gleeful expressions of support from nationalist groups and heightened concerns about a rise in hate crime in the country.The mayor, Yiannis Boutaris, who is known for his liberalism and outspoken views against far-right violence and racism, was attacked Saturday afternoon in the northern city of Thessaloniki by about a dozen people during a ceremony commemorating the World War I genocide of Pontic Greeks by Turkish forces.Nationalist groups, notably the far-right Golden Dawn, have capitalized on growing frustration in Greece. The economy has been hobbled by years of austerity imposed on the debt-racked country by international creditors, and a huge migrant influx has further strained tensions.Greece has often been the first port of call in Europe for migrants fleeing war and economic misery in Afghanistan, Syria, countries in Africa and elsewhere.Prosectors ordered an investigation on Monday to determine the \u201cmoral instigators\u201d of the attack on Mr. Boutaris, and four men who were arrested in connection with it \u2014 a 36-year-old, two 20-year-olds and a 17-year-old who have not been publicly identified \u2014 were charged with causing bodily harm, vandalism and disturbing the peace.It was unclear whether the men were acting on their own or aligned with a far-right group, but members of nationalist, anti-immigrant organizations were conspicuous in praising an attack that was otherwise condemned by others on the political spectrum.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras condemned the \u201cbarbaric\u201d attack on Mr. Boutaris in a speech to his cabinet on Monday in which he also hit out at \u201ca dark and extreme section of the main opposition\u201d that, he said, \u201clays out the carpet for the far right.\u201dWhile also condemning the attack, the conservative opposition New Democracy, which is leading Mr. Tsipras\u2019s leftist party, Syriza, in opinion polls, responded by accusing the prime minister of the \u201cpolitical and moral legitimization of violence\u201d through \u201cpolarizing and toxic rhetoric.\u201dMembers of far-right groups, however, could barely contain their excitement. \u201cBravo to each and every one who carried out his duty in Thessaloniki today. Respect,\u201d wrote Ourania Michaloliakou, the daughter of Nikos Michaloliakos, the leader of Golden Dawn, on Twitter. In another, she wrote, \u201cMy God, why can\u2019t I be in Thessaloniki today,\u201d adding, \u201cWell done, dudes.\u201dChristos Paschalidis, an official with a nationalist group, Anasa, in the northern city of Kavala, struck a similar note with a post on Facebook, saying that Mr. Boutaris \u201cgot what he deserves. Well done to the boys.\u201d\u201cNow it\u2019s the turn of the traitor\u201d lawmakers, he added, using a term often used by populists to condemn politicians who backed Greece\u2019s acceptance of international bailouts that imposed years of austerity on the country.The assault was the focus of a front-page story by a Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, with the headline, \u201cAn attack on friendship.\u201d That was an apparent reference to Mr. Boutaris\u2019s championing of closer ties between Greece and its traditional rival, Turkey, and efforts to increase tourism between the two countries.Mr. Boutaris has hailed Thessaloniki as the birthplace of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the progressive founder of modern Turkey, and he has been instrumental in pushing plans for the creation of a Holocaust museum in the city, which lost some 50,000 Jews to the Nazis.In March, statistics from the Greek police showed that hate crimes more than doubled last year, with 184 attacks recorded, compared with 84 in 2016. Some observers have said that most assaults go unreported and that the actual figures are much higher.Speaking to the municipal council Monday evening, Mr. Boutaris called on all Greek political parties to condemn violence and marginalize \u201cthugs of all kinds.\u201d\u201cThere is no other way,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause tomorrow someone else will be in my place, and will be beaten \u2014 for his ideas, for his religion, for his sexual orientation, for the color of his skin, for being different.\u201d\u201cFor as long as I am mayor I will not allow Thessaloniki to return to an era of darkness,\u201d he added, citing the killing of the leftist politician Grigoris Lambrakis by right-wing thugs in 1963 during the protracted social tension that followed Greece\u2019s civil war.Advertisement"}

He had a fully charged AirPod in his ear, a giant bag of SunChips within reach and DVDs of his favorite old music videos to play.But all that would come later. \u201cThe first thing I do every morning is I taste the ice cream,\u201d said Mr. Vasquez, filling up the hoppers of his soft-serve machine with chocolate and vanilla mix. \u201cI make sure the ice cream is good.\u201dGood: A light, airy, melt-away texture that can maintain its form as it\u2019s rolled sideways in chocolate sprinkles, or dropped upside down into a vat of warm, waxy blue dip. A smooth, dense-but-not-too-dense consistency in the mouth, and a long, clean flavor.Mr. Vasquez is one of about 200 Mister Softee drivers who roam the city, dispensing the sweet, industrially engineered flavors of summer to a jangling soundtrack. They lap parks and residential blocks, pull up strategically near the exits of schools and public swimming pools and punctuate sunny days with milkshakes, ice pops and cones.All the truck drivers start with the same prepackaged cartons of liquid mix, but the quality of their ice cream isn\u2019t uniform. Machines malfunction in countless ways, and some vendors worry more over the details than others. Dirty tubes can lend the ice cream unpleasant off-notes and aftertastes. And a faulty temperature control setting often produces ice cream that\u2019s too stiff or too soft.Mr. Vasquez, who at 50 has wiry, muscular arms and a graying, impeccably groomed goatee, said most machines tended to be 2 to 4 degrees off. Over time, he has come to rely on his senses, and not a dial, to find the ideal setting (about 18 degrees).If Mr. Vasquez has a feel for the work, it\u2019s because he\u2019s been driving a Mister Softee truck for 31 years. His father, Lautaro Vasquez, drove one for 40 years before retiring in 2011.But this year\u2019s unrelenting cold weather threw off the calendar, said Peter Bouziotis, who has been distributing ice cream from the Bronx depot for 22 years. So most drivers started selling about six weeks late.\u201cThat\u2019s six weeks you\u2019re never going to get back,\u201d Mr. Bouziotis said.Mr. Vasquez said long hours don\u2019t bother him, and neither does being alone in the truck. What\u2019s tough is how everything \u2014 everything \u2014 in the ice cream business depends on the weather. How one day, one week, one year can be so vastly different from the next.Mr. Vasquez arrived at the depot around 10 a.m., order in hand, and Mr. Bouziotis slid box after box across the counter \u2014 waffle cones, slush bases, sprinkles and syrups. (For the last three summers, the biggest prepackaged seller has been a SpongeBob SquarePants pop, followed by a Minions pop.)Close to the water on the Upper East Side, at the edge of Carl Schurz Park, Mr. Vasquez pulled up on the corner of 84th Street and East End Avenue, where he would stay put for most of the day. It was a beautiful Saturday morning and the sun was out, but a chilled breeze came off the East River \u2014 the kind that was bad for business.Mr. Vasquez cut all the fruit for the sundaes, and organized his garnishes. He rearranged the freezer so the most popular items were easy to reach. On the truck\u2019s TV screen, just above the dashboard, he played videos and concert clips of Celine Dion, Lionel Richie, Phil Collins and the Eagles.It\u2019s not just that he\u2019s avoiding a ticket for a noise violation. Mr. Vasquez said people tend to know he\u2019s around, because he is always around \u2014 he has been around for three decades \u2014 standing behind these gleaming machines with a baseball cap on, ready to go.\u201cGive me a vanilla two-face,\u201d said a twentysomething man working on the building across the street, still wearing his hard hat. Mr. Vasquez made him a cone half-covered in rainbow sprinkles and half in chocolate sprinkles, moving quickly and elegantly in the narrow space.Over the next six hours, Mr. Vasquez composed swirled cones and chocolate dips. He made fruit-topped cups and sundaes drowned in syrup, strawberry milkshakes and root beer floats.When kids charged the truck from the playground, shouting over one another, Mr. Vasquez easily deciphered their orders. Teenagers sharing one large frozen yogurt got extra spoons before they could ask.\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d a woman in a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses said, handing him back the change. \u201cWe owe you a dollar from last weekend, remember?\u201dMr. Vasquez said he once had an offer for steadier, full-time work as a doorman on the Upper East Side, but he didn\u2019t take it. \u201cI love to deal with all this,\u201d he said, gesturing toward the line \u2014 negotiating parents, screaming children, chaos. \u201cI love to make ice cream.\u201dAs the temperature dropped, the line dispersed, and Mr. Vasquez\u2019s father, climbed up into the truck. At 77, Lautaro Vasquez visits his family a few times a week to chat, run errands or deliver them lunch as they work (say, a quart container of caldo de salchicha). As a bonus, he can run the truck for a while if anyone needs a break.Before he moved to the United States and became a citizen, Lautaro put on a suit every day and taught primary school in Ecuador. He worked in restaurants in New Jersey as a busboy, and in Midtown Manhattan office buildings, pushing a coffee cart.When he bought his first Mister Softee ice cream truck in the 1970s, it cost $8,000, and though it didn\u2019t come with power steering, it did come with a route around Union Square. (A new truck now goes for about $140,000.) The soft-serve machines were more demanding back then, and Lautaro remembers how he had to stop and refill the hopper after every fourth cone, or the ice cream wouldn\u2019t flow at all.\u201cPrueba,\u201d Lautaro said. He had brought a cup of vanilla soft serve from the truck that his daughter was driving, and he wanted his son\u2019s opinion on it. \u201cPrueba, prueba!\u201dMr. Vasquez tasted and nodded with approval. Sure, the weather could have been better, but today the ice cream was good.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blurred Lines Between Journalists and What We Cover", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 60______\u201cI\u2019m a foreign correspondent for The New York Times,\u201d I told her. \u201cI can\u2019t really help because at some point, somewhere, there\u2019s a good chance I may cover what you do.\u201dI always feel bad trying to explain journalistic detachment in such moments, and I often get looks of confusion in response.Young people in particular tend to question the limits that many of us at The Times take for granted: no marching for a cause, no advocacy and no giving or accepting of travel or gifts when dealing with sources or organizations that have an interest in news coverage.We are expected, in short, to avoid the \u201cappearance of bias\u201d and maintain a sense of healthy detachment from what we cover.But I believe in the limits. I think they make for better, more trustworthy (if still imperfect) journalism \u2014 and I\u2019ve been thinking more about that here in Australia because I often see them challenged.This week, a few examples come to mind:\u2022 Checkbook JournalismLet\u2019s start with Barnaby Joyce, the (former) deputy prime minister.The heat he\u2019s taken this week for accepting $150,000 from the Seven Network for an interview alongside Vikki Campion \u2014 his partner and former staff member who is the mother of his newborn child \u2014 is just the latest example of the mess made when money and access mingle.Watching the criticism that led him to take a leave of absence, I found myself wondering what was part of the negotiation. Would the public be getting a less candid interview if the price for access had been $50,000? Would we get more if it was $200,000? (These are Australian dollar amounts, in case you\u2019re wondering.)\u2022 The Lucrative Revolving DoorWhat about the other ways that journalists and government cozy up to each other?Neither seemed to be punished by their audiences or their bosses.Maybe that\u2019s just a function of a partisan media culture, where many politics reporters and editors have also acted as political advisers, or gone back and forth between both worlds. The revolving door is not unique to Australia \u2014 George Stephanopoulos worked in the Clinton White House before joining ABC News \u2014 but it\u2019s definitely common and accepted here.John Garnaut\u2019s case is also interesting.There\u2019s value, of course, in subject-specific expertise, but when there are so many blurred lines between government and journalism, it can be hard to figure out whether what we\u2019re learning from what we read or watch includes all the relevant details, or just those that serve a particular argument, political party or paying client.\u2022 The Junket IndustryThe calls and emails no longer surprise me: At least three or four times in the past year, a well-meaning and interesting Australian organization has offered to fly me somewhere and pay for my hotel accommodation so I could witness what it does.In every case, I\u2019ve said no and politely explained that our ethics guidelines forbid that sort of thing except in the most extreme circumstances (military flights in war zones, for example).I\u2019ve also turned down a number of freelance pitches that would have been financed by those seeking coverage \u2014 again, explaining that accepting payment from an organization or cause we are covering creates a problematic expectation of positive coverage, making it harder for us to be seen as dispassionate observers.I honestly don\u2019t know how common it is for journalism in Australia to be financed by those with a vested interest, but anecdotally, it seems to be on the rise. In a conversation with one of the organizations offering me a trip, I asked why and was told that with Australian media outlets making cutbacks, junkets were often the only way they could cover certain issues.In the latter case, in Good Weekend, there was a note providing much-needed transparency, stating, \u201cTim Elliott and Kate Geraghty traveled to Guatemala and Mexico with Australia for UNHCR, an Australian charity that raises funds to support the U.N. refugee agency.\u201dI couldn\u2019t see any sign of bias in the article, and I\u2019m sincerely torn about whether this kind of thing is cause for concern. If it was a choice between a story about Central America or no story at all, I suppose I would choose the story, with an explanation of who paid for the journey.But what all these examples show is that the boundary between source (or interest group) and journalist can be shaped, if not erased, in ways that threaten to hamper candid reporting.Given the context, saying no to signing a petition for Doctors Without Borders may seem extreme. And maybe it is. But when there are so many forces pushing journalism to abandon independence and nonpartisan storytelling, you have to draw the line somewhere.______It\u2019s changing Britain in ways big and small, as eight years of budget-cutting make the country look less like the rest of Europe and more like the United States, with a shrinking welfare state and spreading poverty.Peter S. Goodman\u2019s piece is one of many on the way that will look at Britain\u2019s moment of profound challenge in a post-Brexit world.______We published a special section this week on 30 of the world\u2019s greatest visionaries, those who are combining passion with science, technology, creativity and innovation.Meet five people using medical and scientific breakthroughs to improve the quality of life, from cancer to the white rhino.______Something about the reality of this really pleased me, both for those I\u2019ve been to and those I have not yet visited.______My \u201cTrump of the Week\u201d idea in last week\u2019s newsletter clearly bombed. A few of you wrote to tell me to kill it. Fine. You win.______OpinionNewsCulture______Once again, I\u2019m in a moment where I\u2019ve run out of recommendations \u2014 so I\u2019m coming to you with my hands open wide. What have you seen, heard, read, eaten or experienced recently that you think I should know about and the readers of this newsletter should know about?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Baby\u2019s Hand Was Mummified. Why Wasn\u2019t the Rest of Its Body?", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first, J\u00e1nos Bal\u00e1zs had no idea why the tiny hand he found in a storage box of bones was green and mummified. It was around 2005 and he was examining remains from an earlier archaeological dig of a cemetery conducted at Ny\u00e1rl\u0151rinc, a village in southern Hungary. The excavations had yielded more than 500 graves that mostly dated from between the 12th and 16th centuries. But none of those burials was anything like the mummified green hand Dr. Bal\u00e1zs and his colleague, Zolt\u00e1n B\u00f6lkei, had uncovered in that forgotten box.The bones Dr. Bal\u00e1zs found were so small they could have been confused with a rat\u2019s. Several, including some vertebrae, a hip bone and the leg bones were stained green. Both forearms were green as well, but the right one was still covered in desiccated flesh. The skin near the back was also mummified and embedded with five vertebrae pieces. Most of the ribs, a shoulder bone and two humerus bones were not discolored. From inspecting the tiny skeleton, Dr. Bal\u00e1zs determined the deceased was either a stillbirth or premature baby that died shortly after birth. The researchers concluded the child was 11 to 13 inches and weighed only one or two pounds. Archaeologically speaking, green bones are not uncommon at grave sites. Bronze or copper jewelry can often discolor skeletons as they degrade, and Dr. Bal\u00e1zs thought the child\u2019s body came in contact with some sort of metal. But how did that mystery metal object end up near its tiny hands? They performed a chemical analysis on the remains and found that the child had copper levels that were hundreds of times more than average. In fact, they said, the levels were the highest ever seen in a mummy.Dr. Bal\u00e1zs soon discovered that a nearby museum also had storage boxes from the dig where the baby was found. When he examined the boxes, he found the clues he needed: a small ceramic pot and a corroded copper coin.\u201cWe started to see the actual story unfold,\u201d said Dr. Bereczki.The team concluded that before the child was placed in the pot and buried, someone put the copper coin into its hand. Many cultures in antiquity have buried their dead with coins as a way to pay a mythical ferryman to take their souls into the afterlife.In this case, the copper\u2019s antimicrobial properties protected the child\u2019s hand from decay. Along with the conditions inside the vessel, it helped mummify the baby\u2019s grasp. The team thinks this child\u2019s burial may be one of the first reported cases in the scientific literature of copper-driven mummification. The child, the team said, was most likely in a crouched position. That allowed the copper corrosion to stain other parts of the skeleton. The team also found evidence of two more burials of premature babies. One had green bones, and the team found its coin and pot, but the other did not. Though the copper coin solved one mystery, it presented another. The specific copper coin, or \u201cKreuzer\u201d or \u201ckrajc\u00e1r,\u201d that was found with the baby was in circulation between 1858 and 1862. That meant the burial did not occur during Medieval times. Traditionally, Christians from this later time period have not been known to bury loved ones holding coins.Dr. Bal\u00e1zs and Dr. Bereczki speculate that because this child died either before or immediately after it was born, it was most likely not baptized. They think that whoever buried the child in the pot with a coin did so in hopes of finding some way to send the child into the afterlife.And in a way, it worked.\u201cThey kind of succeeded at saving not necessarily the soul, but some kind of legacy of this little kid,\u201d said Dr. Bereczki, \u201cbecause here we are still talking about the baby and the circumstances of its burial 150 years later.\u201dAdvertisement"}
