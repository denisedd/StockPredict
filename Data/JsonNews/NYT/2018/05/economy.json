And Mr. Kim may be the most realist of them all.It does so from a special posture, of course, because of its nuclear program and diplomatic isolation \u2014 and because of many remaining uncertainties about its intentions, including over a matter as fundamental as what it means by \u201cdenuclearization.\u201d Still, Mr. Kim\u2019s unexpected offer to meet President Trump and Mr. Trump\u2019s quick acceptance suggest that both leaders see in this moment an opportunity for some measure of d\u00e9tente. About that much at least they are correct.Lifting sanctions, normalizing relations, starting to trade \u2014 these things may not materialize soon, or ever. But the strategic landscape on the Korean Peninsula already has changed, and it has changed in favor of America and its allies.Skeptics will doubt that North Korea, given its ideology, can really move in this direction; optimists may now see the reunification of the Korean Peninsula on the horizon. I think that North Korea\u2019s one-party system will remain in place for a long while and that in the meantime the country\u2019s human rights situation will continue to be dire. Nor will improved relations between the two Koreas, or even the conclusion of a peace treaty, lead to any kind of reunification. Any such thing would be suicidal for Pyongyang and too costly for Seoul.Yet I also think that this moment is indeed a rare opportunity for both America and America\u2019s allies to improve relations with North Korea \u2014 and work with it to establish a new balance of power in Northeast Asia that can offset China\u2019s ambition to dominate the region and better serve the interests of the West.This article has been updated to reflect news developments.Jean-Pierre Cabestan is a professor and head of the department of government and international studies at Hong Kong Baptist University.Advertisement"}

The agreement was confirmed Thursday by Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for PayPal.\u201cSmall businesses are the engine of the global economy and we are continuing to expand our platform to help them compete and win online, in-store and via mobile,\u201d said PayPal\u2019s chief executive, Dan Schulman.The agreement is the latest example of a promising European start-up selling itself to a larger American company. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft have all used acquisitions in the region to gobble up promising technology and sought-after engineers. Past deals include Google\u2019s purchase of the London-based artificial intelligence start-up DeepMind; Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Mojang, the Swedish maker of popular video game \u201cMinecraft\u201d; and Apple\u2019s deal for the music-recognition company Shazam and digital-assistant maker VocalIQ, both of which started in Europe.The trend is troubling for European policymakers who have been eager to develop a homegrown tech sector that has lagged the United States and China.Founded eight years ago and based in Stockholm, iZettle began as a maker of products like credit card readers. But it has expanded its offerings to analytics software and even small business loans, giving it a strong foothold among such companies in Europe and Latin America.Last week, it filed to go public, announcing plans to list itself on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange, with ambitions for a $1.1 billion valuation. Among its existing investors are Mastercard and American Express, as well as the venture capital firm Index Ventures.The purchase would boost PayPal\u2019s international expansion, and help it compete with Square, which has focused on processing payments for small businesses. Both companies are trying to capitalize on the growing volume of purchases being made on mobile phones and the internet.Michael J. de la Merced reported from London and Nathaniel Popper from New York.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Wants to Fill Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Moat\u2019 With Candy, but It Still Holds Water", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOMAHA \u2014 Elon Musk is taking on Warren Buffett, and their differences run deeper than jokes about candy and medieval fortifications.At Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting over the weekend, I relayed a question from a shareholder to Mr. Buffett about a comment Mr. Musk had made a couple days earlier.\u201cI think \u2018moats\u2019 are lame,\u201d Mr. Musk had said during a Tesla earnings call. It was a criticism of an economic principle that Mr. Buffett had coined in 1999 and that has become something of a mantra for his faithful: Invest in businesses \u201cthat have wide, sustainable moats around them.\u201dSuch moats, Mr. Buffett has said, are made of the competitive advantages that benefit major brands and companies, like distribution networks, pricing power and brand reputation.But to Mr. Musk, they are a metaphor for being stuck in the past. \u201cIf your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is the pace of innovation \u2014 that is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness.\u201dAt a time when technology is upending even old-line industries that once seemed impenetrable to competition, might Mr. Musk be right?\u201cElon may turn things upside down in some areas,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d want to take us on in candy,\u201d suggesting Berkshire\u2019s See\u2019s Candies division enjoyed an unassailably wide moat. The quip elicited laughter from the 20,000 shareholders who packed the CenturyLink Center.Mr. Musk answered the challenge immediately, saying he was starting a candy company. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Not only that, Mr. Musk said, he planned \u201cto build a moat and fill it with candy\u201d \u2014 making it impossible for Mr. Buffett to resist sinking his money into the venture.The repartee was good for some chuckles and clickbait headlines, but the mini-spat masked a more serious and significant debate taking place across corporate America: Have the traditional moats shrunk?When direct-to-consumer brands like Dollar Shave Club have been able to take on consumer giants like Procter & Gamble\u2019s Gillette \u2014 so much so that Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion \u2014 are any businesses still safe? Mr. Buffett owns Kraft Heinz, for example, but could upstart food companies one day overtake it, breaking through the substantial network of distribution and marketing arrangements \u2014 and brand loyalty \u2014 that Kraft Heinz has built up over decades?Mr. Buffett acknowledged that times had changed. \u201cThere have been more moats that have become susceptible to invasion than seemed to be the case earlier,\u201d he said.To a large degree, Mr. Musk is a living embodiment of a gleeful invader. With Tesla, he is trying to prove that what was long thought of as a substantial moat around the automobile industry could be overcome. He has gone direct to consumer with Tesla vehicles, bypassing the traditional car dealers that were once considered a barrier to entering the automotive business. He even had what seemed like his own moat: a network of Supercharger stations around the country that he recently opened up to competitors. (His initial panning of the \u201cmoat\u201d idea followed a question about why he was willing to cede the advantage that the closed charging network provided.)But, in truth, Mr. Musk\u2019s experience \u2014 and challenges \u2014 at Tesla may demonstrate just how much a moat remains a powerful deterrent to competitors.In the case of the automobile industry, perhaps the biggest barrier is the huge amount of capital needed \u2014 Tesla has already raised more than $12 billion. But even with huge amounts of money, Tesla\u2019s recent production struggles \u2014 it has repeatedly missed its targets for making the new mass-market Model 3 \u2014 show the immense value of manufacturing experience.Mr. Musk\u2019s willingness to challenge convention has clearly pushed the automobile industry forward, but his progress has lately been bumpier than he initially expected. That\u2019s not to say he won\u2019t succeed, but if he does, he may be the exception, not the rule.There are still huge swaths of our economy that have dauntingly wide moats, many of them protected by regulatory walls. Banks, which have been speculated about as ripe for disruption by financial technology companies, seem more likely to buy start-ups than compete against them. Airlines \u2014 which Mr. Buffett once called \u201ca death trap for investors\u201d \u2014 have consolidated, and enormous corporations control virtually all the landing slots at airports around the globe. Before it could get off the ground, any insurgent hoping to challenge them would have to find a spot to come down.Even many digital businesses have a moat: Google and Facebook control so much of the advertising market that it is hard to see how a kid in a garage with an idea could usurp them anytime soon. Amazon has itself has become so powerful that virtually every seller feels it has to go through it. And Mr. Buffett has convinced himself that Apple\u2019s deep relationship with its customers through its ecosystem of products and iCloud mean the business has a defensible moat.\u201cThere are some pretty good moats around,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cBeing the low-cost producer, for example, is a terribly important moat,\u201d he said, citing Geico, the low-cost insurance company Berkshire owns.Saturday night, after the Berkshire meeting ended, Mr. Musk was still tweeting: \u201cSaying you like \u2018moats\u2019 is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies.\u201dFor better or worse, the limited competition that oligopolies face is usually good for investors \u2014 even if consumers might disagree.But whether they have been dug by a company\u2019s experienced hand, the good will of its customers or the heavy machinery of governmental regulation, moats remain a formidable form of protection, even from the most willing of raiders.Perhaps Charlie Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, put it best: \u201cElon says a conventional moat is quaint. And that\u2019s true of a puddle of water.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do Pipelines Really Create Lots of Jobs?", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Leslie writes\u00a0on dams, water scarcity, soil and other environmental topics.Here\u2019s a curious ritual of American politics: Whenever a large energy project is proposed, the ensuing debate revolves chiefly around how many jobs it will create.For example, backers of the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline, a contested 600-mile natural gas conduit that would run from West Virginia to North Carolina, have maintained that it would create nearly 20,000 construction and manufacturing jobs.\u201cMost of the people who take a newly \u2018created\u2019 job are leaving an existing job. Or would have found another job,\u201d Mr. Borenstein wrote. \u201cThen there are people who are displaced by the new jobs created \u2014 the coal miners who worked for the mine that is shut down\u201d or \u201cthe fracking oil drillers in North Dakota laid off when cheaper crude from the tar sands is carried to market by the Keystone XL.\u201dThe \u201cfundamental fallacy\u201d of counting jobs, Mr. Borenstein continued, is that all sorts of things, from government policies to variations in energy prices and taxes, affect employment. As a result, \u201creports of \u2018green job creation\u2019 or the \u2018jobs that will be created by Keystone\u2019 are just data cherry picking, not real analysis,\u201d he wrote.A deep recession justifies the sole exception to this rule: In 2008, joblessness was rampant and stimulus projects clearly led to increased employment. But at other times, Mr. Borenstein told me, the idea that projects \u201ctake people who have no job and now they have one is completely misleading.\u201dThe right way to assess the worthiness of energy projects has nothing to do with counting jobs, Mr. Borenstein added. It involves doing cost-benefit analyses that include both the projects\u2019 direct costs \u2014 the sort of thing that investors base decisions on \u2014 and their \u201cexternalities,\u201d the costs and benefits to society such as air or water pollution or useful knowledge uncovered by research and development.When fossil fuels are involved, a sophisticated cost-benefit analysis requires an additional calculation using what has become known as \u201cthe social cost of carbon\u201d\u2014 an estimated number in dollars per ton of carbon dioxide that reflects the climate change consequences of a project\u2019s emissions. This is an imprecise number, intended to take into account a deluge of woes, an array of constantly changing and sometimes unpredictable climate phenomena including rising temperatures and sea levels, intense droughts and floods, and hampered agricultural production. But the number, pegged by the Obama administration at $45 per ton in 2020, is a better approximation of climate change\u2019s impact than zero, the default number if the calculation isn\u2019t attempted.Multiply $45 by the number of tons of a project\u2019s expected carbon dioxide emissions and the result is its climate change cost, which should be included in its cost-benefit analysis. If that calculation were performed for all energy projects now, most existing coal-fired power would be considered uneconomical, while gas-fired power plants wouldn\u2019t be significantly affected. Renewables would benefit.On an individual level, the impact of the social cost of carbon might be modest: For instance, the average American car emits a ton of carbon dioxide every two to two and a half months, hiking the annual expense of driving a car by roughly $250.But on a national scale, the quantities are enormous. Consider that in 2016 the United States emitted five billion tons of carbon dioxide, nearly a seventh of the global total of 36 billion tons. Adding the social cost of carbon to domestic fossil fuels\u2019 other expenses would have driven up their cost by about $200 billion, enough to help hasten the economy\u2019s conversion to renewable energy and reduce the depredations of climate change.In 2009, the Obama administration drew representatives from a dozen government agencies and offices to create a working group that calculated a set of estimates for all agencies to use \u2014 eliminating the duplication and confusion arising from allowing the agencies to perform their own, inevitably conflicting calculations. The group\u2019s estimates have been applied to scores of federal regulations since then, as well as the Obama administration\u2019s now-stalled Clean Power Plan. They are also being used by Canada and several state public utilities commissions, including New York\u2019s. Many corporations \u2014 oil companies like Exxon Mobil, the onetime climate change denier, among them \u2014 use some version of the social cost of carbon to plan investment.The Trump administration would probably have liked to disregard the social cost of carbon entirely, but it is already too firmly entrenched in law and regulation for that. Instead, two months after taking office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that disbanded the working group and returned the job of calculating the social cost of carbon to individual agencies. Then, last October, the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a drastically lowered social cost of carbon, ranging from $1 to $6 in 2020. Other agencies are likely to use similar numbers.The administration argued, among other things, that the previous calculation erred by including the international impacts of climate change instead of just the national ones. But as Richard Newell, president of an environmental economics think tank called Resources for the Future, pointed out to me, carbon dioxide is a global pollutant that has impacts everywhere, regardless of where it\u2019s emitted. And even if many of the impacts \u2014 for example, increased migration or economic or political upheaval \u2014 occur in other countries, they can affect the United States in unpleasant ways. Perhaps more important, the United States\u2019 willingness to curb its emissions would encourage other nations to limit theirs, a necessary step toward reducing climate impacts here.If reinforced by rollbacks planned by the E.P.A. in car fuel economy standards and other regulations, the administration\u2019s distortion will have far-reaching consequences. Vehicles will burn more fuel, and appliances will be less energy-efficient. Proposed renewable energy plants will be disadvantaged compared with fossil-fuel plants (which will generate fewer jobs than predicted). Most ominously, climate change will worsen.The Trump administration\u2019s daily-soap-opera gyrations attract more attention, but its attempt to ignore global warming is more sinister. One way that business leaders, environmentalists and elected officials at all levels can fight back is to insist on considering the social cost of carbon in every energy decision. Honest accounting, it turns out, is a pillar of a clearsighted society.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a poor substitute for a court of law, with lopsided, inconsistent rules of evidence. When coupled with a ban on group activity, mandatory arbitration can deter aggrieved workers from coming forward in the first place.The technicalities of arbitration rules are dreary, which is why it has taken the #MeToo movement to highlight why they are so unfair to employees. Survivors of sexual harassment and assault have rightly demanded an end to the practice, in which the proceedings are kept secret. High-profile employers are responding to this criticism cynically, at best, by agreeing to eliminate mandatory arbitration only for #MeToo-type claims.\u201cIt\u2019s great that we\u2019ve started talking about forced arbitration, but it\u2019s unfortunate we\u2019re only talking about it in the context of harassment, not pregnancy discrimination or pay discrimination or wage theft,\u201d said Juno Turner, a lawyer with Outten & Golden, a firm based in New York City that represents employees. \u201cAnd there is no attention brought to the issue of class and collective waivers, which also have an impact on the ability of multiple women victimized by the same harasser to speak out.\u201dIt\u2019s to the tremendous credit of the #MeToo movement that Americans are now talking so openly about the disproportionate abuse faced by women on the job.

{"Headline": "Kelly Finds Himself in a Familiar Place in the Trump White House: Eyeing the Exits", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump learned this week that his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, reportedly called him \u201can idiot\u201d on several occasions, he expressed little in the way of frustration or anger, an uncharacteristically low-key response from someone with little tolerance for slights.Many current and former officials said Mr. Trump\u2019s response was less a vote of confidence in his top adviser than a sign of indifference \u2014 a reflection of the kind of cold truce that exists between two powerful and mercurial men who have grown tired and irritated with each other, but are in no immediate rush to part ways.The president has come to believe that Mr. Kelly is hiding things from him, in the view of people who work in the White House and insist on anonymity to describe private conversations. He has complained that Mr. Kelly has not been forthcoming about the pasts of some staff members, who either opposed him during the 2016 presidential primaries or had connections to the Bush family. And he has taken to venting about Mr. Kelly to an array of friends and supporters, while expressing confidence that recent successes \u2014 such as the continued strength of the economy and progress toward nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea \u2014 are proof that he is his own best adviser.Mr. Kelly complains aloud about Mr. Trump, telling colleagues, \u201cI don\u2019t need this\u201d after dressing-downs from the president.While several current and former officials said they had not heard the chief of staff call his boss \u201can idiot,\u201d as NBC News reported on Monday, many said that Mr. Kelly had given the impression over many months that he did not hold the president in high regard. He speaks as if he sees himself as the lone bulwark against potentially dangerous decisions by the commander in chief, they say. And whether he used the word or not, they added, the story itself could serve to accelerate his departure.Yet Mr. Trump, always averse to confrontation, has continued to keep Mr. Kelly in his role, while increasingly steering around him on matters large and small. One person close to the White House said that it will be up to Mr. Kelly to end his tenure, since Mr. Trump knows how damaging it would be to dismiss a four-star Marine general.The result is that Mr. Kelly now finds himself in the position where several others who have worked for Mr. Trump have landed: aware that their jobs have become close to untenable, looking for ways to cauterize the wounds to their reputations and knowing that it is only a matter of when \u2014 not if \u2014 they will have to leave.In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Kelly\u2019s deputy, Zachary D. Fuentes, defended his boss and insisted he was the victim of unfounded attacks.\u201cHe\u2019s never called the president an idiot, he\u2019s never called the president unhinged, and the idea that a Marine would ever tolerate somebody disrespecting the commander in chief like that is unthinkable,\u201d said Mr. Fuentes, who has taken the unusual step of talking to reporters on the record this week to push back against the reports.\u201cHe\u2019s been smeared,\u201d Mr. Fuentes said of Mr. Kelly, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people want to see him go.\u201dAs for the relationship between Mr. Kelly and Mr. Trump, he said: \u201cThey\u2019re on great footing. Their relationship is as strong as ever.\u201dBut the White House communications staff, which normally rushes to deny or sidestep rumors that Mr. Trump is angry with or on the brink of firing an underling, has been quiet. It allowed a statement that Mr. Kelly issued on Monday, and the protestations of his closest aide, to serve as the only substantial on-record comment in response to the NBC story.\u201cI spend more time with the president than anyone else, and we have an incredibly candid and strong relationship,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in the statement, circulated to the White House press pool. \u201cHe always knows where I stand, and he and I both know this story is total BS.\u201dThe next day, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, tried to put the best face on the relationship, telling reporters that both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly were \u201cvery happy with his position that he currently holds.\u201dMr. Whipple described Mr. Kelly as suffering from what he called the \u201cDon Regan syndrome,\u201d a reference to Ronald Reagan\u2019s ill-fated chief of staff. Like Mr. Kelly, Mr. Regan would often say things that revealed a disdain for his boss, once famously comparing his job to that of a shovel brigade whose task was to walk behind a herd of elephants cleaning up their mess.\u201cHe\u2019s arrogant, he\u2019s been imperious and he\u2019s politically out of his depth,\u201d Mr. Whipple said of Mr. Kelly. \u201cThat\u2019s all coming back to bite him now.\u201dSome officials said the NBC story appeared to be part of a calculated effort by Mr. Kelly\u2019s detractors to damage him in Mr. Trump\u2019s eyes, perhaps to prod the president to take the step he has so far resisted of firing his chief of staff.Mr. Kelly\u2019s hold on the White House staff has certainly weakened, tarnishing his reputation and overshadowing his efforts to bring order and discipline to the West Wing.The scandal surrounding the departure in February of Rob Porter, the staff secretary who resigned under pressure amid allegations of spousal abuse, left a lingering bitter taste among aides, some of whom felt that Mr. Kelly had botched his response and been dishonest about his own role in the episode. Among those who came away angry with Mr. Kelly were Jared Kushner \u2014 whose high-level security access he revoked as part of tightened security clearance procedures in the scandal\u2019s aftermath \u2014 and Ivanka Trump.More recently, he has left some aides with unclear job descriptions in place while declining to fill key roles. He has targeted some people who were close to Mr. Trump during the campaign as potential problems, and tried to limit their influence. That has included people within the West Wing as well as those on Mr. Trump\u2019s ever-present evening phone call list, such as Corey Lewandowski, the first 2016 campaign manager who was fired before the convention.Mr. Lewandowski and David Bossie, the deputy campaign manager, both traveled with Mr. Trump to Michigan on Saturday. And the looming midterm elections \u2014 for which Mr. Kelly has no instinctive feel \u2014 provide Mr. Trump with added incentive to listen to other voices.Mr. Kelly\u2019s insistence on an identifiable chain of command in the White House \u2014 one of the first things he tried to establish when taking the job last summer \u2014 has given way to the creation of new fiefs.Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump\u2019s new director of the National Economic Council, has a direct line to the president, as does John R. Bolton, his newly installed national security adviser, who was not Mr. Kelly\u2019s preferred candidate for the role. Mr. Bolton has been seeking to build his own empire, hiring staff members who may have been considered problematic before.Mr. Kelly, for his part, is sanguine about how little control he has over how the president chooses to spend his time. At a breakfast event last week for Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, Mr. Kelly marveled that Mr. Trump had spent a long time the day before on the phone with Bill Belichick, the New England Patriots coach, talking about the status of Tom Brady, the star quarterback, according to two people familiar with his remarks, one of whom was present.\u201cIt was, to begin with, the most dysfunctional White House in modern history, and now it\u2019s worse,\u201d Mr. Whipple said. \u201cWithout an empowered White House chief of staff, you can\u2019t execute policy.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

Powers, president and chief executive of TradePort Logistics, who has been talking to scores of shippers as he scouts business for a new 100-door loading facility and a 650,000-square-foot fulfillment center he\u2019s building near the port.That local confidence in the port\u2019s potential has apparently helped insulate some of Savannah\u2019s business leaders and workers \u2014 whose livelihoods depend on global commerce \u2014 from anxiety over rising tensions with trading partners.Instead of a trade war, businesses talked of a trade hiccup.\u201cWe feel very comfortable that this will just continue to grow,\u201d said Rebecca George Ogden, president of PortFresh Logistics, a 100,000-square-foot cold-storage and packing facility for produce that opened last year, contending that American appetites will carry the day. \u201cThe demand is so great. I really believe Americans are going to want their grapes in January and their citrus in June, this year-round availability that we\u2019re accustomed to.\u201dThe optimism is reflected in the shortage of industrial space \u2014 a vacancy rate of 0.52 percent compared with the average 5 percent in a healthy market, according to Colliers International, a real estate services company. Tracts of land that the port puts on the market are \u201cjust gobbled up,\u201d said Clifford H. Dales, a principal of Colliers.Whatever concern about tariffs exists, it has not had an impact on business, he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t hear much about it,\u201d Mr. Dales said about local and out-of-town developers.\u201cSavannah has become a magnet for containers,\u201d said Walter Kemmsies, an economist at Jones Lang LaSalle, who has advised more than a dozen American ports on development.Savannah does have a few distinct assets, among them location. Its southern latitude disguises just how far west the shipping channel reaches \u2014 far enough to catch a plumb line dropped from Cleveland.Another is that in Savannah, unlike other major ports in the country that lease to different terminal operators, the ports authority runs the whole show.That makes it easier to get containers from Point A to Point B. Truckers have a single check-in point when they enter and exit, and 9,700 feet of contiguous docking space. Several ships can dock on the same day, and the mechanics, crane operators and drivers working directly for the port can be quickly deployed where they are most needed.In New Jersey, for instance, a trucker might make only one trip if the ship unloads at rush hour, Mr. Kemmsies said. In Savannah, warehouse owners said truckers can average four to six.\u201cA private owner would not have the same outlook,\u201d Mr. Powers of TradePort Logistics said. \u201cThe port\u2019s mission is not to create profit for themselves but to provide services and create jobs for the region.\u201dThis approach extends to the transportation hub, which is undergoing bridge, road and interchange modernizations designed to streamline port traffic. To finance the increased capacity on Georgia\u2019s roads, the state passed a gas tax indexed to inflation and fuel efficiency.The port\u2019s coordinated investments are helping it lure ships away from the West Coast \u2014 which is more vulnerable to trade tensions with China \u2014 and nip at the heels of the Port of New York and New Jersey, its biggest rival in the East.\u201cInfrastructure drives jobs,\u201d said Ms. Ogden of PortFresh Logistics. \u201cGeorgia gets it.\u201dHer company\u2019s warehouse, cold enough for workers to wear knitted ski masks, is 15 miles from the Garden City Terminal off Interstate 16 on a 182-acre parcel bought from the county and designated for port-related development. Aiming to double its building space within the next year, the company plans to expand its 120-person work force.Nearby is a Mitsubishi Hitachi plant that makes gas and steam turbines. Its location six miles from the port was a key factor in the decision to set up manufacturing there, said Peter Mierke, the plant\u2019s general manager. The state and local governments paid for a rail spur to deliver the giant turbines directly from the warehouse to the docks.The area has become a manufacturing powerhouse, and 10 of the 15 fastest-growing cities in the country are in the South.Foreign car companies like Toyota, Mercedes and BMW \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest auto exporter \u2014 have set up factories in the Southeast in the last two decades, and their vast network of suppliers followed.Kia opened a factory in Georgia in 2009. Part of the draw was the port, which was already knee deep in its infrastructure overhaul. The company was impressed, said Corinne Hodges, a spokeswoman for Kia, with \u201chow quickly can a truck get in and out and how fast can freight get off the boat and get its way into the plant.\u201dSavannah has also benefited from some unanticipated assistance. Labor troubles caused a monthslong slowdown at the nation\u2019s largest port complex in Los Angeles, stranding cargo on ships and frustrating retailers with tight deadlines. The episode pushed importers and shipping lines to diversify their points of entry and better acquainted them with the efficiencies of Savannah\u2019s port.That may be why union leaders here emphasize that no matter what happens, they intend to keep the cargo moving.\u201cWe don\u2019t think the administration is out to hurt anybody\u201d with its trade policy, said Timothy S. Mackey, president of the 1,500-member Local 1414 of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association. \u201cTrump is a competitive guy, a businessman. He wants the best deal.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019ll do what we need to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world keeps moving.\u201dFollow the reporters on Twitter: @PatcohenNYT and @NataliekitroPatricia Cohen reported from Savannah and Natalie Kitroeff from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pleasure and Pain of Being California, the World\u2019s 5th-Largest Economy", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When a transportation agency said two years ago that rush hours were a thing of the past on a major highway in the San Francisco Bay Area, it was not good news.\u201cFor the first time on record, the morning and evening peak periods have merged,\u201d said a spokesman for the agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, \u201ccreating a continuously congested freeway from 5:30 in the morning until nearly 8 o\u2019clock at night.\u201dIt has only gotten worse.California\u2019s economy has soared into the stratosphere, but not without inflicting some pain. Paralyzing traffic is one symptom; the increasingly absurd price of putting a roof over one\u2019s head is another.One person from the Midwest devised a quick formula to calculate the price of a house in the Bay Area: See how much a similar house would cost in Minnesota and then add a million dollars.Every few weeks there seems to be another story in the California news media about a dilapidated shack in an ordinary neighborhood selling for seven figures, just to be torn down. It has become common enough to lose its shock value.California recorded another milestone last week, one reflecting a prouder facet of the state\u2019s success. If the state were an independent country, its economy would rank as the fifth-largest in the world, ahead of Britain\u2019s (which has been crawling lately). California held that spot once before, but it slipped a bit during the Great Recession a decade ago.As the state has blossomed, outpacing many others, it has reinforced a liberal narrative about growth, that a state can have big government and a booming economy, too. (Texas is the conservatives\u2019 counterexample: a big, fast-growing economy under laissez-faire government.)California has strict environmental protections, a progressive tax system and an ascendant minimum wage, now $10.50 an hour and set to rise in stages to $15 in 2023. The state welcomes immigrants, celebrates ethnic and linguistic diversity, and actively tries to combat climate change. And with all that, its economy continues to soar.\u201cWe have raised income taxes and imposed increasingly high fees to reduce greenhouse emissions,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. \u201cNone of that has overridden the attractiveness of this state for talent and innovation and entrepreneurship.\u201dCalifornia is not the only state doing well, of course. The federal Bureau of Economic Analysis produced a map last week showing a somewhat lopsided pattern of prosperity in America. The economies of states like Kansas and Louisiana shrank slightly last year, while those in the West thrived: Nevada grew by 3.5 percent, Washington by 4.4 percent, Arizona by 3.2 percent.Even among its booming neighbors, though, California, which saw 3 percent growth last year, stands out for the diversity and sheer size of its economy.Every sector contributed to the state\u2019s growth last year except agriculture, according to Irena Asmundson, the chief economist of the California Department of Finance. Financial services and real estate led the pack, and even manufacturing, often said to be in decline in America, grew significantly, contributing $10 billion in output to the $127 billion the state added over all.\u201cMost of this is a lot of relatively small firms that are very specialized,\u201d Ms. Asmundson said of the growth in manufacturing.Unsurprisingly, Silicon Valley is a big part of California\u2019s success. One of the state\u2019s technology giants, Apple, brought in more revenue in its latest fiscal year \u2014 $229 billion \u2014 than the entire economic output of Wyoming, five times over.All of that money pouring in to California\u2019s tech and entertainment industries produces a big wealth effect, ballooning what the state\u2019s workers can spend \u2014 and not just those who work directly in those fields.When Gov. Jerry Brown returned to office in 2011, he faced a budget deficit of $27 billion. Now, after eight years of economic expansion, the state has a surplus of $6 billion, and its tax revenues are running well ahead of projections.Yet it is hard to overlook the pain that prosperity has brought: traffic, property prices, homelessness.Those last two issues are increasingly seen as sides of the same coin. In 2017, California saw the fastest growth in its homeless population of any state (14 percent), and also had the highest proportion of them unsheltered: 68 percent of the state\u2019s 134,000 homeless people sleep outdoors.All economic booms run out of steam sooner or later, and some Californians say they might welcome a little relief from this one. William Yu, an economist with the Anderson Forecast at the U.C.L.A. Anderson School of Management, recalls a panel discussion a month ago with real estate developers.\u201cOne developer was asked, \u2018Are you worried about a recession coming?\u2019\u201d Mr. Yu said. \u201cThe developer said, \u2018I\u2019m not worried at all. I\u2019m waiting for it.\u2019\u201dWhy? So he can snap up some properties at cheaper prices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Wants to Restart Nuclear Talks With Iran, but Hasn\u2019t Budged on Demands", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will outline a new strategy on Monday for constraining Iran, centered around a demand that the United States\u2019 European allies have already rejected: that Tehran enter negotiations in a new deal that would permanently ban Iran from any substantive manufacturing of nuclear fuel and, in turn, forever cut off a pathway to building a bomb.But the negotiating strategy of the United States\u2019 new chief diplomat is unlikely to be embraced by major European powers, who opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s move and are talking now about how to nullify the effects of threatened United States sanctions on European firms that do business with Iran.But Mr. Pompeo has calculated that for all of Europe\u2019s bluster, Mr. Trump\u2019s sanctions threat \u2014 which would ban any company that does substantial business in Iran from doing business with the United States \u2014 will ultimately work.Total, the French oil giant, announced this week it is canceling planned contracts in Iran, and the top executives of other multinational companies have said, some publicly and others privately, that they have no choice. Iran is a relatively small customer, and the United States is its largest.Mr. Pompeo\u2019s plan calls for a new negotiation that will embrace stronger and longer nuclear limitations, restrictions on missile tests and exports, and limits on Iranian activity to support terrorist groups or the government in Syria.Officials say they are also trying to figure out how to enforce limits \u2014 or sanctions \u2014 on Tehran\u2019s cyberactivity, fearing that the Iranian response to the United States will come not in the nuclear arena, but in attacks on banks and financial institutions.Mr. Pompeo\u2019s speech on Monday, to be delivered at the Heritage Foundation, is expected to play down the divisions with Europe.\u201cI think it\u2019s more than fair to say that we agree with the Europeans on much, much more than we disagree on,\u201d said Brian H. Hook, the director of policy planning at the State Department, who conducted the unsuccessful negotiation with Britain, France and Germany to agree on major amendments to the nuclear accord that was in place before Mr. Trump\u2019s exit.The major sticking point with the Europeans was language that would have extended \u2014 indefinitely \u2014 limits on Iran\u2019s ability to produce enough enriched uranium or plutonium to produce a bomb in under 12 months. While the Europeans said they had no objection to that goal, they could not achieve that without reopening the terms of the 2015 deal with Iran.The Trump administration wanted to impose the requirement unilaterally, with the threat that sanctions would be automatically reimposed if the Iranians got closer to a weapon than the 12-month standard.Now the sanctions have been reimposed anyway, and European leaders find themselves caught between competing impulses to resist Mr. Trump\u2019s mandates and to work with him.Mr. Hook argued that with the old deal cast aside, there is a chance for new diplomacy \u2014 though he offered no guess as to whether the Iranians would engage.\u201cWe see this, the coming months, as an opportunity to expand our efforts and to work with a lot of countries who share the same concerns about nonproliferation, about terrorism, about stoking civil wars around the region,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re very \u2014 we\u2019re very hopeful about the diplomacy ahead.\u201dSo far, Iranian officials have indicated they are planning to abide by the requirements of the 2015 deal. But there is clearly a debate underway in Iran \u2014 argued by some members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and people who were deeply invested in the nuclear program \u2014 that the United States never intended to allow Tehran to rejoin the Western economies. They have advised Iran\u2019s leaders to simply bar international inspectors and resume uranium enrichment.\u201cThere are now only two countries that matter for Iran,\u201d Vali Nasr, a Middle East expert and the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. \u201cThey are Russia and China, and they haven\u2019t showed their hand\u201d on whether they would join Iran in seeking to frustrate Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to isolate the country.Russia has been Iran\u2019s partner in the war in Syria. China, meanwhile, may see an opportunity to strike energy deals with the Iran despite the American sanctions, betting that the United States could not afford to cut off Chinese suppliers.The Trump administration, said Mr. Nasr, who was born in Tehran and immigrated to the United States after the 1979 revolution, \u201cmay be pursuing a regime-change strategy against Iran.\u201d\u201cBut they will discover that regime change is not an exact science,\u201d he said.Mr. Pompeo is unlikely to talk about leadership change in Iran during his speech on Monday, officials said. But he will discuss a broad containment policy.During the Obama administration, officials gave similar speeches before striking the 2015 deal. But those were different in nature because the major European states were fully participating in sanctions, determining they were the best way to force Iran to negotiate.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to scrap the results of that negotiation, however, may have so angered European officials that they will simply refuse to negotiate a new deal \u2014 unless they fear the economic consequences will be overwhelming.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How well did Flipkart\u2019s investors do?\u2022 What did AT&T and Novartis want from Michael Cohen?\u2022 What the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal means for the business world.\u2022 The bottom line on Vodafone\u2019s big deal with Liberty Global.The story of Walmart\u2019s $16 billion deal for Flipkart began nearly two years ago and spanned secret negotiations in both Bentonville, Ark., and Bangalore, India. Here\u2019s an account of how it came together based on interviews by people involved in the transaction, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal.Walmart had initially approached Flipkart in 2016. But it quickly backed away to focus on its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, one of these people said.By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.Walmart could also provide a permanent base of capital, which would allow Flipkart to avoid raising money every few years. For its part, Walmart would feel more comfortable if it had majority control, even as it was prepared to give Flipkart\u2019s management some degree of independence.In December, Amazon entered the fray, these people said. The e-commerce titan sought to buy Flipkart outright. But Flipkart was wary. It worried regulators would block a deal that would have combined India\u2019s two biggest e-commerce services.Discussions with Walmart pressed forward. Over the next few months, the boards of Walmart and Flipkart refined what became Wednesday\u2019s deal: The size of the stake Walmart would buy and at what price. They also settled on which of Flipkart\u2019s investors would sell. Some, including the investment firm Tiger Global Management and the Chinese internet giant Tencent, wanted to stay on board, betting that Flipkart would continue to grow. Others, including the nearly $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, were happy to cash out.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s how well some of them did:Some investors who are keeping stakes in Flipkart \u2014 including Tiger Global, which will maintain a roughly 5 percent stake, Microsoft and the Chinese internet giant Tencent \u2014 could continue to reap returns should Flipkart eventually go public.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedWhat exactly were AT&T and Novartis after when they made payments to a firm set up Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer?- Peter EavisDetails\u2022 Walmart will buy an initial stake of 77 percent in Flipkart and invest $2 billion in fresh capital into the Indian firm.\u2022 The two companies said they are in continuing talks with other investors to purchase a stake, which might reduce Walmart\u2019s eventual shareholding in Flipkart.\u2022 Walmart said the purchase would reduce its net income by at least $750 million this year and by more than double that amount next year.It\u2019s a risky bet for Walmart\u2022 Although India\u2019s population is rapidly coming online, the number of people with enough income to shop online is still tiny.\u2022 Walmart is paying a hefty premium to buy its way into the pole position in India\u2019s e-commerce market, but it has not yet outlined any strategy that would keep it ahead of Amazon there.\u2022 While Flipkart is currently the market leader, Amazon\u2019s relatively new India site is quickly closing the gap.The big winners\u2022 Sachin Bansal. Flipkart's co-founder, is selling his entire 5.5 percent stake in the company, becoming an instant billionaire.\u2022 SoftBank Vision Fund, the investment vehicle run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart in August. That the stake will now be sold for about $4 billion.The advisers\u2022 Walmart was advised by JPMorgan and Barclays on the banking side and Hogan Lovells, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher on the legal side.\u2022 Flipkart was advised by Goldman Sachs and law firms Gunderson Dettmer LLP, Khaitan & Co., Allen & Gledhill LLP and Dentons Rodyk & DavidsonCritic\u2019s CornerUna Galani of Breakingviews writes: \u201cAfter buying Jet.com for $3 billion a couple years ago, Walmart\u2019s efforts to compete online in the United States have hit some bumps. Earlier misadventures in China prompted it to join forces with local rival JD.com in return for a small stake. India will test the U.S. company\u2019s ability to keep pace halfway around the world with Amazon, whose investors are as patient as boss Jeff Bezos. This will be a make-or-break overseas deal for Walmart.\u201dSturm Ruger had urged shareholders for weeks to reject a proposal from a group of Roman Catholic nuns demanding more transparency from the company on whether it planned to develop safer products and monitor the ones already in circulation.The vote was a rebuke to the company\u2019s leaders and a victory for gun control activists.Ruger must now produce a report by February on how it tracks violence associated with its firearms, what kind of research it is conducting related to so-called smart gun technology and its assessment of the risks that gun-related crimes pose to the company\u2019s reputation and finances.\u2014 Tiffany HsuSears said it will provide customers who purchase any brand of tire on Amazon, including the Sears DieHard brand and full-service tire installation and balancing.The service initially will available at 47 Sears Auto Centers in eight metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.This the second partnership that Sears has struck with Amazon in the past year. Last July, Sears said it would sell its Kenmore appliances of Amazon. The announcement pushed Sears\u2019s shares up 24 percent. The stock is down more than 70 percent over the past 12 months.AT&T said Essential was \u201cone of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\u201d and that its contract ended in December. Novartis said that its contract ran for a year, through February.\u201cRight around [when the] inauguration is happening, we need somebody who knows the administration,\u201d the person said. \u201cHow does he think? What are their priorities?\u201dThe price of benchmark American crude oil rose to more than $71 early Wednesday.Oil prices are hovering near highs not seen since 2014 would seem to run counter to the President\u2019s stated, or tweeted, preference for lower oil prices. But as American oil production has surged, the traditional view that higher oil prices act as a clear drag on American growth has become less of an item of faith.We believe this event is a bellwether for the sector, and could potentially contribute toward a flurry of consolidation across Europe.Not so fast: Expect Deutsche Telekom, now in Vodafone\u2019s cross hairs, to fight the transaction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pompeo\u2019s Iran Plan: Tell Them to Give Up", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverMs. Giacomo is a member of the editorial board.The demands \u2014 12 points in all \u2014 are so extensive that it is unlikely Iran could comply any time soon, even if it wanted to. And any benefits it would achieve in exchange \u2014 sanctions relief, the re-establishment of diplomatic and commercial relations \u2014 would be at some unspecified point in the future.There are many things wrong with this approach, but let\u2019s start with this: It\u2019s not a strategy. It\u2019s wishful thinking that will make regional tensions worse, if not lead to outright conflict.We\u2019re at this absurd point because Mr. Trump cast aside a multinational deal under which Iran curtailed its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Mr. Trump objected that the deal did not address concerns it was never meant to address, like Iran\u2019s regional activities.Mr. Trump and his lieutenants act confident that reimposing American sanctions will bring Iran, hampered by a weak economy and political unrest, to heel. But the sanctions that preceded the 2015 nuclear deal were effective because they were broadly supported by the international community, especially Europe, Russia and China.The Europeans have reaffirmed their commitment to the deal as well as to continued economic engagement with Iran. So what is Mr. Trump doing? Making enemies of America\u2019s best friends by threatening them with sanctions.Justifiably angered, the Europeans are discussing ways around the American sanctions, further eroding the trans-Atlantic alliance and perhaps hastening the day when they have a financial system far less entwined with the United States\u2019.There is no defending Iran\u2019s support for Bashar al-Assad, the bloody dictator in Syria, or its use of Hezbollah militants to control Lebanon and threaten Israel. But other countries \u2014 including Russia in Syria and Saudi Arabia in Yemen \u2014 also fuel regional instability.Although Mr. Pompeo said the administration\u2019s aim was a comprehensive agreement with Iran, the real goal seems to be to break the regime or force it to resume the nuclear program, thus giving the United States and Israel an excuse for military action.The world\u2019s experience with regime change in Iraq should make clear why this is a terrible idea. Along with waging war on a false premise, causing tens of thousands of deaths and trillions of dollars in wasted funds, and enabling the spread of Islamist militants, it\u2019s a major reason Iran has gained a foothold in Iraq today.It\u2019s no coincidence that John Bolton, one of the George W. Bush administration\u2019s architects of that disaster, is now at the center of American policymaking as Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser.There\u2019s also the irony of, as Mr. Pompeo is making these demands, his boss is offering North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un \u2014 believed to have as many as 60 nuclear weapons \u2014 security guarantees to abandon his arsenal. Iran has no nuclear weapons and has significantly curbed its program.Over the past several weeks, the Iranians have had a reasonably measured response to the American provocations, even as President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, has faced pressure from hard-liners eager to push back against the United States and restart the nuclear program. The world is left to hope \u2014 with no help from Washington \u2014 that restraint can hold.Advertisement"}

Robinson, who is the United States Embassy\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, and Mr. Robinson\u2019s No. 2, Brian Naranjo, 48 hours to leave, declaring them both persona non grata.\u201cThis is in protest, in defense of Venezuelan dignity!

The order extended to Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the state oil company known as Pdvesa. It has been troubled by deep production declines.In the speech on Tuesday, Mr. Maduro repeated claims that Venezuela\u2019s economic woes \u2014 which include shortages of food, medicine and nearly all government services \u2014 have been caused by foreign powers trying to undermine his Socialist-inspired government. Now, he said, the outsiders were trying to undermine his victory.\u201cThere have been 24 elections that have faced threats,\u201d he said, referring to the elections since his predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, won the presidency in 1998. \u201cNo one has gifted us victory, not today, not ever. We won it inch by inch, vote by vote.\u201dThe last time Mr. Maduro expelled an American Embassy\u2019s top diplomat was in 2013, when Kelly Keiderling, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the time and two other diplomats, were ordered to leave. He accused them of having supported plots to sabotage the economy and the electric grid, and meeting with \u201cthe Venezuelan extreme right wing.\u201dMr. Robinson, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires ordered expelled Tuesday, is a career diplomat who arrived in Caracas last December after serving as the United States ambassador to Guatemala.In the lead-up to the vote, Mr. Robinson took a less confrontational tone than that coming from Washington Republicans, most notably Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who posted a picture of a prison jumpsuit after Mr. Cabello was sanctioned, implying that the Venezuelan would be jailed.Last week Mr. Robinson met reporters to complain that American officials have not been allowed access to Joshua Holt, an 26-year-old American missionary who has been held in a Venezuela on accusations of stockpiling weapons.Mr. Robinson did not comment on the election or Mr. Maduro.William Neuman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Bush, who had branded the North part of an \u201caxis of evil.\u201dNow, as president of South Korea, Mr. Moon is keen not to repeat past failures as he stakes his own political career on brokering a deal between the unpredictable leaders of the United States, his nation\u2019s protector, and North Korea, long its mortal foe.As chief of staff during the Roh administration, from 2003 to 2008, Mr. Moon did not participate in the negotiations with the North, led at the time by Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, or join Mr. Roh\u2019s overland visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. But he did help Mr. Roh organize those talks, held in October 2007.He has clearly taken to heart what he sees as the lessons of that stillborn peace initiative.One lesson was that advancing inter-Korean relations with generous offers of aid was a nonstarter so long as the United States remained locked in a standoff with the North over its nuclear weapons program.Another was that any deal with North Korea must be struck and carried out early in the terms of the South Korean and American presidents. This ensures that the agreement does not die with a change of governments and political ideologies in Seoul and Washington, as the 2007 agreement and other past deals did.\u201cWhen we look back, the most important thing is speed,\u201d Mr. Moon told the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, during their meeting last week in the Demilitarized Zone, the fortified border separating the two Koreas.During that meeting, Mr. Moon urged the North Korean to move quickly to make a deal with President Trump during their talks, expected later this month or next month. \u201cWe have to learn lessons from the past,\u201d Mr. Moon told Mr. Kim.That need for speed is apparent in the fast pace of diplomacy that appears to be leading to a first-ever summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea, who just a few months ago appeared on the brink of war.Mr. Moon, 65, has played a key role in bringing together Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, who now appear likely to meet at Panmunjom, the same \u201ctruce village\u201d in the Demilitarized Zone where Mr. Moon held his talks with Mr. Kim.Such a meeting would be a triumph for Mr. Moon, who has experienced both highs and lows in his country\u2019s relations with North Korea.Mr. Moon was a conscripted member of an elite paratroop unit in 1976, when ax-wielding North Korean troops murdered two American Army officers while they pruned a poplar tree that blocked their view at Panmunjom. In \u201cOperation Paul Bunyan,\u201d Mr. Moon\u2019s unit was sent in to finish chopping down the tree while the North Koreans stood back.Until last week, Mr. Moon\u2019s only visit to North Korea was in 2004, when he accompanied his mother on a government-arranged reunion to see her younger sister for the first time since the Korean War. Mr. Moon himself was born in a refugee camp during the war, after his parents fled their native North Korea on board an American Navy cargo ship.His approach to handling the United States is one of Mr. Moon\u2019s biggest departures from his predecessor, Mr. Roh, who committed suicide in 2009 amid corruption allegations surrounding his relatives.Mr. Moon appears to have concluded that Mr. Roh doomed his own peace deal at least in part by failing to get Mr. Bush to back it. Instead, Mr. Roh, fiery and blunt, had vowed not to \u201ckowtow to the Americans.\u201dSince taking office last year, Mr. Moon has shown himself more sophisticated and accommodating in managing relations with Washington.The need to bring in America also reflects hard-earned domestic political lessons. Mr. Moon saw Mr. Roh and Kim Dae-jung, the two presidents who championed what was called the Sunshine Policy of engagement with North Korea, fail as the North persisted in its weapons programs despite generous aid.Both died heartbroken men, with their legacy dismantled by their conservative foes, who ridiculed them as na\u00efve and pro-North Korean.\u201cOne thing South Korea has learned is that it cannot improve ties with North Korea without progress in denuclearizing North Korea,\u201d said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. Otherwise, he said, any deal \u201cwould be like building a house of cards.\u201dDuring his meeting with Mr. Kim at Panmunjom, Mr. Moon\u2019s highest priority appeared to be convincing the young North Korean dictator that he could create a better future by striking a deal with Washington to rebuild his country\u2019s economy in exchange for giving up his nuclear arsenal.Despite the spectacle of the two Korean leaders leisurely holding hands as they stepped across their nations\u2019 border, Mr. Moon and his aides compared his mission to \u201cwalking on this ice,\u201d and urged Mr. Kim to quickly sign and implement a deal while he and Mr. Trump were in office.\u201cI am still in the first year of my term,\u201d Mr. Moon told Mr. Kim during their meeting. \u201cI hope we can maintain this speed through my term.\u201dMr. Moon\u2019s rush for an early deal is rooted in past experiences.In 1994, North Korea and the United States reached their first of many agreements on dismantling the North\u2019s nuclear program, then in its very early stages. Washington offered energy aid and promises of normalizing diplomatic and economic relations, but the accord unraveled after the United States dragged its feet because it did not expect the North Korean government to survive long past the collapse of the Soviet Union.North Korea also hedged its bets, secretly keeping a program to enrich uranium so it could one day build its own atomic bombs.In 2000, President Kim Dae-jung, the initiator of the Sunshine Policy, flew to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jong-il, ushering in a period of d\u00e9tente that seemed to promise an end to hostilities on the peninsula. Investment and trade flourished, and families separated by the war were allowed to hold reunions.Kim Jong-il sent his trusted aide, Vice Marshal Jo Myong-rok, to the White House to ask President Bill Clinton to visit Pyongyang. However, Mr. Clinton decided he could not attempt so bold a diplomatic move at the end of his time in office, and instead sent his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright.The new opening with Washington closed after Mr. Bush took office in 2001. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006.\u201cAfter he stepped down, President Clinton visited Seoul and told President Kim Dae-jung how regrettable it was; he said if he had a little bit more time in office, he could have changed the course of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d said Lim Dong-won, a former aide to Mr. Kim, who attended the meeting.Mr. Roh, who replaced Kim Dae-jung, tried to keep the d\u00e9tente alive with his 2007 agreement on easing military tensions and increasing economic cooperation. But the deal, signed four months before Mr. Roh\u2019s term ended, was quickly overturned by Mr. Roh\u2019s conservative successor, Lee Myong-bak.Mr. Lee was eager to align himself with Mr. Bush, who sought to isolate the North with sanctions in the hopes it would surrender its nuclear weapons program, a strategy continued by President Barack Obama.So far, Mr. Moon\u2019s gambit seems to be winning broad support within South Korea. Opinion polls show his approval ratings surging, with some nine out of 10 South Koreans viewing the DMZ meeting as a success.Not all South Koreans are convinced, however.Hong Joon-pyo, leader of the main conservative opposition Korean Liberty Party, likened Mr. Moon to former Prime Minister Arthur Neville Chamberlain of Britain, who he said fell into Hitler\u2019s \u201ctrap of false peace.\u201d\u201cAfter being cheated eight times, did he still think for a ninth time that North Korea would not cheat this time?\u201d Mr. Hong said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How ISIS Has Changed Terrorism in Indonesia", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Jones is a political analyst and terrorism expert long based in Southeast Asia.The damage caused by ISIS was expected to last longer than its caliphate proper, and in Indonesia the group\u2019s impact already seems to have been to expand and transform local extremist movements. Local Islamist extremists still go after the same targets: religious minorities and law enforcement. But their tactics have shifted: Now women and children are participating in suicide attacks.Since the beginning of May, at least 49 Indonesians \u2014 12 civilians, seven police officers and 30 terrorists \u2014 have died in back-to-back attacks by ISIS supporters or government antiterrorism operations.More shocking still are three instances last week of suicide bombings carried out by families, including children.On May 13, six members of the same family attacked three churches in Surabaya, East Java. The father went after one; his teenage sons went after another; and his wife and two daughters, age 12 and 9, blew themselves up at the third. Twelve congregants died.That evening, a mother and her 17-year-old son were killed in Sidoarjo, East Java, apparently when a bomb the father was making prematurely exploded. (The father was injured in the blast and killed by police officers when they arrived at the scene.)On May 14, a couple, two teenage sons and a daughter tried to bomb police headquarters in Surabaya. Only the daughter, 8, survived.These three families knew one another and regularly attended lectures given by an Indonesian Muslim preacher who was arrested in Turkey in 2017 and deported back home after trying, along with more than a dozen relatives and friends, to join ISIS in Syria for almost a year.Even more important about the recent eruption of violence, however, is the fact that it confounds many assumptions experts held about what would happen to Islamist terrorism in Indonesia after the Islamic State was routed in the Middle East.For all the horror of these recent family bombings, however, they may not indicate that extremism is growing in Indonesia: Violence can be as much a sign of weakness as of strength, an effort to keep motivation high precisely because recruitment is declining. Now that their energies are no longer focused on getting to Syria, ISIS\u2019s supporters in Indonesia may be turning their attention back to waging war at home. But now they are having to operate in an environment that is more hostile to their views than it was when the caliphate was proclaimed.Yet they may have an indirect influence: The more that conservative hard-liners reject Christians as equal citizens under the law, the more, perhaps, terrorists will see churches as appropriate targets. Terrorism cannot be disassociated from its political environment.The attacks this month are the work of a tiny fringe desperate for attention, but they undermine Indonesia\u2019s self-image as a nation of largely tolerant, moderate Muslims. It is now up to the government to translate citizen outrage over the bombings into programs to monitor jihadist returnees, curb extremist teachings and protect religious minorities.Sidney Jones is director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta, Indonesia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet the Pro-Trade, Pro-Immigration Economist Running for Congress. As a Republican. In Ohio.", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen there is Tim Kane.Mr. Kane, 50, has a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that sounds as if he answered a casting call for a Republican congressional candidate: An Ohio native, he served in the Air Force, then earned a Ph.D. in economics and worked at conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and the Hoover Institution. Along the way, he helped start two companies, wrote four books and became a familiar commentator on economic issues in newspapers and on television.Yet, in part because of that same r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mr. Kane can seem almost uniquely out of step with the Republican Party in 2018. At a time when much of the party is hostile to elites and even the very idea of expertise, Mr. Kane is a self-described \u201cpolicy nerd\u201d who peppers his conversations with references to economists with little public profile beyond Washington.In the era of \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d Mr. Kane speaks proudly of having testified as an expert on Capitol Hill and highlights endorsements from establishment figures such as former Secretary of State George P. Shultz. And even though President Trump won Ohio in part by tapping into voters\u2019 deep skepticism of immigration and free trade, Mr. Kane is a vocal proponent of both.\u201cI\u2019m an old-school, free-market economist,\u201d Mr. Kane told voters during a recent event in this Columbus suburb.\u201cEven within the Republican Party, it\u2019s a referendum on Trump and whether those traditional conservative Republicans can reclaim control of the party,\u201d said Rita Kipp, head of the League of Women Voters of Licking County, one of seven counties in this sprawling district outside Columbus.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and president of the American Action Forum, a conservative group, said those results were hardly surprising. Trade has never been an easy sell to the public, he said, because the costs, in shuttered plants and lost jobs, are large and obvious, while the benefits \u2014 lower consumer prices and greater productivity \u2014 are diffuse and hard to see.\u201cYou have to make the case on a regular basis that the benefits are greater than the costs,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.Mr. Holtz-Eakin, who has endorsed Mr. Kane, said the Republican Party needed candidates who would make the case for policies that are more popular with economists than with the general public, among them immigration, fiscal restraint and trade.\u201cCampaigns are teachable moments in the United States,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.If any district in Ohio is likely to be receptive to Mr. Kane\u2019s economics lessons, it is the 12th. The district \u2014 which went for Mr. Trump by about 10 points in 2016 \u2014 includes rural areas, but the bulk of the population lives in relatively affluent, educated Columbus suburbs that have largely escaped the postindustrial decline that has afflicted Youngstown, Dayton and other cities. Dublin, where Mr. Kane moved late last year, is one of the state\u2019s wealthiest cities, with a median household income of more than $125,000.Campaigning on a recent Monday, Mr. Kane did not try to run away from his more contentious positions, or from his wonkish r\u00e9sum\u00e9. At a meet-and-greet with voters at a French bakery in Dublin\u2019s quaint downtown, Mr. Kane broke the ice with stories about his days at the Air Force Academy, but quickly pivoted to citing articles he had written promoting free trade and entrepreneurship.Even on friendly turf, however, Mr. Kane faced some skepticism. When one attendee, Caroline Lahrmann, asked about immigration, Mr. Kane noted that he had written 20 articles and was working on a book about the subject. Then he moved into an intricate discussion of immigration policy: why immigration is important for the economy and why he supports work permits, but not a pathway to citizenship, for people in the country illegally.Eventually, Ms. Lahrmann broke in.\u201cI haven\u2019t heard how he\u2019s going to address illegal immigration yet,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are you going to stop the illegal immigration?\u201dMr. Kane said he was not necessarily opposed to a border wall, but he doubted it would do much good. Melissa Stack, a local nurse, cut him off. \u201cI disagree with you that the wall doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said.Speaking after the event, Ms. Lahrmann said she had liked Mr. Kane, but had not been convinced by his answers on immigration. She also questioned his stand on trade.\u201cIt sounds great, free trade,\u201d she said, noting that she had studied economics in college. But, she said, \u201cyou have to play tough sometimes\u201d \u2014 something she said Mr. Trump understood.Mr. Trump will not be on the ballot on Tuesday, but he is a constant presence in the race. Most of Mr. Kane\u2019s rivals for the Republican nomination have embraced Mr. Trump, promising to support his agenda. Melanie Leneghan, who has the backing of several members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, pledges on her campaign website that she \u201cwill stand with our president every step of the way.\u201dMr. Kane is more circumspect. He initially supported Jeb Bush in the 2016 election, and signed a letter opposing Mr. Trump during the primary campaign. But in an interview last week, he praised Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy and said he believed that the president would ultimately side with the pro-trade faction of his administration.\u201cI\u2019m trying to help the president be successful,\u201d Mr. Kane said. \u201cI do think the president is a man who listens.\u201dMr. Kane\u2019s opponents paint him as a Washington insider and a carpetbagger. Mr. Kane grew up in Columbus but until last year had not lived in the area since high school; he was a resident of Virginia when Mr. Tiberi announced his retirement.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t live here and never has,\u201d Ms. Leneghan said. \u201cHe\u2019s a Washington insider.\u201dBut Mr. Kane is serious about winning. He has lent his campaign $244,000 of his own money and received donations of more than $200,000. Two other candidates in the race \u2014 Ms. Leneghan and Troy Balderson, a state senator whom Mr. Tiberi has endorsed for his old seat \u2014 have each raised a similar total. A county prosecutor, Carol O\u2019Brien, and another state senator, Kevin Bacon, have also raised and spent substantial amounts.Several national \u201csuper PACs\u201d have also entered the fray, running ads and sending mailings for and against the leading candidates.In an unusual twist, this primary is actually two elections in one. Voters will get to choose nominees both for a special election to replace Mr. Tiberi, which will be held in August, and for the general election in November.There has been no independent polling, and local political experts say that with turnout expected to be low, Tuesday\u2019s outcome is anyone\u2019s guess.In the meantime, Mr. Kane is out knocking on doors, making his case to anyone willing to listen.Campaigning in Dublin, Mr. Kane spied a man in a Navy hat walking his dog. After chatting briefly about military service, the man told Mr. Kane that what he really wanted was for Congress to balance the budget.Mr. Kane\u2019s campaign manager, standing a few feet away, smiled, knowing what was coming next.As a matter of fact, Mr. Kane said, \u201cI wrote a book on that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aid Agency Chief Reports \u2018Tremendous Sense of Optimism\u2019 in North Korea", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korean officials have a \u201ctremendous sense of optimism\u201d about their country\u2019s recent turn toward diplomacy and have promised to work more openly with humanitarian aid groups, according to the head of the World Food Program, who visited the country last week.David Beasley, the executive director of the United Nations agency, also said that while malnutrition continued to be a problem in the impoverished North, he saw no evidence during his four-day trip of the kind of extreme food shortages that killed more than two million people there in the 1990s.\u201cWhat I did not see was starvation,\u201d Mr. Beasley said Tuesday at a news conference in Seoul. \u201cI saw none of that. Is there undernutrition? Of course there is.\u201dMr. Beasley, a former Republican governor of South Carolina, said the diplomacy underway between the North and the United States had had a visible effect on the attitude of North Korean officials. He said his group was given more access during its tour of the countryside than in past trips.\u201cThere is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership and by the people I met with and hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in history, a new page,\u201d he said.The World Food Program has been operating in North Korea for more than 20 years, providing nutritional aid for children, pregnant women and nursing mothers. But in recent years, the agency has had trouble raising funds for its work there, as the United Nations Security Council has imposed increasingly tough sanctions on the North over its nuclear and missile tests.The North has also been accused of not giving independent monitors enough access to establish that aid is reaching people in need.Mr. Beasley said his team spent a considerable amount of time explaining to North Korean officials that they needed to provide the World Food Program with more access and data, to ensure transparency in aid distribution and help the agency better determine people\u2019s needs. He said he saw \u201ca genuine desire to be more open\u201d and engage in \u201cmore frank and candid discussions.\u201dThe North Koreans \u201cgave us all indications that they plan to meet our standards and work with us,\u201d Mr. Beasley said.On average, North Korean teenagers are several inches shorter than their South Korean counterparts because of malnutrition, according to humanitarian groups. \u201cNo children should suffer the consequences of political decisions,\u201d Mr. Beasley said.During his visit, Mr. Beasley said, he saw men and women working in the fields with minimal farm machinery, toiling with their hands, hoes and shovels and using oxen to pull plows. He said \u201cevery inch\u201d of arable land, up to the edges of roads and down embankments, seemed to be cultivated, as the mountainous, heavily sanctioned country struggled to produce food.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Britain, Austerity Is Changing Everything", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "Britain\u2019s Big SqueezeAfter eight years of budget cutting, Britain is looking less like the rest of Europe and more like the United States, with a shrinking welfare state and spreading poverty.Supported byPRESCOT, England \u2014 A walk through this modest town in the northwest of England amounts to a tour of the casualties of Britain\u2019s age of austerity.The old library building has been sold and refashioned into a glass-fronted luxury home. The leisure center has been razed, eliminating the public swimming pool. The local museum has receded into town history. The police station has been shuttered.Now, as the local government desperately seeks to turn assets into cash, Browns Field, a lush park in the center of town, may be doomed, too. At a meeting in November, the council included it on a list of 17 parks to sell to developers.\u201cEverybody uses this park,\u201d says Jackie Lewis, who raised two children in a red brick house a block away. \u201cThis is probably our last piece of community space. It\u2019s been one after the other. You just end up despondent.\u201dIn the eight years since London began sharply curtailing support for local governments, the borough of Knowsley, a bedroom community of Liverpool, has seen its budget cut roughly in half. Liverpool itself has suffered a nearly two-thirds cut in funding from the national government \u2014 its largest source of discretionary revenue. Communities in much of Britain have seen similar losses.When Ms. Lewis and her husband bought their home a quarter-century ago, Prescot had a comforting village feel. Now, core government relief programs are being cut and public facilities eliminated, adding pressure to public services like police and fire departments, just as they, too, grapple with diminished funding.\u201cThe government has created destitution,\u201d says Barry Kushner, a Labour Party councilman in Liverpool and the cabinet member for children\u2019s services. \u201cAusterity has had nothing to do with economics. It was about getting out from under welfare. It\u2019s about politics abandoning vulnerable people.\u201dConservative Party leaders say that austerity has been driven by nothing more grandiose than arithmetic.\u201cIt\u2019s the ideology of two plus two equals four,\u201d says Daniel Finkelstein, a Conservative member of the upper chamber of Parliament, the House of Lords, and a columnist for The Times of London. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t driven by a desire to reduce spending on public services. It was driven by the fact that we had a vast deficit problem, and the debt was going to keep growing.\u201dWhatever the operative thinking, austerity\u2019s manifestations are palpable and omnipresent. It has refashioned British society, making it less like the rest of Western Europe, with its generous social safety nets and egalitarian ethos, and more like the United States, where millions lack health care and job loss can set off a precipitous plunge in fortunes.Much as the United States took the Great Depression of the 1930s as impetus to construct a national pension system while eventually delivering health care for the elderly and the poor, Britain reacted to the trauma of World War II by forging its own welfare state. The United States has steadily reduced benefits since the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. Britain rolled back its programs in the same era, under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher. Still, its safety net remained robust by world standards.Then came the global financial panic of 2008 \u2014 the most crippling economic downturn since the Great Depression. Britain\u2019s turn from its welfare state in the face of yawning budget deficits is a conspicuous indicator that the world has been refashioned by the crisis.Conservative Party leaders initially sold budget cuts as a virtue, ushering in what they called the Big Society. Diminish the role of a bloated government bureaucracy, they contended, and grass-roots organizations, charities and private companies would step to the fore, reviving communities and delivering public services more efficiently.To a degree, a spirit of voluntarism materialized. At public libraries, volunteers now outnumber paid staff. In struggling communities, residents have formed food banks while distributing hand-me-down school uniforms. But to many in Britain, this is akin to setting your house on fire and then reveling in the community spirit as neighbors come running to help extinguish the blaze.Most view the Big Society as another piece of political sloganeering \u2014 long since ditched by the Conservatives \u2014 that served as justification for an austerity program that has advanced the refashioning unleashed in the 1980s by Mrs. Thatcher.\u201cWe are making cuts that I think Margaret Thatcher, back in the 1980s, could only have dreamt of,\u201d Greg Barker said in a speech in 2011, when he was a Conservative member of Parliament.A backlash ensued, with public recognition that budget cuts came with tax relief for corporations, and that the extensive ranks of the wealthy were little disturbed.Britain hasn\u2019t endured austerity to the same degree as Greece, where cutbacks were swift and draconian. Instead, British austerity has been a slow bleed, though the cumulative toll has been substantial.Local governments have suffered a roughly one-fifth plunge in revenue since 2010, after adding taxes they collect, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies in London.The national court system has eliminated nearly a third of its staff. Spending on prisons has plunged more than a fifth, with violent assaults on prison guards more than doubling. The number of elderly people receiving government-furnished care that enables them to remain in their homes has fallen by roughly a quarter.In an alternate reality, this nasty stretch of history might now be ending. Austerity measures were imposed in the name of eliminating budget deficits, and last year Britain finally produced a modest budget surplus.In the blue-collar reaches of northern England, in places like Liverpool, modern history tends to be told in the cadence of lamentation, as the story of one indignity after another. In these communities, Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s name is an epithet, and austerity is the latest villain: London bankers concocted a financial crisis, multiplying their wealth through reckless gambling; then London politicians used budget deficits as an excuse to cut spending on the poor while handing tax cuts to corporations. Robin Hood, reversed.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly an attack on our class,\u201d says Dave Kelly, a retired bricklayer in the town of Kirkby, on the outskirts of Liverpool, where many factories sit empty, broken monuments to another age. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on who we are. The whole fabric of society is breaking down.\u201dAs much as any city, Liverpool has seen sweeping changes in its economic fortunes.In the 17th century, the city enriched itself on human misery. Local shipping companies sent vessels to West Africa, transporting slaves to the American colonies and returning bearing the fruits of bondage \u2014 cotton and tobacco, principally.The cotton fed the mills of Manchester nearby, yielding textiles destined for multiple continents. By the late 19th century, Liverpool\u2019s port had become the gateway to the British Empire, its status underscored by the shipping company headquarters lining the River Mersey.By the next century \u2014 through the Great Depression and the German bombardment of World War II \u2014 Liverpool had descended into seemingly terminal decline. Its hard luck, blue-collar station was central to the identity of its most famous export, the Beatles, whose star power seemed enhanced by the fact such talent could emerge from such a place.Today, more than a quarter of Liverpool\u2019s roughly 460,000 residents are officially poor, making austerity traumatic: Public institutions charged with aiding vulnerable people are themselves straining from cutbacks.Over the past eight years, the Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, which serves greater Liverpool, has closed five fire stations while cutting the force to 620 firefighters from about 1,000.\u201cI\u2019ve had to preside over the systematic dismantling of the system,\u201d says the fire chief, Dan Stephens.His department recently analyzed the 83 deaths that occurred in accidental house fires from 2007 to 2017. The majority of the victims \u2014 51 people \u2014 lived alone and were alone at the time of the deadly fire. Nineteen of those 51 were in need of some form of home care.The loss of home care \u2014 a casualty of austerity \u2014 has meant that more older people are being left alone unattended.Virtually every public agency now struggles to do more with less while attending to additional problems once handled by some other outfit whose budget is also in tatters.Chief Stephens said people losing cash benefits are falling behind on their electric bills and losing service, resorting to candles for light \u2014 a major fire risk.The city has cut mental health services, so fewer staff members are visiting people prone to hoarding newspapers, for instance, leaving veritable bonfires piling up behind doors, unseen.\u201cThere are knock-on effects all the way through the system,\u201d says Chief Stephens, who recently announced plans to resign and move to Australia.The National Health Service has supposedly been spared from budget cuts. But spending has been frozen in many areas, resulting in cuts per patient. At public hospitals, people have grown resigned to waiting for hours for emergency care, and weeks for referrals to specialists.\u201cI think the government wants to run it down so the whole thing crumbles and they don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore,\u201d says Kenneth Buckle, a retired postal worker who has been waiting three months for a referral for a double knee replacement. \u201cEverything takes forever now.\u201dAt Fulwood Green Medical Center in Liverpool, Dr. Simon Bowers, a general practitioner, points to austerity as an aggravating factor in the flow of stress-related maladies he encounters \u2014 high blood pressure, heart problems, sleeplessness, anxiety.He argues that the cuts, and the deterioration of the National Health Service, represent a renouncement of Britain\u2019s historical debts. He rattles off the lowlights \u2014 the slave trade, colonial barbarity.\u201cWe as a country said, \u2018We have been cruel. Let\u2019s be nice now and look after everyone,\u2019\u201d Dr. Bowers says. \u201cThe N.H.S. has everyone\u2019s back. It doesn\u2019t matter how rich or poor you are. It\u2019s written into the psyche of this country.\u201d\u201cAusterity isn\u2019t a necessity,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a political choice, to move Britain in a different way. I can\u2019t see a rationale beyond further enriching the rich while making the lives of the poor more miserable.\u201dWealthy Britons remain among the world\u2019s most comfortable people, enjoying lavish homes, private medical care, top-notch schools and restaurants run by chefs from Paris and Tokyo. The poor, the elderly, the disabled and the jobless are increasingly prone to Kafka-esque tangles with the bureaucracy to keep public support.For Emma Wilde, a 31-year-old single mother, the misadventure began with an inscrutable piece of correspondence.Raised in the Liverpool neighborhood of Croxteth, Ms. Wilde has depended on welfare benefits to support herself and her two children. Her father, a retired window washer, is disabled. She has been taking care of him full time, relying on a so-called caregiver\u2019s allowance, which amounts to about $85 a week, and income support reaching about $145 a month.The letter put this money in jeopardy.Sent by a private firm contracted to manage part of the government\u2019s welfare programs, it informed Ms. Wilde that she was being investigated for fraud, accused of living with a partner \u2014 a development she is obliged to have reported.Ms. Wilde lives only with her children, she insists. But while the investigation proceeds, her benefits are suspended.Eight weeks after the money ceased, Ms. Wilde\u2019s electricity was shut off for nonpayment. During the late winter, she and her children went to bed before 7 p.m. to save on heat. She has swallowed her pride and visited a food bank at a local church, bringing home bread and hamburger patties.\u201cI felt a bit ashamed, like I had done something wrong, \u201d Ms. Wilde says. \u201cBut then you\u2019ve got to feed the kids.\u201dShe has been corresponding with the Department for Work and Pensions, mailing bank statements to try to prove her limited income and to restore her funds.The experience has given her a perverse sense of community. At the local center where she brings her children for free meals, she has met people who lost their unemployment benefits after their bus was late and they missed an appointment with a caseworker. She and her friends exchange tips on where to secure hand-me-down clothes.\u201cEveryone is in the same situation now,\u201d Ms. Wilde says. \u201cYou just don\u2019t have enough to live on.\u201dFrom its inception, austerity carried a whiff of moral righteousness, as if those who delivered it were sober-minded grown-ups. Belt tightening was sold as a shared undertaking, an unpleasant yet unavoidable reckoning with dangerous budget deficits.\u201cThe truth is that the country was living beyond its means,\u201d the then-chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, declared in outlining his budget to Parliament in 2010. \u201cToday, we have paid the debts of a failed past, and laid the foundations for a more prosperous future.\u201d\u201cProsperity for all,\u201d he added.Eight years later, housing subsidies have been restricted, along with tax credits for poor families. The government has frozen unemployment and disability benefits even as costs of food and other necessities have climbed. Over the last five years, the government has begun transitioning to so-called Universal Credit, giving those who receive benefits lump sum payments in place of funds from individual programs. Many have lost support for weeks or months while their cases have shifted to the new system.All of which is unfortunate yet inescapable, assert Conservative lawmakers. The government was borrowing roughly one-fourth of what it was spending. To put off cuts was to risk turning Britain into the next Greece.\u201cThe hard left has never been very clear about what their alternative to the program was,\u201d says Neil O\u2019Brien, a Conservative lawmaker who was previously a Treasury adviser to Mr. Osborne. \u201cPresumably, it would be some enormous increase in taxation, but they are a bit shy about what that would mean.\u201dHe rejects the notion that austerity is a means of class warfare, noting that wealthy people have been hit with higher taxes on investment and expanded fees when buying luxury properties.Britain spends roughly the same portion of its national income on public spending today as it did a decade ago, said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.But those dependent on state support express a sense that the system has been rigged to discard them.Glendys Perry, 61, was born with cerebral palsy, making it difficult for her to walk. For three decades, she answered the phones at an auto parts company. After she lost that job in 2010, she lived on a disability check.Last summer, a letter came, summoning her to \u201can assessment.\u201d The first question dispatched any notion that this was a sincere exploration.\u201cHow long have you had cerebral palsy?\u201d (From birth.) \u201cWill it get better?\u201d (No.)In fact, her bones were weakening, and she fell often. Her hands were not quick enough to catch her body, resulting in bruises to her face.The man handling the assessment seemed uninterested.\u201cCan you walk from here to there?\u201d he asked her.He dropped a pen on the floor and commanded her to pick it up \u2014 a test of her dexterity.\u201cHow did you come here?\u201d he asked her.\u201cBy bus,\u201d she replied.Can you make a cup of tea? Can you get dressed?\u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m physically disabled,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018Not mentally.\u2019\u201dWhen the letter came informing her that she was no longer entitled to her disability payment \u2014 that she had been deemed fit for work \u2014 she was not surprised.\u201cThey want you to be off of benefits,\u201d she says. \u201cI think they were just ticking boxes.\u201dThe political architecture of Britain insulates those imposing austerity from the wrath of those on the receiving end. London makes the aggregate cuts, while leaving to local politicians the messy work of allocating the pain.Spend a morning with the aggrieved residents of Prescot and one hears scant mention of London, or even austerity. People train their fury on the Knowsley Council, and especially on the man who was until recently its leader, Andy Moorhead. They accuse him of hastily concocting plans to sell Browns Field without community consultation.Mr. Moorhead, 62, seems an unlikely figure for the role of austerity villain. A career member of the Labour Party, he has the everyday bearing of a genial denizen of the corner pub.\u201cI didn\u2019t become a politician to take things off of people,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got the reality to deal with.\u201dThe reality is that London is phasing out grants to local governments, forcing councils to live on housing and business taxes.\u201cAusterity is here to stay,\u201d says Jonathan Davies, director of the Center for Urban Research on Austerity at De Montfort University in Leicester, England. \u201cWhat we might now see over the next two years is a wave of bankruptcies, like Detroit.\u201dIndeed, the council of Northamptonshire, in the center of England, recently became the first local government in nearly two decades to meet that fate.Knowsley expects to spend $192 million in the next budget year, Mr. Moorhead says, with 60 percent of that absorbed by care for the elderly and services for children with health and developmental needs. An additional 18 percent will be spent on services the council must provide by law, such as garbage collection and highway maintenance.To Mr. Moorhead, the equation ends with the imperative to sell valuable land, yielding an endowment to protect remaining parks and services.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to pursue development,\u201d Mr. Moorhead says. \u201cLocally, I\u2019m the bad guy.\u201dThe real malefactors are the same as ever, he says.He points at a picture of Mrs. Thatcher on the wall behind him. He vents about London bankers, who left his people to clean up their mess.\u201cNo one should be doing this,\u201d he says. \u201cNot in the fifth-wealthiest country in the whole world. Sacking people, making people redundant, reducing our services for the vulnerable in our society. It\u2019s the worst job in the world.\u201dNow, it is someone else\u2019s job. In early May, the local Labour Party ousted Mr. Moorhead as council leader amid mounting anger over the planned sale of parks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Air France Dispute Threatens to Escalate Macron\u2019s Battle With Labor", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 In the first year of his presidency, Emmanuel Macron has pushed business-friendly labor laws through Parliament, made it easier for companies to hire and fire, cut the wealth tax and decentralized collective bargaining. Through it all, France\u2019s most militant unions have resisted.His changes, which set out to reshape the way France\u2019s economy and society work, are now facing increasing pushback from labor groups. For weeks, unions have staged a series of strikes to oppose efforts to make the nation\u2019s main railway system, the SNCF, more competitive. And unions representing Air France-KLM staff on Monday called for new strikes after rejecting a pay proposal.While Mr. Macron\u2019s economic changes do not take aim at the nation\u2019s flagship air carrier, his administration has inserted itself directly into the fight, warning labor leaders that they risked driving Air France to the brink of calamity.France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the company might \u201cdisappear\u201d if unions persisted in their demands for an immediate 5 percent wage increase and continued rolling strikes that have already affected tens of thousands of fliers worldwide. The French government, which owns a minority stake in Air France, would not ride to the rescue with a taxpayer bailout if the airline faltered, Mr. Le Maire said.The standoff, which has already cost the airline an estimated 300 million euros, or $360 million, in lost revenue, prompted the abrupt resignation of the airline\u2019s chief executive. Shares of the company were down 13 percent on Monday.\u201cI am not taking the money of the French and putting it in a company that isn\u2019t at the required competitive level,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said.The battle is an outgrowth of Mr. Macron\u2019s effort to remake the French economy.Mr. Macron\u2019s moves have been cheered by businesses and investors. It has encouraged drawn companies like Facebook and Amazon to step up their presence in France.In many ways, that has been Mr. Macron\u2019s point. Although only around 8 percent of the nation\u2019s workers are unionized, organized labor has long held outsize clout at the negotiating table with employers. In France, even small changes tend to agitate unions, which have historically sought to secure workplace protections through protests and strikes.Before pushing through changes to the labor laws, Mr. Macron held more than 50 meetings with unions shortly after his election in an effort to get them onboard with his program.The General Confederation of Labor, known as the C.G.T., has largely resisted, seeing an effort to repeal hard-won labor rights. The union has been at the forefront of mobilizing actions that in recent weeks have led hundreds of thousands of people into the streets, and encouraged regular strikes at the nation\u2019s railway system that are scheduled to last until July.At Air France, the government pushed back against labor groups over the weekend after the chief executive, Jean-Marc Janaillac, resigned abruptly on Friday. Mr. Janaillac had failed to win workers over in a contentious internal referendum that proposed a 7 percent pay increase for pilots and staff over four years.Air France\u2019s hard-line pilots\u2019 union had demanded an immediate 5 percent raise to make up for wages that have been frozen for nearly five years. The company has recorded record profits thanks to lower oil prices since 2016, prompting the union to insist that Air France could afford the pay increase.Still, it has set up a dangerous game of brinkmanship between unions and the French government, which has hinted that it is willing to let Air France go under.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t make the necessary efforts to be at the same competitive level of Lufthansa and other major airlines, it will disappear,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said on the French television station BFM on Sunday. He added that the union\u2019s salary demands were \u201cunjustified\u201d and urged employees to show \u201cresponsibility.\u201dSuch talk is reminiscent of Mr. Macron\u2019s broader approach to overhauling the economy. Some analysts have criticized the way he has pushed through changes to the labor laws, most of which have been done by the equivalent of executive order, raising questions about how democratic \u2014 or not \u2014 his methods have been.\u201cEmmanuel Macron is walking a fine line between the rehabilitation of a certain presidential authority and authoritarianism,\u201d Jean-Claude Monod, a specialist in political philosophy, said in an interview published Monday in the French daily Le Monde. \u201cOne has the impression of a deafness in front of forms of protest or political experimentations, of a will to use force for his reforms.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Heartbreak of Kanye West", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Hampton has written about music for The Village Voice, Spin, NPR and\u00a0other outlets.Mr. West thought his recent return to Twitter after an almost yearlong hiatus, with relentless contrarian, stream-of consciousness tweets from the minuscule Negro corner of the alt-right world, would read like a takeover of Twitter. But that\u2019s not how the platform works. Black Twitter runs Twitter, and Black Twitter swiftly handed Mr. West his lunch. Mr. West was reading the blowback and did exactly what a person does when he or she is losing \u2014 he dug in.Like Mr. Trump, who also brags about not reading books, Mr. West is parroting the racist right-wing talking points he has learned from watching YouTube videos. The same white power wing nuts who trolled him for years as a way of defending Taylor Swift\u2019s honor are now over the moon to hear the rapper blame President Barack Obama for not ameliorating gang violence in Chicago, to see Mr. West at the office of the gossip website TMZ blaming his own enslaved ancestors for their enslavement.Because the trolls won the election, their dangerous drivel sometimes becomes policy, as the musician John Legend tried to tell Mr. West in a series of reasonable texts that Mr. West immediately published. Those talking points from Alex Jones and company perpetuate mass criminalization and incarceration, deportation and worse.When a poll shows 20 percent of Trump supporters would have opposed the freeing of slaves, it\u2019s more than a fun punctuation ending the night on cable news. Those talking points run in tandem with textbooks used in Texas schools that describe slaves as \u201cworkers\u201d and their journey to America as \u201cimmigration.\u201d The denial of the sadism and brutality of slavery is perpetuated when there\u2019s \u201canother side\u201d arguing to keep statues and symbols of the Confederacy in public places, and when plantation tours explain the generosity with which slave owners cared for their chattel.When Mr. Legend and Mr. West later demonstrated their lasting friendship by publishing pictures of themselves at a baby shower \u201cdespite their differences,\u201d they advanced the fiction that theirs are two equal but divergent viewpoints. They are not. There is the same old white supremacy that denies black humanity, and there are people who struggle mightily against white supremacy and for black life.It would be unfair to call Mr. West\u2019s public outbursts mere stunts. He was right about the MTV Video Music Awards best female video of 2009. Beyonc\u00e9 should have won. Mr. West was at his most profound in 2005 when he said George Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people after that president did a flyby of the poor and black victims of New Orleans\u2019s levee failure.When Hurricane Katrina happened, Mr. West was a new artist and his \u201cCollege Dropout\u201d was an album that helped give millennials a clear sense of identity. He wrote about being insecure, about not being comfortable managing his new money and visibility. That honesty was refreshing. His self-reflection and self-diagnosis felt familiar to a generation that drafted dozens of confessionals a day on social media.Kids who were in high school and younger when Mr. West made his debut connected with him more than they did with M.C.s like Jay-Z or even Tupac Shakur or Biggie Smalls, who deserve respect but belonged to another era. 50 Cent seemed a Neanderthal compared with the nerdy, backpack-wearing Mr. West.Mr. West rose as the economy collapsed, and his open insecurity spoke to a generation whose struggle was the housing market collapse, not a crack epidemic. He is the son of a single mother, a professor who raised him abroad for a semester or two in China. His story was more like President Obama\u2019s than 50 Cent\u2019s.This new generation didn\u2019t necessarily believe in crowns, but Mr. West was their guy, and almost immediately after being chosen, he began to collapse from the pressure.We\u2019ve seen Mr. West melt down before. His 2013 radio interview with the journalist Sway was as unhinged as Mr. Trump\u2019s recent call-in to \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d Mr. Trump and Mr. West both seemed to want the same thing in those tirades \u2014 to be recognized as gods. Mr. Trump roared into the phone about the Breitbart calculator he uses to argue voter fraud cost him the popular vote. The rapper screamed at Sway, who seemed unwilling to concede that Mr. West is the greatest artist of his generation. Or maybe Mr. West was arguing he was the greatest artist of any generation. It\u2019s hard to remember. We got a harmless new pop culture refrain from the interview \u2014 \u201cHow, Sway?\u201d \u2014 and mostly moved on.But unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s call, Mr. West\u2019s interview with Sway was videotaped. We were witnessing something more than his outsize ego doing battle with his mammoth insecurity. His refusal to make eye contact with Sway was particularly off-putting. He spent the hour talking to the heavens \u2014 not to the interviewer, not even to the audience. Absent was the wink and nod embedded in Muhammad Ali\u2019s news conference performances, where he talked about himself in the third person and invented the kind of braggadocio that would become hip-hop\u2019s bedrock. Watching Mr. West during that interview, some of us began to worry about his mental health.Like most of his fans, I\u2019m not qualified or interested in actually attempting to diagnose an illness in Mr. West. He has shared with us that he has been medicated and hospitalized. He has also told us that his recent Twitter rant is unconnected to his mental health, that he is fine. His performance at TMZ was similar to his interview with Sway. It wasn\u2019t until Van Lathan, on the staff there, interrupted to take him on about slavery that Mr. West even seemed present in the room, and that was truly heartbreaking to watch.But what was dangerous was the way Mr. West included Candace Owens, an alt-right darling, a black woman and puppet, on his broadcast from the TMZ office. Her participation was most likely arranged by alt-right operatives. A Black Lives Matter strategist hypothesized as much on his Facebook page when he noticed white power operatives taking credit for connecting the two.With uncharacteristic generosity, Mr. West ceded the mic to Ms. Owens, who allows a racist, misogynist movement to hold her up as evidence that it is neither. Mr. Trump\u2019s speechwriters made sure to include Mr. West in his recent speech to the National Rifle Association, thanking the rapper for \u201cdoubling\u201d his approval numbers among black people. He was referring to a real poll, but he got it wrong. The doubling was only among black men, from 11 percent to 22 percent (with a margin of error of nine points).Mr. West barely owned the entire week. R. Kelly had some karma delivered to his front door, and the fascist, feeble Rudy Giuliani had his moments, embarrassing himself. But Mr. West\u2019s shrill missives from the monochromatic sunken place that is his mansion may be consequential in ways he can\u2019t fathom.Dream Hampton (@dreamhampton) is a filmmaker and writer.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When People and Companies Are Both Just \u2018Brands\u2019?", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsSome ideas are bigger than others. Some even grow so large that they turn into paradigms, their logic organizing the way we see everything around them. And if you\u2019re uncertain what framework dominates modern life, well, you can take it from the TED conference fixture and Advertising for Humanity founder Dan Pallotta, who put it bluntly enough in a 2011 article for Harvard Business Review: \u201cBrand is everything, and everything is brand.\u201dHe was writing in the service of building his own brand, which is about rebranding other people\u2019s brands. The brand, in fact, is such a ubiquitous organizing principle for so many things \u2014 companies, products, people \u2014 that it has been forced to spawn an expansive glossary of subcategories and varieties. There are \u201cpublic brands\u201d (civic institutions), \u201cbrand extensions\u201d (new products from existing brands), \u201cfighter brands\u201d (cheaper brands released by costlier brands to reattract lost brand loyalty) and \u201cbrand leaders\u201d (the very best brands). Even aspects of branding itself are branded, with \u201cbrand managers\u201d (marketers) building \u201cbrand equity\u201d (likability) through the cultivation of \u201cbrandface\u201d (the way the consumer sees herself when she engages with the brand). The apotheosis of all this might be the \u201clifestyle brand\u201d \u2014 a corporate bid to escape the humdrum reality of selling products and instead market an entire way of being. Taco Bell is entering the category with a Forever 21 clothing line targeted at \u201cmaking wardrobes a whole lot saucier.\u201d Lexus has chased the luxury lifestyle into the sea by introducing a yacht. A vice president for Good Foods describes its guacamole as part of \u201ca lifestyle brand that adds optimum nutrition and wellness, along with the fun factor that can be enjoyed during holidays like Cinco de Mayo.\u201dAnything that can be consumed is now understood as a brand \u2014 and on the internet, that\u2019s every last bit of content. This is how a consultant like Eric Garland can, on the strength of a viral tweet storm about the \u201cgame theory\u201d behind American politics, brand himself as a Russian conspiracy sage and market subscriptions to @gametheorytoday. It\u2019s also why actual brands, like Hamburger Helper or Denny\u2019s, hang around social media masquerading as people, posting jokes and memes and roasting haters. Even the most cynical internet users speak semiseriously about our posts being \u201con brand\u201d or \u201coff brand.\u201d There is no refuge from the logic of the brand \u2014 and if there is, some up-and-coming strategist will soon enough bolster her own brand by colonizing it.At its core, branding is a process of humanization: It imbues companies with personalities. Often the personification is overt. Once there were Aunt Jemima and Betty Crocker; now there\u2019s the Trump Organization and Fenty Beauty. As the celebrity adman Bruce Barton once said: \u201cInstitutions have souls, just as men and nations have souls.\u201d A company with a soul becomes relatable, but in a deceptive way: The more we think of it as a \u201cbrand,\u201d the more our focus shifts away from things like labor practices and supply chains and onto issues of narrative and identity.Part of what Peters envisioned was human beings\u2019 thinking of themselves in the same way. The internet had made people identical, too, just messages stacked in a virtual box; like the snacks and sneakers that came before them, they needed ways to differentiate themselves. Where \u201cThe Brand Called You\u201d becomes fascinating, though, is when it applies this logic to employment. Peters saw personal branding as a way to liberate yourself from the constraints of corporate life; he described lifelong steady employment as \u201cwhat we used to call indentured servitude.\u201d In its place, he hailed the emergence of a new \u201cproject world,\u201d where work \u201cis organized into bite-sized packets.\u201d To thrive in such a world, he encouraged readers to collect and market skills and connections \u2014 to throw out their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in favor of a \u201cmarketing brochure for brand You.\u201dHe imagined empowered workers divesting themselves from corporate drudgery, but what actually happened was the opposite: Our corporations divested from us. Over the two decades since \u201cThe Brand Called You,\u201d full-time employment has steadily atomized into casual, part-time and temporary work, culminating in the \u201cproject world\u201d of the gig economy \u2014 microjobs driving for Uber, running errands for TaskRabbit or cooking up side hustles on Fiverr, a company whose subway ads glamorize pitiless overwork (\u201csleep deprivation is your drug of choice\u201d) despite its being named after a woefully small amount of cash.The opportunities to market ourselves online are never-ending, but the financial rewards remain elusive. Headlines heralding the multimillion-dollar incomes of YouTube stars can make cultivating a brand there seem like a real career option, but a recent study found that even channels among the top 3 percent of viewership can bring in as little as $16,800 a year. (When a would-be YouTube star opened fire in the company\u2019s offices, it was perhaps the first workplace shooting of the gig economy.) Marketing money flows through Instagram, but few of the \u201cinfluencers\u201d there see much of it; the Cornell professor Brooke Erin Duffy has described them as engaging in \u201caspirational labor,\u201d a \u201cmode of (mostly) uncompensated, independent work that is propelled by the much-venerated ideal of getting paid to do what you love.\u201dThey burnish their brands based on the unspoken assumption that a successful brand leads naturally to actual success. But this tricky conversion rarely takes place, and the work behind it tends to be less valuable to us than it is, in the aggregate, to the companies that facilitate it. All the time I thought I was building my own brand, seeding the internet with personal information in a bid to dominate the Google results \u2014 fending off challengers like Amanda Hess, the saintly doctor who delayed giving birth in order to deliver another woman\u2019s baby first \u2014 I was enriching any number of tech companies.Tom Peters encouraged us to break the chains of the corporate world in favor of pursuing a life of autonomous creativity. But now branding has taken over not just work but life itself, seizing control of our appearances, our social relationships, even our approach to civil society. After Starbucks staff called the police on two black men waiting in one of their stores \u2014 then closed 8,000 locations to conduct bias training for employees \u2014 a Forbes contributor praised the company for showing \u201cbrand purpose and promise\u201d that could \u201cprovide direction for both Starbucks and society at large.\u201d Even in the age of the personal brand, corporations rule.Amanda Hess is a critic at large for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Fertility Rate Fell to a Record Low, for a Second Straight Year", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The fertility rate in the United States fell to a record low for a second straight year, federal officials reported Thursday, extending a deep decline that began in 2008 with the Great Recession.The fertility rate fell to 60.2 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age, down 3 percent from 2016, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. It was the largest single-year decline since 2010, when families were still feeling the effects of a weak economy.Fertility rates are essential measures of a society\u2019s demographic balance. If they are too high, that can strain resources like housing and education. If they are too low, a country can face challenges replacing its work force and supporting its older adults, like in Russia and Japan. In the United States, declines in rates have not led to drops in the population, in part because they have been largely offset by immigration.The country has been living through one of the longest declines in fertility in decades and demographers are trying to figure out what is driving it. Rates tend to drop during difficult economic times as people put off having babies, and then rise once the economy rebounds. But the rate has not recovered since the Great Recession. A brief uptick in 2014 did not last. The number of births has also declined, and last year was its lowest level since 1987. The fertility rate is the number of births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44.\u201cEvery year I look at data and expect it will be the year that birthrates start to tick up, and every year we hit another all-time low,\u201d said Kenneth M. Johnson, a demographer at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the big demographic mysteries of recent times.\u201dHe said it seemed to be inconsistent with the growing number of women of childbearing age: In 2017, women had nearly 500,000 fewer babies than in 2007, despite the fact that there were an estimated 7 percent more women in their prime childbearing years of 20 to 39.Social forces are also at work. Women are postponing marriage, becoming more educated and are more likely to be the primary breadwinners for their households.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell whether this is a dip that we periodically see in fertility or this is a long-term trend due to major social changes,\u201d said Donna Strobino, a demographer at the Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.She noted that the numbers of births to 10- to 14-year-old girls, now only a few thousand, are down from over 6,000, 10 years ago. The reverse has happened with births to women in their late 40s, which were more than 9,000 last year. Nearly one in five births are now to women 35 or older, she said.Shannon Hettinger, a 32-year-old from Washington, D.C., said she definitely wanted children. She grew up in a large family in a small town in Pennsylvania and almost all her high school friends are married with children. But she moved to Washington, and spent her 20s deciding on a career. Now that she has one she loves \u2014 she works in residential real estate sales \u2014 she is not going to stop until she gets established. That means not having children for a while.\u201cI just want to build my book of business and see where I can go from here,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole focus is career growth. That\u2019s my No. 1 priority.\u201d\u201cOnce I achieve a certain level of success,\u201d she added, \u201cthen I\u2019ll start thinking about a family.\u201dIvy Gray-Klein, 26, who lives in Philadelphia and works at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, said she was open to having children but cannot imagine doing so until she is 30 or 35. She wants to feel settled in her own life first. Now she has three roommates, is paying down her student loans and is working to build a little bit of savings.\u201cI\u2019m just really trying to get myself to a place that is solid,\u201d she said by phone. \u201cHaving a child right now would be so destabilizing. Children just seem like such an enormous financial undertaking.\u201dThe country has had declines before. The longest period of continuous decline on record was from 1958 to 1968, according to Brady E. Hamilton, a statistician and demographer with the National Center for Health Statistics. The United States has been tracking the number of births and birthrates since about 1910.The most recent decline has been deepest for minorities. The fertility rate among Hispanic women dropped more than 27 percent between 2007 and 2016, the most recent year of data by race. The rate for whites has dropped about 4 percent, for blacks about 11 percent and for Asians about 5 percent.The biggest falls have been among younger women, but last year the birthrate even declined for women in their 30s, an unusual development, demographers said. The rate had been rising for that group, as more women delayed childbearing.\u201cI was surprised to see that reversal,\u201d said Gretchen M. Livingston, a demographer at the Pew Research Center. She cautioned into reading too much into one year.A bright spot was the rate of births to teenagers, which has dropped 55 percent since 2007 \u2014 nearly 8 percent a year \u2014 a decline Dr. Hamilton called \u201cphenomenal.\u201d The teenage birthrate is down 70 percent since its peak in 1991, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Emerges as Key Power Player in Soccer", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn soccer, all roads suddenly lead to Saudi Arabia.FIFA, the world governing body, is facing three major decisions in the coming weeks and months, and Saudi Arabia, long a bit player among soccer\u2019s ruling classes, is positioning itself as one of the most powerful influencers in each of them.Foremost is the vote on the host of the 2026 World Cup. There is also a proposal to expand the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to 48 teams. Finally, FIFA has to decide how to proceed in ongoing negotiations with investors who are offering as much as $25 billion for two new soccer tournaments that could reshape both club and international competition. Saudi Arabia is among the biggest investors in the consortium that has offered the potential windfall to FIFA.Leaders of the North American bid for the 2026 World Cup, including Carlos Cordeiro, the president of U.S. Soccer, traveled to Saudi Arabia recently to make a pitch to leaders of a dozen national federations after Saudi Arabia created a new regional bloc \u2014 the South West Asian Football Federation. If the group continues with Saudi Arabia at its helm, the Saudis could potentially control more than simply their own vote on the important matters facing FIFA.Officials from 10 mainly South Asian and Arab countries posed for a picture to announce the formation of the group, which will be based in Jeddah and led by Adel Ezzat, the head of soccer in Saudi Arabia. Its honorary president is Turki al-Sheikh, the kingdom\u2019s top sports official and a close associate of the 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Experts say Saudi Arabia\u2019s moves in soccer dovetail with its long-term goals of modernizing its society and economy and becoming less oil dependent. The country has also considered starting a major regional sports network, and Saudi executives have signed long-term deals with the wrestling franchise W.W.E. and the Formula E motor racing series.\u201cIt\u2019s a new leadership with profoundly different ideas,\u201d said David B. Roberts, a Gulf expert at King\u2019s College in London.Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Sports Authority didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Saudi Arabia this year qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 2006. Only once has it played beyond the group stages. Politically, it has largely avoided interfering with how the sport is governed, and it has rarely had a member on FIFA\u2019s top board.After deciding to organize the South West Asian Football Federation, Saudi Arabia hosted delegates from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and several other countries, who were given watches and told that the country planned to create new regional tournaments and fund soccer development, according to people who attended the event. The gift and the funding pledge may breach ethics regulations, according to a senior official connected to Asian soccer.The Bangladesh soccer president, Kazi Salahuddin, who attended the meeting, said the Saudi Arabian hosts also took care of all flight and accommodation arrangements. He said his deputy collected the gift that was set aside for him.\u201cI don\u2019t wear a watch so I had no interest in looking at it,\u201d insisted Salahuddin, who also heads a separate South Asian regional group.\u201cThey said, \u2018We want to help each other in football.\u2019 As a president that sounds good to me,\u201d Salahuddin said.Setting up the new federation without the approval of FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation violates existing guidelines. The A.F.C. has given participants in the meeting until May 21 to provide an explanation for their presence there. FIFA declined to comment.Until the recent developments, Saudi Arabia\u2019s influence in soccer has been largely marginal compared to that of its regional neighbors, notably Qatar. Qatar has spent the past year isolated by much of the region because of a blockade Saudi Arabia set up after it accused Qatar of not doing its part to confront terrorism.Qatar controversially secured rights to the 2022 World Cup amid bribery accusations that the tiny, gas-rich emirate denies. Al-Sheikh, the top Saudi sports official, said recently on his Twitter feed that should Qatar be found to have violated regulations it should be stripped of the tournament, and replaced by England or the U.S.Saudi Arabia has since emerged as one of the most enthusiastic backers of the North American bid to stage the 2026 World Cup, which would take place mostly in the United States. Morocco, the only challenger, has secured the backing of Qatar. Earlier this week, a second group of North American officials traveled to the Middle East on behalf of the World Cup bid. Their destination: Saudi Arabia \u2014 just days after Cordeiro had visited the country.\u201cWe value Saudi Arabia the same as all the other 207. Every vote counts,\u201d the North American bid said in a statement.Saudi Arabia backs the proposal to speed up the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams from 32, which is now scheduled for 2026. If that happens, the 2022 event will likely have to expand beyond Qatar to other countries in the region.The potential deal with FIFA may attract the most attention for Saudi Arabia. If FIFA signs on, it would lead some of the most significant changes in the history of the sport, while also providing Infantino with a major financial trampoline from which to launch his bid for re-election next year. The possibility of FIFA selling out to an investor group has led to stormy meetings between its leadership and key soccer stakeholders.A gathering of clubs, leagues and players brought together to form UEFA\u2019s Professional Football Strategy Committee discussed the issue at length at a meeting in Lyon, France, on Wednesday before issuing a strongly worded statement. They decried the haste with which Infantino is attempting to push through an agreement for a 24-team World Cup for clubs and a league for nations that would be bankrolled by the fund whose identity has been kept secret.Infantino, citing a nondisclosure agreement, said he was limited in what he can reveal.Still, the sums of money on offer have turned heads. Barcelona and Real Madrid, two of soccer\u2019s richest clubs, among a group of seven major teams to have received a private pitch from Infantino, have in recent days spoken out in favor of the process. Manchester United\u2019s chief executive, Ed Woodward, appeared to talk up the idea during a conference call with investors on Thursday.The fund is guaranteeing FIFA $3 billion for each edition of the quadrennial Club World Cup, three times more than FIFA\u2019s best-case valuation.Lars-Christer Olsson, who heads an organization representing European Leagues, said the lack of information was a problem, as was the potential for a country to buy into soccer for political reasons.\u201cSports should stand aside from political systems because otherwise it will not be credible,\u201d said Olsson, a former general secretary of UEFA.\u201cI\u2019m very critical of any involvement of state subsidies to get a position in sports. I think that\u2019s dangerous for the sport itself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Shari Redstone\u2019s response to the CBS lawsuit.\u2022 A tough road ahead for the Trump administration on trade.\u2022 Who doesn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s lifeline to ZTE?Less than an hour before hearing, Ms. Redstone issued a change to the CBS bylaws that would grant her more control of the network\u2019s board. Under the new rules, decisions on dividends would need to be approved by a \u201csupermajority\u201d of CBS\u2019s board. That likely would have blocked a potential move by most of CBS\u2019s board to issue a special dividend to water down the Redstones\u2019 voting stake to 17 percent from 79 percent.The change to bylaws is now on hold: The judge said on Wednesday that he would issue his legal opinion on Ms. Redstone\u2019s change to the bylaws in his decision on Thursday.Ahead of the hearing, Ms. Redstone\u2019s National Amusements filed its legal response to a CBS lawsuit, seeking to prevent her from blocking a special meeting of its board on whether to water down her controlling stake.Here are some of the notable parts of the filing by lawyers for National Amusements:\u2022 On CBS\u2019s contention that Ms. Redstone intends to replace its board because of its resistance to a deal: \u201cN.A.I. does not have, and has never had, any intention of replacing the CBS board or taking other action to force a merger.\u201d\u2022 Why Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery should reject a CBS board move to dilute the Redstones\u2019 voting power to 17 percent from 79 percent: \u201cThis is an unprecedented usurpation of a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting power.\u201d Later, Ms. Redstone\u2019s lawyers add, \u201cThis court has held that, absent a compelling justification (which is non-existent here), a board of directors breaches its fiduciary duty of loyalty by acting for the primary purpose of diluting a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting rights.\u201d\u2022 The revelation of which CBS director National Amusements had suggested was involved in questionable activity. The filing includes an affidavit by Robert Klieger, a CBS board member and lawyer for the Redstones (whom other directors have argued is working on behalf of Ms. Redstone), regarding a call he had had last week with Bruce Gordon, the head of the CBS board\u2019s special committee:Specifically, I noted National Amusement Inc.\u2019s discomfort with the continued CBS board position of Charles K. Gifford given certain incidents that took place in 2016 and 2017. I also discussed the possibility of facilitating Mr. Gifford\u2019s exit from the CBS board with minimal disruption and public attention, including, in the event of a merger of CBS and Viacom, through his potential non-appointment to the board of a combined company.\u2022 A lament for what Ms. Redstone is her current predicament:\u201cPlaintiffs have forced CBS\u2019s controlling stockholder into a position of having to make a Hobson\u2019s choice\u2014of either accepting massive dilution of its voting power (thereby losing control of the company and suffering the economic detriment to its stake that entails), or acting as a stockholder to prevent such dilution and protect its voting power, knowing that doing so might trigger the departure of (and payment of massive parachute payments to) key management and directors of the company.CBS filed a response to National Amusements saying that Ms. Redstone\u2019s opposition to the special meeting is proof that CBS need a temporary restraining order.\u201cUnless restrained, defendants will use the consent process to replace directors or amend bylaws in advance of Thursday\u2019s board meeting.\u201dThe context\u2014 Michael de la MercedSenate Democrats narrowly won a vote on Wednesday to save so-called net neutrality rules.Cecilia Kang of the NYT reports:The Senate passed a resolution in a 52-47 vote to overturn a decision last December by the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle Obama-era rules that prevented broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast from blocking or speeding up streams and downloads of web content in exchange for extra fees. The commission\u2019s repeal of net neutrality is set to take effect in a few weeks.The rare victory for Democrats is sure to be short-lived, with a similar resolution expected to die in the House, where Republicans have a larger majority. Only three Republican senators voted in support of the resolution.Apple has quietly explored the idea of opening a campus for 20,000 employees in Northern Virginia, further advancing the possibility that the Washington area could evolve into an East Coast outpost for Silicon Valley.His planned appearance in Brussels highlights the breadth of the international concern over how Facebook failed to prevent political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica from obtaining and using the data of many as 87 million of its users.His visit will involve a closed-door session with leaders of the European Parliament\u2019s various blocs and the head of the body\u2019s civil liberties committee, which is holding hearings on Facebook\u2019s practices, as well as a stop in Paris, where Mr. Zuckerberg is set to have lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss a range of issues.\u2014 Prashant S.

The group will also be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints\u201d That means whoever takes the job will have to \u201chandle the requisite long hours, extensive travel and public scrutiny of running a high-profile start-up, but probably without the allure of a big stock incentive plan, which is typically an attractive incentive in tech recruiting.\u201d\u2022 At Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting, Warren Buffett said the partnership hoped to announce a hire \u201cwithin a couple of months.\u201d But he seemed uncertain, though not unhopeful, about the effort as a whole.\u201cWhether we can bring the resources, bring the person, that C.E.O., is terribly important.

The key assumption of that era was that markets work best when the government focuses exclusively on enforcing contract and property rights.This sort of agreement is now illegal, but businesses have nevertheless found new and creative ways to achieve monopoly profits, while antitrust enforcers have fallen behind.According to one study, the power of firms to raise prices above the competitive level or cut wages below it increased more than threefold from 1980 to 2014.To revive economic growth and restore equality, we need to update the solutions first developed a century ago. Then, the focus was on breaking up monopolies, prohibiting cartels and blocking mergers. These laws helped advance broadly shared prosperity, but owners of capital devised strategies to evade them. These strategies must be addressed with new regulatory approaches.We also need a renewed public awareness of the dangers of monopolies to ensure that in the future antitrust enforcers feel the pressure to keep up with the ever-changing faces of monopoly power.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Is Annoyed, Not Grateful, After Trump Delays Tariffs", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 American allies did not bother to conceal their annoyance Tuesday with the Trump administration\u2019s last-minute decision to delay punitive aluminum and steel tariffs by a month, in their view leaving a sword of Damocles hanging over the global economy.In Europe, the reprieve was seen not as an act of conciliation or generosity but instead as another 30 days of precarious limbo that will disrupt supply networks and undermine what has been an unusually strong period of growth.European leaders, normally circumspect, are openly irritated that President Trump\u2019s protectionist assault is aimed at them despite decades of military alliance and shared values. The region has pushed for a permanent exemption to the American trade penalties, and threatened retaliation otherwise.They find it absurd that Mr. Trump is risking a trade war with Europe, the United States\u2019 biggest trading partner, rather than joining forces to rein in Chinese trade practices they both oppose. And the European Union\u2019s cautious, often ponderous approach to policymaking is now clashing directly with Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictability and aggressiveness.While the commission said it was willing to continue negotiating, it was hard to see how the two sides would find common ground.The White House wants to reduce what it maintains is the United States\u2019 trade deficit with the 28-member European Union and is seeking concessions, such as lower tariffs on American cars sold here. Speaking to a group of steel executives on Tuesday, the White House trade adviser Peter Navarro insisted that the administration would take a tough line toward Europe.\u201cThe guiding principle of this administration from the president down to his team is that any country or entity like the European Union which is exempt from the tariffs will have a quota and other restrictions, which are necessary to defend the aluminum and steel industries from imports in defense of our national security,\u201d Mr. Navarro said.But the Europeans say they will discuss the Trump administration\u2019s concerns only after the bloc receives a permanent, unconditional exemption from the tariffs. They regard the tariffs as illegal under global rules.\u201cWe will not negotiate under threat,\u201d the commission said in the statement Tuesday.The unusually grumpy tone of the statement from Brussels highlighted the enormous cultural gap. The European Commission prizes deliberation and procedure, while the Trump administration shows a penchant for ad hoc decision-making, exemplified by its announcing the latest reprieve just hours before the deadline.\u201cThere is huge frustration with the way the administration is doing business,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director in London for Eurasia Group, a consultancy.Economists say the biggest danger to the global economy is not so much the tariffs as the insecurity they sow among business managers trying to plan where to buy or sell products that contain steel or aluminum.Big metals consumers like auto manufacturers and construction firms have been stockpiling supplies, girding for a disruptive trade war. \u201cAs a result, there is a visible surge in steel prices in the U.S., which negatively affects manufacturing and many other sectors,\u201d said Max Finne, assistant professor of operations management at the University of Warwick in Britain.Mr. Trump\u2019s provocative approach has fueled anxiety in Europe that the long-awaited economic recovery is losing momentum. The threat of a trade war adds to a list of risks that are making businesses less willing to invest and create jobs, including the imminent end of European Central Bank stimulus, Britain\u2019s planned exit from the bloc and political deadlock in Italy.\u201cThe latest extension has created enormous insecurity for companies,\u201d Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries, a lobbying group, said in an email.The European Union regards the planned tariffs on steel and aluminum as a violation of international treaties and has already complained to the World Trade Organization, normally the arbiter of trade disputes. The complaint lays the groundwork for the bloc to impose retaliatory tariffs on a long list of American products \u2014 including bluejeans, bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorcycles \u2014 as early as mid-June.While officials in Brussels have said they do not want to reward the Trump administration\u2019s breach of international rules with concessions, Germany \u2014 the country with the most to lose \u2014 has indicated a willingness to be more flexible. Steel accounts for about one-fifth of German exports outside the European Union, and German carmakers like BMW and Daimler would be hit the hardest if Mr. Trump acts on threats to penalize vehicle imports.Martina Fietz, a spokeswoman for the German government, said in a statement Tuesday that it was important for the European Union to continue talks with the United States and \u201cdevelop a trade agenda that is in the interests of both sides.\u201dPeter Altmaier, the German economics minister, went further. \u201cPersonally I believe we should make an offer, something concrete, that would be the basis for further talks,\u201d Mr. Altmaier said in an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio before the extension of the exemptions was announced.Mr. Altmaier\u2019s statement was at odds with the European Commission\u2019s refusal to negotiate until the Trump administration removes the threat of steel and aluminum tariffs. The potential for a rift between Berlin and Brussels raised the possibility that Mr. Trump would succeed in rattling European unity.Two members of the European Parliament complained Tuesday that President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had undermined the European position when they discussed trade with Mr. Trump during visits to Washington last week.\u201cThis open demonstration of different European priorities is deplorable at the moment of high political tensions,\u201d Yannick Jadot and Sven Giegold, members of the environmentalist Green faction in Parliament, said in a letter to Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner.The statement by Ms. Fietz on behalf of the German government hinted at that theme, saying, \u201cBoth the U.S.A. and European Union would profit from further deepening of the trade relationship.\u201dThe Obama administration pursued such an agreement for years, but it was largely moribund even before Mr. Trump took office, in part because of popular opposition in Germany.But the chances for such talks are probably slim given Mr. Trump\u2019s disdain for the European Union and his complaints about German cars. Mr. Trump said in March that if Europe retaliated against American products, he would tax imports of European vehicles into the United States, which in practice would hit the German automotive sector.China, whose support for state-owned firms and restrictions on outside investment have long frustrated politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, presents another opportunity for Europe and the United States to make common cause.Mr. Rahman of Eurasia Group said that secretly, some European leaders were happy that Mr. Trump had challenged China, whose large and increasingly sophisticated economy is a threat to Europe.Europe would be happy to cooperate with the United States to press China on issues such as protection of intellectual property. But in the current climate it seems unlikely that the European Union and United States are capable of joining forces.\u201cThe way Trump is going about it may not be the most effective, but he\u2019s put it on the agenda. There is some sympathy for that,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very difficult. The process seems completely broken.\u201dAna Swanson contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fate of Most Silicon Valley Drones: \u2018Live Work Work Work Die\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.It was not long ago that it seemed as if the companies of Silicon Valley were poised to renew and reshape American capitalism. In the late \u201990s, companies like AltaVista and Razorfish received the most extraordinary valuations in the history of the stock market, and their foosball-table-filled offices were the subject of breathless coverage. Their employees were rich \u2014 congenital dorkiness having become phenomenally lucrative \u2014 and a \u201cnew economy\u201d was on the horizon. The proof? In some parts of the country, you could log onto America Online through a dial-up modem, sign into Kozmo.com and order a Coca-Cola to be delivered in about an hour. Ah, liberty! In 2001, the bubble burst, but the dream of a genuinely profitable, internet-fueled economy remained.That economy is now here, most visibly in the form of a sleek slab of phone on which you might be reading (or, really, scrolling) this, and the bloom is off the digital rose. You can still get a Coke delivered, but it will be handed to you by an independent contractor for Caviar, cycling around town with a humiliating giant orange box on his back, as he makes well under minimum wage. Or it will eventually come in the back seat of a robot UberEats car, which might well have slammed into a few pedestrians on the way \u2014 the price of progress. Now, or soon, anything you want can be paid for and delivered, virtually at any time, at nearly any speed. For this great convenience, Amazon can now pretty much gull every mayor in America into selling their schools, transportation systems, birthrights, etc., in order to draw 50,000 tech employees \u2014 among the least beloved specimens of humanity \u2014 to invade and comprehensively ruin their city, block by blessed block. Those employees will be mostly white, mostly men, and mostly known for upholding an industry whose sexism is towering, peerless and, according to charmers like James Damore, not even as sexist as it should be.The effects of this bargain on all of us have been well documented \u2014 even if some of its political consequences, as with the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal, are continually ramifying \u2014 but the lives of the people who work in the industry and have foisted it on us are less well known, and this is where Corey Pein\u2019s \u201cLive Work Work Work Die\u201d attempts to fill in the picture. Pein, a staff writer for the caustic and essential little magazine The Baffler, is a former newspaper reporter, who experienced the depredations of tech \u201cdisruption\u201d firsthand. Thinking he was following the money, in 2012 he joined a Seattle-based \u201cavant-garde online news service\u201d called Demotix as its editor in chief. Soon into his tenure, Demotix was bought by Corbis, an online photography database, which proceeded to reassign photographers from war zones to \u201cchase reality TV stars around red-carpet events\u201d; not long after, Pein learned that Corbis also planned to lay off half of Demotix\u2019s employees.So, in the spirit of gonzo journalism, he decides to high-tail it to the Bay Area to sell a start-up and document the horrors of his temporarily adopted home along the way. The idea he comes up with is called \u201cLaborize,\u201d a company that would hire itself out to one organization to unionize a rival \u2014 it would, say, contract with Uber to unionize Lyft \u2014 and therefore ruin the competitive advantage that comes from denying health care, steady wages and other benefits of unionization. It is a clever ploy that cuts to the heart of what makes Silicon Valley a very pure example of capitalism: the fact that it screws over, or tries to automate into the digital ether, a vast proportion of the American work force, in order to enrich, artificially and enormously, a small proportion of investors and owners, whose companies are \u2014 more often than not \u2014 profoundly unprofitable.It probably doesn\u2019t ruin the surprise to point out that Pein\u2019s efforts are a failure: His start-up plans stall out. Nor does his exhaustive, scathing description of what Silicon Valley companies do make for a serious contribution to journalism about the tech industry. More than gonzo, an aura of laziness pervades the exercise. In an emblematic passage, Pein visits the Googleplex in Mountain View, but doesn\u2019t manage to get inside any of the buildings, which in my experience is not so hard to do. Instead he wanders around outside, telling us that it \u201clooks like pretty much any other dismal suburban office park\u201d and that \u201cthe real story hid behind the blackened windows of the squat office buildings.\u201d The real story \u2014 digitizing, data mining, etc. \u2014 turns out to be what is already widely available in reporting elsewhere, in any case uncited in Pein\u2019s book.Still, despite and perhaps a little because of its lackadaisical approach to its subject, \u201cLive Work Work Work Die\u201d manages to capture something essential about Silicon Valley that has eluded other authors. This is because Pein starts from the grimy underbelly of tech and never makes it out, which accurately reflects the experience of many tech workers. We only learn of those who make it big \u2014 Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. We rarely hear of the people who fail, or work uselessly and endlessly hard, without much in the way of reward.Struggling to find an apartment in San Francisco\u2019s stratospherically overheated rental market, Pein settles for an Airbnb in which he has to share a room with four people and, because of what appears to be its uncertain legal status, has only one key. Calling it the Hacker Condo, he notes that all four residents are \u201cimmigrants or the children of immigrants, and therefore accustomed to getting jerked around,\u201d and that the foreign-born residents are on H-1B visas, an arrangement that requires them to stay employed. But the lure of making it big keeps everyone working insane hours.

{"Headline": "Critics Say He Can\u2019t Beat a Dictator. This Venezuelan Thinks He Can.", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 If there is one thing that particularly irks Henri Falc\u00f3n, it\u2019s the suggestion that you can\u2019t beat a dictatorship.Mr. Falc\u00f3n, a former governor, promises to defeat President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro when Venezuela goes to the polls on Sunday. Few elections have been such a crossroads for democracy in South America in recent years \u2014 and for the fate of one of its countries.Now the president has agreed to go up for re-election. But it comes with a catch: The most popular candidates among the opposition either have been barred from running or are jailed as political prisoners. After some opposition parties boycotted a previous election, the Constituent Assembly ruled that they would not be allowed to run in this one, either.Enter Mr. Falc\u00f3n, a former member of Mr. Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party who campaigns as though the president\u2019s grip on power is an inevitable advantage for any opposition.\u201cIn the history of the world, these governments always fall by decisive action \u2014 by the votes of their own people,\u201d Mr. Falc\u00f3n said.\u201cChile under Pinochet came out toward democracy peacefully,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how power changed in Nicaragua, in Peru \u2014 and even in Spain after Franco.\u201dSo Mr. Falc\u00f3n, 56, has launched what most here see as a long-shot candidacy, but one that has already injected some measure of debate into an otherwise lopsided election. He pledges to rescue the country\u2019s economy by using the dollar as its currency, to open the country\u2019s oil sector to more foreign investment and to start paying workers a minimum of $75 a month.In doing so, he is also taking on the opposition itself \u2014 defying its boycott of the election. Not all opposition parties were banned by the government, but the biggest ones were. So a coalition of opposition parties joined together and boycotted the election in protest.Now, many opposition politicians describe Mr. Falc\u00f3n and his Progressive Advance party as traitors, calling on their supporters not to vote at all.\u201cThose that are participating today, like Falc\u00f3n, they\u2019re collaborating with the regime,\u201d said Jorge Mill\u00e1n, an opposition lawmaker who says he will not vote. \u201cThey\u2019re aiding Maduro, who is looking for legitimacy in this electoral farce.\u201dMr. Falc\u00f3n dismissed that idea, saying the only way to win was to take part in elections.\u201cWhat do you gain from abstention?\u201d said Mr. Falc\u00f3n, arguing that the collapse of the economy created the exact conditions in which Mr. Maduro could lose.Polling points to some wisdom in these words.Independent polls show Mr. Falc\u00f3n with a significant edge over Mr. Maduro, fueled by deep anger over the shortages of food, medicine and water that accompanied a drop in oil prices in recent years and decades of economic mismanagement. Mr. Falc\u00f3n\u2019s campaign also seems to have kept his popularity intact even as the opposition\u2019s reputation tanked when it declined to put forward a candidate.But the realities of Mr. Maduro\u2019s Venezuela may be hard to overcome.Like his predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Mr. Maduro has used the largess of the state \u2014 even food, which the government controls \u2014 to rally voters and mobilize them on Sunday. Even so, a large majority of voters, particularly in the opposition, is expected to heed the call to abstain. And with the opposition boycotting the vote, few auditors who are not aligned with Mr. Maduro will be reviewing the results.Beyond that, many voters are simply gone. More than a million Venezuelans have recently fled the country and its collapsing economy, a diaspora that is deeply angered with Mr. Maduro but unlikely to vote on Sunday, analysts say.\u201cIs the vote fair? It\u2019s clearly not fair,\u201d said David Smilde, a professor of sociology at Tulane University who studies Venezuela. \u201cBut sometimes, even in unfair conditions, it\u2019s possible for the opposition to win.\u201dMr. Falc\u00f3n likes to argue that he is best positioned to lead the divided country because he came from the very party he aims to defeat. After Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was elected in 1998, Mr. Falc\u00f3n helped rewrite the Constitution, then rose to become mayor of Barquisimeto, a large city, and governor of the surrounding state, Lara.Accounts differ on why Mr. Falc\u00f3n left the party in 2010. Most analysts say it was because Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was sidelining him as a rising star. Mr. Falc\u00f3n says he felt that the governing party\u2019s drive to nationalize private assets was leading it to an economic disaster.Mr. Falc\u00f3n continued on as governor as a member of the opposition, but lost his seat last year. He wasted little time in mounting a bid for the presidency and working out what he says is a remedy for the country\u2019s failing economy.His first step would be to switch to the dollar.Mr. Falc\u00f3n argues that the country\u2019s most painful economic problems, such as low wages, stem from runaway inflation.Francisco Rodr\u00edguez, an economist on leave from the New York investment bank Tornio Capital who is advising Mr. Falc\u00f3n, said that moving to the dollar would stem inflation almost immediately. Within three months, government workers would be paid at least $75 a month, he contends, widening access to food.\u201cWith what they\u2019re paid now, you can\u2019t even get people to show up to work,\u201d he said.Next, Mr. Falc\u00f3n says, he would topple other tenets of the ruling party, such as price controls, which economists say have led to shortages by making items more costly to produce than to sell.And in the meantime, Mr. Falc\u00f3n says, he would release scores of political prisoners, while re-establishing ties to the United States.It remains unclear how Mr. Falc\u00f3n would govern, even if he does win and Mr. Maduro accepts the result.The country\u2019s military has been loyal to the president, who has given top leaders control over lucrative parts of the economy. And the ruling party still runs the Constituent Assembly, the body created to sideline the legislature and rewrite the Constitution.Mr. Falc\u00f3n says he\u2019s willing to take that risk. On a recent day, he ticked off the miseries of his fellow citizens, offering each one as a reason to vote: \u201cThey are humble, poor people, people who have no food, people who have no medicine, people who have no services \u2014 the water is gone, the light is gone.\u201dDespite the obstacles, Mr. Falc\u00f3n is counting on people like Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, a 63-year-old pensioner whose monthly check does not cover the cost of food.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez waited for Mr. Falc\u00f3n at a gathering in Barquisimeto, where the presidential hopeful had first risen as a politician. It was a crowd of just 200, but Mr. Rodr\u00edguez had waited for three hours. There were few left in his home, he said: Both of his children had left the country, seeking jobs and food.\u201cI\u2019m not leaving because I\u2019m not young enough to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here fighting.\u201dElsewhere, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Vargas, a 22-year-old member of the party, denounced Mr. Maduro\u2019s management and wore a jacket with the colors of the Venezuelan flag.Then for a moment his face changed and he looked regretful.\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d he said. \u201cI have thought of leaving.\u201dA few hours later, Mr. Falc\u00f3n arrived, walking down a wide commercial street full of shuttered restaurants and businesses, not a customer in sight. He shook hands along the road and stopped a few times to hug people.Some walked away smiling. Others didn\u2019t.\u201cThat\u2019s the same as Maduro,\u201d said a woman nearby.The crowd started to disperse. Mr. Falc\u00f3n darted behind a corner and was gone.\u201cIf we don\u2019t vote,\u201d he said, \u201cwe squander the great opportunity we have before us.\u201dMeridith Kohut contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump\u2019s Intense Focus on the Trade Deficit Could Cost the Economy in the Long Run", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe latest China trade talks defused a potential trade war, and promise a boost for American agriculture and energy, but at the cost of industries of the future.Or is it to reset a dysfunctional economic relationship between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, in hope of ensuring that the United States maintains competitive footing in the industries of the future \u2014 even if dividends aren\u2019t immediate?Over the weekend, Mr. Trump\u2019s team de-escalated the trade war while seemingly choosing Option A.If those purchases materialize, there could be political dividends for the president. American farmers have much to lose from a potential Chinese trade war, and stepped-up Chinese purchases of American soybeans and other commodities could be a boon. If those purchases are large enough to move the dial on the overall trade deficit with China, it will create an easy-to-measure win for the president on his pet issue.\u201cThis is the stuff you can count and measure,\u201d said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a trade scholar with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s short term, and instantaneous.\u201dAmerican companies that make automobiles, semiconductors and other complex products bemoan Chinese government requirements that force American firms to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, sharing their technology. The U.S. companies accuse those partners of widespread theft of intellectual property as the Chinese try to catch up in advanced technologies. Many American firms face Chinese competition that receives heavy state subsidies.These are some of the most stubborn, longstanding issues in American-Chinese economic relations. But they aren\u2019t likely to be fixed overnight, and even if the United States wins concessions, it won\u2019t necessarily affect the trade deficit \u2014 especially in the next couple of years.This helps explain why some prominent advocates of a tougher stance toward China \u2014 who applauded President Trump\u2019s tariff threats \u2014 are critical of the turn the negotiations have taken.The tariffs the president threatened \u201care designed to address China\u2019s technology theft and their plans to dominate advanced and high technology manufacturing,\u201d said Dan DiMicco, chairman of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advocates a hard-line stance, in a statement. By contrast, \u201can agreement to sell agricultural and energy commodities is the result of bad negotiating and bad economic strategy.\u201dSectors like computers and electronic products and machinery were responsible for substantially more export-related jobs.Mr. Hufbauer notes similarities with a strategy that American trade negotiators pursued with Japan in the 1980s, of \u201cvoluntary import agreements\u201d in which the Japanese agreed to import more American semiconductors and other products.Whatever the near-term benefits for particular American exporters, Japanese trade surpluses kept rising.Even some who are critical of the administration see value in more systemic rethinking of the relationship between the United States and China.But, she added, in this round of negotiations \u201cit\u2019s not clear what we\u2019re getting for a lot of the concessions that have been made.\u201dThe thing to watch in the weeks ahead is whether the administration faction seeking short-term wins and trade peace continues to prevail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Rallies Against U.S. and Warns Europe Over Endangered Nuclear Deal", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Iran\u2019s hard-line authorities organized nationwide rallies on Friday to denounce the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement, burning American flags and warning that Europe might further sabotage the accord.The reaction reflected the view held by many hard-liners that the American withdrawal had vindicated their suspicions that Westerners were treacherous.The anger on display in Tehran and other cities also reinforced the possibility that Iran would now abandon the agreement as well, restarting the nuclear-fuel enrichment that it had halted.Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a well-known hard-liner who leads the Friday Prayer services in Tehran, admonished fellow citizens against making any deals with foreigners \u201csince they cannot be trusted.\u201dIn his sermon, broadcast on state television, Ayatollah Khatami also criticized Iranian politicians who have looked toward Europe to preserve the nuclear agreement, arguing that the Europeans, too, have broken promises.The agreement relaxed or ended many economic restrictions on Iran in return for its verifiable pledges to never make nuclear weapons, including a freeze on nuclear fuel production for at least 15 years. Mr. Trump called the agreement too weak and described it as a shameful giveaway to Iran by his predecessor, Barack Obama.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement restored onerous American sanctions on Iran, including penalties for foreign companies that do business with that country. His announcement was widely criticized around the world but drew praise from Iran\u2019s regional enemies, Israel and Saudi Arabia.While European governments have said they want to preserve the accord, the participation of the United States was widely considered to be crucial to its survival.Even before Mr. Trump announced the pullout, non-American businesses were wary about making any financial commitments in Iran, fearful of such an outcome.Many Iranians, who had hoped the nuclear accord would bring a flood of investment and business to the country of 80 million, have been deeply disappointed.Reminding Iranians of this point, Ayatollah Khatami said Europeans had been expected to invest in Iran after the nuclear agreement took effect but most never did. He exhorted listeners to shout \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201dIn response to what Israel has described as its aerial assaults on Iranian bases in Syria, Ayatollah Khatami also said that Iran would \u201crob the Israeli regime of sleep\u201d and threatened to \u201craze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground.\u201dThe American withdrawal from the nuclear accord is considered a serious political blow to Hassan Rouhani, Iran\u2019s president, who had promised that the agreement would end the country\u2019s prolonged isolation and economic travails.The withdrawal also reinforced the anti-American hostility of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, who reluctantly had gone along with Mr. Rouhani and his nuclear negotiators.The mood at Friday Prayer services was defiant in Tehran, where men burned American flags. One worshiper, Hassan Khedri, 24, with spiky hair and a sleeveless shirt, said: \u201cI am an Iranian Kurd and I am ready to fight with America and Israel. I only wait for the command of the chief commander, our Supreme Leader Khamenei.\u201dAnother worshiper, Hasan Biagi, 65, said the threat to the nuclear agreement caused by the American pullout showed the true faces of Iran\u2019s enemies.\u201cWe cannot even rely on Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big lesson for us. Never trust the West.\u201dThe mistrust was an underlying theme in a statement issued by the government on Thursday denouncing what it called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cnew extremist administration\u201d for exiting the agreement.\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s absurd insults against the great Iranian nation indicate the extent of his ignorance and folly,\u201d the statement said.Warning the agreement\u2019s European participants \u2014 Britain, France and Germany \u2014 the statement said they \u201cmust take the necessary action to safeguard the accord and to implement their commitments \u2014 which they proved incapable of fully performing even while the U.S. was nominally a party to the deal.\u201dAyatollah Khamenei also expressed skepticism about whether the Europeans would keep their word. In a speech on Wednesday to teachers in Tehran, he hinted that the nuclear agreement would fail.\u201cI do not trust these three countries either,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not trust them. If you want to sign a contract, ask for actual guarantees. I swear to God, they will do the same thing that the Americans did.\u201dResentment and resistance toward Mr. Trump\u2019s decision also appeared to be deepening in Europe, where many officials view it as an arrogant act that could force European companies to acquiesce to American policy toward Iran.\u201cDo we want the United States to be the world\u2019s economic gendarme?\u201d Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s minister of economy and finances, said on the Europe 1 radio station. \u201cOr do we Europeans want to say: \u2018We have economic interests, we want to continue trading with Iran within the framework of a strategic agreement. We believe that this is the right approach, so we will continue.\u2019\u201dEven so, there were new signs on Friday that some big non-American companies were heeding the White House\u2019s warning to wind down commercial commitments in Tehran. The Treasury Department, which oversees American sanctions policy, has given businesses 90 to 180 days before it starts enforcing penalties.Two leading shipping companies, Maersk Line and MSC, said they were reviewing their Iran operations, and Indonesia\u2019s state energy company, Pertamina, said it might delay a contract to operate Iran\u2019s Mansouri oil field, Reuters reported.Airbus, which has already delivered a few aircraft to Iran, has not specified what it will do. Although Airbus is a European company, it needs an American export license because Airbus planes contain some American components.\u201cWe\u2019re carefully analyzing the president\u2019s announcement and will be evaluating next steps consistent with our internal policies and in full compliance with U.S. sanctions and export control regulations,\u201d Airbus said in an emailed statement. \u201cThat analysis could take a bit of time.\u201dThomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the President Takes On Amazon, Nobody Wins", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIf President Trump resumes his fight with Amazon, the ultimate loser is clear: It will be the American economy.Economists are a disputatious bunch, but across the political spectrum we agree on one thing: Politicians shouldn\u2019t be attacking specific companies based on their own whims or preferences.But putting the factual basis of these claims aside, there is another problem that may even be even bigger: The president was unnecessarily specific about a single company.Some economic interventions necessarily pinpoint particular companies. When talking about the major credit rating agencies, for example, it\u2019s hard to avoid talking about the big three: Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch.That isn\u2019t the case here. The issues the president raised about Amazon actually apply to large parts of the economy. For example, every retail transaction on the web raises the thorny issue of how to handle local sales taxes. But Amazon itself collects taxes for 45 states and the District of Columbia.Political interference in markets is always dangerous. But when it is narrowly targeted, it is particularly so.First, such interference creates unclear rules.Any sports fan knows the frustration of watching a game with arbitrary and unpredictable refereeing. Consistency is equally important for a well-functioning economy.Capricious refereeing complicates managerial decision-making. It distorts cost-benefit calculations, delaying decisions and wasting resources.Second, political targeting opens the door to various forms of corruption. When politicians play an outsized role in the economy, companies must curry their favor.This is obvious in many countries, particularly poor ones, where politicians interfere heavily in local economies by deciding such matters as which companies will get a license to operate and which will be audited by the tax authority. Managers must focus as much effort on catering to politicians as to customers, not just through campaign contributions but through bribes, both subtle and overt.These incentives don\u2019t merely warp the economy. They alter the political sphere, too.Companies have many tools at their disposal when they seek to influence politicians. A few weeks before an election, a company seeking to help a candidate can announce a major plant opening. Or it can cut prices in response to a politician\u2019s entreaties.Professor Fisman found that when Suharto\u2019s health was reported to be poor, the shares of companies most closely linked to the ultimate leader declined the most sharply. As Professor Fisman put it, \u201cA large percentage of a well connected firm\u2019s value may be derived from political connections.\u201dStock prices of such companies did not budge when his political fortunes rose \u2014 as when he was first chosen as the vice-presidential candidate \u2014 or when his health was impaired while in office.The heartening truth is that until now, the United States has, by and large, done a good job of insulating the economy from political interference. Should that insulation wear down, though, we will find ourselves in a troubling world. That\u2019s why President Trump\u2019s campaign against Amazon is worthy of continuing scrutiny.Any possible interference with freedom of the press endangers the economy \u2014 and much more. An efficient economy \u2014 and a democracy \u2014 requires uniform application of the law.We live in partisan times. But we all can root for the rule of law. It\u2019s not a particularly exciting cause, but it is in dire need of supporters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Hit This Small Town Hard. Now, Locals Hope It Will Fuel a Revival.", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "Holywell, a town in Wales with dozens of local retailers, has struggled with the impacts of online shopping. It is applying technology to try and keep its shops open.Supported byHOLYWELL, Wales \u2014 Officials in this Welsh town will soon install free Wi-Fi along their lone shopping street. They are erecting the first electric car chargers in the area. And this past winter, small businesses began partnering with an American mobile payments system in the hope of getting more people in their stores.This is small-town tech \u2014 the scattershot response as communities try in any way possible to draw shoppers back to their High Streets and Main Streets.Many places like Holywell are experimenting with new technologies and digital services, in a defensive crouch against the dominance of e-commerce and the lure of bigger cities. Along with the car chargers and free Wi-Fi, officials here have added digital \u201cbeacons\u201d that describe local attractions to aid smartphone-toting tourists.Although such efforts will hardly insulate their economies, the alternative amounts to giving up. Shop owners are hopeful the moves will help them survive, and improve the mood of an area that has seen decades of decline.\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re a little town in the middle of nowhere,\u201d said Ted Palmer, whose barbershop lies just off Holywell\u2019s main shopping area, the High Street. \u201cUnless you\u2019re open to change, you will drown.\u201dHolywell lies close to a Christian religious site popular with tourists and is a short drive from the Welsh coast, but it has always relied on its shops to fuel the local economy. In recent years, though, many have closed, including a stationery store, a drugstore and an appliance retailer. Then, in a matter of months, three of the town\u2019s four bank branches closed.Its High Street is a shell of its former self. Shopping is increasingly being done over the internet, and major retailers are able to drive down prices while offering premium services like next-day delivery on hard-to-find items.Customers in Holywell can have their groceries brought straight to their front doors from online supermarkets like Ocado, and much else from the shopping behemoth Amazon. Instead of local grocery stores, residents can drive up to a mammoth Tesco supermarket a short distance from the High Street, or take the short walk to Home Bargains, a nationwide discount retailer.Indeed, in much of Britain and the world, people can use smartphones and the internet to get restaurants to dispatch food to their homes, arrange an appointment with a repair person or cleaner, and have their laundry picked up. (Mr. Palmer joked that, for now at least, haircuts could not be delivered online.)The closings have forced stores to keep large amounts of cash on site, leaving some shop owners fearful of burglaries or thefts. People who would have gone into the town to do their banking are going elsewhere. And foot traffic into the center of Holywell, a town with a population of 9,000, has dropped off drastically.When Helen Ryles-Owen opened her stationery store in the middle of Holywell, her only local competitor had recently shut down, and her sister promised to help run the new business. But their timing \u2014 opening just weeks before the bank closings began \u2014 was bad.\u201cWould I have opened here\u201d knowing the branches were closing, Ms. Ryles-Owen asked. \u201cI would have thought twice.\u201dThe efforts by Holywell to transform itself and its town center belie its long history. In the British vernacular, Holywell is a market town. Edward I granted monks a charter to establish a weekly market here in the 13th century, and they used it to sell ale and collect taxes from farmers and traders who came to hawk their wares. By the beginning of the 19th century, there were dozens of shops, inns and beer houses.While the weekly market still continues, it now varies between around 25 stalls during the Christmas period, down to half a dozen during the cold and wet days of winter. Offices of the local council, which is responsible for issues like garbage collection as well as services like libraries, moved to another town long ago, taking jobs with them. Workers at a nearby quarry and asphalt plant rarely venture into Holywell, staying instead at a hotel on the town\u2019s outskirts.The High Street, which runs less than 300 yards, is today an assortment of cafes, barber shops and stores selling items ranging from e-cigarettes to shoes. The lone surviving bank branch, of the Spanish lender Santander, has a single ATM. Holywell residents complain there is always a queue, and the machine frequently runs out of cash.The town\u2019s embrace of tech was happenstance.In recent years, the monthly meetings of a local government committee featured regular discussion of the difficulties faced by the town\u2019s High Street and potential solutions. The High Street, which was fully pedestrianized decades ago, would be reopened to vehicle traffic. Electric vehicle chargers would be installed to lure wealthier car owners. Free Wi-Fi would be added to help ensure those customers stuck around.Then at the Labour Party\u2019s annual conference in September, David Hanson, Holywell\u2019s member of Parliament, ran into Sarah Harvey, who heads the British operations of Square, the American mobile payments company. A trial was hatched.Square would offer its card readers \u2014 small white boxes that connect to a smartphone \u2014 free to businesses in Holywell. And the Silicon Valley company would use the experience to learn about companies in Britain, a market it had entered only months earlier.For small businesses, Square and others like it can be a cheaper alternative to the companies that currently dominate card processing. Square typically sells its card readers for a one-off charge, and then levies a flat 1.75 percent fee on all card transactions carried out in-store. Traditional services that are usually found in stores usually charge a monthly rental for readers, and often require longer-term contracts.Retailers in Holywell say another benefit is the portability of Square\u2019s readers, which connect easily to smartphones and can be carried to trade fairs and shows. This month, Ms. Ryles-Owen took her card reader to the Llandudno Extravaganza, a Victorian-themed fair about 30 miles from Holywell.Business owners here are cleareyed about the impact so far. The service has not suddenly driven a significant increase in trade, nor do they expect it to. But many say it has stanched a fall, and allowed them to appeal to a wider array of customers, particularly younger ones, who use cash less than previous generations.At a recent reception held near Parliament in London, Mr. Hanson, representatives from Square and Holywell business owners related their experience to more than a dozen lawmakers. Questions ranged from how the system worked (trial units were on hand) to how fast entrepreneurs received payments (the next working day).Russ Warburton, 56, was one of more than 60 business owners in Holywell who signed up for Square. Revenue for his lighting business had fallen by almost 30 percent after the branch closings. Using Square helped flatten that out. He acknowledged that was a small victory, but one that nevertheless encouraged him \u2014 and other fellow business owners \u2014 to consider new investments. Mr. Warburton is now expanding from lighting to antiques and refurbishing furniture.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem,\u201d Mr. Warburton, the chairman of the town\u2019s business council, said. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get the High Street back to what it was 30, 40 years ago, because people\u2019s shopping habits have changed.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just trying everything we can to bring people back into the town.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A lot of people seem interested in whatever he\u2019s doing, whether it\u2019s football, baseball, canasta or pick-up sticks.Before he played in his first game last month for the Rumble Ponies \u2014 the Mets\u2019 Class AA affiliate \u2014 Binghamton had a touch of Tebow fever.Through 28 games, Tebow\u2019s statistics were modest: a .261 batting average with three home runs and 12 runs batted in. But, again, that stuff hardly matters with Tebow.Just don\u2019t tell the Rumble Ponies owner John Hughes that his club got lucky landing Tebow.\u201cThings don\u2019t just happen, buddy,\u201d said Hughes, who entered the picture with a plan to save baseball in Binghamton in December 2015, well before Tebow was on the city\u2019s radar. \u201cYou put your nose down and get after it and get to work and good things are going to happen. That\u2019s kind of how I live my life.\u201d\u201cI do everything at the stadium from make nachos to write big checks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the smartest guy in the world. I\u2019m not the most talented person. But I\u2019ll get out there and work as hard as anybody else.\u201dWith no previous ties to the region, he led a group (Evans Street Baseball Inc.) that purchased the Binghamton Mets (as they were then known) in 2015, after the team\u2019s deal with a different ownership group that would have moved it to Delaware fell through.\u201cHis commitment to this community is huge,\u201d said Judi Hess, director of the city\u2019s tourism office. \u201cSo to have something like this happen under his watch is awesome, too, because it\u2019s like a little bit of payback for his personal investment and his belief in our community.\u201d\u201cIt was nice being able to play in front of people,\u201d said Peter Alonso, a top Mets prospect here who also played with Tebow in Port St. Lucie.Tebow, who hit .226 with eight homers and 52 R.B.I. with the two Class A teams in 2017, has tried to keep the focus on baseball during his time in the Mets\u2019 system. But he is aware of his off-field impact.\u201cIf there\u2019s a way I can help a community and be someone that can be a little bit of a light, whether that\u2019s visiting a hospital and encouraging kids, bringing hope or maybe even helping the economy, that would be awesome,\u201d Tebow told reporters last month.He has yet to try the many food and beverage items that bear his name, including the Tebow Time I.P.A.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t drink, which is unfortunate for him, in my opinion,\u201d said Don Titus, the general manager of Craft Bar and Kitchen. \u201cGiven the opportunity, I\u2019d love the chance to try to convince him, or at least have him in for dinner.\u201d\u201cI said it a thousand times, you know, we\u2019re not the Mets,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThe Mets\u2019 colors come from the blue of the Dodgers and orange of the Giants, and the bridge represents going over to Queens, and that has nothing to do with Binghamton. We have plenty of bridges, but no long-span bridges like that.\u201d\u201cPeople have complained about the name, those who don\u2019t come to the ballpark,\u201d sad Cyndy Healy, a season-ticket holder since 2004. \u201cBut I ask them, \u2018Do you know what a Rumble Pony is?\u2019 It\u2019s the strongest steed on the carousel. We have carousels, and that\u2019s what we want to be.\u201dHughes admitted the name change was divisive, but he wanted to do something that would at least engage the fan base.\u201cI don\u2019t even mind the haters,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cMy biggest fear would have been if everybody would have said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t care.\u2019 Indifference was our enemy. And so that\u2019s why I said, \u2018Let\u2019s find out how passionate our fan base is and let\u2019s get this started.\u2019 And, I mean, people responded.\u201d\u201cJohn Hughes has put a lot of money and effort into making this place a lot of fun,\u201d said William Koehler, the Rumble Ponies\u2019 director of food and beverage. \u201cIt\u2019s like the icing on the cake, having Tebow here, and having people say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go see Tebow,\u2019 and then see what we\u2019ve done.

{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Currency Plunges, Potentially Threatening Erdogan\u2019s Re-election Bid", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey called early elections for June 24, more than a year earlier than scheduled, in part to get ahead of tremors in the economy. But on Wednesday they caught up with him as the country\u2019s currency, the lira, took a steep dive, presenting a potential danger to his re-election campaign.The lira fell close to five to the dollar on Wednesday, a 20 percent drop this year, according to Reuters, before the Central Bank stepped in to buck it up with a sharp increase in one of its primary lending rates, to 16 percent from 13.5 percent.The turbulence was not only a sign of growing investor alarm at the state of Turkey\u2019s economy. The drop in the lira has also left some of Turkey\u2019s biggest businesses embattled, while eating deeply into the living standards of ordinary Turks, meaning voters.In that regard, it could not come at a worse time for Mr. Erdogan, who officially opens an election campaign on Thursday that is expected to emphasize his economic achievements and impressive year-on-year growth over 15 years at the head of government.Despite that record, business leaders and financial markets have shown increasing concerns over Mr. Erdogan\u2019s management of the economy as he has accumulated power, with the possibility that the June election for a newly enhanced presidency will give him still more swagger.Financial analysts and political opponents say the latest plunge in the lira was set off by Mr. Erdogan himself, and by his overriding of his financial officials and the Central Bank, in particular his rejection of their calls to raise interest rates.Turkey\u2019s inflation rate is over 10 percent, but out of a desire to maintain high growth rates, Mr. Erdogan has opposed raising interest rates, which financial analysts say is needed to ease the pressure on the currency.The president set off the latest decline of the lira with comments in an interview with Bloomberg News on Monday, when he revealed his intention to take even greater control of the Central Bank if he wins the election to a new, more powerful presidency.\u201cFrom the moment we move to a presidential governing system, our effectiveness there will be very different,\u201d he said, referring to the Central Bank. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this so we can be held accountable for the responsibility we\u2019ve taken.\u201d\u201cWhen the people fall into difficulties because of monetary policies, who are they going to hold accountable?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll hold the president accountable. Since they\u2019ll ask the president about it, we have to give off the image of a president who\u2019s influential on monetary policies.\u201dOpponents of Mr. Erdogan warn that an economic crisis is nearing.\u201cThis rhetoric is extremely dangerous and will put Turkey in a dead-end street,\u201d Durmus Yilmaz, a former governor of the Central Bank who is running for Parliament, said of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s remarks in London. \u201cTurkey did try the exact same thing in 1994 and that\u2019s how we ended up with a crisis.\u201dThe president\u2019s officials would have none of it. His deputy prime minister, Bekir Bozdag, cast the lira\u2019s fall as a foreign plot to damage Mr. Erdogan.\u201cThose who believe that by manipulating the dollar they will lead to results that will harm the nation and their pockets and change the election result, are mistaken,\u201d he told the semiofficial Anadolu news agency.Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, speaking to the news channel NTV, blamed speculators.\u201cWe have instruments that the necessary steps can be taken about monetary policies and the value of the lira,\u201d he said. \u201cThe relevant institutions have very strong instruments.\u201dOne reason for the pressure on the lira is that the United States Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates and drawing international capital away from emerging markets like Turkey. It can be remedied if Turkey raises interest rates, analysts say.But Mr. Erdogan may have overreached. After 15 years of growth and easy credit, his country has accumulated a great deal of foreign credit that it is now struggling to finance, analysts say.Turkey\u2019s corporate foreign currency debt has ballooned since 2009, and 80 percent of it is held by Turkish banks. With the slide of the lira, they are struggling to service the debt and are no longer extending credit to Turkish businesses.Two of Turkey\u2019s biggest companies have recently entered discussions to refinance their debt. Yildiz Holding, a global confectionary and cookie business owned by Turkey\u2019s richest man, entered negotiations to refinance $7 billion of debt in March.The credit crunch is affecting small and medium-size businesses, too, said Atilla Yesilada, an investment analyst. \u201cJust look at the empty shops in the main streets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been the last three years, the currency depreciation continues and people are suffering.\u201dEconomists and financial analysts say the rot lies within Turkey, where crony capitalism and corruption have grown as the rule of law and an independent judiciary, essential bulwarks for foreign investors, have been eroded under Mr. Erdogan.Foreign direct investment has declined to a third of previous levels. Credit rating agencies have downgraded Turkey\u2019s sovereign debt rating in recent months, citing a lack of economic structural reform and a removal of checks and balances by Mr. Erdogan.At a campaign rally, Muharrem Ince, a physics professor who is the leading presidential challenger, called on Mr. Erdogan to cease interfering with the Central Bank and to stop listening to advisers who were feeding him false information.He advised the president to reassure the nation that public fiscal discipline was a priority, rather than funding his mega-construction projects, and to quash rumors of currency controls.\u201cThe economy is sinking,\u201d Mr. Ince told supporters. \u201cWe are about to crash into a wall. My beloved nation, the truck is about to crash into the wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Graphic Novels and Comics Can Move a Story", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Times\u2019s Books desk has recently hired two graphic novels and comics columnists, and an editorial cartoon series just won a Pulitzer.Jake Halpern had been thinking about how to make people care about issues that were tough to read about \u2014 especially the plight of the modern refugee.He had written lengthy narratives about refugees in The New Yorker, and was used to deep-dive, text-based articles that sometimes attracted limited audiences. At the end of a long day, he said, \u201cThe idea of reading about other people\u2019s misery is a hard sell, even for people with the best of intentions.\u201dSo he was intrigued and optimistic when Bruce Headlam, then an opinion editor at The Times, suggested that he approach the refugee story through a visual medium \u2014 the graphic narrative. About 18 months after the initial conversations, he and the illustrator Michael Sloan won a Pulitzer Prize for their graphic narrative series, \u201cWelcome to the New World.\u201dIt was somewhat novel for The Times.Comic strips have rarely appeared in the paper, sometimes to the chagrin of our readers. And Mr. Halpern and Mr. Sloan\u2019s Pulitzer was The Times\u2019s first win for editorial cartooning. Even though the graphic novel long ago became a serious literary genre in countries like France and Japan, in America, the movement\u2019s growth has been comparatively slow or niche. But that\u2019s changing.\u201cI think there\u2019s something really special that can happen when you bring together images and words in the way comics do,\u201d said Gal Beckerman, an editor for the Book Review. When it comes to the kinds of difficult subject matters that can feel abstract in text \u2014 sometimes \u201chitting the boundaries of language alone,\u201d as he said \u2014 comics can make those issues feel distinctly tangible. \u201cIt\u2019s an art,\u201d said Pamela Paul, editor of the Book Review. \u201cI\u2019m blown away by the quality of storytelling.\u201dWhile working on \u201cWelcome to the New World,\u201d Mr. Halpern said he was pleasantly surprised by how quickly readers of various age groups could move through the story \u2014 almost \u201ctoo quickly,\u201d he said, for the hours upon hours of work each of the narrative\u2019s 20 parts required. Part of its accessibility was Mr. Sloan\u2019s \u201cwarm drawings\u201d of the characters, he said. \u201cThe characters kind of brim with humanity,\u201d instead of with some of the darker aspects other war-related graphic novels have highlighted in characters, Mr. Halpern noted.Comics can evoke meaning from small moments like pauses in conversation, nuances of facial expression and internal turmoil. Mr. Beckerman said that some comics, like Nick Drnaso\u2019s \u201cSabrina,\u201d which Mr. Park reviews in his upcoming column, highlight the \u201cinternal quality of the human mind\u201d in a deep way. In \u201cWelcome to the New World,\u201d textless or \u201csilent\u201d panels underscore a family\u2019s shock in discovering that its home has been destroyed; a mother\u2019s sleepless, anxiety-ridden night; a child\u2019s wonder at seeing snow from his window. Mr. Sloan said those moments were inspired by the often entirely silent comics of Frans Masereel, a Flemish graphic artist. \u201cThere\u2019s this beautiful economy that happens with pictures and images when you combine them with words or the absence of words,\u201d Mr. Beckerman said.Marrying the two is a skill that can take a lifetime of practice and learning by example. Mr. Sloan, who has been an illustrator for over 25 years, grew up with comics like \u201cPeanuts\u201d and \u201cPogo.\u201d \u201cAs a child, it was something I immediately responded to,\u201d he said. \u201cI liked having the story told visually and also as a text narrative.\u201dTry these recommendations for seminal graphic novels and comics, from the Book Review\u2019s Gal Beckerman and Maria Russo.

{"Headline": "Keeping Summit Hopes Alive Suggests Kim Jong-un May Need a Deal", "Date": "2018-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Ever since Kim Jong-un took over as the young, untested ruler of North Korea seven years ago, he has promised his country a future free from deprivation.So when President Trump on Thursday abruptly canceled their much anticipated summit meeting on June 12, the North Korean response was remarkably diplomatic and cordial, holding open the hope that the meeting could still take place, after all.The measured response to the cancellation, and the extraordinary diplomatic scramble that followed, was a strong reminder, analysts said, that Mr. Kim not only wants a diplomatic deal with the United States. He may need one.\u201cNorth Korea can still survive under sanctions, especially if China helps it,\u201d said Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. \u201cBut as long as sanctions are there, Kim Jong-un can never deliver the kind of rapid economic growth he has promised for his people.\u201dMr. Kim\u2019s stated desire to continue engaging with Mr. Trump \u2014 even after such a high-profile snub \u2014 does not necessarily mean the North Korean leader is willing to renounce his nuclear arsenal, the primary American demand.No matter how painful sanctions may be, analysts say, Mr. Kim would be unwilling to give up his nuclear weapons unless an accord left him feeling completely safe without them. The security of his family-run regime is a nonnegotiable priority.North Korea has emphasized that it wants security guarantees and will not trade its nuclear arsenal for economic benefits alone. It has also rejected assertions that it has been pressured into talks because of the pain of sanctions, adding that it does not expect help from the United States in pursuing economic development.Indeed, the North Korean economy has been growing as much as 1 to 5 percent annually under Mr. Kim\u2019s rule, because of a limited embrace of market forces by his government and, until late last year, loopholes in the multiple rounds of sanctions adopted by the United Nations Security Council.Still, his apparent willingness to continue diplomatic efforts does suggest that Mr. Kim, 34, may be under pressure to satisfy rising expectations in North Korea for economic gains and shake off the painful grip of sanctions.While largely depicted as a nuclear provocateur in the outside world, Mr. Kim is determined to be the face of a modern and more open North Korea at home. He has erected new buildings and repainted old ones in Pyongyang, the capital, attended a concert by a South Korean girl band and let a state orchestra play American pop music.Mr. Kim has also sent party officials to China to learn its economic policies, and has even admitted to other failures during his supposedly faultless leadership, like a botched satellite launch in 2012. When he met with South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, last month and invited him to Pyongyang, he asked Mr. Moon to fly there because North Korea\u2019s roads and trains were in such \u201cembarrassing\u201d condition.The contrasts between the North and South are particularly stark. North Korea generates a tiny fraction \u2014 less than 5 percent, by some estimates \u2014 of the electricity that South Korea does, leaving passengers stranded for hours in immobilized trains because of widespread power shortages, according to defectors from the country.The dueling economic realities of the two countries are on clear display from space: Even now, nighttime satellite photos show the southern half of the Korean Peninsula splotched with bright lights, while Mr. Kim\u2019s North is shrouded in darkness, with only a pinprick of light indicating the location of Pyongyang, where the nation\u2019s elite lives.Without a doubt, North Korea has come a long way since the 1990s, when mass starvation stalked the population and the country was so energy-starved that travelers camped out in stations for days waiting for trains.But for all his efforts to portray himself as vigorous, approachable and goal-oriented, there is a limit to how far Mr. Kim can go under international sanctions, analysts say.Mr. Kim has the power to rule his country and suppress dissent through extreme brutality. There is no political opposition.But he is also eager to be seen as \u201cpeople loving.\u2019\u2019 Building a \u201cstrong socialist country\u201d is his catchphrase.Recent visitors say Pyongyang looks more colorful and prosperous than it did a decade ago, with stores stocked with imported and domestically produced foods. But conditions outside the capital remain dismal, with widespread malnutrition among children and nursing mothers, according to United Nations relief agencies.The most recent round of sanctions in the American-led \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign has undercut North Korea\u2019s ability to earn hard currency needed to buy imports. Since September, the United Nations Security Council has banned all major North Korean exports, including coal, iron ore, seafood and textiles. If enforced fully, the sanctions could eliminate 90 percent of the country\u2019s total exports.North Korean exports to China, which account for more than 90 percent of the North\u2019s international trade, fell by one-third to $1.65 billion last year, with volumes plunging by as much as 95 percent in recent months. The United Nations sanctions also cut the North\u2019s imports of refined petroleum products by 90 percent, causing gasoline prices to double.Many mines and factories have closed for lack of raw materials or export orders, according to South Korean and Japanese news organizations.Investors and fishermen have deserted fishing ports, after lucrative exports to China were blocked. Last year, four North Korean soldiers defected to South Korea through the heavily armed border. One of them braved a hail of bullets while fleeing. When South Korean doctors operated on him, they found his intestines riddled with worms.There is no sign of a return to mass starvation, experts say, and the country is believed to still earn substantial amounts of cash through smuggling, hacking and weapons sales.Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise decision to withdraw from the summit meeting could also play into Mr. Kim\u2019s favor, especially if China \u2014 North Korea\u2019s main trading partner \u2014 blames Washington and chooses not to enforce sanctions as vigorously.\u201cKim has perfected the most dramatic makeover within a few months,\u201d said Lee Sung-yoon, a professor of Korean studies at Tufts University. \u201cHe\u2019s gone from pariah to statesman, from madman to gracious, well-prepared leader who knows his brief.\u201dSome analysts said Mr. Trump\u2019s initial decision to scrap the summit meeting was a hiccup before a return to dialogue.Others said that if the two nations failed to get diplomacy back on track quickly, Mr. Kim could feel growing pressure to resume weapons tests to pressure the United States and \u201csalvage his fallen status at home and abroad,\u201d said Cheon Seong-whun, an analyst at the Asan institute in Seoul.While Mr. Kim may wield tremendous power, his longevity as North Korea\u2019s undisputed leader is not guaranteed.Mr. Kim\u2019s engagement with Mr. Trump may be unsettling to senior figures in North Korea\u2019s military who worry that he could, in fact, relinquish the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal, which he has called a \u201ctreasured sword\u201d that ensures the country\u2019s survival.At the same time, Mr. Kim\u2019s failure to meet the expectations he has raised for greater prosperity at home could anger the people who already have had a taste of a more affluent life.\u201cThe group around Kim that are living reasonably well and benefiting from the way he\u2019s kind of running things is relatively large,\u201d said Scott Seaman, a Korea analyst at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy in Washington. \u201cThat could mean you don\u2019t want to tick it off.\u201dLike many dictators, Mr. Seaman said, \u201cThis is a guy who goes to sleep at night not knowing whether he\u2019s going to wake up.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank May Take More Heat From Regulators This Summer: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How Warren Buffett failed to grab a $3 billion slice of Uber.\u2022 White House will impose metal tariffs on Europe, Canada and Mexico.\u2022 More headaches for Deutsche Bank.\u2022 Why C.E.O.s should pay attention to the way Dick\u2019s weathered its gun-sales ban.Deutsche Bank\u2019s difficulties with United States regulators could become even worse in the coming weeks.The Fed\u2019s censure, according to the Journal, stemmed from concerns about Deutsche Bank\u2019s procedures for measuring its exposure to its clients and for valuing the collateral backing its loans. Regulators require efficient and accurate controls so that banks can assess their financial strength and the risks they face, especially through difficult times in the economy.Subpar controls could hamper Deutsche Bank\u2019s ability to pass two crucial upcoming tests in the U.S.The first is the Fed\u2019s stress tests, which are used to determine whether large banks can survive a severe economic downturn. Until now, only Deutsche Bank\u2019s small U.S. trust bank had gone through the tests \u2013 and even that failed. Commenting on the 2016 test, the Fed slammed the subsidiary for continuing \u201cto have material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine its capital planning process.\u201d The entity did not get tested last year because of a rule change.But this year, effectively all of Deutsche Bank\u2019s operations in the U.S., including its substantial Wall Street operations, will be subject to a public stress test (the operations went through a confidential test last year.) If the issues with controls that afflicted the small trust bank exist in the trading business, Deutsche Bank could fall short on the test.Banks can also effectively fail the stress tests if they cannot make it through the hypothetical turbulence with adequate equity capital. Regulatory filings show that, at the end of last year, Deutsche\u2019s U.S. operations had $7.3 billion of equity supporting $148 billion of assets. The stress tests, scheduled for next month, will reveal if that equity is sufficient for the storm.But Deutsche Bank, along with several other large foreign banks, faces another tough challenge. By July 1, the banks have to file a detailed plan with regulators that lays out how they would wind themselves down in a bankruptcy-type scenario. Regulators require such plans because they want to be able to shut down troubled banks while minimizing the chaos and confusion that characterized the 2008 financial crisis. These plans can be difficult to get right, particularly for banks with shoddy controls.- Peter EavisMasayoshi Son\u2019s grand plan for SoftBank\u2019s $100 billion Vision Fund was audacious: Own pieces of all the companies in a wide range of sectors \u2014 transportation, food, work, medicine and finance \u2014 that may underpin the global shifts brought on by artificial intelligence.So far many of the biggest wagers have been on transportation.The fund announced plans Thursday to invest $2.25 billion in General Motors\u2019 driverless-technology division to help the automaker ramp up a ride-hailing service and other new businesses.The investment in G.M. Cruise is just the latest in the companies and technologies rapidly transforming the auto industry.Before GM Cruise, its last investment directly into an autonomous driving start-up was last year, when it co-led a financing round for Nauto, a maker of sensors for autonomous vehicles.So far ride-hailing has been a major focus. SoftBank and the Vision Fund have poured money into Uber and its rivals, like Didi Chuxing in China and Ola in India. SoftBank has also invested in Brazil\u2019s 99 and Singapore\u2019s Grab.The investments go beyond just ride-hailing start-ups. SoftBank also bought ARM and invested in Nvidia, semiconductor companies that are making chips for self-driving cars.There have also been investments in Auto1, a German car dealer service, and Mapbox, a mapping start-up.Michael Ronen, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said in a statement that he was \u201cvery impressed by the advances made by the Cruise and G.M. teams.\u201d He also said, \u201cthe G.M. Cruise approach of a fully integrated hardware and software stack gives it a unique competitive advantage.\u201dIt also appears to be second in the state in terms of performance, based on the number of times a driver had to take over from the robotic vehicle. G.M. Cruise drivers had to take control once every 1,300 miles, while Waymo\u2019s drivers intervened just once every 5,600.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe tariffs are meant to make good on President Trump\u2019s longstanding promises to protect American industry. But they have prompted a fierce response from allies, who have already readied lists of American products they plan to tax in return, as well as American businesses that use steel and aluminum, which are seeing their costs rise as a result of the measure.Opposition from an unusual sourceThe tariffs drew the opposition of the Koch brothers\u2019 political network, one of the most powerful in conservative politics. Though known for its advocacy of conservative causes, the Kochs\u2019 approach has generally tended toward more libertarian, deregulatory ends \u2014 and tariffs run counter to that.Trade wars hurt everyone. They trigger retaliatory tariffs from our trade partners and that raises prices on American families who need affordable access to household goods. We urge the Trump administration to abandon these tariffsIt wasn\u2019t just President Trump\u2019s plan to slap tariffs on metal imported from the E.U., Canada and Mexico. While the White House has considered putting tariffs on imported cars, a report from a German business magazine suggested that the president wanted to go much further.Whether the report is accurate, shares in Daimler and Volkswagen fell after the magazine article went up on Thursday, declining about 2 percent.Prosecutors said Woojae \u201cSteve\u201d Jung \u2014 who is Korean and attended Seoul National University before moving to the United States, according to his LinkedIn profile \u2014 made the trades in a brokerage account opened at Interactive Brokers in the name of a friend in South Korea.Prosecutors said he earned illicit profits of just over $130,000.Mr. Jung specialized in technology, media and telecommunications deals, according to his LinkedIn profile. The trades he allegedly made were in the shares of companies involved in deals that Goldman was working on, such as Western Digital\u2019s 2015 acquisition of hardware company SanDisk.The Federal Reserve designated Deutsche Bank\u2019s U.S. subsidiary in \u201ctroubled condition\u201d a year ago, the WSJ reported.

While the company repaid some of its debt due next year, it still has more debt coming due in October of 2019.

{"Headline": "Boosting U.S. Exports to China by $200 Billion Is a Tricky Task", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump is trying to broker a deal to bring down the national trade deficit with China. Experts doubt his goal is achievable.Dear Xi Jinping,Could we interest you in 500 million metric tons of soybeans? We\u2019re just trying to make the math work here. Many experts, though, doubt that plan could work as advertised. Option 1In total, America exported $22 billion worth of soybeans last year, and its soybean production has risen steadily over the last decade. But the country\u2019s total crop is worth just over $40 billion annually. It\u2019s hard to see how it would quintuple in the span of a few years. Mr. Setser estimates that a realistic hope for a near-term increase in soybean exports to China is about $5 billion, which would likely come at the expense of other Chinese trading partners, such as Brazil.Option 2Again, though, the problem is scale. China bought $2 billion worth of liquefied natural gas last year from the United States, double the amount from 2016. It bought about $7 billion worth of other fossil fuel products, including coal and crude oil. If you optimistically doubled those purchases right away, that would still give you less than $10 billion in additional exports, though the number would grow over time. Such an increase would require a massive ramp-up in energy infrastructure, particularly for gas exports.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the liquefaction facilities constructed yet to automatically turn on the spigot,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Option 3That\u2019s still not $200 billion, but it\u2019s a start, which could continue with other high-tech goods that the United States exports a lot of. China could stop buying new jets from Airbus and only source from Boeing, for example (though Boeing appears to be backlogged on filling its orders from around the world). It could buy more cutting-edge American-made cars, such as Teslas. China would probably love to go a step further and buy fighter jets, aircraft carriers and other advanced defense weaponry from the United States \u2014 but for national security reasons, that pitch would probably never fly. Option 4Option 5Neither Mr. Bown nor Mr. Setser find it realistic that a combination of the options above would add up to the administration\u2019s goal, over the span of one year. But it might look more achievable as a three-year accumulation of purchases, through 2020. (Sort of like how the administration passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut in Congress last year \u2014 with that total being for a 10-year window.)Option 6Mr. Setser said he suspects the import growth will continue, in part because of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cut, which is giving consumers more money to spend on electronics, clothing and other Chinese-made goods. So unless Americans stop buying Chinese TVs, toys and clothing, the trade deficit may not budge as much as Mr. Trump wants.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Voted for Obama, Then Went for Trump. Can Democrats Win Them Back?", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRITTMAN, Ohio \u2014 In the daily race that is her life, Sharla Baker does not think about politics very much.She rises early, drives to the gas station to buy coffee, feeds her baby, dresses her two other children, ages 3 and 2, and hustles them all off to day care. By 9:30 a.m. she pulls into a hair salon 45 minutes away, where she is training to be a cosmetologist. She waxes and cuts all day long, making only the money she earns in tips, which on a recent day last month was $8.41.But Ms. Baker does vote. She picked Barack Obama for president in 2008 and 2012. He seemed sincere and looked like a happy family man. But most important, he was a Democrat. Her great-grandmother, who grew up poor in Pennsylvania, always said that Democrats look out for the poor people.In 2016, though, she voted for Donald J. Trump. Yes, he was rich and seemed mean on his TV show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d But she liked how he talked about jobs and wages and people being left out of the economy.Now, more than a year later, she is wavering.\u201cI voted for Trump because I wanted some change going on,\u201d said Ms. Baker, 28. \u201cBut then again, maybe he\u2019s going to do the wrong change.\u201dThe swing of Obama voters to Mr. Trump proved a decisive factor in the 2016 presidential election. Of the more than 650 counties that chose Mr. Obama twice, about a third flipped to Mr. Trump. Many were in states critical to Mr. Trump\u2019s win, like Iowa, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.John Sides, a political-science professor at George Washington University, has estimated that 9 percent of voters who cast ballots for Mr. Obama ended up voting for Mr. Trump. Among white voters who had never been to college, it was 22 percent.Now, as the country lurches into another election season \u2014 this time the prize is control of Congress \u2014 a crucial question for Democrats is whether they will be able to lure these voters back. The party has had some early successes. Wins in Alabama, Pennsylvania and Virginia have given Democrats hope that voters might be souring on Mr. Trump \u2014 to the point that the party might flip control of the House and possibly even the Senate. Next week\u2019s primary races in Ohio and West Virginia, both states that went for Mr. Trump in 2016, will also serve as tests of voter enthusiasm for Democrats.We recently asked people who cast ballots for both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump to describe how they felt about the president and the Democratic Party ahead of the midterms. In interviews with 38 voters in 14 states across four months, a clear pattern emerged. Voters said they did not like Mr. Trump as a person and did not consider themselves die-hard supporters. Some were even embarrassed by him.But many were basically satisfied with his policies. The tax bill was mildly positive, they said. Several had a bit of extra money in their paycheck. They liked that he was trying to address illegal immigration. Only a few regretted their vote.Voters said they still liked Mr. Obama and that they voted for Mr. Trump because they didn\u2019t want to cast a ballot for Hillary Clinton. But they were still open to voting for Democrats \u2014 if the party could come up with the right candidates. For the most part, the midterm elections were not yet on their radars.\u201cHonestly, it hasn\u2019t crossed my mind really at all,\u201d Ms. Baker said, when asked about them.Several voters said they chose Mr. Trump for the same reason they chose Mr. Obama: a deep craving for change and disgust with both political parties.Charlotte Griffin, the mayor of Bear Grass, N.C., a town of about 80 people in the eastern part of the state, said her vote for Mr. Trump was more an act of desperation than a positive political choice. She had grown furious with the national political class \u2014 and what she saw as its wealth, ignorance of ordinary people\u2019s lives and inability to get anything done. It was the first time she\u2019d chosen a Republican in 50 years of voting. Her county flipped to Mr. Trump after choosing Mr. Obama twice.\u201cDid I really like Trump? No. I still don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Griffin said in January. \u201cBut at least I thought we might move. We were in a stalemate. We were at dead center zero. We were just sitting there spinning our wheels.\u201dIn January, Mr. Trump was defending himself after an uproar over vulgar comments he was said to have made at a closed-door immigration meeting. When asked again in April how she felt, Ms. Griffin said Mr. Trump was still \u201cseverely testing my sensibilities.\u201dShe said she planned to vote for the same Democrat, G.K. Butterfield, who has been her congressional representative since 2004.\u201cIt\u2019s a variable wind situation,\u201d she said by phone, referring to the country. \u201cOne day it seems to be going this way, and then all of a sudden it\u2019s going the other way.\u201dCounties like Ms. Griffin\u2019s that flipped from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump have lost ground to the rest of the nation, even more so than the counties that have been solidly Republican. Forty years ago, workers in the flip counties earned 85 cents for every dollar earned by workers in the Democratic strongholds. By 2016, the ratio had fallen to 77 cents.Ms. Baker works at a hair salon Stark County, Ohio, which flipped to Mr. Trump after choosing Mr. Obama twice, and she said the president was an economic disappointment.\u201cHe\u2019s not there for the poor and the middle class,\u201d she said, sitting on her mother\u2019s couch in the small town of Rittman. \u201cI thought he would be, but he\u2019s not.\u201dMs. Baker has worked many jobs since graduating from high school in 2007 \u2014 at a Bob Evans restaurant, an Aldi supermarket, a Subway sandwich shop, a packaging plant for camera memory chips and a frame store. All paid badly. She didn\u2019t have health care or 401(k) retirement benefits with any of them.Ms. Baker hated making minimum wage, and how powerless it made her feel, so she enrolled in beauty school to get more control over her life.She had hoped Mr. Trump would raise wages and force companies to give all their employees benefits. But that hasn\u2019t happened. All she hears now is harsh talk by Republicans on TV about poor people: How people who get food stamps are lazy. How they should be given boxes of food instead of money.Ms. Baker knows there is another election this year, but like most people interviewed for this article, she said she had not looked up the candidates yet. She was not sure if she would vote.Many people interviewed went out of their way to say they did not consider themselves Trump supporters.Donna Burgraff, a registered independent in Chillicothe, in southern Ohio, said she finds Mr. Trump boorish. She said that he judges women on their looks and seems to thrive on embarrassing people, behavior that Ms. Burgraff, an associate professor of education at Ohio University, disapproves of.Ms. Burgraff did not like how Mr. Trump kept falsely asserting that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States.\u201cHow could that have been anything but racism?\u201d she said.Still, on Election Day 2016, Ms. Burgraff voted for Mr. Trump, if reluctantly. She believed he was the better choice. And looking back she does not regret it. The tax bill has given her an extra $400 a month in her paycheck.\u201cI pulled the lever for Trump, and I\u2019m not sorry I did,\u201d she said over lunch in Chillicothe in March. She said she planned to vote this fall for her Republican congressman, Brad Wenstrup.But others regretted voting for Mr. Trump and are less certain how they will vote this fall.Brad Zeigler, 68, a retired police chief in Warren County, Ill., said he has not liked anything Mr. Trump has done.\u201cI thought maybe he\u2019ll listen to his advisers and they\u2019ll contain him,\u201d said Mr. Zeigler, who, like his county, voted for Mr. Obama twice before choosing Mr. Trump. \u201cBut that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201dHe said he is furious at himself for having voted for Mr. Trump and is open to voting for Democrats this fall, even though the party no longer really speaks to him.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about our environment,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about people\u2019s rights. I sound like a far-left person and I\u2019m not!\u201dInstead, Mr. Zeigler said he feels politically homeless.\u201cThe Republicans are about money and big business and the Democrats have lost their way. They are not taking care of that core group they know is out there.\u201dSona Patel contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In California\u2019s Farm Country, the Tide of \u2018Resistance\u2019 Runs Dry Ahead of the Primary", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "Although within California it is common to pit north versus south, the sharp cultural divisions between rural and urban areas are in many ways more significant.Supported byVISALIA, Calif. \u2014 Amid neat rows of orchards, on cattle ranches and dairy farms across the southern territory of California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, the churn of daily life offers few hints of an imminent political spectacle. This is another California, where conservative values are often taken for granted, and where the tide of liberal \u201cresistance\u201d runs as dry as its unirrigated dirt.In 2016, the 22nd District overwhelmingly went for Mr. Trump, and voters are quick to write off criticism of Mr. Nunes, whose family farming background many closely relate to, as television spin and partisan bickering.Here are the pieces you need to read to understand the state, and what may happen there on Tuesday.On a sunny day on Visalia\u2019s quiet main street, Will Dixon, 41, said he believes Mr. Nunes has \u201cdone a lot for the valley\u201d and its farmers. Mr. Dixon, who has lived in the area his entire life, said that he heard some grumbling on television about Mr. Nunes becoming a character in the Russia investigation, but said he feels that the congressman has shown he is committed to his constituents.\u201cI think that was just politics,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really happy we have someone like Devin Nunes. I have high hopes in the future for what he\u2019s going to do for the valley.\u201dMr. Nunes\u2019s Republican peers in the region, including Representative Kevin McCarthy in the 23rd District to the southeast, inspire similar defenses, and are widely considered safe in their bids for re-election. Even Representative David Valadao, a Republican dairy farmer in the 21st District to the west, an agrarian area where Hillary Clinton trounced Mr. Trump, drew just one competitor \u2014 a Democrat \u2014 this year.And although within California it is common to pit north versus south, the sharp cultural divisions between the valley and more coastal regions, between rural and urban locales, are in many ways more significant.Tricia Stever Blattler, the executive director of the Tulare County Farm Bureau, said that the rural communities that live across the southern San Joaquin Valley must often fight for attention and can be overshadowed by large urban centers like Los Angeles and San Francisco. In a region that feels neglected by other parts of the state, farmers identify strongly with representatives who understand their needs and can speak the language of their burdens.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for our voices to be heard, so we do appreciate what our current congressional members bring to the table. Most of them are very well versed in agriculture and water issues, and they understand what a rural farm economy looks like,\u201d she said, pointing to Mr. Valadao\u2019s efforts to expand access to water in the San Joaquin Valley in particular.As a matter of political calculation, it would make little sense for farming groups or farmers themselves to rankle incumbent members of Congress who they feel are in tune with their communities, especially those who are becoming more powerful in Washington.But not all are satisfied with the status quo.Earlier this month, the Fight Back California Political Action Committee went up with billboards in the district knocking Mr. Nunes for his ties to Mr. Trump and making the case that he has neglected his constituents. In quick succession, three billboards along Highway 99 south of Fresno ask, \u201cWhy is Devin Nunes hot on Russia... While farmers get burned by a trade war with China? Congressman Nunes, how could you forget us?\u201dKatie Merrill, the group\u2019s executive director, said that internal polling in Mr. Nunes\u2019s district suggests there is an opening to attack the congressman. She said Mr. Nunes\u2019s ties to Mr. Trump will not dissuade voters \u2014 Mr. Trump won there by about 10 percentage points \u2014 but that Democrats can make the case that Mr. Nunes is spending too much time in Washington and not paying sufficient attention to needs at home.\u201cHe\u2019s not home, he doesn\u2019t do town halls, and no one ever sees him,\u201d she said.David Marquette, 53, a steady Democratic voter, said that Mr. Nunes is \u201cobsessed with defending Trump against the Mueller investigation.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be focused on the issues here,\u201d he said.To say that Mr. Nunes is considered the safe bet to win the seat is an understatement; he beat his Democratic opponent in 2016 with nearly 70 percent of the vote, and had $5 million in his war chest as of mid May, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. He has raised more than $1.7 million since January 1, bringing his total receipts far beyond what he has raised in previous elections, though just about half of those donations from within the state.But California\u2019s rural heartland is not a monolith. While the region tends to vote conservatively, there is a significant Latino community, which makes up nearly 50 percent of the population in many parts of the district, or more than 80 percent in small towns like Farmersville.Driving through the district, there are many signs for Mr. Nunes\u2019s main opponent, Andrew Janz, a Fresno County prosecutor and a Democrat. He has shown fund-raising potential already; he has raised $1.8 million to challenge Mr. Nunes and had $600,000 left on hand as of mid-May.Any number of variables, however, could shift between now and the general election in November. The calculations of agricultural groups and trade organizations could change if Mr. Trump pursues trade policies internationally that could harm farming exports in California. The very nations with which the United States has seen tensions under Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership \u2014 South Korea, China, Japan and Mexico \u2014 are among the largest export markets for Californian products.And there are points of tension between Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line agenda and more moderate positions taken by some California Republicans. Immigration is particularly important in a farm economy, and mass deportation is not a popular solution in these rural areas.Ms. Blattler said that, pragmatically, farmers depend immensely on foreign labor because \u201cthere are not enough legal citizens living here today that want those jobs.\u201d She said she would like to see an agricultural guest worker program and a solution to the number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States that does not require a so-called \u201ctouchback,\u201d which would mandate that farm workers return to their country of origin, and would disrupt farm labor and existing relationships.\u201cA lot of our agricultural employers have sometimes multiple generations of employees who have never been able to get through the process, and they\u2019re working on our farm and our ranches,\u201d she said.Concerns over Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda appear easier to exploit in the neighboring 21st District, where Mr. Valadao faces a steeper battle to hold onto his seat in November. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has listed him as a top target in their \u201cred to blue\u201d program.Mr. Valadao has won landslide victories in the district since his election in 2012, despite voters there repeatedly supporting Democrats in national and statewide elections. Mrs. Clinton won the district in 2016 by nearly 16 percentage points, but Mr. Valadao beat his opponent by 13 points. Notably, Mr. Valadao has taken a much softer approach on immigration than many of his Republican colleagues, and has even broken with his party to defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.But with just one other candidate in the race, Mr. Valadao\u2019s fight will come in November, as he and his opponent are automatically on the general election ballot. Few voters in downtown Hanford, the Kings County seat, seemed aware there was a primary election happening in just a matter of weeks.Kelly Mahoney, who lives near Hanford, said that she tries not to follow politics too closely because it is so toxic, and she did not discuss her thoughts on Mr. Trump. She lamented, however, that politicians in the rest of the state do not fully understand what rural life is like.\u201cI don\u2019t think they get us and I don\u2019t think they consider us very much. They\u2019re always worried about everyone else,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Sanctions Mean to Iranians", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Arian\u00a0and Mr. Bouzari are Iranian writers.The July 2015 nuclear deal officially ended Iran\u2019s isolation and economic punishment, but the comprehensive sanctions that the country had endured for nearly a decade continued to take a toll.Those sanctions have profoundly damaged the Iranian economy. The government \u2014 hemmed in by domestic opposition and its own corruption \u2014 has done little to repair it. There have been encouraging signs of life since the nuclear deal, but they turned out to be short-lived.But among most people \u2014 average Iranians \u2014 the news elicited feelings of bitterness and resignation. At dinner tables and in bakery lines and taxi pools, people across Iran are discussing their traumatic memories of life under punishing sanctions. Iranians now experience the disturbing prospect of crippling inflation, budget cuts, delayed payments and shortages of basic goods, especially imported medication upon which many lives depend.We have friends with young children and relatively secure jobs who are abandoning a lifetime of work and leaving the country. We know people who are doing everything they can to transfer their assets overseas because they believe their money would be safer anywhere but Iran. Many parents we know are striving to send their families abroad.Meanwhile, the warmongers in the Trump administration are effectively enablers for the most conservative elements in the very government they want gone. A powerful faction in the government in Iran justifies domestic oppression by referring to American bellicosity.More than it will hurt the government, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the nuclear deal will affect these grass-roots movements. It will damage political activism and peaceful, creative expressions of will to change.For the working class and for low-income people, new sanctions and renewed isolation will mean fewer jobs, less security and more poverty. As a result, the poor will be forced to change their priorities: The time and energy they could dedicate to peaceful protests will be consumed by struggling to provide bread. Or things could take another turn: Extreme poverty may create such high levels of frustration that people turn to violence, eventually strengthening the hand of the oppressive state.As for the middle class and people in large cities, renewed sanctions \u2014 especially alongside the talk of war \u2014 present an existential threat to the meager well-being they have worked so hard to cobble together. The Trump administration\u2019s decision to pull out of the nuclear deal may well make the middle class more conservative, as they fear economic collapse and chaos, they will move closer to the government. They will give up demands for equality and justice in order to protect their hard-earned relative comfort.As for the government itself, especially the faction intent on ruling with an iron fist, the sanctions will not hurt much. As the Obama years proved, sanctions never forced the Iranian government to cut back its security and military budgets. Instead, a choked-off economy and its accompanying black markets allowed a group of the powerful people to monopolize the economy, giving rise to a mafia-like class that funneled wealth to the top or transferred it overseas, and deployed all its political and military capital to protect it.Those are the people who thrive under the sanctions. They are probably celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.Amir Ahmadi Arian is professor of literature and creative writing at City College of New York.

{"Headline": "He Was a Protester a Month Ago. Now, Nikol Pashinyan Leads Armenia.", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYEREVAN, Armenia \u2014 Nikol Pashinyan, who led the nonviolent protest movement that improbably toppled the government of Armenia, had just ended a brief interview and headed into another room when he whirled around.\u201cWould you like to eat?\u201d he asked, beckoning to a table scattered with plastic cartons holding takeout pork kebabs wrapped in paperlike bread, as well as tomato and cucumber salad. \u201cThis kind of lunch is the usual for us for the past month; we have not gotten back to civilized ways.\u201dIf whirlwind events of the past month are any guide, Armenia might never get back to its old ways, civilized or not. On Tuesday, Mr. Pashinyan became Armenia\u2019s interim prime minister, when a Parliament dominated by his political foes elected him by a 59-to-42 vote.After vowing to remake the country\u2019s political and economic systems, Mr. Pashinyan told a cheering throng in the central Republic Square in Yerevan, the capital, that, \u201cYour victory is not that I was elected as prime minister of Armenia; your victory is that you decided who should be prime minister of Armenia.\u201dTens of thousands had gathered in the square, cheering wildly and waving the country\u2019s red, blue and orange flag as the vote was broadcast live on giant monitors.On March 31, Mr. Pashinyan, 42, a balding man with a salt-and-pepper beard and slight paunch, began a quixotic walk across central Armenia to protest an effort by the president to skirt term limits.Few paid much attention at first. Yet within three weeks, Mr. Pashinyan, a former newspaper editor and political prisoner, had galvanized a civil disobedience movement that transformed the country\u2019s political landscape. It forced the retirement of Serzh Sargsyan, the president for the past decade, and shoved aside the long-dominant Republican Party.It was the most sweeping change in this small, landlocked country of about 2.8 million people in the southern Caucasus since it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.Mr. Pashinyan\u2019s election on Tuesday was all the more remarkable because it happened in the backyard of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who sent his congratulations.Popular protests tend to alarm Mr. Putin, and he has invaded other former Soviet states, Georgia and Ukraine, where he saw Russian interests and influence being threatened. Russia considers Armenia of such strategic importance that it maintains a military base in the country, and helps guard Armenia\u2019s borders with Turkey and Iran.But by focusing on strictly domestic problems while pledging eternal brotherhood with Moscow, Mr. Pashinyan deftly avoided a military intervention by the Kremlin.\u201cThere are no foreign forces involved in this process,\u201d Mr. Pashinyan said over lunch. \u201cI have insisted many times that there is no geopolitical context to our movement, our velvet revolution.\u201dIf many Armenians find it nothing short of miraculous that their country seems transformed overnight, Mr. Pashinyan described it as the culmination of a journey that began some 20 years ago.As a journalism student at Yerevan State University, he wrote screeds against corruption, and was expelled in 1995 before he could graduate.He later become the editor in chief of the newspaper Haykakan Zhamanak, where he continued polemical attacks against politicians and rich businessmen. His car, a Lada Niva, was set on fire outside the newspaper\u2019s offices in 2004.In 2008, he helped organize street protests against what many considered a tainted presidential election. Some still blame him for bloody clashes that resulted in the deaths of 10 people, although he denies provoking the violence.\u201cI didn\u2019t trust him,\u201d said Anahit Sahakyan, 42, the owner of the bohemian Ilik cafe in central Yerevan. \u201cHe would shout, \u2018They treat you like slaves! They treat you like dogs!\u2019 He was trying to arouse the animal instincts in people. I didn\u2019t like it.\u201dWanted by the government, Mr. Pashinyan went on the lam for 16 months. \u201cThat was the hardest time we experienced,\u201d said his wife, Anna Hakobyan, 40, who met him in journalism school. A security services officer moved into their apartment, in case he showed up.With Mr. Pashinyan in hiding, Ms. Hakobyan took over the newspaper, while also caring for their three children; they now have four. She did not see him for six months, but she heard from him \u2014 he sent notes accusing her of destroying the paper, along with occasional praise.\u201cThat was stressful,\u201d she said, laughing.Eventually, she would visit him for a few days, changing cars as she moved across Yerevan to lose the officers tailing her. \u201cJust like the movies,\u201d she said.In 2009, Mr. Pashinyan turned himself in, and was sentenced to seven years in prison, thrown in with violent criminals. One night, two masked men entered his cell and kicked him to the ground.\u201cI am proud that I experienced it and was able to stay true to myself in that strange environment under all different kinds of pressure,\u201d he said. He learned English and read a lot.When he returned to their modest, two-bedroom, fourth-floor walk-up after a 2011 amnesty, he was a stranger to their daughter, Shushan, who had been an infant when he was locked up. \u201cWhat is Daddy for?\u201d she asked, puzzled.Elected to Parliament in 2012, he joined a weak alliance of nine opposition members. He infuriated many opposition activists in 2015 by not opposing the governing party\u2019s move to alter the Constitution, shifting most presidential powers to the prime minister.Last month, term limits forced Mr. Sargsyan to step down as president, but he held onto power by having Parliament elect him prime minister, despite his pledge not to seek that office. When his plan became clear, Mr. Pashinyan began preparing his protest.\u201cI understood that the best way to prevent violence is to be nonviolent,\u201d he said. Drawing inspiration from Nelson Mandela and from Gandhi\u2019s famous 1930 walk across India to protest British taxation, Mr. Pashinyan decided to walk around 120 miles across Armenia from Gyumri, the second-largest city, to Yerevan.Opponents mocked him for wearing a camouflage-pattern T-shirt, accusing him of trying to disguise his lack of military service. He laughed off the criticism, and the shirt became a signature.His beard and clothes set him apart from the slick haircuts and suits favored by the governing party. His supporters saw his look as fitting for a man they described as down-to-earth, smart, spontaneous and far less volatile then he had been in his youth.Students were already protesting by the time he reached Yerevan on April 13, and the crowds grew with each step the government took. On April 17, Mr. Sargsyan became prime minister, and on April 22 he tried to decapitate the protest movement by having Mr. Pashinyan detained.The demonstrations swelled, with Mr. Pashinyan, again free, stressing that if the police used force, protesters should just raise their hands and surrender. He told the police repeatedly that they were friends and fellow Armenians.Many of those who had been skeptical became supporters. \u201cHe is one of the few political guys in Armenia who really changed,\u201d said Samvel Martirosyan, a specialist in internet security and a veteran political observer. \u201cHe became smarter, calmer, he speaks really well.\u201dSupporters brought the country to a halt, joking that it was a measure of Mr. Pashinyan\u2019s influence that he could make Armenians do things on time.Parliament met again on Tuesday to choose a leader, and this time Mr. Pashinyan prevailed. He said his first priority was to organize the first fair parliamentary elections in many years.Mr. Pashinyan has vowed to break up the cozy system of oligarchic monopolies and invigorate an economy that has left a third of the country in poverty. After 30 years of fighting with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region both countries claim, he has said he will make the enclave part of Armenia.He brushes aside fears that he has set expectations so high that he is bound to disappoint.\u201cI am in a working mood, there is no sense of euphoria, just work to do,\u201d Mr. Pashinyan said. \u201cIf we were able to do the impossible, that means we will be able to do the difficult.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Iran Deal Is a Lie", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion Columnist\u201cThe sanctions lifting will only occur as Iran takes the steps agreed, including addressing possible military dimensions.\u201dTwo lies, actually. The first was Iran\u2019s declaration to the International Atomic Energy Agency, prior to the implementation of the deal, of the full extent of its past nuclear work. This was essential, both as a test of Tehran\u2019s sincerity and as a benchmark for understanding just how close it was to being able to assemble and deliver a nuclear warhead.The second lie was the Obama administration\u2019s promise that it was serious about getting answers from Tehran. In a moment of candor, then-Secretary of State John Kerry admitted \u201cwe are not fixated on Iran specifically accounting for what they did at one point in time or another\u201d \u2014 but then he promised Congress that Iran would provide the accounting.That was when the White House still feared that Congress might block the deal. When it failed to do so, thanks to a Democratic filibuster, the administration contented itself with a make-believe process in which Iran pretended to make a full declaration and the rest of the world pretended to believe it.So much, then, for all the palaver about the deal providing an unprecedented level of transparency for monitoring Iranian compliance. So much, also, for the notion that Iran has honored its end of the bargain. It didn\u2019t. This should render the agreement null and void.That\u2019s the significance of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s show and tell on Monday of what appears to be a gigantic cache of pilfered Iranian documents detailing Tehran\u2019s nuclear work. The deal\u2019s defenders have dismissed the Israeli prime minister\u2019s presentation as a bunch of old news \u2014 just further proof that Iran once had a robust covert program to build a bomb. They also insist Iran has complied with the terms of the agreement since it came into force in January 2016.Yet it\u2019s difficult to imagine that the I.A.E.A. can now square Iran\u2019s 2015 declaration with what the Israelis have uncovered. Iran\u2019s mendacity is no longer the informed supposition of proliferation experts such as Mr. Albright. It is \u2014 assuming the documents are authentic, as the U.S. has confirmed \u2014 a matter of fact that the I.A.E.A. chose to ignore when it gave Iran a free pass under political pressure to move to implement the deal. If the agency cares for its own credibility as a nuclear watchdog, it should decide that Iran\u2019s past declaration was false and that Iran\u2019s retention of the documents obtained by Israel, with all the nuclear know-how they contain, put it in likely breach of the agreement.As for Iran\u2019s current compliance, of course it\u2019s complying. The deal gave Iran the best of all worlds. It weakened U.N. restrictions on its right to develop, test and field ballistic missiles \u2014 a critical component for a nuclear weapons capability that the Iranians haven\u2019t fully mastered. It lifted restrictions on Iran\u2019s oil exports and eased other sanctions, pumping billions of dollars into a previously moribund economy. And it allows Iran to produce all the nuclear fuel it wants come the end of the next decade.Yes, Iran is permanently enjoined from building a nuclear weapon, even after the limitations on uranium enrichment expire. But why believe this regime will be faithful to the deal at its end when it was faithless to it at its beginning?Netanyahu\u2019s revelations were plainly timed to influence Donald Trump\u2019s decision, expected later this month, on whether to stay in the Iran deal. Trump is under pressure from the French, British and Germans to stay in it, on the view that, if nothing else, the agreement has kept Iran from racing toward a bomb.But the deal now in place allows Iran to amble toward a bomb, even as it uses the financial benefits of the agreement to fund (in the face of domestic upheaval and at a steep cost to its own economy) its militancy in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and especially in Syria. And Iran\u2019s own nuclear history suggests the country\u2019s leaders have always been cautious in the face of credible American threats, which is one reason they shelved much of their nuclear program in 2003 after the U.S. invaded Iraq.\u201cWhen the Iranians fear American power, they either back down or they stall,\u201d says Mark Dubowitz, an expert on Iran sanctions at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t fear American power, they push forward. With Trump, the question is: Are they going to feel American power, or American mush?\u201dI opposed the Iran deal, but immediately after it came into effect, I believed that we should honor it scrupulously and enforce it unsparingly. Monday\u2019s news is that Iran didn\u2019t honor its end of the bargain and neither need the United States now. Punitive sanctions combined with a credible threat of military force should follow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tariff Impact Colors a Key House Race in Boeing Country", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUBURN, Wash. \u2014 President Trump likes to keep negotiating partners on their toes. But workers like Charles Cesmat have been just as unnerved by the president\u2019s recent moves on trade.Mr. Cesmat is a parts manager at a Boeing plant in Renton, Wash., just south of Seattle. One of every four planes Boeing assembles is sent to China. Each time Mr. Trump attacks Beijing on Twitter, or announces a new set of tariffs, Mr. Cesmat winces.\u201cI\u2019m concerned a potential trade war could affect work for our members and work for me,\u201d Mr. Cesmat said. \u201cThousands of people\u2019s jobs rely on a working relationship with China.\u201dThe spat with Beijing has rattled the state\u2019s juggernaut aerospace industry, as workers and business owners reckon with the possibility that their livelihood could be at risk. Boeing shares economic dominance with giants like Amazon and Microsoft, but trade still supports 40 percent of all jobs in Washington, according to a Seattle consulting firm.\u201cTrade issues are high on people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Chris Mefford, president of Community Attributes Inc., the firm that produced the estimate. \u201cThey are wondering and worrying how it\u2019s going to play out.\u201dThat anxiety is particularly acute in the Eighth Congressional District, a comma-shaped expanse that will hold one of the most closely watched midterm races in November as the Democrats battle to win back the House. Several political handicappers rate the race as a tossup.The district\u2019s quirky boundary, which encompasses the vast airplane-making ecosystem to the west and thousands of acres of cherry and apple farms on the other side of the Cascade Mountains, makes the territory uniquely vulnerable to the president\u2019s actions on trade. Boeing is probably the American company with the most riding on a healthy relationship with Beijing.China is projected to buy more than 7,000 planes worth around $1 trillion in the next 20 years, more than Boeing\u2019s current backlog for the entire world. Most commercial aircraft in China are made by Boeing, the company says, but if the trade pressures escalate, China could choose to award more work to Europe\u2019s Airbus.For now, Beijing has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on some airplanes, including older 737 models made in the Renton factory where Mr. Cesmat works, which is just outside the district.\u201cChina knew exactly where to target,\u201d said Kim Schrier, the Democratic candidate who has built the biggest campaign war chest ahead of the Aug. 7 primary. \u201cThey\u2019re targeting districts where this could be problematic for Republicans.\u201dMs. Schrier is among half a dozen or so Democrats gunning for a seat that became catnip for the party the moment that the seven-term Republican incumbent, Dave Reichert, announced his retirement in September. Despite Mr. Reichert\u2019s success, the district favored Hillary Clinton by three percentage points over Mr. Trump, and it went twice for Barack Obama. Ms. Schrier, a pediatrician and first-time candidate, has been hammering Dino Rossi, the likely Republican nominee, on the tariff issue.\u201cThese tariffs are a direct response to the policies of a president you helped elect. Don\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d she tweeted to Mr. Rossi last month.Mr. Rossi, a former state senator, is careful to note that the bluster could be part of Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiating style. But he said he understood why everyone was so worried. \u201cYou really can\u2019t get down to a trade war. In the end it will be very disruptive,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHopefully this is more posturing than anything.\u201dBut voters in the district say the escalating trade drama has already begun to complicate their daily lives. Companies that supply construction materials have suspended orders, waiting to see what happens to metal prices. Employees at a builder of truck components say managers have been hastily reassessing supply chains that run through China and Mexico. A local hard-cider brewer is reconsidering an expansion after the steel and aluminum tariffs made new tanks and cans more expensive.And at Boeing, a company that employs grandfathers next to granddaughters and has introduced generations of Washingtonians to their spouses, the unease has been evident from the executive suite to the factory floor.Mr. Trump\u2019s hard line on trade didn\u2019t used to inspire so much teeth-grinding among Boeing workers. A lot of union mechanics were happy last year when he pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have reinforced the nation\u2019s embrace of free trade. And the president earned a lot of fans in Washington when he criticized the company on the campaign trail in 2015 for setting up a new plant outside Shanghai, saying it would \u201cend up taking a tremendous number of jobs away from the United States.\u201dJim McKenzie, a union machinery repairman, remembered that comment when, several months ago, he came across a package of dorsal-fin parts at the Boeing plant in Auburn where he works. Mr. McKenzie pulled back the Bubble Wrap and saw a label that made him feel as if he were sinking into quicksand: Boeing China.\u201cWe drill it and assemble it, but they ship the parts in from China,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said. \u201cThere are people who have worked here for 25 years making those parts, and they\u2019re proud of that.\u201dBut Mr. McKenzie, 56, isn\u2019t eager to blow up the Beijing relationship. \u201cChina will just buy all their planes from Airbus,\u201d he said, leaning his chair back against a wall in the machinists\u2019 union hall in Auburn.He doesn\u2019t have much hope that Mr. Trump will do anything to stop Boeing from setting up shop in China \u2014 he saw how Carrier shipped work from Indianapolis to Mexico even though the president had railed against the move. In Boeing\u2019s case, Mr. McKenzie said, hiring some Chinese workers might be unavoidable. \u201cYou have to provide them jobs to sell them airplanes,\u201d he said.Ms. Schrier recently won the endorsement of the machinists\u2019 union, which represents more than 26,000 Boeing workers. Mr. Cesmat, 27, plans to volunteer for her campaign. \u201cShe pledged to support our jobs,\u201d he said.Boeing\u2019s political action committee donated $2,000 to Mr. Reichert\u2019s campaign, but hasn\u2019t contributed to any candidates vying to succeed him, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. It did donate $8,000 to Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is facing a strong Democratic challenge in her quest for re-election in Washington\u2019s Fifth District.The fear over trade tensions has spread beyond Boeing\u2019s hulking factories, all the way to Schilling Cider, a hard-cider company founded here five years ago by two friends, Mark Kornei and Colin Schilling. The business grew quickly, thanks in part to the state\u2019s abundant apple orchards, but now it\u2019s staring down an uncomfortable new reality.The company that sells Mr. Kornei stainless-steel tanks told him recently that prices for its raw materials might rise by 20 percent. A single tank costs around $50,000. He has also heard from the manufacturer of his aluminum cans that prices could increase by 10 percent. Mr. Kornei will buy 11 million of them this year, so that uptick alone could cost him more than $100,000, he said.\u201cStirring the pot unnecessarily doesn\u2019t help business whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Kornei said. \u201cGive us a steady set of rules so we can figure out what we are going to do.\u201dMr. Rossi acknowledged that some of what the president says and does \u201ccan at times\u201d make it harder for him on the campaign trail. But he has raised more than $2 million, about twice as much as Ms. Schrier.The Republican tax cuts are a big selling point for Mr. Rossi, who has a ready figure for exactly how much a typical household will save because of the law (\u201c$3,357 \u2014 that\u2019s real money\u201d). He\u2019s also counting on a personal bond with Republican voters east of the Cascades.Kirk Johnson contributed reporting from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In About-Face on Trade, Trump Vows to Protect ZTE Jobs in China", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 As China and the United States go toe-to-toe on trade and maneuver ahead of a historic North Korea meeting next month, an unlikely obstacle has emerged: a second-tier Chinese electronics maker, ZTE.In a tweet, Mr. Trump said he was working with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to prevent the collapse of the company, which employs 75,000 people.\u201cToo many jobs in China lost,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cCommerce Department has been instructed to get it done!\u201dThe overture appeared to be off-key for an administration that has been reliably strident on what it has called unfair Chinese trade practices. Mr. Trump\u2019s concern in his tweet about Chinese jobs \u2014 which echoed Beijing\u2019s talking point on the issue \u2014 also runs counter to his vows to restore American jobs lost to China.Still, by saying the United States would work to bring ZTE back to life, Mr. Trump took pressure off the American-Chinese relationship at a crucial moment. Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has been scheduled for next month and will hinge on China, which has fashioned itself as an intermediary with Mr. Kim.And after weeks of economic threats, American and Chinese officials have been making the 14-hour flights back and forth in an attempt to negotiate their way out of a looming trade war. Liu He, a top economic adviser to Mr. Xi, is expected to visit Washington this week to see if the two sides can make progress.Yet if ZTE\u2019s resuscitation reduces trade tensions, it also demonstrates the intractable nature of a deepening technological cold war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Though their electronics supply chains remain intertwined, neither country trusts the other with sensitive or core technology \u2014 an indication that a longer-term deal could prove elusive. China will not relent on industrial policy imperatives, such as Made in China 2025, aimed at building self-reliance. Similarly, American trust for Chinese companies is unlikely to grow.For now, however, Mr. Trump seemed to indicate his desire to walk back from that impasse.Asked about the president\u2019s tweet, a White House spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters, said that Mr. Trump expected that Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. would \u201cexercise his independent judgment, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, to resolve the regulatory action involving ZTE based on its facts.\u201dBut the about-face left many scratching their heads.The prospective shutdown of ZTE has been seen as major leverage in continuing trade discussions between China and the United States over Chinese trade practices. If Mr. Trump was announcing a huge concession with his tweet, it was without any indication of what he might have gotten in return.\u201cGiven his pressure on Beijing on trade, I don\u2019t understand his concern for Chinese jobs\u201d in the tweet, said Adam Segal, a technology and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. It \u201cgoes against the steady stream of security warnings about ZTE,\u201d he added.Last month the Commerce Department banned shipments of American technology to ZTE for seven years, saying that the company broke sanctions and then lied about carrying out the punishment. The department said on Sunday that it had no comment.The company had already agreed last year to a $1.2 billion fine in connection with those violations. But now, barred from using American microchips, software and other components, ZTE has been facing the prospect of being unable to manufacture its telecommunications equipment and smartphones.ZTE says it has business in more than 160 nations. Although large American wireless carriers do not use the company\u2019s telecommunications equipment out of security concerns, it is the No. 4 smartphone brand in the United States, behind Apple, Samsung and LG.The Commerce Department\u2019s action last month may well have caught some senior administration officials by surprise, said Paul Triolo, who focuses on technology policy for the Eurasia Group, an advisory firm. He previously held senior United States government positions that focused on China\u2019s technological prowess.\u201cThere was almost certainly disagreement within the administration about the costs and benefits of coming down hard on ZTE,\u201d he said, adding that the optics of the United States killing China\u2019s No. 2 telecommunications manufacturer would not have been good for broader trade and tech policy negotiations.ZTE\u2019s closing \u201chas whipped up a lot of techno-nationalist fervor already, at a delicate time in the relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wants to see iPhones getting smashed in the streets of major Chinese cities.\u201dThe president\u2019s tweet underscored his willingness to try to hammer out deals by offering unconventional or unrelated concessions that are ordinarily left to government negotiators working in more structured processes. But presidential intervention to rescue the Chinese company could also be seen as undercutting the Commerce Department\u2019s authority to enforce trade controls. It might, therefore, diminish the future effectiveness of such controls when applied to other companies.The possibility of a seven-year ban on using American technology had been written into ZTE\u2019s settlement with the department last year. Before the department activated the ban last month, the Chinese firm had acknowledged to the department that it had not, despite its statements to the contrary, fully disciplined employees involved in evading sanctions. But the company asked the department to postpone its response so an internal investigation could determine why management had failed to chastise the employees.\u201cGiving ZTE additional time to complete its internal investigation will not erase the company\u2019s most recent \u2014 in a series \u2014 of false statements to the U.S. Government,\u201d the Commerce Department\u2019s order last month said.Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that in expressing concerns about Chinese jobs, Mr. Trump was reiterating the case made by Beijing on ZTE\u2019s imminent collapse.\u201cJobs is the talking point,\u201d he said, adding that for Mr. Trump to write about Chinese jobs in the tweet, \u201cit must have just been part of the conversation, which would have come from the Chinese side.\u201dIn reality, ZTE represents much more to China than merely jobs. As a maker of the equipment that undergirds cellular networks, the company plays a crucial role in China\u2019s innovation drive and its push to influence technology outside its borders.Both ZTE and Huawei have been the subject of repeated security warnings by the American intelligence establishment. The two telecommunications equipment makers have a close relationship with China\u2019s government, and a 2012 report from Congress cautioned that allowing the companies to build out American cellular networks would be a threat to national security.Ana Swanson contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans Can\u2019t Even Cut Red Tape Correctly", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Republicans look at what they\u2019ve gotten out of their current moment of unified government, they can point to cutting corporate taxes, some judicial appointments and \u2026 not much else. Beyond that, they claim that they\u2019ve teed up the economy for explosive growth through the magic of \u201cderegulation.\u201d But deregulation is a term that should be banned from the nation\u2019s policy lexicon, mixing as it does equal parts wholesome and foul \u2014 in this administration, almost exclusively foul.The wholesome justification for deregulation arises when government uses its power in ways that gum up the dynamic power of markets. In the long run, our nation\u2019s wealth and the opportunity it provides for improving quality of life depend on the forces of creative destruction. In competitive, open markets, incumbent actors cannot prevent challenges from more nimble competitors, armed with new products or more efficient ways of organizing the production process.This process can be stifled when government acts in ways that stymie or distort competition. Our economy is, increasingly, plagued by these kinds of constraints. The growth of patent and copyright protection over the past few decades has made it harder for new companies to recombine existing technologies in new ways, thus shielding the entertainment industry, tech companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers from challenges. Byzantine regulation of housing construction at the local level has made the cost of living prohibitively expensive in many high-growth areas and blocked millions of workers from moving to high-paying jobs. The growth of company-specific tax subsidies (like those offered by places in competition for Amazon\u2019s HQ2) has shoveled resources toward large businesses that can effectively lobby for government largess.The list could go on, but the point is simple \u2014 in all these areas, there are huge opportunities for growth that are being hamstrung by rules that protect existing companies at the expense of new ones. A bonfire of regulations like this would be entirely wholesome for the American economy and also help to eat away at some of the hyper-inequality that is generated by these forms of crony capitalism.Unfortunately, this is not the kind of regulation that the Trump administration has been attacking. Instead, it has been sharpening its knives for precisely the kinds of regulation that, far from distorting markets, help to improve them. In particular, regulation is often necessary to a properly functioning market when, in its absence, businesses can make a profit by pushing costs onto others, in effect forcing others to subsidize their bottom line. In two areas, the environment and finance, these are exactly the sorts of market-improving regulation that the administration has put in its cross hairs, with the effect of increasing profits via freeloading.The classical justification for environmental regulation is that without properly designed rules, businesses do not have to pay the true costs of their economic activity (what economists call \u201cexternalities\u201d). If a company was making money by parking vehicles in all our driveways without paying, it would be obvious, and individuals would have a remedy in the form of trespass laws. But the costs that companies generate through pollution are widespread and hard to trace. Environmental regulations, by making companies absorb the costs they would otherwise impose on the rest of us, reduce market-distorting subsidies to polluters.Finance is another area where supposed deregulation can be a scheme for allowing a favored few to profit by pushing costs onto others. The challenge in financial regulation is to protect the public from market meltdowns while not also allowing businesses to take excessive risks with the knowledge that the government will pick up the tab if they fail. The Dodd-Frank legislation passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis has numerous flaws and shortcomings, but it did impose more stringent rules on the largest banks. The administration and its allies in Congress have proposed dramatically reducing the number of banks covered by these rules, without (as a large number of economists have recommended) creating other, more effective ways of reducing excessive risk-taking. The consequence of this species of deregulation is to move back toward the world of \u201cHeads I win, tails you lose\u201d that brought us the financial crisis in the first place.Even in the realm of market-improving regulation, there are still many rules that are misconceived or out of date and whose main effect is to protect today\u2019s economic winners from competitive challenge. In these areas, regulatory reform could do a lot of good. For instance, rather than just scrapping the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, as the Trump administration wants to do, we could replace it with a much less distortive and more effective alternative, like a broad-based carbon tax. Instead of just cutting Dodd-Frank rules on the largest banks, we could require that they increase their reliance on equity rather than debt, so that the costs of failure fall on investors rather than taxpayers.But there is a critical difference between areas where regulation\u2019s main effect is to protect incumbents and those where government is legitimately, if imperfectly, solving real problems of market failure. If Republicans are really serious about encouraging growth through pro-market policies, they should focus their red-tape-cutting zeal on the former, market-distorting kind of regulation \u2014 not on the rules needed to make markets function properly.Advertisement"}

The presence of Europeans here, not that much yet.\u201dNevertheless, the inroads made by Western businesses in the past three years are visible all along the clogged roads of the Iranian capital.Bosch, the German home appliances producer, wants Iranians to buy their dishwashers, enormous billboards show.

Two major oil companies, Total of France and Eni of Italy, are leaving development projects. The Danish shipping companies TORM and Maersk will no longer call on Iranian ports. An Italian steel maker, Danieli, which a year ago opened a big factory near Tehran, will have to sell its shares and pull out.But the decision is not so clear cut for numerous other companies, mostly European and Asian, that sell products that are not under sanctions \u2014 soft drinks, chocolate bars, clothes, medical equipment and medicine, for instance. Debenhams, the British department store, has franchises in Tehran, as does Adidas, the German sports apparel company. Peugeot and Renault of France sell cars here. Scania, the Swedish company, sells trucks and buses.Then there are European and Asian consultants in Tehran and the rest of the country advising Iranian companies: importers of skin-care products, chefs working in high-end restaurants, professional soccer players and companies that have entered into joint ventures with Iranian partners.The departure of the European and Asian companies undoubtedly will mean job losses for young Iranians. \u201cI have a staff of 11 supermotivated women,\u201d said one European executive who had built his office from scratch after his company returned to Iran in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see how quickly employees here learn and adapt,\u201d the executive said. \u201cNow, I have to let them all go. It physically hurts me to even think of that.\u201dLocal Iranian employers are feeling the effects, as well. \u201cWe lost 20 percent of our customers last week, and 60 percent have put their work in Iran temporarily on hold,\u201d said Ben Karami of I.C.A., an advertising company based in Tehran. His customers used to be Procter & Gamble, the global beauty company Coty and others. \u201cWe will lose a lot of expats and a lot of know-how,\u201d he added.\u201cMy employers, others where I was hoping to work, they might be leaving,\u201d said Sanaz, 31, who is with a consumer products company. \u201cPrices are high, most salaries \u2014 if you can find a job \u2014 low.\u201dSanaz said she had no plans to join any protests against Iran\u2019s leaders, as the Trump administration is hoping. \u201cI was in protests in 2009,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a painful experience. If everyone comes out, I\u2019ll join, but most probably I\u2019ll tolerate the situation.\u201dFew European diplomats and analysts believe the new sanctions on Iran will have the impact that Mr. Pompeo, for one, seems to be hoping. And Washington is largely insulated from much of the impact.\u201cThe Americans now want to destabilize Iran, but they won\u2019t live with the consequences. We will,\u201d said one European diplomat. He added that he doubted the sanctions would have much effect. But if they did destabilize the country, Europe would face the ramifications in migration and enhanced regional insecurity.For now, the diplomat said, most European embassies are telling their companies to take their time. \u201cWe are telling them not to make any rash decisions and keep their business in place,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, of course, they make their own decisions.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Negotiations in Italy Push Euro to Fore, the Last Place Europe Wants It", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLISBON \u2014 Through more than two months of tough negotiations to form a government in Italy after inconclusive March elections, global financial markets remained relatively calm. Italy\u2019s uncertainties seemed contained to Italy, and Europe\u2019s economy kept growing.That changed this week when Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, effectively blocked two populist parties from forming a government. He judged that a crucial member of their proposed cabinet was intent on having Italy abandon the euro, though they had not explicitly campaigned on that issue.For the European Union, another Italian election would be terrifically bad timing.After all, it was Brussels that warned Greece in 2011 that a proposed referendum on its bailout and the euro would actually be a referendum on membership in the European Union itself. That was enough to cause Greece to back down. It did so again four years later.But the common currency is not without its problems. The European Union plunged into the euro without having either the economic institutions to fully manage it or full political integration. Member states gave up their authority over monetary policy, often to deleterious effect at home.Today, not only will the issue of sovereignty not go away, it keeps roaring back with a vengeance, just when populism in Europe\u2019s core countries seemed to have been kept at bay.After the shock of Britain\u2019s vote in 2016 to leave the European Union, the bloc seemed unexpectedly steady. Italy had a pro-Europe government for several years. Spain and Portugal were growing again. France\u2019s anti-Europe presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, was defeated. Even the populist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in Greece was grudgingly holding the line on spending in order to stay in the eurozone.But the turmoil in Italy makes clear that anti-European populism has not gone away, and that the euro is in the cross hairs.Mr. Mattarella has turned to a former International Monetary Fund official to be a caretaker prime minister and form a government. But even he seemed to have hit a wall late Tuesday evening, making the prospect of another election \u2014 as early as July or September \u2014 more likely.Matteo Salvini, the fiery leader of the League, the populist party that is strong in Italy\u2019s north, has made opposition to Brussels, and occasionally the euro, a standard in his campaign speeches.His putative coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the populist Five Star Movement, has been sharply critical of Brussels, but has lately rejected a referendum on the euro, despite having previously floated the idea.Mr. Mattarella, moderate and pro-Europe, was clearly skeptical of their intentions, and he vetoed Mr. Salvini\u2019s pick of an economy minister with openly anti-euro views, in the name of economic stability.In doing so, Mr. Mattarella has given Italians, exceptionally, the same option built into the French election system \u2014 two rounds of voting \u2014 the first to vote your heart, and the second to vote your head. In France, Ms. Le Pen did well in the first round of presidential voting last year; she was soundly defeated in the final round.Mr. Mattarella is gambling that Italians may do the same, if the populist parties can be made to surrender their ambiguity on the euro \u2014 an issue they skirted through the Italian campaign.The risks of leaving the euro have always been a reason Italy has stayed in. But the country has not done well with the euro, by some measures, and so the question now is whether a public frustrated by two decades of stagnation is ready to take a gamble of its own and bolt.As demonstrated by the Brexit vote, which numerous analyses showed would not be good for Britain\u2019s health, economic logic does not always prevail.Like Ms. Le Pen, Mr. Salvini may discover after a public debate that despite anger at Brussels over migration and the problems of the euro, Italians, like the French and the Greeks, are afraid to leave it.Many analysts believe that Mr. Salvini, whose League has risen in the polls, will do well in a future election, and some think he sabotaged this coalition government to get to new elections.He is expected to use Mr. Mattarella\u2019s attempted appointment of a technocratic \u2014 if temporary \u2014 prime minister to reinforce the League\u2019s anti-elitist message and portray himself as standing up against anti-democratic forces beholden to Brussels, Berlin and the bankers.The euro may have originally been a project of the political elite, and it may indeed benefit Germany, but the consequences of leaving it would be big. Those would be likely to include a devalued Italian currency that would savage Italian savings accounts overnight and increase the country\u2019s already large burden of debt.That is one reason Mr. Mattarella argued that any decision to leave the euro should come only after a major public debate, not by stealth.Then there is the potential damage to the European Union itself. The bloc has moved since the Greek crisis to create backstops for the euro, so the currency would almost surely survive an Italian exit and manage the economic contagion. But the damage to the idea of Europe would be severe.Italy\u2019s confusion about its political and economic future \u2014 and its already large stock of nonperforming loans \u2014 are more reasons Germany will continue to refuse to mutualize eurozone debt and provide bank deposit guarantees across the eurozone.As Holger Schmieding, chief economist of Berenberg, an investment bank, points out, \u201cSize matters.\u201d Italy today accounts for 15.4 percent of the eurozone\u2019s gross domestic product and 23.4 percent of the bloc\u2019s public debt.By comparison, he said, at the start of the Greek crisis in 2009, Greece contributed only 2.6 percent of the eurozone\u2019s gross domestic product and today accounts for only 3.3 percent of eurozone public debt.Italy\u2019s cumulative debt is more than 130 percent of gross domestic product, more than twice the eurozone\u2019s requirements, and it is denominated in euros. Having to repay that debt in a devalued currency would be a major struggle and would badly harm Italian savers and investors, who hold most of it.The Italian crisis also has other implications, said Ian Lesser, vice president for foreign policy at the German Marshall Fund and head of its Brussels office.\u201cThe political debate in Italy has taken on an increasingly critical tone toward Germany, speaking directly to Italian anxiety over German power in Europe,\u201d Mr. Lesser noted. That anxiety is shared widely, not just in Greece but in other populist-run states like Hungary and Poland.And a prospective populist government \u201cis not only deeply anti-E.U. but with a lot of sympathy toward Russia and without traditional Atlanticist instincts,\u201d Mr. Lesser said.Italy is a key member of NATO and has important naval and air bases for Middle East operations. \u201cIt threatens key elements of continuity in Italian politics, in both the European and trans-Atlantic sphere,\u201d Mr. Lesser said.European Union arrogance could also play an important political role.On Tuesday, the European Commissioner for the budget, G\u00fcnther H. Oettinger, a German, told the broadcaster Deutsche Welle that the markets and a \u201cdarkened outlook\u201d would teach the Italians to vote for the right thing.They may yet do so, but it\u2019s impolitic to say so, especially for a Brussels-based German.One of the first to point out the offense was Mr. Di Maio himself, who in his own message on Twitter called the remark \u201cabsurd.\u201d\u201cThese people treat Italy like a summer colony where they come to vacation,\u201d Mr. Di Maio wrote. \u201cBut in a few months a government of change will be born and Europe will finally respect us.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. It took place in 2016, not last year.Jason Horowitz contributed reporting from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Businesses Race to Washington to Sway Trump on China Tariffs", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Mary Buchzeiger describes herself as a proud Republican who was drawn to President Trump\u2019s business-friendly philosophy. But the president\u2019s plan to impose sweeping tariffs on $50 billion of products from China now threatens to cripple an automotive supply business in Michigan that her father began and that she has spent years building.\u201cI\u2019m angry, I\u2019m frustrated, and honestly, I\u2019m scared,\u201d Ms. Buchzeiger said on Tuesday morning, as she joined dozens of other vulnerable entrepreneurs, as well as supporters of the Trump administration\u2019s trade agenda, at a public hearing about the tariffs. \u201cScared that my president is about to make a terrible mistake.\u201dThe hearings come at a moment of brinkmanship and negotiation, with the world\u2019s two largest economies repeatedly veering toward a trade war only to reverse course and edge instead toward diplomatic discussions.The economic relationship now hinges on trade talks happening this week between top Trump administration officials and Liu He, a Chinese vice premier who arrived in Washington on Tuesday. Chinese negotiators and global businesses remain uncertain about whether the United States will move ahead with its plan to impose hefty tariffs and investment restrictions on China in an effort to pressure economic reforms \u2014 or whether Mr. Trump will seek to avoid a damaging trade war by cutting a quick deal.Mr. Trump appeared to soften his stance on China in a series of tweets this week, as he emphasized his friendship with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and said the United States would consider easing penalties on ZTE, a Chinese telecom firm. In a tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said \u201ctrade negotiations are continuing with China\u201d and to \u201cstay tuned!\u201d\u201cI think the time is right for China to make changes they should have been making for the past 15 to 20 years,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, said at an event in Washington on Tuesday morning.The array of companies testifying in a hushed hearing room in Washington on Tuesday included TV makers, auto parts suppliers, steel companies and retailers. Some commended the planned 25 percent tariffs on Chinese imports and others blasted them, but all agreed on the potential for the Trump administration\u2019s actions to irrevocably alter the course of their businesses.Those testifying on Tuesday morning included executives from the solar cell and module manufacturer SolarWorld Americas, the wind turbine maker American Superconductor Corporation and the United States Steel Corporation, all companies that say they have had intellectual property stolen by Chinese actors and have assisted in the Trump administration\u2019s investigation into unfair Chinese trade practices. In March, the United States trade representative determined that the Chinese had violated American intellectual property, a finding that gave Mr. Trump the authority to impose tariffs and other restrictions.Many business owners pleaded with the administration to be even tougher on China and help protect their businesses against foreign competition. Cory Watkins, the president of Schumacher Electric, which manufactures car battery chargers and jump starters primarily in North America, asked the administration to include more of the company\u2019s finished products in the tariff list.Mr. Watkins said the company had learned in the last few weeks that one of its biggest customers had signed a contract with a Chinese manufacturer that Schumacher Electric has sued for stealing its intellectual property. Without the tariff protections, Mr. Watkins said, \u201cwe still run the risk of the very problem we\u2019re facing today, which is Chinese companies taking our intellectual property, copying it and selling it to our own customers.\u201dCompanies caught in the tariffs cross-fire, like the electronics retailer Best Buy and the TV streaming device maker Roku, protested that they would face higher prices to import products from China and that those costs would ultimately be passed on to American consumers. Michelle Erickson Jones, a Montana farmer and a member of the trade lobbying group Farmers for Free Trade, complained that trade tensions were already costing American farmers, who were facing canceled orders of soybeans and wine and seeing perishable shipments held up in Chinese ports.Representatives from Chinese business groups argued that the proposed tariffs were arbitrary, were inconsistent with World Trade Organization rules and put millions of American jobs tied to trade with China at risk. \u201cShould the U.S. implement the proposed action, it will lead to nothing but confrontation between the two countries,\u201d said Jian Tan, a representative of the China Chamber of International Commerce.The Trump administration has said it devised its tariff list to remove goods that were vital to American consumers. But in the process, many economists say, the administration ended up targeting the imported parts and machinery that businesses depend on to run American-based operations.Ms. Buchzeiger\u2019s company, Lucerne International, used to source more products from within the United States. But when the financial crisis hit, her American suppliers started to fold, and the company had to look abroad. The company supplies 28 parts for the Jeep Wrangler, which Lucerne sources from seven manufacturing facilities in China, she said.With tariffs looming, Ms. Buchzeiger, who expanded the company from six employees in 2008 to nearly 50 today, has frozen hiring and set aside plans to find new engineers. She estimates the tariffs would cost her company $7.5 million of its nearly $40 million in annual sales and put her out of business in less than three months.\u201cI would be shipping money with the parts to my customers every day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I ship hundreds of thousands of parts a week.\u201dMs. Buchzeiger fully supports the idea of bringing manufacturing back to the United States, and has a long-term plan to set up a manufacturing plant in Flint, Mich., where she was born. But \u201cit takes millions of dollars of investment to open up a plant, and it takes time,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t react in less than three weeks to some arbitrary tariffs that are slapped on our products. And being able to move production of 7.8 million parts overnight, that\u2019s not possible.\u201dInstead, she said, putting tariffs on Chinese products would simply force her to look for suppliers in other low-cost countries, including Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. \u201cThe only thing it\u2019s going to do is move business out of Michigan to another country,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Monopsony, Rigidity, and the Wage Puzzle (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistIn the past I\u2019ve used the ECINEQ talk to discuss issues involving inequality and macroeconomic performance, both vulnerability to crises and long-term growth. Both areas are still very much unresolved; but I\u2019m not sure I have anything new to say. So I thought I\u2019d do something different, and focus on an issue some very smart economists have been worrying at: the puzzle of continuing wage stagnation despite very low unemployment.An aside: the way this discussion is taking place marks a kind of new frontier in the mechanics of scientific communication \u2013 and, I think, an unfortunate one. Once upon a time economic debate took place in the pages of refereed journals, but that stopped being true at least 30 years ago, with working papers becoming the principal means of communication. Even that turned out to be too slow in the face of rapid change; so during the crisis years, say from 2008-2013, a lot of discussion and debate moved to blogs, which I\u2019d say worked very well. In retrospect, the debates we all had over leverage, monetary policy, fiscal policy and more were really classic \u2013 the 21st-century equivalent of, say, Keynes vs. Ohlin on trade balances and relative prices.I guess I\u2019m doing some of that here, but we need clear statements by the principals.OK, complaints registered. What I want to do now is, first, describe the wage puzzle; then describe the resulting debate, which is largely over how much if any slack remains in the labor market; then lay out a story which combines the issue of downward nominal wage rigidity \u2013 which has been discussed fairly extensively \u2013 with the role of monopsony power in labor markets, which I don\u2019t think has been integrated into this debate, but should be.After the crisis, wage growth dropped \u2013 but only about as much as it dropped in the early 2000s slump, despite much higher unemployment. And it has increased only modestly since then, to levels well below pre-crisis growth, despite unemployment rates as low as we\u2019ve seen in a very long time:It\u2019s a puzzle. But why does the explanation matter? Basically, we\u2019re trying to assess the current state of the U.S. economy, which has lots of implications for monetary and fiscal policy. The unemployment rate, plus some other indicators I\u2019ll get to shortly, suggest an economy pretty much at full employment. But sluggish wage growth could indicate that there\u2019s still substantial slack in the labor market. Which is it?EPOP is indeed still significantly below its pre-crisis level. But it has been a decade since the crisis \u2013 and that\u2019s enough time to worry about secular trends in labor force participation. In particular, there\u2019s been a long-run trend toward fewer prime-age men working, and it\u2019s not at all clear that we\u2019re currently below that trend.Two other pieces of data also cast doubt on the unmeasured-slack hypothesis. One, shown in Figure 4, is the quits rate \u2013 the fraction of workers quitting their jobs each month:Quits rates vary with the state of the labor market: workers are more willing to quit if they feel sure of finding another job. And quits are back up to pre-crisis levels, suggesting that the labor market really is tight.All in all, I think I come down on Jason Furman\u2019s side here \u2013 not with 100% certainty, to be sure, but this really shows most of the signatures of a full-employment economy.But in that case, why aren\u2019t wages surging?Figure 7 illustrates the position of such a firm. Marginal revenue product is the value to the firm of an additional worker. The supply of labor to that firm is upward sloping: From its point of view, to attract more workers the firm needs to raise wages. But if it does that it will have to pay more to the workers it would have had anyway, so the marginal cost of an additional worker to the firm is higher than that worker\u2019s wage.But here\u2019s the thing: during the years of high unemployment, firms faced both reduced demand \u2013 lower marginal revenue product \u2013 and increased supply of labor, from workers desperate for jobs. This \u201cshould\u201d have allowed them to cut wages \u2013 but for the most part they couldn\u2019t, because wage cuts have lots of adverse side effects.So for a while the usual complaints about the supply and/or quality of workers were in abeyance. Given the wages firms were still offering, willing workers were abundant.But now demand has recovered, unemployment is low, and normality has been restored. Once again, firms are complaining that they can\u2019t find workers without raising wages \u2013 which is the normal state of affairs.It\u2019s true that the complaints seem even louder than in previous business cycle peaks. But I can offer a couple of reasons.One is simply that it has been a long time since labor markets were tight. Most HR managers, I would guess, don\u2019t remember what a full employment economy is like. They find the idea that there aren\u2019t tons of highly qualified workers lined up for every job opening shocking \u2013 and, inevitably, blame the workers.Either way, I\u2019d argue that the combination of downward nominal wage rigidity and monopsony power helps explain both why wages didn\u2019t fall during the period of high unemployment and why employers aren\u2019t doing much to raise wages despite tight labor markets now.The bottom line here is that I reluctantly find myself on the no slack side of this debate. I think the U.S. really is more or less at full employment.But do I think the Fed is right to be raising rates, and that we should start being worried about fiscal deficits? Actually, no, for two reasons.First, I might be wrong. And the costs of tightening when the economy still has room to grow are much bigger than those of waiting and discovering that we\u2019ve overshot a bit.Second, everything we\u2019ve learned since a 2% inflation target became orthodoxy suggests that the target was too low. The effective lower bound on interest rates is a much bigger threat than we realized, and the problem of downward wage rigidity is a bigger deal too. So if inflation crept up from 2 to 3 or even 4, that would actually be a good thing.So while I am not convinced that we have a lot of labor market slack, I actually favor policies that act as if we did. Hey, nobody except fools said economic policy was easy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Trump\u2019s Termination of Iran Deal Is a Risky Bet", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 For President Trump and two of the allies he values most \u2014 Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 the problem of the Iranian nuclear accord was not, primarily, about nuclear weapons. It was that the deal legitimized and normalized Iran\u2019s clerical government, reopening it to the world economy with oil revenue that financed its adventures in Syria and Iraq, its missile program and its support of terrorist groups.Now, by announcing on Tuesday that he is exiting the nuclear deal and will reimpose economic sanctions on Iran and companies around the world that do business with the country, Mr. Trump is engaged in a grand, highly risky experiment.Mr. Trump and his Middle East allies are betting they can cut Iran\u2019s economic lifeline and thus \u201cbreak the regime,\u201d as one senior European official described the effort. In theory, America\u2019s withdrawal could free Iran to produce as much nuclear material as it wants \u2014 as it was doing five years ago, when the world feared that it was headed toward a bomb.But Mr. Trump\u2019s team dismisses that risk: Iran does not have the economic strength to confront the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia. And Iran knows that any move to produce a weapon would only provide Israel and the United States with a rationale for taking military action.It is a brutally realpolitik approach that America\u2019s allies in Europe have warned is a historic mistake, one that could lead to confrontation, and perhaps to war.And it is a clear example of Middle East brinkmanship that runs counter to what President Barack Obama intended when the nuclear deal was struck in July 2015.Mr. Obama\u2019s gamble in that deal \u2014 the signature foreign policy accord of his eight years in office \u2014 was straightforward. He regarded Iran as potentially a more natural ally of the United States than many of its Sunni-dominant neighbors, with a young, educated Western-oriented population that is tired of being ruled by an aging theocracy.By taking the prospect of nuclear weapons off the table, the Obama administration had argued, the United States and Iran could chip away at three decades of hostility and work on common projects, starting with the defeat of the Islamic State.It did not turn out that way. While the deal succeeded in getting 97 percent of Iran\u2019s nuclear material out of the country, Iran\u2019s conservatives and its military recoiled at the idea of cooperating on any projects with the West.Months before it became clear that Mr. Trump had a decent shot at being elected, the Iranian military increased support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; it expanded its influence in Iraq and accelerated its support for terrorist groups. And it doubled down on deploying cyberattacks against targets in the West and in Saudi Arabia, embracing a weapon that was not covered by the nuclear accord.Then came Mr. Trump, with his declaration that the deal was a \u201cdisaster\u201d and his vow to dismantle it. That is exactly what he has now done, but at a huge cost.Moments after he delivered his statement \u2014 in which he made it sound as if Iran was cheating on the accord, even though his intelligence chiefs have testified otherwise \u2014 Mr. Trump received a stinging rebuke from Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.The three leaders, America\u2019s closest European allies, essentially rejected his logic. They noted that the United Nations Security Council resolution that embraced the Iran deal in 2016 \u201cremains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear program.\u201dThat was polite diplomatic language for the stark conclusion that it is the United States \u2014 not Iran \u2014 that first violated the accord.And now, suddenly, the world may well be headed back to where it was in 2012: on a road to uncertain confrontation, with \u201cvery little evidence of a Plan B,\u201d as Boris Johnson, the British foreign minister, said on a visit to Washington.Exiting the deal, with or without a plan, is fine with the Saudis. They see the accord as a dangerous distraction from the real problem of confronting Iran around the region \u2014 a problem that Saudi Arabia believes will be solved only by leadership change in Iran.The Saudis have an ally in John R. Bolton, the president\u2019s new national security adviser, who had made clear before taking office that he shared their view. Mr. Obama\u2019s deal, Mr. Bolton said on Tuesday afternoon, featured \u201can utterly inadequate treatment of the military dimension of Iran\u2019s aspirations.\u201dThe Saudi case against Iran has been bolstered in recent months by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has repeatedly referred to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as \u201cthe new Hitler.\u201d\u201cMany countries around the world and in Europe did not realize how dangerous Hitler was until what happened, happened,\u201d Prince Mohammed said in a recent interview with the CBS News program \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the same events happening in the Middle East.\u201dIn a speech in March at the Brookings Institution, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, asserted that Iran was \u201cthe biggest problem we face in our region.\u201d He blamed Iran for interfering in neighboring countries, backing allied armed groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, and supplying Yemeni rebels with ballistic missiles they fired at his country.Even if its restrictions on nuclear weapons were tightened and extended, \u201cthe agreement by itself does not solve the problem of Iran,\u201d Mr. Jubeir said. \u201cIran must be held accountable.\u201dJeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a State Department official during the Obama administration, argued that the nuclear deal\u2019s opposition from Saudi Arabia, Israel and other regional players was primarily about its effects on American politics and policy.\u201cThey believe they are in this existential conflict with the Iranian regime, and nuclear weapons are a small part of that conflict\u201d \u2014 but the one that most influences public opinion in the United States, Mr. Shapiro said.\u201cIf the deal opened an avenue for better relations between the United States and Iran, that would be a disaster for the Saudis,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to ensure a motivation for American pressure against Iran that will last even after this administration.\u201dIsrael is a more complicated case.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed Mr. Trump to abandon an arrangement that the Israeli leader has always detested. But Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s own military and intelligence advisers say Israel is far safer with an Iran whose pathway to a bomb is blocked, rather than one that is once again pursuing the ultimate weapon.\u201cThe individuals who shoulder responsibility for Israel\u2019s survival and security have been crystal clear,\u201d Graham Allison, a Harvard professor who has spent his career examining cases of nuclear proliferation.But Mr. Netanyahu holds Israel\u2019s bullhorn, and he used it last week to persuade Mr. Trump to pull the plug on the Iran deal. By releasing Iranian documents, stolen from Tehran in January, Mr. Netanyahu proved what Western intelligence agencies long knew: A decade ago or even longer, the Iranians were working hard to design a nuclear warhead.To Mr. Netanyahu, this was proof that Iran could never be trusted and that it had reached the nuclear deal under false pretenses by pretending it never had a weapons program. To Mr. Trump and his allies, the Israeli discovery said less about Iranian nuclear capability than it did about Iranian perfidy.Given evidence that Iran was preserving its bomb designs as a hedge for the future, the discovery suggested it has not given up its ambitions. As Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator, put it, someone needed to address the Israeli discovery \u201clest they give the Iranians the ability to pick up quickly where they left off on weaponizing.\u201dStill, at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement on Tuesday is a conviction that Mr. Obama made a critical mistake in agreeing to a deal that contains an expiration date. Mr. Trump\u2019s argument is that Iran can never be allowed to accumulate enough material to assemble a bomb.So when the Europeans said that would require reopening the negotiations, Mr. Trump balked, and decided instead to scrap the entire deal.It was a classic Trumpian move, akin to the days when he would knock down New York buildings to make way for visions of grander, more glorious edifices. But in this case, it is about upsetting a global power balance and weakening a government that Mr. Trump has argued, since he began campaigning, must go.An earlier version of a caption with this article misstated the day on which it was taken.

{"Headline": "The Entire Economy Is MoviePass Now. Enjoy It While You Can.", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIt\u2019s called the 75 Cent Dollar Store. We\u2019re going to sell dollar bills for 75 cents \u2014 no service charges, no hidden fees, just crisp $1 bills for the price of three quarters. It\u2019ll be huge.You\u2019re probably thinking: Wait, won\u2019t your store go out of business? Nope. I\u2019ve got that part figured out, too. The plan is to get tons of people addicted to buying 75-cent dollars so that, in a year or two, we can jack up the price to $1.50 or $2 without losing any customers. Or maybe we\u2019ll get so big that the Treasury Department will start selling us dollar bills at a discount. We could also collect data about our customers and sell it to the highest bidder. Honestly, we\u2019ve got plenty of options.If you\u2019re still skeptical, I don\u2019t blame you. It used to be that in order to survive, businesses had to sell goods or services above cost. But that model is so 20th century. The new way to make it in business is to spend big, grow fast and use Kilimanjaro-size piles of investor cash to subsidize your losses, with a plan to become profitable somewhere down the road.\u201cThe fact that Google and Facebook were able to generate such enormous profits and growth does give hope to some companies,\u201d Mr. Ritter said. If start-ups can figure out to convert a large user base into paying customers, he added, \u201cit can be enormously profitable.\u201dBut investors aren\u2019t convinced. Shares of MoviePass\u2019s parent company, Helios and Matheson Analytics, have fallen more than 90 percent since October, and the company recently reported that it has been burning through its cash reserves, spending an average of $21.7 million per month with just $15.5 million left in the bank at the end of April. On Tuesday, Helios reported that MoviePass lost $98.3 million in the first quarter, despite adding more than a million net subscribers.Mitch Lowe, the chief executive of MoviePass, told me in a phone interview this week that the company\u2019s financial troubles have been exaggerated. The company has access to a $300 million equity line of credit that will keep it solvent, he said, and blamed the company\u2019s competitors, such as large theater chains, for sowing the seeds of doubt.\u201cThey smell blood in the water, so they\u2019re spreading rumors and hypotheses,\u201d he said.Ultimately, companies like MoviePass illustrate the perilous tightrope many growing businesses must walk. Spend too little on acquiring new customers and drawing business away from your competitors, and you won\u2019t make it off the ground. Give too many freebies away, and you risk running out of cash before you\u2019re big enough to cash in.\u201cPricing can be strategic,\u201d said Kara Nortman, a partner at Upfront Ventures, which invests in technology companies. \u201cIf you can attract a lot of consumers to your product or service, it gives you a lot more power with incumbents who are limiting your growth.\u201dThe king of money-losers, of course, is Amazon, which went years without turning a profit. Instead, it plowed billions of dollars back into its business, building out its e-commerce infrastructure and jump-starting side efforts like Amazon Web Services and Amazon Prime Video. Those years of investments paid off, and Amazon is now the second most valuable company in the world, with $1.6 billion in profit last quarter alone.An economy full of unprofitable companies has risks, of course. Along with the danger of investor wipeouts \u2014 which are unavoidable in early stage investing \u2014 customers of these companies have come to expect a kind of whiplash that can involve sudden price hikes, disappearing benefits, and useless subscriptions and meaningless warranties. It\u2019s also difficult for small businesses without access to huge amounts of capital to compete with the Googles and Amazons of the world, which further distorts economic growth in favor of corporations that can afford to spend billions of dollars undercutting the competition.For consumers who are willing to do their research, though, this can be a golden age of deals. We can get our \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d tickets and pecan-crusted salmon meal kits, reaping the benefits of artificially cheap goods and services while investors soak up the losses. The current crop of money-losing companies may not survive forever, but as long as someone is willing to keep funding these types of gambles, there\u2019s no reason to stop enjoying the fruits of their optimism.So, back to the 75 Cent Dollar Store.

{"Headline": "Trump Initiates Trade Inquiry That Could Lead to Tariffs on Foreign Cars", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has asked for a sweeping trade investigation into whether autos imported into the United States pose a threat to national security, a move that could ultimately result in tariffs on foreign-made cars and further strain relations with global allies.In a statement released Wednesday evening, the Commerce Department said it had begun an investigation \u201cfollowing a conversation\u201d with Mr. Trump. The announcement followed a statement from the president, in which he said he had instructed the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, to investigate imports of cars, trucks and auto parts \u201cto determine their effects on America\u2019s national security.\u201d\u201cCore industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a nation,\u201d Mr. Trump said.In a separate announcement, the Commerce Department said that imports of passenger vehicles had grown from under a third of cars sold in the United States 20 years ago to nearly half today, while employment in the sector had declined. Automobile manufacturing has long been a source of technological innovation in the United States, and the investigation would consider whether the decline of the auto industry threatens to weaken the American economy by reducing research and development in cutting-edge technologies, the statement said.\u201cThere is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry,\u201d Mr. Ross said.Reaction from American trading partners was largely muted after the announcement of the investigation. But one senior European Union official voiced confusion and frustration over the move.\u201cIt would be very difficult to imagine\u201d how automotive imports to the United States \u201ccreate any sort of threat to the national security,\u201d Jyrki Katainen, a European Commission vice president, said at a news conference in Brussels on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to understand, but we have just now read what has been said, and there is a long journey to the practice.\u201dIn remarks Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump appeared to link the new trade investigation with continuing talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Those negotiations have largely stalled over auto rules, including how much of a car\u2019s content must be manufactured in North America \u2014 and in the United States \u2014 to qualify for Nafta\u2019s zero tariffs.The Trump administration has tried to use the steel and aluminum tariffs as a bargaining chip to persuade other countries to voluntarily restrain their metal shipments to the United States or make other trade concessions. The administration may be looking to use the auto tariffs similarly, as leverage to force concessions from trading partners like Canada and Mexico.\u201cI think your autoworkers and your auto companies in this country are going to be very happy with what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d the president said on Wednesday afternoon as he prepared to board Marine One. \u201cNafta is very difficult. Mexico has been very difficult to deal with. Canada has been very difficult to deal with. They have been taking advantage of the United States for a long time. I am not happy with their requests. But I will tell you, in the end, we win.\u201d\u201cOur autoworkers are going to be extremely happy,\u201d he added.In a Twitter post Wednesday morning, the president also hinted at the pending announcement.But the proposal drew what appeared to be a swift backlash from the car industry. Some auto industry representatives said they worried that the plan could raise prices for cars and trucks in the United States, and end up leading to a less competitive American industry and fewer choices for American consumers.\u201cIf these reports are true, it\u2019s a bad day for American consumers,\u201d said John Bozzella, the chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group. \u201cTo our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection.\u201dThe Trump administration has already deemed imports of steel and aluminum a threat to national security, saying foreign metals are degrading the United States\u2019 manufacturing base. It is also considering tariffs on as much as $150 billion of Chinese imports as retaliation for China\u2019s forced coercion of American intellectual property, which the administration has also declared a threat to national security.Trade experts said a finding by the administration that imported autos pose a national security threat would most likely prompt legal challenges at the World Trade Organization. The European Union, Japan and other allies are already challenging the Trump administration\u2019s claim that imports of steel and aluminum put American national security at risk. Extending that argument to automobiles would probably be met with even greater skepticism.Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, pointed out that 98 percent of American imports of passenger cars last year came from five American allies: Mexico, Canada, the European Union, Japan and South Korea.\u201cThis is not about national security,\u201d Mr. Bown said. \u201cAfter the steel and aluminum high, President Trump has now become addicted to tariffs. He is now clearly abusing this national security law simply to get his tariff fix. And this law is the easiest access he has found.\u201dMr. Trump has made the auto industry a major focus of his economic policy, seeing carmakers as an example of an American sector weakened by global offshoring.Many inside and outside the auto industry say the administration\u2019s approach could backfire by raising prices for American-made products, potentially slowing sales and encouraging more companies to move abroad.Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, criticized the idea as \u201can unusually ill-conceived trade move.\u201d\u201cIt seems to imagine a world in which each country produces its own automobiles and then they swap them back and forth. In fact, we live in a world in which viable auto companies are heavily involved in global supply chains,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would harm U.S. consumers at the margin, while undermining the global trading system and inviting certain retaliation.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He takes one four-week and one two-week vacation every year. He has only a high school degree. A two-year apprenticeship gave him the tools he needed to open his own business.His son graduated from high school a few years ago. He immediately went to work for his father, and by the fourth year there was earning $40,000 a year. His cumulative earnings for those four years were roughly $90,000. Had he attended a four-year college, it would have cost his father somewhere in the neighborhood of $60,000 to $200,000. Instead, his son has money in the bank and is supporting himself instead of owing payments on student loans that could drag him down forever.His father has insisted that he go to a community college to take courses in accounting and marketing that will be helpful when he takes over running the business.It is unlikely that anything that happens with the economy will affect him, and the same could be said for electricians. Perhaps of greatest importance is that the individuals I have known in these trades really enjoy what they are doing, fixing things.To the Editor:Ellen Ruppel Shell\u2019s commentary on the value of higher education is not supported by evidence or experience.Second, the economic and social returns of higher education are clear. Ms. Ruppel Shell points out that 25 percent of college graduates do not enjoy an earnings premium over high school graduates, which means that fully three-quarters of college graduates do enjoy such a premium. Additionally, there is a wealth of data showing that people with education after high school have better health outcomes and greater life expectancy, and are more likely to be active and engaged citizens.Americans are concerned about college access and cost, but they overwhelmingly believe in its value. We owe this nation a better dialogue than one that emphasizes the value of higher education for our own children and questions it for other people\u2019s children.ALLAN GOLSTON, SEATTLEThe writer is president of the U.S. Program for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.To the Editor:Ellen Ruppel Shell reveals an important finding \u2014 that college is more valuable in terms of increased income for those who come from higher income families than for those who come from lower income families. But in her zeal to play down the value of college for those lower income students, she abuses the statistics on which she relies, by suggesting that college has little to no economic value for students from lower income families.Factor in the increased job satisfaction, better working conditions and superior health benefits that likely come with the college grad\u2019s job, and the suggestion that \u201ccollege may not be worth it\u201d is misleading and irresponsible.RICHIE FEDER, PHILADELPHIATo the Editor:Is Ellen Ruppel Shell ever right! I believe that American college education takes far too long and is absurdly expensive, a burden to almost all except its richest participants. As the British have long known, three years is quite long enough for any B.A. or B.S. degree.Our colleges are stuffed with excessive facilities, athletics and administrators. Some of these programs are supposedly in aid of the neediest, but in effect drive tuition ever higher.COLIN EISLER, NEW YORKThe writer is a professor of fine art at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University.To the Editor:Ellen Ruppel Shell\u2019s attack on the value of a college education makes about as much sense as asserting that because some people will die of cancer it\u2019s not worth attempting to treat all patients or to research a cure.Is American higher education perfect? Certainly not. Do we need to find ways to ensure that more Americans from all walks of life, and particularly low-income students, not only attend college in the first place but also complete their degree in a timely manner and with a minimum amount of debt? You bet. But an essay that concludes that it\u2019s not in the best interest of some Americans to gain a college education, even as the author admits she wants her own children to do so, is dangerously misleading.If anything, Mr. Leonhardt\u2019s column reminds us that all of us \u2014 especially colleges and universities \u2014 need to redouble our efforts. But we should not, as Ms. Ruppel Shell suggests, give up.TED MITCHELL, WASHINGTONThe writer is president of the American Council on Education.To the Editor:Instead of discouraging students from going to college, I would encourage them to enroll in their local community college. They are places where students can get an excellent education, not amass crippling debt, and either complete two years of postsecondary education in a field that leads directly to work or complete the first two years of a bachelor\u2019s degree before transferring.Clearly students can make better choices about where they spend their very valuable student aid. As for the rest of us, we should ask ourselves why college-educated students born poor make only slightly more than high school graduates from the middle class.

What can Americans expect in these uncertain times?We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d when a reporter asked Mr. Trump on Tuesday whether he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to arrange peace talks between North and South Korea.\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens, I often say,\u201d the president said a day earlier about relations with North Korea, apparently aware of his tendency to take an indefinite view on timely negotiations.\u201cSo the end result is, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week, again broaching the summit meeting with North Korea.At least two dozen times in the past month, the president appears to have shifted into full-on verbal tic mode, deploying some variation of \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d as a cast of world leaders from France, the Baltic States, Japan and Nigeria rotated in and out of the White House or his Florida estate. Mr. Trump\u2019s one-person guessing game came into play as he addressed topics including Mexico, Nafta, Russia, Amazon, North Korea, Mike Pompeo, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, Iran and the special counsel\u2019s investigation into his presidential campaign.Republican and Democratic speechwriters and others who study the president\u2019s speech patterns say \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d may be a way to signal a veiled threat to unpredictable adversaries, like the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, amid delicate negotiations. But many who watch closely say Mr. Trump is using the phrase to avoid accountability.\u201cThe occasions in which he\u2019s made specific promises, like \u2018we\u2019ll build a wall and Mexico would pay for it,\u2019 he has had trouble delivering,\u201d Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cInstead of forecasting and being accountable for the forecast, he\u2019s opening the possibility that there are a range of possibilities not anticipated for which he does not want to be held accountable.\u201d\u201cThe more people heard it, the less effective it became,\u201d one of Mr. Obama\u2019s speechwriters, David Litt, said in an interview, \u201cwhich is one reason there were fewer \u2018Let me be clears\u2019 in the second term.\u201dMr. Trump is different from other presidents because he seems to enjoy speaking extemporaneously on matters of consequence, said Ms. Jamieson, who has written extensively about Mr. Trump\u2019s talent for using blunt language to subvert political norms. That approach has lent itself to a collection of presidential favorites: In Trumpese, she said, \u201cmany people are saying\u201d means \u201cI wish many people were saying this because I want you to believe they are.\u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, likely means \u201cI just found out,\u201d and \u201cbelieve me,\u201d on some level, may signal \u201cI have real doubts.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s modern predecessors, she said, tended to adhere to a tightly scripted approach. For example, she had a hard time imagining President John F. Kennedy saying \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d while negotiating his way through the Cuban missile crisis.\u201cThe presidents wanted to ensure that they knew what outcomes could be achieved and that their rhetoric could help them achieve the outcome,\u201d she said. With Mr. Trump, \u201cthe signaling function is being eroded,\u201d meaning that even words uttered by a commander-in-chief have a way of losing their power if they\u2019re said often enough.Speechwriters have often sought to hammer out such crutches, aware that an audience\u2019s eyes and ears begin to glaze over if subjected to a rhetorical overdose. (Easier said than done, of course, when a president delights in veering off script.)\u201cIf you keep forcing the same phrases into people\u2019s ears all the time, people start to wonder what you\u2019re actually meaning,\u201d Matt Latimer, a literary agent and former speechwriter for Mr. Bush, said in an interview. He said the danger in Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency could be, \u201cafter a while it\u2019s like, \u2018He really doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, does he?\u2019\u201dMr. Latimer said that while Mr. Trump enjoys a strong economy and policy victories, like tax cuts, aimed at his base, it\u2019s probably easier for him to speak extemporaneously. For instance, of the impending deadline on negotiations with Iran, Mr. Trump twisted the phrase to suit his penchant for showmanship: \u201cNobody knows what I\u2019m going to do on the 12th, although, Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea \u2014 but we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said during a meeting last week with President Emmanuel Macron of France.But Mr. Latimer, who scripted a president through the Iraq war and a looming recession, said Mr. Trump\u2019s laissez-faire attitude probably would not last as consequential negotiations advance: \u201cFree styling only works when things are going pretty well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House to Impose Metal Tariffs on E.U., Canada and Mexico", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Union, Canada and Mexico, which will face 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, quickly denounced the action and drew up lists of tit-for-tat measures, many aimed at parts of the United States where President Trump enjoys his strongest political support.The tariffs \u201chave already had major, positive effects on steel and aluminum workers and jobs and will continue to do so long into the future,\u201d White House officials said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, the Trump administration\u2019s actions underscore its commitment to good-faith negotiations with our allies to enhance our national security while supporting American workers.\u201dBy keeping trading partners guessing, the president has sought to create leverage in trade negotiations, including in talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. But in the process, he has sowed an atmosphere of chaos among allies as well as manufacturers uncertain about the ultimate impact on their vast supply chains.The latest twist in the trade drama does little to alleviate the confusion among business owners and foreign leaders. Although the Trump administration signaled a tougher stance with the tariffs, it also left open the possibility for continued negotiations with affected countries.As trade tensions escalate, Europe, Canada and Mexico are threatening to respond in kind, raising the potential of an all-out trade war.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, on Thursday, called the tariffs \u201cillegal,\u201d while saying \u201cthe measures carry the threat of a spiral of escalation that will result in damaging everyone.\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that Canada \u201ccould be considered a national security threat.\u201d Within minutes of the American action, Mexico had detailed a list of goods to target for retaliation, including steel, pork, apples, cranberries and cheeses.\u201cFor the first time in generations, we\u2019ve really thrown out the rule book with our best trading partners,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents some of the largest exporters in the United States. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect them to continue business as usual with us if we are throwing out the rules. So that means everything from airplanes to agriculture is on the chopping block.\u201dBut the tariffs loomed in the backdrop as the administration continued to negotiate with Mexico and Canada over Nafta and European officials over other trade matters. Neither talks achieved much.On Nafta, the Trump administration had been pushing for a quick conclusion to ensure the deal passed through Congress this year. But negotiations have sputtered as the countries remain deeply divided on several important issues, like the rules for automobile manufacturing.Mr. Trudeau said the countries had the broad lines of \u201ca decent win-win-win deal\u201d last week. He spoke to Mr. Trump and offered to travel to Washington so they could work out the final details.But Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday phoned to tell the Canadian prime minister that the precondition of a deal was a sunset clause, meaning the pact would automatically expire unless the three countries voted to continue it. The idea has drawn ire from both foreign leaders and business executives, who say it undercuts the surety that trade agreements are meant to create.\u201cI had to highlight that there was no possibility of any Canadian prime minister signing a Nafta deal that included a five-year sunset clause,\u201d said Mr. Trudeau, \u201cand obviously the visit didn\u2019t happen.\u201dEuropean officials had tried offering the United States a limited trade deal. They wanted to avoid tit-for-tat actions \u2014 something they view as unproductive, economically perilous and detrimental to the increasingly fraught relationship between the longtime allies.Allies have vowed to challenge the legal statute the Trump administration used to roll out the tariffs, which is related to national security.The Trump administration has argued that imports have weakened the country\u2019s industrial base, and, by extension, its ability to produce tanks, weapons and armored vehicles. \u201cWe take the view that without a strong economy, you can\u2019t have strong national security,\u201d the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said Thursday.The European Union and Canada have objected strongly to the idea that they pose any kind of threat to national security, citing their close alliances and defense agreements with the United States. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, called the steel and aluminum tariffs announced by the White House on Thursday \u201cprotectionism, pure and simple.\u201dWith the tariffs set to go into effect at midnight, all three allies are readying their counterattacks.Canada announced corresponding tariffs on a broad list of American exports, including steel and aluminum, as well as dozens of basic consumer products like ketchup, insecticides and laundry machines. The Canadian tariffs, which go into effect July 1, will cover $12.8 billion worth of American goods, the value of Canadian steel and aluminum exports to the United States in 2017.\u201cThis is the strongest trade action Canada has taken in the postwar era,\u201d said Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland. \u201cThis is a very strong Canadian action in response to a very bad U.S. decision.\u201dAlong with fighting the tariffs at the World Trade Organization, European officials have been preparing levies on an estimated $3 billion of imported American products in late June. In a joint statement, ministers from France and Germany said the countries would coordinate their response.\u201cGlobal trade is not a gunfight at the O.K. Corral,\u201d Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s finance minister, said on Thursday after meeting with Mr. Ross. \u201cIt\u2019s not about who attacks whom, and then wait and see who is still standing at the end.\u201dWhether American consumers and companies get caught in the crossfire depends on how it all plays out.American metal manufacturers say that has helped to level the playing field. Century Aluminum, which has supported the tariffs, said the action \u201cprotects thousands of American aluminum workers and puts U.S. national security first.\u201dBut it has left businesses that rely on imported metals, like beer makers, auto manufacturers and others, exposed. And now that the tariffs will hit America\u2019s closest allies, some early supporters are changing their view.Canada is the largest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the United States, and the supply chains for many products snake back and forth across the border. The United Steelworkers union, which represents members in Canada as well as the United States, said the decision called \u201cinto serious question\u201d the design and direction of the administration\u2019s trade strategy.\u201cThe regular chaos surrounding our flawed trade policies is undermining the ability to project a reasoned course and ensure that we can improve domestic production and employment,\u201d the union said in a statement.The Aluminum Association, the industry trade group, also said it was disappointed. Heidi Brock, the group\u2019s president, said the tariffs would do little to address the larger issue of overcapacity in China \u201cwhile potentially alienating allies and disrupting supply chains that more than 97 percent of U.S. aluminum industry jobs rely upon.\u201dThe steel and aluminum tariffs already appear to be hurting construction companies, retailers and manufacturers \u2014 by raising their costs and injecting uncertainty into the price and availability of the metals going forward.The Federal Reserve\u2019s latest Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes about the health of regional economies, contains more than two dozen references to business fears that the administration\u2019s trade policies, and the steel and aluminum tariffs in particular, would hurt sales and profits.In a more pointed statement, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, called the tariffs \u201cdumb.\u201d\u201cEurope, Canada and Mexico are not China, and you don\u2019t treat allies the same way you treat opponents,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Liz Alderman in Paris; Elisabeth Malkin in Mexico City; Catherine Porter in Toronto; Jim Tankersley in Washington; Melissa Eddy in Berlin; Ian Austen in Ottawa; and Milan Schreuer in Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Crackdown on Students Who Overstay Visas Rattles Higher Education", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration plans to crack down on international students and visitors who overstay their visas, stoking fears in the higher education community that President Trump\u2019s aggressive immigration policies will hinder university efforts to attract the brightest minds from overseas.\u201cIt is clear that in an attempt to \u2018enhance public safety,\u2019 the administration seeks to further close the door on academic talent,\u201d said Jill Welch, the deputy executive director for public policy at Nafsa, the Association of International Educators. \u201cThis is yet another policy which makes the United States less attractive to talented international students and scholars.\u201dSo far, the president has focused his policy efforts on the nation\u2019s borders, and his harshest rhetoric has targeted gang members. But Mr. Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 signaling that visa overstays would also be a target.It is estimated that overstays account for as many as half of the undocumented immigrants in the country, and the most recent figures released by the Department of Homeland Security show that student and exchange visitors had the highest overstay rate \u2014 2.8 percent \u2014 among nonimmigrant visitors to the United States.Immigration officials said the new policy aligned with the executive order.The proposed rules would target F and M visas, which are overwhelmingly used by international students to enter academic and vocational institutions of higher education, as well as J-1 visas, which allow students, professors and visitors to participate in short-term cultural exchange programs.Under the new policy, the government would begin to calculate what is called \u201cunlawful presence\u201d from the date that visa holders\u2019 purpose in the country has expired, such as the end of their studies. Under the current policy, put in place 20 years ago, that calculation started once the government discovered the violation.The new policy would also be less forgiving. Visa holders found to be in the country illegally for more than 180 days would be barred from re-entry for three or 10 years, depending on the length of their overstay. The current policy usually allows students to go back to their country and apply for a new visa, or update their visa status and return.The harsh penalties are especially jarring because small mistakes could now carry big consequences, said Angelo A. Paparelli, an immigration lawyer at Seyfarth Shaw LLP, a firm based in Los Angeles.\u201cFor immigration attorneys, because time is of the essence, if the three- or 10-year bar is triggered, there\u2019s not much you can do,\u201d he said.It is common for students to fall out of compliance while awaiting a new visa or transitioning to a new one, Mr. Paparelli said. Students who use visas to stay and work after completing their degrees are particularly vulnerable. Determining whether their jobs meet certain requirements to stay is subjective. Their violations could be applied retroactively, and subject them to an automatic ban, he said.\u201cThe effect of this change will be felt by businesses,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will foreclose what have been standard approaches to transitioning from student to worker, whether that\u2019s on an H1-B or some other work visa category, or the transition to permanent residence.\u201dAdministrators who work with international students worry that they will be punished for life events that domestic students are usually supported through. Many students fall out of status because of extenuating circumstances, such as temporarily dropping below a full course load because of mental health issues, leaving school temporarily for a family emergency or picking up a part-time job to help with family finances.\u201cA lot of this impacts things that happen when students are in crisis, when status is the last thing on their minds,\u201d said Katie Tudini, the director for international student services at the University at Buffalo.Adam Julian, the director of international student and scholar services and outreach at Appalachian State University, said international students are among the most scrutinized populations in the immigration system because their visas require constant reporting of enrollment information, such as addresses and full-time status in school. But now, even the smallest miscommunication with school officials could lead to a violation.\u201cWe\u2019ve always stressed compliance with students; that\u2019s not changing,\u201d Mr. Julian said. \u201cBut we will just be especially vigilant on advising students that this is the new reality: The U.S. is ultimately going to be a country that does not want to benefit from everything that international scholars have to offer.\u201dCollege administrators have already noticed that the international talent pool is shrinking.But there was a slight decline \u2014 6,210 students, or 0.5 percent \u2014 in the number of students studying on F and M visas from March 2017 to March 2018. While the visa data included K-12 education, 85 percent of student visa holders attend colleges and universities. The report said that a majority of students seek bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in business, engineering or computer science. It also noted a sharp decline in the number of students coming from Saudi Arabia and South Korea.\u201cThese students and scholars are considered the most brilliant minds in their field, and they are not coming here with the intention to infringe the law and intentionally overstay in the country,\u201d said Karen F. Da Silva, an international student advocate for the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students.A previous version of this article inaccurately described the length of time visa holders found to be in the country illegally for more than 180 days would be barred from re-entry. They are barred for three or 10 years, depending on the length of their overstay, not three to 10 years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Members of the Migrant Caravan Await Their Fate Near San Diego", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Scores of migrants from Central America have set up an encampment on the border between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, waiting to apply for asylum in the United States after a journey that has drawn international attention. American border authorities have thus far declined to process the asylum seekers, a stalemate with no clear end.For several years, migrants from Central America have made their way north en masse in so-called caravans as a way to protect themselves from criminals as they flee violence in their home countries. This year, more than 1,200 migrants joined the caravan, which formed in late March in southern Mexico. It has drawn intense scrutiny among conservatives and in right-wing media, and President Trump himself warned on Twitter that the caravan posed a threat to the United States\u2019 security.With the American authorities unwilling to let the migrants enter the country on Monday, upward of 150 migrants from the caravan who intended to seek asylum huddled with donated blankets and sandwiches, which were distributed by volunteers. Plastic tarps protected them from the intense sun, and small knapsacks held their few belongings.The group has vowed to stay until the asylum seekers are allowed to petition for protection on American soil.Mario Quintanillo and Cecilia Sarai Carillo, who made the trek from El Salvador, were married at the beach in Tijuana on Sunday morning in preparation for their request for asylum in the United States. Their 2-year-old daughter, Daryeline Ariana, was with them.\u201cI\u2019m going with the feeling that it\u2019s going to be worth the effort,\u201d Mr. Quintanillo, 30, said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The triumph was more than just historic for residents of South Los Angeles, where Mr. Lamar grew up \u2014 it was also profoundly moving, an acknowledgment that their stories mattered.Young writers and artists in the area have long venerated Mr. Lamar, whose rise from poverty to becoming one of the acclaimed musical writers of his generation is a source of hope and inspiration. Kyland Turner, a young writer and poet from Watts, said Mr. Lamar\u2019s music helped him make sense of his own life and choices at critical moments.\u201cThere was a long time that I didn\u2019t know how to express myself, and Kendrick was that expression for me personally. I was young and trying to make it through the city,\u201d said Mr. Turner, 22. \u201cHis first album, that album got me through some of the toughest parts of my life, from being evicted to having friends dying.\u201dMr. Turner\u2019s dream is to make it as a songwriter and screenwriter. He\u2019s well on his way. He has built a following through raw performances in spoken-word events around the city, drawing from his life in South L.A.\u2019s neighborhoods. He recently did story-consulting work on a Netflix series about South L.A., \u201cOn My Block,\u201d and once performed at the White House.Mr. Lamar\u2019s Pulitzer win, said Mr. Turner, has provided a rush of inspiration for Mr. Turner and others like him.\u201cWe knew about Kendrick before the world knew about him. To see his growth over time and for him to stay true to his community, just on a personal level growing up in the city, in L.A., Watts, Compton \u2014 it made me feel like, man, I can make it,\u201d Mr. Turner said.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "South Korea Hands Kim Jong-un a Path to Prosperity on a USB Drive", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut last month, when he met with the South\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, Mr. Moon handed him a USB drive that contained quite a different message.In charts and video clips, Mr. Moon\u2019s memory stick laid out a \u201cnew economic map for the Korean Peninsula,\u201d including new railways and power plants for the impoverished North, should Mr. Kim abandon his nuclear weapons, according to South Korean officials.Mr. Moon based his sales pitch on the belief that Mr. Kim wants to become the North Korean equivalent of Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw the economic liberalization of China. In this view, Mr. Kim may be willing to transform his pariah state by trading in his nuclear arsenal for diplomatic and economic incentives he needs to achieve prosperity.\u201cKim Jong-un\u2019s desire to develop his country\u2019s economy is as strong as, and even stronger than, his desire for nuclear weapons,\u201d said Lee Jong-seok, a former unification minister of South Korea. \u201cBut he knows he cannot achieve the kind of rapid economic growth in China that he envisions for his country while keeping his nuclear weapons \u2014 because of the sanctions.\u201dSkeptics doubt Mr. Kim\u2019s xenophobic regime will ever surrender its nuclear deterrent.But since the inter-Korean summit meeting, many South Koreans have started to believe that Mr. Kim is a \u201ctrustworthy\u201d reformer, according to recent surveys. A growing number of South Korean analysts have also begun arguing that Mr. Kim wants to follow the model of the South\u2019s own past military dictators who focused on economic prosperity, or that Mr. Kim has convinced himself from China\u2019s experience that he can pursue economic growth while maintaining one-party rule.\u201cMy desires were burning all the time, but I spent the past year feeling anxious and remorseful for the lack of my ability,\u201d Mr. Kim said in a nationally broadcast speech last year, a startling admission for a member of the family that has ruled North Korea with the help of a personality cult since its founding in 1948.After meeting him, Mr. Moon called Mr. Kim \u201copen-minded and practical.\u201d\u201cKim Jong-un is at a crossroads,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, South Korea\u2019s capital. \u201cHe could advance his nuclear weapons program further and face a deeper isolation and possible economic ruin. Or he could use it as a bargaining card to win normalized ties and a peace treaty with the United States and economic recovery.\u201dIf Mr. Kim pursues the route of economic reform, energy and transportation are the two areas where he most needs outside help. In his meeting with Mr. Moon, Mr. Kim admitted to the \u201cembarrassing\u201d condition of his roads and railways, South Korean officials said.Lacking cash for oil imports, North Korea produces all its electricity from hydroelectric dams and coal-burning power plants. But the country\u2019s power industry is trapped in a vicious cycle, energy experts say. Chronic electricity shortages make it difficult to produce coal and transport it to power plants. People in search of firewood for heat and cooking have denuded their hills, causing floods and droughts and making silt pile up at dams. That cuts down hydroelectric generation.North Korea\u2019s electricity generation amounts to only 4.4 percent of South Korea\u2019s, according to Park Eun-jeong, an analyst at the South\u2019s Korea Development Bank. The country prioritizes supplying electricity to lighting statues of Mr. Kim\u2019s father and grandfather, who had ruled before him, while passengers wait for hours in trains unable to move because of power shortages, according to defectors from the country.\u201cElectricity is the Achilles\u2019 heel for North Korea,\u201d said Lee Jong-heon, an energy analyst in Seoul.Mr. Moon\u2019s proposal to modernize the North\u2019s roads and railways and link them to the South\u2019s is not meant to help just North Korea.South Korean policymakers say that the two Koreas must first integrate their economies to make an eventual reunification less chaotic. They also envision building trans-Korean railways to find faster and cheaper routes to export South Korean goods to China, Russia and Europe, and bring Russian oil and gas into the South through pipelines for its power-hungry economy.But that is unlikely to happen until the North denuclearizes.Now, with Mr. Kim reportedly willing to discuss denuclearization, there are renewed hopes in the South.\u201cReunification can start with reconnecting energy and transport lines of the two Koreas,\u201d said Mr. Lee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Viktor Orban\u2019s Victory, Hungary\u2019s Judges Start to Tumble", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFour days later, something strange started to happen in the Hungarian court system. A flurry of judges began resigning in quick succession from the National Judicial Council, the main bulwark against executive interference in the judiciary.Mr. Orban\u2019s party maintains there is nothing untoward about the departures. But his critics fear that the judges are resigning under pressure from allies of a newly emboldened Orban administration with the intent of further bringing the judiciary to heel.\u201cThe situation wasn\u2019t good before,\u201d said Zsuzsa Sandor, a former senior judge, \u201cbut it\u2019s now going to get worse.\u201dMost urgently, the National Judicial Council is scheduled on Wednesday to announce the results of an inquiry into allegations that one of Mr. Orban\u2019s oldest friends and allies, Tunde Hando, has systematically packed the courts with loyalists in her role as chief of the judiciary for the past six years.The sudden resignation of so many key council members may squelch the announcement, prevent the council from taking action against her, and free her hand even more.If the council can no longer function properly, \u201cthen there\u2019s no more hope that judges will be able to operate and rule independently,\u201d Judge Sandor said. \u201cIt would mean that there are no more ways to control the work of Tunde Hando.\u201dAs part of those changes, the independence of the Hungarian court system has gradually been undermined but, to Mr. Orban\u2019s frustration, never destroyed.Newly galvanized by a bigger electoral mandate, Mr. Orban or his loyalists may now be able to change that \u2014 either by placing the judiciary under the direct control of the Justice Ministry, or by undermining the National Judicial Council.Ms. Hando is an old friend of the prime minister\u2019s, and her husband heads Mr. Orban\u2019s caucus in the European Parliament. Because of changes made by Mr. Orban in 2011, she was subsequently made president of the National Judiciary Office.Within the judiciary, her decisions can only be challenged by the National Judicial Council, a panel of 15 judges elected by their peers.For years, the council did little to obstruct Ms. Hando\u2019s activities. But after new members were elected in January, the council began to challenge her authority, announcing an investigation into her hiring practices.Then Mr. Orban won the election. Four days later, Agnes Rendeki, a newly elected council member, stepped down for what she said were personal reasons. A second member followed the next day. And then the day after, a third.Less than three weeks later, five council members had stepped down, as well as six reserves who could have taken their place. There are now conflicting assessments of whether the council has enough members to meet.Istvan Lovas, a prominent commentator who supports Mr. Orban, said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to claim Ms. Hando had gamed the judiciary in favor of the government.\u201cI can give you many many examples that show that Hando appointed judges who are absolutely against Fidesz,\u201d said Mr. Lovas, referring to Mr. Orban\u2019s party. \u201cOut of 10 decisions by the Hungarian courts, eight go toward the opposition.\u201dThe controversy comes at a critical moment for Mr. Orban and Fidesz. Mr. Orban is due to meet on Wednesday with senior members of the European People\u2019s Party, an alliance of conservative political parties to which Mr. Orban belongs, along with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor.The leadership of the European People\u2019s Party has done little to restrain Mr. Orban since 2010, but increasing numbers of its lawmakers in the European Parliament have had enough.This might in turn prove off-putting to some foreign businesses, particularly German ones, which play an important role in the Hungarian economy, said Otilia Dhand, an analyst of Central and Eastern Europe at Teneo Intelligence, a financial and political consultancy.\u201cThe courts will be a key part of the discussion on Wednesday,\u201d said Dr. Dhand. If Mr. Orban is unconvincing, \u201cit might increase the risk that Hungary faces an Article 7 procedure, which could have a knock-on effect on investors\u2019 thinking.\u201dMr. Orban\u2019s case is helped by the fact that most of the judges who have resigned from the National Judicial Council have cited personal reasons for their decisions.But the timing of their departures, as well as the speed at which they occurred, has led other Hungarian judges to wonder whether something more sinister was afoot.Shortly before her resignation, for instance, Judge Rendeki was seen in tears following a meeting with Ms. Hando.\u201cForced resignations may be too extreme an expression,\u201d said Peter Szepeshazi, a serving judge who is frequently critical of how the Orban government has managed the judiciary. \u201cBut they may have been approached by people close to Tunde Hando, who may have conveyed the message that it would be best if they stopped.\u201dAsked whether they had been pressured into resigning, two of the five departing judges declined to comment, two did not respond, and the fifth \u2014 Judge Rendeki \u2014 stood by her original explanation.Gergely Gulyas, the parliamentary leader of Mr. Orban\u2019s party, released a brief statement suggesting that the council\u2019s work was free of political interference.\u201cAs judiciary in Hungary is independent, Fidesz does not have a position on recent resignations\u201d from the council, he said in a message sent via a spokesperson.Neither Ms. Hando nor Mr. Orban\u2019s office responded to multiple requests for comment about both the resignations and her general conduct. Contacted by telephone, an official at the Justice Ministry asked for requests to be emailed, but did not respond to subsequent emails.Suspicions have been raised about the resignations because Ms. Hando has the power to instigate disciplinary procedures against high-ranking judges \u2014 including several of those on the council \u2014 as well as overall control over who gets promoted to senior positions within the judiciary, and the resources given to their departments.That might make some ambitious judges wary of crossing her, for fear of wrecking their careers, Judge Sandor said.Before Mr. Orban took charge, senior judges were appointed by an autonomous panel. But though that is still nominally the case, Ms. Hando can in practice now reject the council\u2019s choice, appoint her preferred candidate in an acting capacity for a year, and then install the person on a permanent basis.Critics fear this process \u2014 which Ms. Hando embarked on 28 times throughout 2017 \u2014 will gradually allow her to install loyalists throughout the system.\u201cIt\u2019s not that they tell you what to rule in a particular case,\u201d Judge Sandor said. \u201cBut how cases are assigned, how people are promoted, and how disciplinary proceedings are made against judges \u2014 all of that depends on Tunde Hando herself.\u201dBenjamin Novak contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canceling of Trump-Kim Meeting Shakes Asia but Could Help China", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Trump\u2019s announcement put the brakes on disarmament negotiations that had been hurtling ahead at an unprecedented pace. Instead of a meeting with Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump vowed that \u201cour very strong sanctions, by far the strongest in history, and maximum pressure campaign will continue.\u201dBut applying that pressure depends in large part on cooperation from China, which may now be able to use any delays in negotiations with North Korea to its advantage in trade talks with the United States.It is unclear how Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the meeting with Mr. Kim will affect the internal politics of North Korea\u2019s secretive regime. If Mr. Kim feels compelled to resume weapons tests and his drive to demonstrate that he can strike the United States with a nuclear warhead, the region will be on edge once again.But if he refrains, Mr. Kim may have already earned enough good will among his neighbors \u2014 especially China, his country\u2019s main trading partner \u2014 to see some softening of the economic sanctions against his isolated nation, without agreeing to give up his nuclear arsenal.\u201cTrump walking away from the summit lets North Korea meet all its objectives: public recognition, lighter sanctions, damage to U.S. alliances and continued nuclear advancement,\u201d said Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington.South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, helped broker the planned meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump. Now he is likely to be damaged politically if the talks are entirely derailed.\u201cMoon Jae-in\u2019s people must be panic-stricken by now because they have invested so much in the Trump-Kim summit,\u201d said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul. \u201cAt home, they will face a gleeful political opposition who will ridicule them for being so na\u00efve.\u201dPresident Xi Jinping of China has also appeared nervous about the pace of the talks and the prospect of Mr. Kim\u2019s getting too close to the Americans, particularly given his independent streak and past willingness to buck China.\u201cIt is in Xi\u2019s interest not only to delay but to have the summit pending for as long as possible,\u201d said James Mann, the author of \u201cThe China Fantasy.\u201d\u201cThe prospect of a deal without a deal itself gives China leverage over the U.S., especially on trade,\u201d he added.Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea expert at Renmin University in Beijing, described Mr. Trump\u2019s decision as \u201cbad news,\u201d but said it might allow Mr. Xi to act as a mediator. \u201cThe cancellation may offer China an opportunity to do something to salvage the aborted meeting,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump appears to suspect that Mr. Xi had something to do with North Korea\u2019s taking a harder line against abandoning its nuclear weapons in recent days.\u201cThere was a different attitude by the North Korean folks after that meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Tuesday as he met with Mr. Moon to discuss strategy toward the North. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I\u2019m happy about it.\u201dMr. Trump also called Mr. Xi a \u201cworld-class poker player,\u201d a backhanded compliment for a world leader whom Mr. Trump has called a friend and a partner in enforcing international sanctions on the North over its nuclear weapons program.But analysts also said they thought Mr. Trump was misreading the situation, and that the tougher stance from North Korea probably stemmed more from internal concerns about its own survival than from interference by Mr. Xi.The confusion and finger-pointing show how complex the situation is, with numerous actors negotiating in multiple channels with myriad and sometimes overlapping agendas.While it is not known what the North Korean and Chinese leaders discussed during their meeting in Dalian, Mr. Xi was probably pushing his own agenda, including economic cooperation, while advising Mr. Kim on dealing with Mr. Trump, analysts said.Many American analysts agreed, saying the North\u2019s recent harsher tone reflected the Kim regime\u2019s concerns about its own preservation, and its bedrock belief that it needs to keep some form of a nuclear arsenal.\u201cBlaming the Chinese for the change in tone from North Korea strikes me as trying to find a Chinese scapegoat for a summit failure,\u201d said Douglas H. Paal, a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.However, some American analysts said China had an interest in at least slowing down any rapprochement between the United States and North Korea.The United States, by pressuring China on trade at the same time it is relying on Beijing to apply tough sanctions against North Korea, has created an opening for Mr. Xi to force the Americans to make concessions on economic issues.Since the Dalian meeting, Chinese officials have been telling foreign diplomats that Mr. Xi and Mr. Kim discussed how the young leader should deal with Mr. Trump.However, just after the Dalian meeting, North Korea seemed to back away from its earlier statement that it would consider complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. During a trip to Pyongyang days later, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hoped to get additional pledges from the North on scrapping its nuclear program but did not.Soon after Mr. Pompeo left Pyongyang, North Korea kicked off its tirade against Washington, saying it would call off the expected June 12 summit meeting if the Trump administration insisted on \u201cunilateral nuclear abandonment.\u201dSignificantly, the threat was issued by the North\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Kye-kwan, a veteran of the North\u2019s foreign ministry who is well known to Washington.His statement took specific aim at John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, who had said on a Sunday television show that North Korea needed to dispose of its nuclear weapons program quickly, following what he called the model of Libya under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.Chinese analysts say North Korea\u2019s elite see Libya, and Mr. Qaddafi\u2019s inability to defend himself when Western powers backed the popular uprising that toppled him, as a warning not to give up nuclear weapons. They said it was Mr. Bolton\u2019s impolitic comments, and not behind-the-scenes Chinese machinations, that hardened North Korean attitudes.\u201cSubverting the summit would bring even bigger uncertainties to China,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.Mr. Shi said China would benefit from easing tensions on the peninsula, with a lifting of sanctions allowing a resumption of trade along its shared border with the North. In fact, he said Mr. Xi probably used the Dalian meeting to entice Mr. Kim with expanded economic ties to help Mr. Kim fulfill his promise to his own people to fix the North\u2019s dilapidated economy.Mr. Trump himself has often linked North Korea and trade, telling the Chinese that he would give them a better deal on the latter if they cooperated on North Korea, said Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Some analysts said this was apparent in the Trump administration\u2019s handling of ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications equipment company. The United States barred it from buying American-made parts as punishment for its dealings with North Korea and Iran, threatening the company\u2019s survival.The United States then eased off that punishment after Mr. Trump said on social media that he was working with Mr. Xi to give ZTE \u201ca way to get back into business, fast.\u201d\u201cThere was a belated recognition that the trade agenda was complicating Trump\u2019s ability to achieve progress on his top priority of North Korea,\u201d said Ryan Hass, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who was a member of President Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council.He said the Trump administration was gambling that showing flexibility on trade would persuade Beijing to cooperate on North Korea.\u201cBeijing set the price for doing so as action on ZTE and steps to ease trade tensions,\u201d Mr. Hass said. \u201cThe Trump administration accepted the terms.\u201d\u201cTime will tell if that bet pays off,\u201d he said.Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea, and Motoko Rich from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Truth About Mass Shootings in Australia: The Father Usually Did It", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The police in Western Australia are working to determine why a farmer killed six members of his family, including four young children, before turning a gun on himself.The country prides itself on strict gun-control laws that have decreased the number of mass murders in the recent past. But experts said that the events in Osmington were part of a wider, more insidious problem in rural Australia: suicide and family murder.Gun violence in Australia is rare, but when it does occur it is most often a suicide.In 2016, the last year for which data is available, 238 people were killed by guns in Australia, compared with 38,658 for the same year in the United States.Of those deaths in Australia, 183, or more than 75 percent, were the result of suicides.People living in rural areas kill themselves at twice the average rate of those in cities, and farmers are particularly at risk, experts said.Friday\u2019s shooting, in which Peter Miles, a farmer, is believed to have killed his wife, daughter and four grandchildren, was the deadliest shooting in the country since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania.Before Friday, the worst shooting since 1996 occurred in 2014, when a farmer shot his wife and three children before killing himself.The victims of mass shootings are typically the gunman\u2019s family members, said Glynn Greensmith, a lecturer at Curtin University in Sydney.More often than not, the man (and it is usually a man) behind the gun is the victims\u2019 father, partner or husband, Mr. Greensmith said.Such killings, known as familicides, have \u201cnever attracted the same attention as the mass random shooting,\u201d Mr. Greensmith said, \u201cbut has always been higher in number.\u201dThe incidence of suicide in rural Australia has been tied to a collapse of the traditional farming economy and a stigma against receiving help for mental health issues.Rural suicides are so common that the phenomenon has been given a name: \u201cthe good bloke under pressure.\u201dAaron Cockman, the former son-in-law of Peter Miles and the father of the slain children, said on Sunday that Mr. Miles \u201cdid not snap\u201d but had been \u201cthinking this through for a long time.\u201d\u201cPeter has been trying to hold it together for a long time,\u201d Mr. Cockman said. \u201cHe\u2019s just thought: I can\u2019t live any more, so this is it for me. But I need to take out everyone because that will fix the whole problem.\u201dMr. Cockman said Mr. Miles was strained emotionally: One of his sons had killed himself, and another had recently learned he was ill.If you or someone you know needs help within Australia, call Lifeline on 13 11 14 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 46 36.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hawaii Eruptions Continue to Disrupt Tourism During Prime Summer Months", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateJuly means summer vacation time in Hawaii, and that means lodgings are normally booked out weeks, or even months in advance. But this year things are different. [UPDATED: July 20, 2018]The continuous eruption has sent lava across 12.5 square miles, destroying more than 700 homes and casting enough lava into the ocean to extend the island by 700 acres; 1,500 people have been evacuated since the eruption began. At the same time, the natural phenomenon also became a tourism spectacle, with lava ocean tours \u2014 like the unlucky one bombed by lava \u2014 setting out to watch the unusual phenomenon from the sea. Two months ago, no one was able to predict how long Kilauea\u2019s eruptions would carry on. But as the weeks have crept by, those working in the travel and tourism industries have become increasingly concerned about the impact the eruptions could have on their bottom line. As news of the eruption flowed out around the world, so did local concerns of a secondary disaster: a tourism shutdown.July means summer vacation time in Hawaii, and that means lodgings are normally booked out weeks, or even months in advance. But this year things are different. Although the Hawaii Tourism Authority will only issue their June hotel performance figures at the end of this month, those running hotels on the Big Island don\u2019t need to wait to see the data for proof of a tourism slowdown; their blank booking calendars are already proof enough. By last week, Ms. Goto\u2019s situation had changed. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone booked for next week, and this time in the summer I am normally fully booked,\u201d she said. \u201cJuly and August are usually my best months.\u201d The shutdown of the park alone is likely to cost the local economy millions of dollars. The National Park Service reported that by driving visitor spending on hotels, restaurants, grocery stores and rental cars the Volcanoes park contributed $166 million to the local economy in 2017. Lynne Koontz, an economist with the National Park System, believes that the most precise way to measure the impact that the park\u2019s closure will have on the local economy is by breaking down the annual figure into a daily average \u2014 $455,000 a day \u2014 and multiplying that by the number of days the park has been closed. The park has now been closed for 10 weeks, adding up to nearly $32 million.But to Hawaii residents, tourists\u2019 fears and their resulting booking cancellations are a source of deep frustration, owing to what they say is a fundamental misunderstanding of the geography of the state and overly alarmist reporting: The eruption is occurring in a rural, 10-square mile area in the southeastern corner of the most southeastern island of the state\u2019s eight main islands. Honolulu, for example, is more than 200 miles from the erupting volcano.\u201cI believe we will lose customers,\u201d said Joel Genavia, the assistant general manager of the Fishhopper restaurant in Kona, on the western side of the Big Island. The restaurant serves 500 to 800 people a day, 75 percent of whom are tourists, Mr. Genavia estimates. \u201cI\u2019m worried that this will mean that my workers, and other workers at tourism businesses around the island, are going to end up getting laid off,\u201d he said.Tourism provides 30 percent of the private sector jobs on the Big Island, causing concern to grow over the potential of a long-term hit on the island\u2019s economy.\u201cPeople canceling trips to Honolulu \u2014 that\u2019s just because they don\u2019t understand the geography of our state,\u201d said Mr. Genavia in a voice quivering with anger. \u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous to us.\u201d His restaurant is 100 miles from the eruption site, but he\u2019s still losing business.Both Japan Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines normally operate flights to Kona (from Tokyo and Los Angeles). Japan Airlines reported via email that their flights were operating normally with no cancellations. Hawaiian Airlines noted that it has experienced a \u201cmoderate drop in bookings for close-in travel to the island of Hawaii,\u201d the airline said in a statement in May. Since that time the airline has eliminated operation of two of their daily flights to the Big Island.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.P.A. Takes a Major Step to Roll Back Clean Car Rules", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration took a major step toward dramatically weakening an Obama-era rule designed to cut pollution from vehicle tailpipes, setting the stage for a legal clash with California that could potentially split the nation\u2019s auto market in two.However, the proposed Trump rule could lead to unintended and unwanted consequences for those same car companies. The Obama-era regulations would have forced automakers to make and sell far more electric and hybrid vehicles, but the new proposal could end up leading to two separate sets of fuel economy regulations within the United States, creating what automakers say would be an even greater regulatory burden.Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the E.P.A., confirmed on Thursday that the agency had sent its proposed regulatory rollback to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. Typically that is the final step before a proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. The rules are then open for public comment before taking effect, during which the terms could still be modified.Together with President Trump\u2019s plans to undo a separate set of climate change regulations, on pollution from coal-fired power plants, \u201cthis represents the centerpiece of the administration\u2019s gutting of the Obama-era domestic climate portfolio,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard University.Dr. Stavins said that while the rollback could give automakers the looser regulations they had sought, it could well backfire by creating two different sets of regulations where there had been one. The uncertainty, he said, \u201c could haunt U.S. car producers at a time at which they are already worried about the effects on their production costs of Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs,\u201d Dr. Stavins wrote in an email.One of the central and most controversial elements of the proposed rule would formally challenge California\u2019s special status under the 1970 Clean Air Act to set its own vehicle pollution standards. California has said that it will continue to enforce the stricter, Obama-era pollution standards, a move that would create two separate auto markets in the United States \u2014 one with the tougher emissions requirements, and another with looser rules.Twelve other states follow California\u2019s lead, and together they make up roughly one-third of the nation\u2019s auto market.California\u2019s lawmakers insist that, under the state\u2019s special status, they and the 12 other states have the right to retain their own tighter rules even if the federal government lowers its fuel economy standards.According to three people familiar with the proposal filed on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed rule would not revoke California\u2019s waiver outright. Instead, it will argue that California cannot use the waiver to require tougher fuel economy standards than those set by the federal government. The three requested anonymity because the E.P.A. had not authorized them to speak publicly on the matter.Gov. Jerry Brown of California and the state\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, have said that, should Mr. Trump challenge their state, they stand ready to fight back with a major lawsuit that would likely end up before the Supreme Court.\u201cWe\u2019ve ridden this bull for almost 50 years and we\u2019re still on top,\u201d Mr. Becerra said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t intend 2018 to be any different because for California, taming greenhouse gas emissions isn\u2019t a choice, it\u2019s a necessity.\u201dMr. Trump has vowed since the early days of his administration to roll back the vehicle pollution rule, which was one of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature policies to address climate change. In the first weeks after Mr. Trump took office, he met with the chief executives of the United States\u2019 major automakers, who asked him to lower the standards, saying that a million jobs were on the line. Mr. Trump then tasked Scott Pruitt, the head of the E.P.A., to craft a legal proposal to achieve that.On May 23, Mr. Trump tweeted, \u201cThere will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!\u201dOne person familiar with the plan, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the White House intended to publish its new rule in the next two weeks. Once the proposed rule is published, the E.P.A. will open it up for public comments before publishing a final regulation later in the year.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.For months, opponents of climate-change policy have pushed Mr. Trump to move forward with the legal challenge to California, arguing that the federal government should not allow states to set their own fuel economy standards.\u201cWe strongly support undoing state pre-emption of standards and taking California out of the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d said Myron Ebell, who led Mr. Trump\u2019s E.P.A. Trump transition team and works for the industry-funded Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington organization.But while automakers had pressed Mr. Trump to relax the Obama-era standards, some now fear that the president\u2019s willingness to dramatically roll back the standards and to fight California in court could have unintended consequences that could end up harming, rather than helping, the industry.Should California fight Mr. Trump\u2019s plan in court and win, that could set the stage for a huge transformation of the nation\u2019s auto market, ultimately creating one set of rules for cars sold in California and the 12 states that follow its strict fuel economy standards, and another set of rules for the rest of the country.Automakers have long described that possibility as the worst-case outcome for them, forcing them to manufacture cars that meet two separate sets of standards. Opponents of the proposed Trump rule say they hope that possibility will persuade the administration to walk back the proposal before it is finalized.Automakers have also spoken publicly in support of sticking, in some form, to more stringent car standards. \u201cWe support increasing car standards through 2025, and are not asking for a rollback,\u201d wrote Bill Ford, executive chairman at Ford Motor, in a blog post this year.\u201cIt has been made very clear that excluding the state of California and freezing fuel economy standards for the better part of decade won\u2019t prove fruitful,\u201d said Senator Thomas Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee. \u201cPresident Trump should recognize the opportunity here and take yes for an answer, rather than try to push extreme and unwanted standards through.\u201dBut people close to the Trump administration said that any future compromise was unlikely. \u201cI can\u2019t envision a scenario where President Trump and Jerry Brown would reach agreement over greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and transition on energy policy, and heads the Institute for Energy Research, a group which advocates fossil fuel use.Mr. Pyle said he was unworried that the ultimate outcome could be the imposition on American automakers of more regulations, not fewer. \u201cIf that\u2019s the outcome, the automakers will figure out something to make it work,\u201d he said.Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Race Problem Beyond the Numbers", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Williams is a tech executive and startup adviser.With this in mind, when concerned lawmakers scrutinize diversity at tech companies, they should look beyond the raw numbers to ask questions like: Do minorities typically have to have more accomplishments than their peers to be promoted? Do the companies enforce consistent expectations for each role? Are metrics for success clear and communicated? Are all employees given equal opportunities to achieve the goals that are required for promotion to leadership roles? Is there a concrete plan to increase diversity in leadership? All of these things make it more likely that members of underrepresented groups will be treated and promoted fairly \u2014 and that they will also be in positions to help shape its culture and its priorities.In future conversations, the caucus should push companies that boast about such pipeline solutions to go a step further and take a serious look at their effectiveness. Members should ask tech companies how they measure the success of program participants and the impact of their programs on the industry. For example, tech firms could release data on participants\u2019 college matriculation rates, selected majors, admission to accelerators or other tech-focused training programs and employment rates. Keeping tabs on the success rates of these initiatives would ensure that companies are doing more than simply throwing money at the problem and are held accountable for whether their efforts are making a difference.I was pleased to learn that the caucus delegation to Silicon Valley did address at least one issue other than inclusive hiring: They indicated that they planned to scrutinize the impact of major tech companies on the communities that surround their headquarters.There are additional ways in which tech companies can have a positive impact on the people of color in the areas outside their campuses, like Oakland, where I live. One of these is the implementation of robust supplier diversity programs \u2014 business initiatives incentivizing the use of minority-owned, women-owned, veteran-owned, L.G.B.T.Q.-owned and disabled-owned businesses to provide the outside goods and services that companies need. Such programs are mandatory for government contractors but are optional in the private sector. Some tech titans already have such programs in place, and I spearheaded the creation of Facebook\u2019s during my tenure there. The caucus should consider encouraging the many smaller tech companies to do the same, with an emphasis on contracting with companies with local communities.The lawmakers who visited Silicon Valley obviously care very much about the impact of the tech industry on members of racial minority groups. I hope they continue to keep in mind \u2014 whether they\u2019re having discussions with industry leaders or drafting litigation \u2014 what those of us who work in tech know well: that the still-dismal diversity numbers are just one small part of the problem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unnatural Economics (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistIs the natural rate hypothesis dead? Maybe. Probably.From the mid-1970s until just the other day, the overwhelming view in macroeconomics was that there is no long-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, that any attempt to hold unemployment below some level determined by structural factors would lead to ever-accelerating inflation. But the data haven\u2019t supported that view for a while; and the latest US employment report, with its combination of a low reported unemployment rate and continuing weak wage growth, seems to have brought skepticism about the natural rate to critical mass.The bottom line here is that the case for aggressive monetary and, when necessary, fiscal policies to sustain demand is much stronger than we used to think. Errors like the turn to austerity and the ECB\u2019s 2011 rate hike were much bigger mistakes than the previous doctrine allowed for; premature Fed rate hikes would be a bigger sin than even the Fed seems to realize now. For given what we now seem to know, output lost to weak demand is lost forever; there is no chance to make up for it later.During the 1970s almost the whole macroeconomics profession was persuaded by the experience of stagflation that Milton Friedman (and Edmund Phelps) were right: there is no long run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Current inflation does depend on unemployment, but it also depends one-for-one on expected inflation:Inflation = f(U) + expected inflationwhere f(U) means some function of the unemployment rate. Meanwhile, expected inflation presumably reflects past inflation. So trying to keep U very low means raising inflation ever higher to keep ahead of expectations, which is not a sustainable strategy.Actually, the speed with which the profession adopted the natural rate hypothesis was remarkable \u2013 and is especially extraordinary compared with the utter unwillingness of many macroeconomists to admit that experience since 2008 requires some change in their models, maybe even a concession that Keynesians were onto something. But that\u2019s a story for another time.So what happened? Consider the behavior of unemployment and core inflation since 1980:The first half of the 80s was marked by a huge rise in unemployment, which eventually came back down to roughly its original level; but inflation at the end of this cycle was a lot lower than at the beginning, seeming to confirm the accelerationist hypothesis.But after 2008 we once again had a huge rise in unemployment, which eventually came back down to roughly its starting point (actually lower at this point). If this cycle had produced an 80s-level disinflation, we\u2019d be well into deflation by now. Instead, inflation is also pretty much back where we started.Does this mean that there\u2019s no relationship between unemployment and inflation? Despite some puzzles in recent US data, I\u2019m not willing to go there. Extreme events are your friend in such cases, because the underlying logic is less likely to be obscured by special circumstances. So I look at things like Spain\u2019s disinflation in the face of massive unemployment:I\u2019d say that the preponderance of evidence still supports the notion that high unemployment depresses inflation, low unemployment fosters inflation.Why does accelerationism, which worked in the 80s, no longer seem to work? One way or another, I think we\u2019re into the realm of bounded rationality/behavioral economics. Downward nominal wage rigidity is a real thing, which becomes highly relevant at low inflation. And as Blanchard suggests, in a low-inflation world people may simply stop paying attention to overall inflation, or building changing expectations into their price-setting.So why does this matter? Consider the following story; any resemblance to real events is entirely intentional. Imagine that we go through a severe economic slump that temporarily drives unemployment way up and reduces inflation, but that eventually inflation gets back to where it started.On the accelerationist view, the period of high unemployment should lead to lower expected inflation, so to get inflation back up to its original level policymakers have to let the economy run hot for a while, with unemployment below its long-run sustainable level. Assuming they manage to do this, the period of running hot helps offset the cost of the initial slump; indeed, to a first approximation the average unemployment rate over, say, a decade is the same as it would have been without the slump:On this view, the task of central banks and fiscal authorities isn\u2019t full employment; it\u2019s \u201cstabilization\u201d, avoiding big swings in unemployment. You can think of reasons that might be important, but it would be wrong to simply add up the output lost during a slump and call that the loss to the economy.But the paleo view \u2013 which is the one supported by the evidence \u2013 says that getting inflation back to the original level doesn\u2019t mean running the economy temporarily hot; it just means getting unemployment back down. So there is never any compensation for the initial slump:On that view, the failure to supply enough demand after 2008 imposed an enormous cost, which we can never regain. And looking forward, the risks of being too loose versus too tight are hugely asymmetric: letting the economy slump again will again impose big costs that are never made up, while running it hot won\u2019t store up any meaningful trouble for the future.Is this reality being reflected in policy? My sense is that a lot of economists in central banks have come around to a neo-paleo view of inflation. But actual policy still looks as if it\u2019s being run with an accelerationist Phillips curve in the background, at best; indeed, there\u2019s an obvious unwillingness even to temporarily let the economy run hot.This matters. We should not let policy be driven by ideas that haven\u2019t worked for decades.Advertisement"}

But if Comcast offers a significantly higher bid than the $52.4 billion that Disney has put forward, as it has hinted that it would do, other shareholders could scuttle Murdochs\u2019 deal with Disney.Here\u2019s how\u2022 how deeply the family was involved in negotiating the Disney deal, and\u2022 how disproportionately the Murdochs may benefit from a lower-priced but all-stock Disney bidThe stockholders have also agreed not to facilitate any effort or attempt by another entity to make an acquisition proposal for 21CF, including by refraining from discussing or providing information to any person in connection with such a proposal.A spokesman for Fox declined to comment on Comcast\u2019s announcement on Wednesday. But this is what Lachlan Murdoch, one of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sons and the company\u2019s executive co-chairman, said on an earnings call earlier this month:\u201cWe\u2019re not going to kind of engage in a lot of speculation around this, but I can say that we are committed to our agreement with Disney and are working through the conditions to bring it to a closing. In addition, our directors, though, of course are aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.\u201dThe cable giant said on Wednesday what we and others have reported: that it is in the \u201cadvanced stages of preparing\u201d a counter bid for the 21st Century Fox assets that Walt Disney has agreed to buy for $52.4 billion.Any offer for Fox would be all-cash and at a premium to the value of the current all-share offer from Disney. The structure and terms of any offer by Comcast, including with respect to both the spinoff of \u201cNew Fox\u201d and the regulatory risk provisions and the related termination fee, would be at least as favorable to Fox shareholders as the Disney offer.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe lawsuit comes in the wake of a tense meeting during which its board voted to dilute Ms. Redstone\u2019s influence over the company. Immediately after the vote, National Amusements called it invalid. In the amended complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, CBS asserted the independence of its board and asked the court to rule on which side\u2019s interpretation of the recent vote is lawful.ContextOn the day before the CBS board was scheduled to meet last week, National Amusements made a sudden and significant change to the CBS bylaws: From now on, the company said, any vote would require a supermajority \u2014 90 percent of the 14 CBS board members \u2014 for approval.The board voted 11 to 3 to significantly diminish Ms. Redstone\u2019s voting power. But that result fell shy of 90 percent.The WSJ reported that Mr. Ackman supports Mr. Ellison.D.E.

{"Headline": "China Tries to Erase Taiwan, One Ally (and Website) at a Time", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 Can China use its enormous economic and diplomatic leverage to simply erase Taiwan\u2019s international identity?China seems to be trying. But its increasingly aggressive posture toward Taiwan is creating a backlash here that is undermining Beijing\u2019s ultimate goal: bringing the island\u2019s 23 million residents under its authority.Although China has long sought to isolate Taiwan, people here said its latest efforts have been the most intense in decades. China\u2019s economic and diplomatic moves have coincided with a series of military exercises that officials said were explicitly aimed at Taiwan and its president since 2016, Tsai Ing-wen, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally supported independence.\u201cThe Chinese government always says it wants to win the hearts and minds of the Taiwanese people, but their military threats against Taiwan and the diplomatic assault against Taiwan are not doing that,\u201d the foreign minister, Joseph Wu, recently told reporters.Even the slightest misstep can provoke China\u2019s vindictive pique.\u201cChina\u2019s goal regarding Taiwan has never changed,\u201d Lee Teng-hui, who in 1996 became Taiwan\u2019s first democratically elected president, said in a rare interview.\u201cThat goal is to swallow up Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty, exterminate Taiwanese democracy and achieve ultimate unification,\u201d said Mr. Lee. At 96, the former leader is calling for a referendum that could pave a path toward sovereignty by explicitly declaring the island Taiwan, not the Republic of China, as it is formally known.Ms. Tsai\u2019s government has tried to push back against China\u2019s campaign \u2014 \u201con a daily basis,\u201d as Mr. Wu, the foreign minister, put it. He and others here acknowledge, however, that China\u2019s economic clout has cowed corporations \u2014 and countries \u2014 fearful of losing access to the world\u2019s largest consumer market.Fire EX, an indie punk band here in Taiwan, knows what it is like to endure China\u2019s disapproval.Fire EX once played in China, but it has not done so since the protests, depriving it of revenue and greater exposure among millions of potential Mandarin-speaking fans.\u201cThose who want to make money will never touch on these topics,\u201d said the band\u2019s lead singer, who prefers to be known by a single name, Sam. \u201cNot talking about these things makes many people believe they are not important. So actually, China\u2019s tactic has succeeded.\u201dThe cost for China, though, is high.The cultural and political divides between China and Taiwan are only deepening. Although many in Taiwan are descendants of Chinese who, along with the Republic of China government, fled the civil war that ended with the Communist takeover in 1949, the potential appeal of unification has waned here, at least in part because of China\u2019s aggressive attitude.\u201cIt\u2019s totally two different countries,\u201d Sam said.Others, too, are resisting.\u201cMy works have been inspired by cultures all over the world but rely entirely on the germination, growth and evolution of the land \u2018Taiwan,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cLike the Taiwan clouded leopards in my next work, the Taiwan hemlock, the ocean around it and the more than 200 mountains of three thousand meters \u2014 to abandon this land, this name, my work would have no basis.\u201dWhile many here still look to China for economic opportunities, Ms. Tsai\u2019s government is moving to strengthen economic \u2014 and diplomatic \u2014 ties with friendlier countries, including the United States, the European Union and Japan.Ms. Tsai reacted angrily when Burkina Faso severed official relations and recognized China. Its move came only weeks after the Dominican Republic did the same. Now only 17 countries and the Vatican have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.As the world\u2019s 22nd-largest economy, Taiwan has its own leverage, and many here argue that the government could use it to become less dependent on economic ties with China, which are deep despite the political frictions.\u201cThe economy is over-reliant on China,\u201d said Mr. Lee, the former president. \u201cChina\u2019s economic incentives for Taiwan are part of a policy to create addictive subsidies that serve a political agenda.\u201dStill others cling to a quixotic hope that Taiwan can reverse the tide and emerge with independent, internationally recognized status.In Hsinchu, a technology hub on the western coast, 200 students participating in an annual Model United Nations conference last weekend practiced the ways of an organization in which Taiwan, because of China, is not now allowed to participate.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to change the situation right now,\u201d one of them, Grace Kung, 15, acknowledged. But she and her peers brim with hope that that could change.Ms. Kung criticized the World Health Organization for not inviting Taiwan to the annual assembly on global health. \u201cThe government and people of Taiwan want to help,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be blocked by any government, including China\u2019s, because of a political stance.\u201dBy chance, she was assigned to represent China in the students\u2019 model conference, which gave her an appreciation of what Taiwan is up against.\u201cBeing the delegate for China,\u201d she said, \u201cis a powerful feeling.\u201dOlivia Mitchell Ryan contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Does a Moment Turn Into a \u2018Movement\u2019?", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsFive or six decades ago, a big crowd meant something big. When 250,000 people gathered for the 1963 March on Washington, or nearly a million showed up for the 1982 anti-nukes rally in Central Park, it symbolized a certain power and legitimacy, a collective coming-of-age. A major protest presented a huge organizational challenge, and pulling one off delivered a potent message: Here was a force to be reckoned with. \u00b6 Today, the mass protest is often seen as a beginning, not an end \u2014 a moment of \u201cbursting onto the scene, but only the first stage in a potentially long journey,\u201d as the sociologist Zeynep Tufekci writes in her 2017 book, \u201cTwitter and Tear Gas.\u201d Getting people onto the streets remains difficult and time-consuming, but in the era of social media, it\u2019s far easier than it once was. Now the real challenge comes after the grand event: Will the passion of the crowd translate into a \u201cmovement\u201d capable of being sustained over the long term? \u00b6 That\u2019s the question being asked of the many and varied protest efforts that have sprung up in recent months. \u201cThe Parkland Teens Started Something,\u201d a Washington Post headline noted in mid-April. \u201cHow CanIt Become a Social Movement?\u201d The Hollywood Reporter asked the same about the campaign against sexual harassment in the entertainment industry \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Time\u2019s Up: Making a Moment Into a Movement?\u201d Even the most dramatic mass actions are often interpreted as mere shows of enthusiasm: Instead of settling doubts about a movement\u2019s significance, they seem to pose the question of whether a movement \u2014 something disciplined, tactically savvy and in for the long haul \u2014 might someday come into being. This has made it hard to judge the significance of any given demonstration, no matter the size or the energy of the crowd. In Arizona, the RedForEd teachers\u2019 revolt, which won higher wages and increased school funding, has been declared both defunct (\u201cRedForEd movement comes to an end, teachers not \u2018thrilled\u2019\u2009\u201d) and also loaded with promise (\u201cWhat will #RedForEd movement do next?\u201d). It has also produced a cycle of rapid obsolescence. In July 2016, just two years after Michael Brown\u2019s death in Ferguson, Mo., some commentators were already asking: \u201cDoes Black Lives Matter still matter?\u201d The rise of \u201cleaderless movements,\u201d especially on the left, has only made impacts harder to predict and challenged more established institutions to keep up. After last year\u2019s travel ban sparked airport protests and a flood of contributions, the American Civil Liberties Union began to flirt with a new identity. \u201cCan the A.C.L.U. Remake Itself as a Mass Movement for Progressive Change?\u201d The Nation asked recently, describing plans to \u201cgo beyond the courts \u2014 and into the streets\u201d as a leading force against President Trump.For most of modern history, constructing a major protest required months if not years of painstaking effort. During the 1960s, being part of \u201cthe movement\u201d meant committing, heart and soul, to this sort of work, showing up wherever bodies might be needed. The label conveyed a sense of purpose, even an entire worldview: antiwar, pro-civil rights, power to the people. Today, joining or even making a movement is often pitched as a far more individualistic enterprise, available to anyone with the requisite outrage and promotional skills. \u201cLeading Female Activists Tell You How to Start a Movement,\u201d Cosmopolitan magazine recently instructed its readers, advising them to \u201cpost about your movement on your social-media feeds\u201d while dutifully including a warning that \u201cnobody can carry a movement by themselves.\u201dBut even showing up in the street, in great numbers, does not necessarily earn much credit in the current environment. Making \u201cyour movement\u201d has become easier; making it stick, gaining public respect and effecting concrete change, has arguably become harder than ever. If turning out thousands, or even millions, of outraged citizens merely indicates potential, how and when do we decide that a movement actually exists? Since then, the basic idea of collective action and forward progress has taken such a dizzying variety of forms \u2014 liberal and conservative, grass-roots and top-down, \u201cpoor people\u2019s movements\u201d and \u201crich people\u2019s movements\u201d \u2014 that scholars have a hard time settling on a single meaning for what a social movement is and does. \u201cThe term has multiple definitions,\u201d write the editors of the Encyclopedia of American Social Movements, \u201cbut perhaps the simplest one is the best: the coming together of large numbers of people to pursue a goal that they believe will improve society.\u201d Movements are supposed to be different from other modes of citizen engagement, less beholden to elections and hierarchies, more fluid and open to transformative ideas. Often their goals are explicitly political, but the word is also used more casually these days, describing almost any group effort aimed at changing cultures, lifestyles or habits. There are craft-beer and slow-fashion and furniture-free movements. The ad firm Ogilvy & Mather champions the \u201cwellness movement,\u201d with \u201cthe new space it creates for brands and marketers,\u201d while employers of all stripes proclaim their membership in the workplace \u201cdiversity movement.\u201dEven the most traditional social movements tend to change over time, further complicating the problem of definition. One commonly identified shift came in the 1960s, when \u201cnew social movements\u201d began to experiment with street protest and consciousness-raising and nonviolent direct action in new ways. As initially understood by sociologists, these social movements came almost exclusively from the left. But the postwar era also proved to be fertile ground for movements on the right, ranging from the student activists of Young Americans for Freedom to \u201cmassive resistance\u201d in the white South. Leaders of the self-identified \u201cconservative movement\u201d spent at least part of that decade policing their own borders and defining their ideological tenets, and by the 1980s, these \u201cmovement conservatives\u201d were running the Republican Party.On the right, many activists focused their energies on transforming or taking over existing institutions, including national parties and local school boards. On the left, movements sometimes rejected such institutional goals, pushing for sweeping changes in hearts and minds, perhaps with legislation or court decisions to follow. In his 2011 book, \u201cAmerican Dreamers,\u201d the historian Michael Kazin identifies a persistent historical divide in outcomes as well, arguing that the left has been far better at \u201chelping to transform the moral culture\u201d than at presenting \u201ca serious challenge to those who held power in either the government or the economy.\u201d This distinction has basically held true for more recent movements. In the wake of the financial crisis, the Tea Party took control of a large share of the Republican Party, while Occupy Wall Street proved most effective at promoting a popular language to criticize the \u201c1 percent.\u201dOne thing they have in common, though, is that each came and went relatively quickly. Less than a decade from their origins, the Tea Party and Occupy already seem like anachronisms. Micah White, one of Occupy\u2019s founders, argues in his 2016 book, \u201cThe End of Protest,\u201d that today\u2019s movements need a thorough reinvention if they hope to withstand the slings and arrows of opposition over the long term. From another perspective, though, the rapid turnover of today\u2019s movements may actually be a sign of their success. \u201cOccupy begat We Are the 99% begat Fast Food Forward begat $15 Now begat the Bernie Sanders campaign,\u201d wrote Eric Liu in last year\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re More Powerful Than You Think\u201d \u2014 while the Tea Party \u201charnessed a radical anti-establishment spirit that seized and then consumed the Republican Party, fueled Donald Trump\u2019s election, unleashed a new populism and created a \u2018none-of-the-above\u2019 opening for libertarians.\u201d In this vision, we\u2019re already living in a golden age of citizen activism, when even high school students have the tools to organize a nationwide protest in five weeks flat.Whether that protest, or any other, will finally be deemed a \u201cmovement\u201d no doubt depends on what it ultimately accomplishes. One open secret of social activism is that nobody can ever really predict when, where, how or why any given issue will change from a lost cause to a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. As my Yale colleague and gay rights pioneer Evan Wolfson often reminds students, ambitious goals have usually seemed \u201cimpossible\u201d until they were achieved, at which point they suddenly became \u201cinevitable,\u201d a matter of simple justice and common sense. The movement is what happens in between./\u2022/Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Drop as Italy\u2019s Political Anxiety Spills Across Its Borders", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock markets in the United States dropped Tuesday amid concerns that growing political uncertainty in Italy and simmering tensions over Chinese trade could weigh on global economic growth.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 1.2 percent, marking the its third straight decline. Financial shares were among the worst performers, as developments in the European markets seemed to reawaken fears of a debt crisis among investors.Amid that uncertainty \u2014 which has left open the prospect of early elections and the formation of another populist alliance \u2014 investors have suddenly shifted away from riskier investments like stocks and commodities and taken refuge in the relative safety of German and American government bonds, the United States dollar and the Japanese yen.Italy\u2019s benchmark stock index fell nearly 2.7 percent, and worried investors sold off government bonds, sending prices down and yields up. The yield on Italy\u2019s main 10-year bond rose to its highest level in more than four years, spiking by more than a half percentage point to roughly 3.20 percent, according to data from Tradeweb, a bond trading platform.The euro fell to its weakest value against the dollar in nearly a year, and prices for government bonds issued by other heavily indebted European countries like Spain and Portugal also tumbled on Tuesday, pushing their yields up as well.The so-called spread between yields on debt from such countries and debt from Germany \u2014 Europe\u2019s biggest economy, which is seen as having the region\u2019s safest government bonds \u2014 widened sharply. That dynamic recalled the worst days of the European debt crisis that began in 2010, when investors first began to consider the risk that Greece may default on its debt, and then cast a worried eye at countries including Ireland, Portugal and Spain. Since then, European policymakers have been able to ease investor concerns, in part through a European Central Bank policy of effectively printing money in order to push interest rates down and speed economic growth.But the uncertainty in Italy reverberated across the continent on Tuesday. The main stock indexes in London, Frankfurt and Paris dropped. In a sign that investors were looking for safer assets, the yields on 10-year bonds from Britain, France and Germany all fell.In the United States, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note also fell to 2.80 percent as investors flocked to the safety of American sovereign debt. Yields on those notes had topped 3 percent in recent weeks on optimism about American economic growth and expectations of ongoing rate increases from the Federal Reserve.The decline in Treasury bond yields \u2014 which serve as benchmarks for private lending rates \u2014 weighed on shares of financial institutions. The financial sector was the worst performing part of the S.&P. 500-stock index, dropping by more than 3 percent, as falling long-term bond yields fanned concerns about crimped bank profitability.In a note to clients, bond market analysts from BMO Capital Markets thought that the shift toward investor demand for safety would probably last.\u201cThe cracks that we\u2019ve seen in risk appetite are only likely to widen,\u201d they wrote.Industrial stocks also dragged on markets in the United States, as trade tensions with China continue to create ongoing uncertainties for manufacturers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turmoil for Turkey\u2019s Trump", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAn anti-establishment leader takes power after a contentious election. His administration quickly proves itself remarkably corrupt; but he subverts the legal system and is able not only to suppress investigations into his corruption \u2014 his supporters denounce it all as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d \u2014 but also to consolidate his rule and undermine institutions (the \u201cdeep state\u201d) that might have limited his power.But does it matter? In America, stocks are up and the economy keeps chugging along. Erdogan has presided over an actual economic boom. Investors and markets don\u2019t seem to mind the craziness at the top. The fact that economic policymakers have no idea what they\u2019re talking about doesn\u2019t seem to make any difference.Until it does.The truth is that most of the time the quality of economic leadership matters much less than most people \u2014 economic leaders included \u2014 believe. Really destructive policies, like those driving Venezuela into the ditch, are one thing. But run-of-the-mill policies like changes in tax law, even if they\u2019re pretty big and clearly irresponsible, rarely have dramatic effects.Basically, as long as the economy isn\u2019t being hit by major shocks, political posturing hardly matters. Someone looking at U.S. growth in G.D.P. or employment over the past few years who didn\u2019t know we\u2019d had an election in 2016 would have no reason to suspect that anything important had changed.But when big shocks do hit, the quality of leadership suddenly matters a lot. Which is what we\u2019re seeing in Turkey now.An aside: Even if the quality of economic leadership matters a lot only during crises, you might expect markets to think ahead and incorporate the risk of badly handled future crises into stock and bond prices. Somehow, though, that almost never happens.What we get instead are long stretches of complacency followed by sudden panic. Students of international macroeconomics are fond of quoting \u201cDornbusch\u2019s law\u201d (named after my late teacher Rudiger Dornbusch): \u201cCrises take longer to arrive than you can possibly imagine, but when they do come, they happen faster than you can possibly imagine.\u201dWhat\u2019s happening in Turkey is a classic currency-and-debt crisis, of a kind we\u2019ve seen many times in Asia and Latin America. First, a nation becomes popular with international investors and runs up substantial foreign debt \u2014 in Turkey\u2019s case, largely debt owed by domestic corporations.Then it starts, for whatever reason, to lose its luster: Right now, emerging markets in general are being weighed down by a rising dollar and rising U.S. interest rates. And at that point a self-reinforcing crisis becomes possible: External factors cause a loss in confidence, which causes a country\u2019s currency to drop, but the falling currency causes the domestic value of those foreign debts to explode, worsening the economy, leading to further declines in confidence, and so on.At such a time, the quality of leadership suddenly matters a great deal. You need officials who understand what\u2019s happening, can devise a response and have enough credibility that markets give them the benefit of the doubt. Some emerging markets have those things, and they are riding out the turmoil fairly well. The Erdogan regime has none of that.So is the turmoil in Turkey a preview of what will happen under Trump? Not in detail: Although America borrows a lot abroad, it borrows in its own currency, which means that it isn\u2019t vulnerable to a classic emerging-markets crisis.But there are lots of ways things can go wrong, ranging from foreign policy crises \u2014 that Nobel Peace Prize doesn\u2019t look too plausible now, does it? \u2014 to trade wars, and it seems safe to say that the Trump team isn\u2019t ready for any of these possibilities. Maybe it won\u2019t have to deal with any really serious challenges. But what if it does?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Red-Scare Relic That Holds Back Smart Labor Policy", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Hafiz is a law professor whose research\u00a0includes labor and employment law and human rights law.When the National Labor Relations Act was passed in 1935, it was one of the most radical pieces of legislation in American history. It established an agency, the National Labor Relations Board, that encouraged workers to unionize in order to lift Depression-era wages and thus give Americans more money to spend, in the hope of stimulating the economy.Other agencies \u2014 like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 use macroeconomic modeling, behavioral science and other tools to understand the impact of their regulations. While the priorities of these agencies may still be shaped by political appointees, these efforts make regulations smarter and sometimes lead to breakthroughs in research.The labor board will never be wholly independent of politics. But a revivified Division of Economic Research could function in a way that\u2019s similar to the Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, by grounding the agency\u2019s policies and labor law decisions on data and analysis that would be part of the public record.The labor board could use such expertise right now on the question of when a company has enough \u201cindirect control\u201d over another company\u2019s workers to be treated as a \u201cjoint employer.\u201d In the Obama administration, the board adopted a more expansive indirect control standard, which was overruled by the board appointed by President Trump. That decision was then vacated because of a conflict of interest.A permanent economic research team could discourage such partisan whipsawing by helping to draft rules and giving guidance in cases before the board.A new Division of Economic Research could help adapt policymaking to workplaces that have been transformed since the 1930s. It could study how outsourcing and the on-demand, app-based economy have affected workers. It could assist the board in setting enforcement priorities, ranking cases by the overall harm caused to workers. It could organize decades\u2019 worth of data to assess which employers in which industries have artificially suppressed wages and which workers most need the board\u2019s protection. For example, the board has already collected an immense amount of data about fast-food franchising, and reliable analysis of that data could be crucial to rulings in that area.Finally, economic analysis could improve the effectiveness of the board itself. The board could ask its economists to score the relative economic impact of its cases according to metrics such as union membership rates. Developing the board\u2019s expertise would also fortify its ability to achieve the ambitious goals that were part of the agency\u2019s original mission: lifting depressed wages and increasing workers\u2019 purchasing power.For example, it could assess how rules that broaden the definition of \u201cemployees,\u201d who are protected by the National Labor Relations Act, or narrow the definition of \u201cindependent contractors,\u201d who are not, affect the relative wages and benefits of workers in the same labor market, at the same company or in the same industry.If the Trump administration is serious about its promises to help American workers, it should encourage Congress to repeal the ban on economists and social scientists.Hiba Hafiz is a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Minutes Suggest Few Worries of Economy Overheating", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal Reserve officials gave no indication that they are likely to speed up their pace of interest rate increases during their most recent two-day meeting, suggesting instead that they would be willing to allow the inflation rate to rise slightly above 2 percent for a \u201ctemporary period,\u201d while the economy continues to expand.Minutes from the meeting, which ended May 2 and are released after a typical three-week delay, reveal Fed officials are on track to raise rates again in June. The minutes also indicate officials are less worried about inflation rising above 2 percent, its current level and the Fed\u2019s target rate, than they are about the rate of inflation dipping again.Officials continue to see the economy as strong, but they remain worried about global trade tensions, including potential damage from American and Chinese tariffs and the possibility that uncertainty over trade policy could already be crimping business investment in the United States.The minutes from the May meeting reported that officials said recent economic indicators \u201chad increased their confidence that inflation on a 12-month basis would continue to run near the committee\u2019s longer-run 2 percent symmetric objective.\u201d But the minutes noted that some officials believed \u201cit was premature to conclude that inflation would remain at levels around 2 percent, especially after several years in which inflation had persistently run below the committee\u2019s 2 percent objective.\u201dSome officials noted, the minutes added, that \u201ca temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the committee\u2019s symmetric inflation objective and could be helpful in anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at a level consistent with that objective.\u201dAs if to drive home the point, the minutes use the word \u201csymmetric\u201d nine times in reference to inflation. Two additional references are found in the statement the Fed released after the May meeting, which noted that annual inflation \u201cis expected to run near the committee\u2019s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.\u201dAnalysts have largely seen the inclusion of \u201csymmetric\u201d as an indication that Fed officials would be willing to tolerate inflation running slightly above target for a period of time. Researchers at Morgan Stanley said this week that in reading the minutes, they would \u201cpay careful attention to the discussion behind the upgraded language\u201d on inflation.The emphasis on \u201csymmetric\u201d \u2014 and the policy stance it signals \u2014 is likely to cheer economic advisers in the White House, who have long insisted that the $1.5 trillion tax cut package that President Trump signed into law late last year will increase economic growth without stoking higher inflation. Many analysts expect that an acceleration in the pace of rate increases would dampen growth and potentially offset some of the stimulus from the cuts and from the federal discretionary spending increases that Mr. Trump and congressional leaders agreed to this year.The policy decision at the May meeting was widely seen as an affirmation by Fed officials that they will stay the course on their plans to increase rates to historically normal levels, after leaving them near zero for years following the Great Recession. The minutes seem to affirm that Fed officials are not wavering in that approach \u2014 though they report officials expressing \u201ca range of views\u201d on the amount of rate increases that will be needed to maintain the Fed\u2019s policy objectives in the medium term.Economic projections released after the Fed\u2019s March meeting suggest officials expected to raise rates two more times in the months to come, for a total of three increases this year. Nearly half of the officials indicated they expected one additional increase on top of that, for a total of four in 2018. Many economists continue to forecast a total of four hikes this year, as well.Recent economic data points have seemed to validate the Fed\u2019s approach. The unemployment rate has dropped to 3.9 percent \u2014 though at the time of the May meeting, the most recent data showed 4.1 percent. While wage growth remains sluggish, particularly for a time of such low unemployment, the inflation rate has risen to about 2 percent.A few developments in the data appear to have surprised officials in recent months, the minutes indicated. One was a slowdown in growth in advanced countries around the world, particularly Britain. Consumer spending in the United States has lagged the expectations of Fed staff in recent months, the minutes showed, which in turn has lowered the staff\u2019s growth projections slightly.Business contacts also reported that they were seeing \u201cshortages of workers in specific industries or occupations,\u201d the minutes show. \u201cIn some cases, labor shortages were contributing to upward pressure on wages.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Populist Parties Win Approval to Form Government", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 After 88 days of impasses and negotiations, two Italian populist parties with a history of antagonism toward the European Union received approval Thursday night to create a government that has already unsettled the Continent\u2019s political order.On Thursday, the populists reshuffled, keeping the same prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and other top players, but moving the objectionable finance minister to a less critical post.That was apparently enough to satisfy the president, who preferred an elected government to a caretaker alternative he had in reserve. The populist parties constituting the new government won the most votes in a March 4 election, promising a sweeping crackdown on the illegal immigration that helped fuel their ascent.But the president\u2019s assent was not enough to allay concerns about the actual agenda of the populists once they enter power, even though they now claim a sudden conversion to full faith in the euro.\u201cThe populist and right-wing government has a program that\u2019s dangerous for the country and the events of recent days confirm our longstanding concerns,\u201d said Maurizio Martina, a leader of the Democratic Party, which will now leave government for the opposition. \u201cTheir acts so far have been a mix of extremism, anti-Europism and iniquity.\u201dThe new government still needs to win a confidence vote in Parliament, but that was a formality. The government will be sworn in Friday.The remarkable rise of the populists now leaves Italy\u2019s traditional political establishment, left and right, in tatters. It also shocked a European Union that thought it had successfully beaten back an anti-establishment and hard-right insurgency last year.But amid all the geopolitical and economic threats to the European Union, Italy represented perhaps the gravest. And as is often the case with Italy, it was overlooked.The birthplace of fascism and for years the home of Western Europe\u2019s largest communist party, Italy again proved an incubator for political experiment. The populist parties it produced \u2014 the Five Star Movement, a party developed on the internet, and the League, a formerly northern secessionist movement \u2014 to varying degrees both blame the euro for depriving Italy of sovereignty.Like the other countries that have adopted the euro, Italy has lost its power to control interest rates, which are set by the European Union\u2019s central bank. The so-called eurozone countries also must adhere to strict fiscal rules, which are especially difficult for Italy because of its heavy debts.Economists say that if Italy, the fourth-biggest economy in the European Union, were to exit the euro it would do enormous financial damage to the country and hurt the Continent\u2019s economic stability.The political uncertainty in Italy \u2014 as well the remote possibility of leaving the euro \u2014 spooked the markets when the formation of a government by the two parties appeared likely. The combination created some of the scariest economic days for the country since the 2011 financial crisis that planted the seeds for this week\u2019s populist flowering.After a leaked draft of the alliance\u2019s government platform included proposals about leaving the eurozone and a proposed finance minister turned out to have helped write a guide to leaving the euro, the global markets dipped precipitously.Since then, however, seemingly every Five Star and League leader has disavowed their antagonism to the euro, or rather denied ever harboring any hostility to it whatsoever.On Wednesday night, League officials literally whitewashed their anti-euro history by painting over the blue \u201cBasta Euro,\u201d or no more euro, sign on its headquarters in Milan.\u201cThe euro was never in discussion,\u201d Mr. Conte, who will be sworn in Friday as prime minister with the rest of his cabinet, said in Florence on Thursday morning before traveling to Rome and then the Quirinal Palace in a plain taxi cab, the preferred transportation for the anti-establishment Five Star.But for any global investor with a search engine or European Union leader with a memory, there remained a real question as to whether the sharply negative market reaction had truly chastened the populists, or whether it simply had led them to disguise their hostility as the price of admission into power.Also unclear was how the parties, which had demanded an Italians-first approach and a dramatic restructuring of their relationship with Europe, would go about it.\u201cI will read the composition of the government,\u201d Mr. Conte said late Thursday night, minutes after receiving approval to form a government from President Mattarella.The cabinet still included the minister blocked by President Mattarella \u2014 Paolo Savona, the euro-skeptic economist. But Mr. Savona has now been moved from the powerful finance ministry to the less consequential European affairs ministry.He will nevertheless be Italy\u2019s representative in Brussels, a key spot for a coalition that wants to change the rules of the European Union.While some other key posts in the cabinet were filled with politicians experienced in working in the European Union, Mr. Conte said the leaders of Italy\u2019s populist alliance, Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini of the League, would be at his side as vice premiers.Critics have said Mr. Di Maio and Mr. Salvini will most likely be in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cWe will work intensely\u201d to implement the alliance\u2019s electoral program and \u201cwith determination to improve the quality of life of all Italians,\u201d Mr. Conte said.Populist leaders in Europe and across the Atlantic looked on with delight as they gained a powerful ally in the heart of Western Europe.Stephen K. Bannon, an architect of President Trump\u2019s own populist-themed campaign, was in Italy to celebrate the new government. He explained in an interview how, a few days after the election, he had met for hours with Mr. Salvini and other senior League officials in Milan urging them to form an alliance with Five Star.Mr. Bannon said he told Mr. Salvini, \u201cYou are the first guys who can really break the left and right paradigm. You can show that populism is the new organizing principle.\u201dHe expressed confidence others in Europe would follow.The League and Five Star both want to renegotiate treaties on budgets, migration and a range of other issues with the European Union. They also want to lift sanctions against Russia and for Italy to move closer to its president, Mr. Putin, who once said he did not need to meddle in the Italian election because it was all going his way.The political breakthrough between Five Star and the League seemed both inevitable and frustratingly out of reach.An inconclusive election led to months of stalemate. Mr. Mattarella threatened to form a caretaker government, which triggered the formation of an alliance between the Five Star and League parties. After weeks of intense negotiations, they presented a prime minister and a cabinet that Mr. Mattarella rejected.The president was about to exercise his authority to create a caretaker government but held off, as the populist parties struggled to give it another shot.Mr. Di Maio, 31, triumphant after his party claimed a third of the March vote, was this week reduced to imploring Mr. Salvini to abandon his calls for another election. With grumbling growing inside his own party, Mr. Di Maio needed help forming a government.Ultimately, Mr. Salvini, with a performance Machiavelli would be proud of, accepted and gained plenty of influence in the government.In the hours immediately following the official announcement about the new government, Mr. Salvini returned triumphantly to his northern Italian base.He said he looked forward to \u201csnipping\u201d the billions of euros in the Italian budget reserved for \u201cmaintaining immigrants in the country.\u201dIn a retort to the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who suggested that Italians must work harder and be less corrupt, Mr. Salvini made clear that the days of Italy going \u201chat in hand\u201d to Brussels were over.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letting Sprint and T-Mobile Merge Is a Terrible Idea", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in\u00a0antitrust and telecommunications.T-Mobile, the self-proclaimed \u201cuncarrier,\u201d has done an admirable job of attacking termination fees, abusive contracts and other mistreatment \u2014 often outperforming regulators as an agent of consumer protection. Sprint, meanwhile, has come to excel in its role as a price-cutting maverick. Allow me to advertise for Sprint: Did you know that it offers a service for $60 with an unlimited data plan?In short, competition has actually worked the way economists say it is supposed to, forcing firms to improve quality or face elimination. But it takes competitors to compete, which is where blocking mergers comes in. That\u2019s a point well demonstrated by the case of the airline industry, where the government let the mergers happen. Over the last decade, Delta was allowed to buy Northwest, United to buy Continental, and American to buy US Airways, leaving behind just three majors. What happened next demonstrates the \u201ccurse of triopoly\u201d in all its terrible glory.If the 2010s were good years for mobile customers, they have not been happy years for airline passengers. Instead, the three major airlines spent the same period finding ways to give less for more: fewer flights (more crowded planes), smaller seats, fewer flight attendants, higher baggage and change fees and a stubborn resistance to lowering fares, even as oil prices plummeted. All this was made possible, indeed easy, given limited competition, for there was no \u201cunairline\u201d of national stature to keep the airlines honest. (Southwest came closest.) As a result, the airline industry has become astonishingly profitable \u2014 last year it made more than $5 billion in baggage and change fees alone \u2014 while the mistreatment of consumers has become a regular feature of the evening news.Granted, spending on infrastructure is important; but killing competitors is an irresponsible way to try and promote it. As history shows and as the antitrust laws dictate, the United States does better by betting on the competitive process.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the air carrier that American Airlines merged with.

The Vatican in particular has been watched closely for signs it could switch, as China\u2019s historically confrontational ties with the Roman Catholic Church have eased somewhat in recent months.\u201cToday\u2019s event will create a stream of diplomatic switching from Taipei in a matter of months, if not in years,\u201d Richard W.

{"Headline": "The Next New Thing in Finance \u2014 Bonds Linked Directly to the Economy", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewWhen the next big recession comes, we\u2019ll be much better off if governments have established a new kind of bond tied to the ups and downs of the economy.In fact, just such a financial innovation is almost ready for the marketplace.The investment vehicle, called a G.D.P.-linked bond because it is tied to fluctuations in a country\u2019s gross domestic product, would be immensely valuable to cash-strapped governments when revenue fell and debt-service costs climbed. In those circumstances, payments on G.D.P.-linked bonds would decline. That\u2019s because the bonds automatically reduce debt payments as the economy weakens, a boon to governments but not obviously a good thing for investors.In boom times, on the other hand, investors would profit as national economies grow and payouts on the bonds increase. If G.D.P-linked bonds had been on the market, global investors could have cashed in on the rapid growth of China\u2019s economy over the past few decades by buying the Chinese version of such bonds. This would not have been the same as investing in Chinese stocks, which would have represented a claim only on earnings of then-traded corporations based in China.The idea behind these bonds may seem strange. But many financial innovations that are now commonplace also seemed strange at one time.Consider the inflation-linked bonds known as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or T.I.P.S. They are standard, unexciting and very useful now. But that wasn\u2019t always the case.Many people are interested in buying them now.In December, T.I.P.S. accounted for 9 percent of the federal debt held by the public, or more than $1 trillion. While inflation is low now, people perceive that there remains a risk it could rise, which has sustained a strong market for those bonds.Basically, once the market sets an appropriate price for G.D.P.-linked bonds, their benefits are straightforward.From the Treasury\u2019s standpoint, the bonds would be helpful in a major financial crisis, when economic growth, inflation and tax revenue fall but conventional debt stays burdensome. Without G.D.P.-linked bonds \u2014 or extraordinary intervention by government or multilateral institutions, as happened in the most recent global financial crisis \u2014 a nation can find itself at risk of default.In a crisis like that, investors would suffer as bond payments declined. In expansions, however, investors would benefit. In the United States, for example, bondholders can probably expect strong long-term growth in gross domestic product, which has risen 3.2 percent a year in real dollars, or 6.1 percent in nominal dollars, since 1929. Foreign investors should want such bonds to diversify their holdings.Purchases of G.D.P.-linked bonds by investors outside the United States would be good for the American government because foreigners would be assuming part of this country\u2019s economic risks from all causes, including global warming.Furthermore, if countries around the world issued G.D.P.-linked bonds, truly diversified global portfolios would be possible, allowing investors to share in risk and to benefit from growth. Modern finance tells us that this would lead to safer, not riskier portfolios.Some technical details still need to be worked out.It is not clear, for example, how credit rating agencies would rate these new bonds. They do not rate equities today and might conclude that individual G.D.P.-linked bonds were too similar to stocks in their risk/return profiles to permit a bond rating.One legal issue to be resolved is whether G.D.P.-linked bonds would come with provisions that allowed disputes to be settled by a vote of a supermajority of investors, who have come to expect this protection from so-called collective action clauses in other types of sovereign bonds.Specifically, a trill would pay an annual dividend equal to one trillionth of that particular year\u2019s G.D.P., and would do so without any end date. This would define the bonds in a transparent way, implying that they are natural extensions of stock markets, which are also perpetual. The trills would go even further because they encompass everything that goes on in an economy.The remaining issues need not be major obstacles. In fact, an advanced country\u2019s government could issue G.D.P.-linked bonds now, setting an example for others to follow. Eventually, a vibrant market for the bonds could exist worldwide.Once that happens, we can use G.D.P.-linked bonds as diversification tools, providing another way to protect vulnerable people and governments against economic fluctuations. One day, we may well take these bonds for granted, as if they had always existed.An earlier version of this article misstated the year John Y. Campbell and Robert J. Shiller wrote a research paper about inflation-linked bonds known as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or T.I.P.S. It was 1996, not 1966.Robert J.

Doctors, philanthropists and companies are trying to solve it. Supported byPANIPAT, India \u2014 Shivam Kumar\u2019s failing eyesight was manageable at first. To better see the chalkboard, the 12-year-old moved to the front of the classroom, but in time, the indignities piled up.Increasingly blurry vision forced him to give up flying kites and then cricket, after he was repeatedly whacked by balls he could no longer see. The constant squinting gave him headaches, and he came to dread walking home from school.\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t see a motorbike until it\u2019s almost in my face,\u201d he said.As his grades flagged, so did his dreams of becoming a pilot. \u201cYou can\u2019t fly a plane if you\u2019re blind,\u201d he noted glumly.The fix for Shivam\u2019s declining vision, it turns out, was remarkably simple.He needed glasses.Then there are the tens of millions of children like Shivam across the world whose families cannot afford an eye exam or the prescription eyeglasses that would help them excel in school.The initiative\u2019s backers point out that responding to the world\u2019s vision crisis does not require the invention of new drugs or solving nettlesome issues like distributing refrigerated vaccines in countries with poor infrastructure. Factories in Thailand, China and the Philippines can manufacture so-called readers for less than 50 cents a pair; prescription glasses that correct nearsightedness can be produced for $1.50. But money alone won\u2019t easily solve systemic challenges faced by countries like Uganda, which has just 45 eye doctors for a nation of 41 million. In rural India, glasses are seen as a sign of infirmity, and in many places, a hindrance for young women seeking to get married. Until last year, Liberia did not have a single eye clinic.\u201cPeople in rural areas have never even seen a child wearing glasses,\u201d said Ms. Sirleaf, who was president of Liberia from 2006 to this year. \u201cDrivers don\u2019t even know they have a deficiency. They just drive the best they can.\u201dFor most, it was the first time anyone had checked their eyesight. The students were both excited and terrified. Roughly 12 percent were flagged as having weak vision and sent to an adjacent classroom where workers using refractor lenses conducted more tests.Shivam, the boy who dreamed of being a pilot, walked away with a pair of purple-framed spectacles donated by Warby Parker, the American eyewear company, which also paid for the screenings.\u201cEverything is so clear,\u201d Shivam exclaimed as he looked with wonder around the classroom.Anshu Taneja, VisonSpring\u2019s India director, said that providing that first pair of glasses is pivotal; people who have experienced the benefits of corrected vision will often buy a second pair if their prescription changes or they lose the glasses they have come to depend on.Ratan Singh, 45, a sharecropper who recently got his first pair of reading glasses, said he could not imagine living without them now. Standing in a field of ripening wheat, he said his inability to see tiny pests on the stalks of his crop had led to decreasing yields. He sheepishly recalled the time he sprayed the wrong insecticide because he couldn\u2019t read the label. \u201cI was always asking other people to help me read but I was becoming a burden,\u201d he said.Last month, after he accidentally broke his glasses, Mr. Singh, who supports his wife and six daughters, did not hesitate to fork out the 60 rupees, roughly 90 cents, for a new pair.That\u2019s what happened to D.

His failing eyesight also made it hard to drive or respond to text messages from customers and co-workers.Mr. Periyanayakam returned to work that day with a $2 pair of glasses. He was among 400 people who showed up at a daylong clinic in a high school run by ophthalmologists, lens grinders and vision screeners.Aravind dispenses 600,000 pairs of glasses each year in India and has expanded its efforts to Nepal, Bangladesh and countries in Africa through local partners.\u201cThese men are always on the move and they are pressed for time, so we try to make it as easy as possible for them,\u201d said Ameen, a Sightsaver employee who uses a single name.On a recent morning, dozens of drivers, many wearing flip-flops and oil-stained trousers, lined up in front of an eye chart taped to the wall of a trucking company in the town of Chapraula. Asked why they had waited so long to have their vision checked, some shrugged. Others said they were too busy. A few cited fears they would be fired if an employer discovered that their vision was flawed.About half the men, it turned out, needed glasses. They included Jagdish Prasad, 55, a father of nine with a deeply lined face who had never had his eyes tested.\u201cI haven\u2019t had an accident in 35 years,\u201d Mr. Prasad exclaimed \u2014 but then reluctantly admitted that he has lately been squinting to see whether a traffic light had changed.Then he gestured to the cavalcade of honking vehicles behind him and told a story. Four days earlier, he said, a mentally ill man had been lying on the edge of the road, forcing drivers to swerve to avoid him. One of those vehicles, a truck not unlike his own, tried to avoid the man but ended up killing two students who were crossing the road on their way to school. The next day, the mentally ill man was also struck and killed, Mr. Prasad said.He paused and then considered the piece of paper in his hand. It contained the prescription for his first pair of glasses. Mr. Prasad hesitated and then gently placed it in his pocket.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Cuts Car Tariffs, in a Small Offering to the U.S. on Trade", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China has carried out a pledge to cut tariffs on imported cars and car parts, the latest move by Beijing to ease trade tensions with the United States. The American auto industry and its workers, however, might be unimpressed.The moves are intended to address longstanding complaints from the Trump administration and global automakers that China\u2019s tariffs on imported cars are much too high. Those tariffs are one reason \u2014 though by no means the only reason \u2014 that global automakers like Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen have built enormous factories in China over the past two decades. Those factories, built and run with Chinese joint venture partners, have helped make China by far the world\u2019s largest automaker.Chinese tariffs will still be relatively high, however, and the change is unlikely to motivate automakers to shift production away from China. The United States has a tariff of 2.5 percent on cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles, for example, although it has a 25 percent tariff on imported pickup trucks. Global automakers have also grown comfortable making cars in China, where sales have boomed.The drop \u201cis a significant reduction, but it really won\u2019t have much of an effect\u201d on where automakers assemble vehicles, said James Chao, the chief Asia auto analyst at IHS Markit.By cutting the tariff on imported car parts more than on imported cars, China may actually strengthen its role as the world\u2019s largest car-assembling nation.Lower tariffs on imported components will make it more attractive for global manufacturers to do much of their final assembly in China, since they will not have to pay as much to import high-tech parts made elsewhere.Cementing China\u2019s role as the leading country for car assembly will help Beijing move the economy toward more sophisticated industries that can provide well-paid jobs for an increasingly well-educated population. Through a process Chinese officials call supply-side reforms, they hope to close older, smokestack industries that offer little more than low wages and high pollution.Tariffs will be reduced, the Finance Ministry said in a statement, \u201cin order to further expand reform and opening up, promote supply-side structural reforms, promote the transformation and upgrading of the auto industry, and meet the people\u2019s consumer demand.\u201dIt also hopes to ramp up exports of cars made in China, and reducing its own tariffs makes it less likely that Chinese-made cars will be hit by retaliatory tariffs.German luxury carmakers and German manufacturers of high-technology brakes could also be winners. While all of the world\u2019s major auto parts manufacturers now have extensive operations in China, a handful of the most sophisticated components, notably advanced braking systems, are made only in Germany.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is scheduled to meet Mr. Xi in Beijing this week. The Chinese government is eager to gain her support in its trade struggles with the Trump administration, at a time when Germany\u2019s business elite is deeply worried about Chinese acquisitions in the robotics and auto parts sectors.Ford still exports some Lincolns to China, and Tesla exports large numbers of electric cars to China despite the current tariff. General Motors has already moved to China practically all of its production for the Chinese market, including Cadillacs, which are now made in Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Dangerous Global Retreat", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistShould anyone seriously care that Germany, with the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, would be unable to defend itself in the event of war, much less fulfill its treaty obligations to NATO? Not if all you can think about is how Donald Trump is going to squirm out of one potentially incriminating lie by inventing another.But Vladimir Putin undoubtedly cares, and so does Trump. It\u2019s a toxic combination.Germany\u2019s persistent, deliberate military weakness is a reminder of just how unprepared much of the world is for the continued unraveling of global order, characterized by two pronounced trends: emboldened dictatorships and risk-averse, inward-looking democracies.Against this stands an American president whose governing foreign policy instincts are bluster and retreat.In the last month or so, Trump has said he wants to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria that are now the chief deterrent against the Turks, though France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron seems to have persuaded him not to remove them yet. The administration\u2019s trade negotiators are forcing a renegotiation of Nafta that appears to be calculated to invite rejection by legislatures in Mexico or Canada, and maybe the U.S. Congress, too. If they do, Trump could declare the trade pact a dead letter, whether or not that\u2019s legal.Why now? Part of the answer is that Trump is trying to force Seoul to foot more of the bill for the U.S. military presence. But Seoul already pays half the U.S. costs and fields one of the largest armies in the world. Unlike Germany, it is no military deadbeat.A likelier answer is that Trump sees American withdrawal as an achievement in its own right and hopes a peace treaty with the North is his ticket.This is the kind of classic diplomatic blunder that, had it been committed by a Democratic president, would have produced thunderous denunciations from people like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo. Here\u2019s an administration squeezing a close ally while telegraphing our negotiating terms to a deadly enemy. Expect Pyongyang to demand substantial U.S. withdrawals as its price for promises of peace and denuclearization. Beijing, which has long aimed to push the U.S. out of East Asia, will be thrilled.Let\u2019s close with some questions for the president\u2019s right-wing supporters.Does Trump have any larger goal in Korea other than to find a pretext for a military exit and gain a moment of glory along the way?Does he have a detailed strategy toward Iran other than to renounce the nuclear deal and hope for better terms?Is the plan for Syria to let Assad \u2014 and his Iranian and Russian patrons \u2014 win, and let the Israelis and other U.S. allies deal with the fallout?Is there a concept for a North American trade regime should Nafta collapse?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now Even Japan Is Pushing Back Against Trump\u2019s Tariffs", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Friday, Japan notified the World Trade Organization that it was reserving the right to impose retaliatory tariffs against the United States in response to tariffs on steel and aluminum imports proposed by President Trump.Japan has not yet filed a formal complaint with the W.T.O., but is signaling that it could impose the retaliatory measures if it does not gain tariff exemptions that it has been seeking from Washington.\u201cThis is Japan basically readying itself for a trade war,\u201d said Jeffrey Wilson, a research fellow at the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cThis is saying, \u2018O.K., Japan can say no to the United States.\u2019\u201dJapan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it would decide whether to impose counter tariffs on U.S. goods \u201cafter carefully examining the U.S. relevant measures and their impacts on Japanese industries.\u201dIt said that the United States tariffs would result in duties of 50 billion yen on Japanese exports to the United States. It did not specify what American products it would target for retaliatory tariffs.It appears Japan may be going the other way. After weeks of trying to persuade Washington to grant an exemption from the steel and aluminum tariffs, Tokyo may also be trying to send a more strident message that it does not want to engage in bilateral trade talks.The steel and aluminum tariffs are unlikely to put that much of a dent in Japan\u2019s economy. The country\u2019s steel exports to the United States represent just 5 percent of its total steel exports, and it produces very little aluminum. Officials have said that they expect American manufacturers to continue to demand the highly specialized steel parts that Japan produces.But Japan is adamantly opposed to a bilateral deal, and the threat of retaliatory measures against American imports to Japan could give Japan leverage when resisting the Trump administration\u2019s pressure for a two-way trade deal.Mr. Abe has demurred firmly but politely, indicating that Japan would like to stick to the broad trade pact among 11 countries known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal from which Mr. Trump withdrew the United States his first week in office. Japan\u2019s lower house ratified the deal on Friday.Japan led the effort to salvage the agreement among the 11 remaining countries after the American retreat, but has always maintained that the United States would be welcome to return on the original terms agreed to by the Obama administration.Analysts in Japan said that over the 16 months that Mr. Trump has been in office, Mr. Abe\u2019s government has learned how to deal with the mercurial president.\u201cThe Japanese government is starting to feel that the appeasement tactics aren\u2019t really working,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors. \u201cActually taking countermeasures may work better.\u201dMr. Okubo added that Mr. Abe was most likely \u201cquite disappointed by the relatively cool, or even cold, treatment by President Trump\u201d in recent weeks.For Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office, Mr. Abe\u2019s close personal relationship helped stave off the American president\u2019s long-percolating economic ire toward Japan.After he was elected, his bark seemed worse than his bite. But with the steel and aluminum tariffs, and increasing pressure to open bilateral trade talks, Japan has started to resist.Senior Japanese officials have insisted that the government is not interested in a two-way trade deal. Last month, Toshimitsu Motegi, Japan\u2019s minister of economic and fiscal policy, told reporters that \u201cwe don\u2019t have a bilateral free-trade agreement in our mind\u201d and said plans for talks between Mr. Motegi and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, were not intended as a step toward any bilateral agreement.The Trump administration, by contrast, has broadcast the president\u2019s desire for a one-on-one pact with Japan.Analysts said that Japan may have at first chosen to avoid provoking Mr. Trump. But \u201cthey have seen how this playbook goes, and they can be a little more confident in bluff calling,\u201d Mr. Wilson of the Perth USAsia Center said.Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Good for Pharma Isn\u2019t Good for America (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistBut promise-breaking aside, would introducing a policy of bargaining drug prices down have been good for America? Actually, yes.Oddly, I never got around to doing my homework on the economics of drug-price bargaining \u2013 partly because I was realistic enough about the political economy to realize that it wasn\u2019t going to happen in America any time soon. Still, the fact that Trump promised to do something makes it somewhat relevant, even if he did predictably break that promise. And it turns out that the economic case for doing what Trump just didn\u2019t do, for putting caps on drug prices, is remarkably strong.[Personal note: why am I doing this on a Saturday night? Because I just finished two days of meeting with men in gray suits talking about money and banking, I have to leave for the airport at 4:45 AM tomorrow, and I\u2019m about to order in room service and go to bed. Life of the party, me.]Let\u2019s start with where things are right now. After a drug company gets a patent, it has a temporary monopoly on sales of its drug. So its situation looks like that of a standard monopolist, as shown in Figure 1:It charges a price that is above the marginal cost of producing the drug \u2013 usually well above marginal cost. Nonetheless, consumers gain from the drug\u2019s availability: the marginal consumer is willing to pay the drug\u2019s price, and all the inframarginal consumers gain consumer surplus. Meanwhile, the drug company makes a profit, which is also a gain to the economy (although we haven\u2019t deducted the cost of developing the drug; more about that in a minute.)So overall, society gains from the drug\u2019s existence. However, as Figure 2 shows, society would gain more if someone \u2013 regulators, purchasing managers at government agencies, whatever \u2013 forced the drug company to charge less than the monopoly price:Consumer surplus would rise; the drug company would earn less profit per unit sold, but this would be partially offset by the profits earned on increased sales. Overall welfare would rise by the green-shaded area.But wait: wouldn\u2019t bargaining drug prices down reduce the incentive to develop new drugs? And wouldn\u2019t this mean in some cases forgoing the welfare gains that come about, even with unregulated monopoly, from the mere fact that a drug becomes available?Yes, it would. But despite this effect, the United States would almost certainly be better off with a moderate level of bargaining/price control than it is under the current hands-off regime. Why? I count at least four distinct reasons.Finally, it\u2019s a global market \u2013 which means that much of the consumer surplus from drug development accrues to foreigners, not U.S. citizens. Maybe there should be more drug development from the point of view of global welfare. But given the unique unwillingness of the U.S. to bargain over prices, we end up paying a much larger share of the costs of that development than we receive of the benefits. Funny how Trump is America first on everything, except when a nationalist position might be bad for Big Pharma.Yes, Trump says he wants to force other countries to raise drug prices. Good luck on that.What this comes down to is that there is a very strong case for doing what Trump promised to do but didn\u2019t. I\u2019m aware that simply saying \u201clet\u2019s bargain over drug prices\u201d isn\u2019t effective unless coupled with a willingness to say no \u2013 to tell a drug company that an overpriced drug will be excluded from the formulary. So it wouldn\u2019t be politically easy. But it would be good economics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Wealth Gap Hits Families the Hardest", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe writers study demographic changes in families and social inequality.What does economic inequality really look like?Income alone doesn\u2019t give a complete picture. Income inequality describes the gap between a six-figure salary and minimum wage. But the more alarming gap occurs in wealth \u2014 a household\u2019s total assets minus debts. To understand how inequality is playing out in the United States, we need to look more closely at the wealth gap.The extreme wealth inequality we have identified is a result of years of policies that have eroded both public spending and private income for families with children.The demographer Samuel Preston warned in 1984 that the United States had made \u201ca set of private and public choices that have dramatically altered the age profile of well-being,\u201d by devoting resources toward improving conditions for the elderly while neglecting to do the same for families with children. \u201cThe constituency for children in public decisions simply appears too feeble to fight back,\u201d he wrote.We are seeing the consequences of these policies now, and they will follow today\u2019s children throughout their lives.Unlike income, which can change quickly because of a booming economy or a rise in the minimum wage, changes in wealth usually happen slowly. The recently passed tax law, for example, may increase your take-home pay, but it\u2019s unlikely to increase the value of your house.To understand how wealth and wealth inequality have changed among families with children and elderly households, we examined data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances, a large survey conducted approximately every three years that catalogs the total assets and debt of American households.The data we used comes from several thousand representative households in each of the nine survey years between 1989 and 2013. We examined the wealth of households headed by someone age 65 or older, and families headed by someone under age 65 and with children under age 18.Our research shows that in terms of wealth, those over 65 have weathered the past quarter-century much better than families with children, despite two major recessions. The net worth of older people\u2019s households increased by 45 percent from 1989 to 2013. And for the past 25 years, the distance between the rich elderly and the poor elderly remained stable. The very wealthiest elderly households grew richer, but so did those of working-class and middle-class older people.Families with children fared worse as a group. Overall, their wealth declined by 56 percent in the same period. More important, they also faced a wide and growing divide: Wealth inequality for these households grew significantly from 1989 to 2013. The top 1 percent saw their wealth increase by 156 percent, while parents in the bottom half saw their wealth shrink by 260 percent. About a third of all families with children in 2013 had no wealth, only debt.In 2013, the top 1 percent of these families had a median wealth of $5.1 million, thanks to skyrocketing incomes, increasing home values and strong returns on stocks and investments. They have millions in savings and generous trust funds for their children.Families on the bottom rungs live very differently. They may not even own a home, and if they face an unexpected expense, like a medical emergency, they don\u2019t have a cushion of savings or other assets to draw on. And when their children start college, some of these parents may still be paying off their own student loans.Why are so many parents with children faring so poorly? In part, it\u2019s a result of long-term changes in employment. Over the period we studied, employment became more unstable, as companies replaced full-time jobs with part-time work and short-term contracts. These employment changes affected families with children more than the elderly, who are mostly retired. That means not only less income but also less money to save or invest in homes or other wealth-producing assets.The other problem for families with children is debt: not credit card or car loan debt, which hasn\u2019t changed much since the late 1980s, but student loan and mortgage debt.Education debt has been rising throughout the period in our study, in part because federal Pell Grants failed to keep up with rising tuition costs. Pell Grants now cover only 29 percent of the cost of a four-year degree at a public college, the lowest percentage on record. Even earning a two-year degree at a community college usually means taking on debt.In the mid-2000s, housing debt also started to rise, especially as subprime lenders opened the housing market to more first-time buyers. After the collapse of the housing market, home prices were down one-third from their pre-recession peak. For many families, that wiped out the value of their main asset.Why did older households fare better? First, older Americans\u2019 incomes were largely stable. Their primary source of income, Social Security, is indexed to inflation. With stable income, fewer older people dipped into savings to pay their bills, and they had more money to invest. Second, most of them bought their homes before the housing bubble, and third, they graduated from college before the era of high student loan debt. Thanks to these three factors, the median net worth of poor and middle-class older people rose by 70 percent from 1989 to 2013.There are a few policy changes that may help. Increasing the purchasing power of Pell Grants and then indexing it to rising tuition costs would be a start. The government could also expand tax credits that benefit families, and compensate families who were victims of predatory lending practices.But the magnitude of the problem is so great that these measures are not enough. The United States needs a fundamental rethinking of public policy priorities to improve the lives of the next generation of children.Christina Gibson-Davis is an associate professor of public policy at Duke.

These giants are popular, because they provide good products and service.

Their size gave them too much power \u2014 to eliminate competition, raise prices, hold down wages and influence politics. So the government passed laws to restrain businesses and occasionally broke up the largest, like Standard Oil and AT&T.The book business is looking like a case study. Amazon is taking over, yet has never run into antitrust scrutiny. It has reduced prices, after all. It sells many e-books for $9.99 and hardcover best sellers at a big discount.

Within that broader group, tech-sector employees proved particularly effective in sustaining the demonstrations.They used messaging apps like Telegram to coordinate protests. They snarled traffic by organizing infinite loops of pedestrians at street crossings not controlled by traffic lights. They donated money for simple things like a sound system and water at Republic Square, the center of the protests.Tech workers described a kind of collective mental shifting of gears as they joined the demonstrations. They realized that by acting in unison, they might finally jettison the stifling one-party control over the government and the economy that their country had inherited from the Soviet Union.\u201cThe new generation had never seen communism; they did not grow up with pictures of Lenin or Stalin or Brezhnev,\u201d said Arsen Gevorgyan, 44, a co-founder of a software company, SFL. \u201cThe new generation is more active. They saw the internet, they saw Europe, they saw democracy.\u201dThe countries of the former Soviet Union have seen many such \u201crevolutions\u201d over the years since the bloc collapsed. Ukraine and Georgia, in particular, have thrown out the old guard on more than one occasion, only to find themselves drifting back, often with the Kremlin\u2019s encouragement.Just a few years ago, there would not have been enough tech workers in Armenia to make a difference. Now, with at least 10,000 mostly well-paid employees in a booming sector of an otherwise stagnant economy, they believe they have the clout to press their demands for democracy, transparency and accountability.Census figures are somewhat inexact in Armenia, a small country in the south Caucasus, but they show that at least 370,000 people emigrated in the last decade. The last census, in 2011, when the population was somewhat higher than the estimated 2.8 million today, indicated that some 45 percent of the population was under age 30.The anti-government zeal among young tech workers was unexpected given their reputation for focusing more on the virtual world than the real one.Plus, abandoning work to protest was not easy to explain to companies overseas that had commissioned projects. \u201cIt is kind of hard to tell them, \u2018You know there is a revolution here, we cannot work this week,\u2019 \u201d said Vahe Evoyan, 30, a physicist and computer programmer.But as the demonstrations swelled, many tech workers recognized that his was a now-or-never moment.Armine Hakobyan, 26, a digital marketing specialist at SFL, said she began thinking about what kind of life her 18-month-old son would have if Armenia remained the same. \u201cIt did not start on the street; it was something that happened in your mind,\u201d she said. \u201cYou realized that you have to take care of your future.\u201dIt helped that the tech sector is relatively oligarch-free. Armenia is a land of monopolies, with the government doling out exclusive control over various businesses. But the traditional powers had few means to pressure the tech sector.Moreover, anger and discontent among the young had been building for years.The oligarchs had sold the population on the idea that poverty and poor roads were among the sacrifices necessary to build a strong army. Then Armenia lost territory in the 2016 war, and there were reports that soldiers lacked basic items like bullets and medical kits.\u201cThe government ate everything that was supposed to be used to supply the army,\u201d said Samvel Mkrtchyan, 24, a quality-control engineer at Inomma, a small start-up company.As the young people evaluated the leadership more critically, they realized how the ruling Republican Party mirrored the old Communist Party. It controlled the courts and the education system, and you had to be a member to get anywhere in government.\u201cWe would go out for lunch and never come back, we just stayed on the street,\u201d said Mr. Mkrtchyan.The government helped with a series of ham-handed responses to the protests, which started in earnest on April 17. That is when Serzh Sargsyan, the president since 2008, tried to bypass term limits by becoming prime minister under a new Constitution that transferred most political power to that office \u2014 after having promised not to take the job.As the protests grew, he warned darkly of a repeat of the events of March 1, 2008, when soldiers opened fire on demonstrators after what many considered a tainted election win for Mr. Sargsyan, killing 10.Like many of her peers, who had been traumatized by the bloodshed a decade ago, Ms. Petrosyan was enraged by the threat, making her eager to protest even more.\u201cFrom the first day that I went out onto the street I understood that something powerful was happening,\u201d said Ms. Petrosyan. \u201cWe all understood that it is not just a question of planting a tree or keeping up a street, but knowing that our government is outdated and that we needed to change it.\u201dHer employer, PicsArt \u2014 where the average age of the 350 employees is 24, and about half are women \u2014 had always considered itself a good corporate citizen, subsidizing education for the disadvantaged, among other things. Management there, and at various companies big and small, looking around at all the empty desks, bowed to the inevitable.On April 19, SFL helped to establish a private chat room on Telegram to discuss shared tactics. By the end of the night it had 800 members representing some 20 tech companies, and a plan to block streets simultaneously at 11 a.m. the next day.Companies with hundreds of employees like Synopsys and PicsArt gave their workers leave to go out, as did smaller firms. Managers made it clear that it was an individual choice, and that those who did not participate would not be ostracized.Nobody was sure the protests would succeed. \u201cAt first we did not really understand the demands of the process or where it was leading,\u201d said Mher Sargsyan, 28, the lead software engineer at SFL. \u201cBut I really want to stay here and to do my best to change everything around me.\u201dThat sentiment was not limited to the tech sector, with countless others blocking streets across the city. The younger generation, especially the high percentage of women who participated, are ecstatic that the protests succeeded, with many saying they want to maintain that effervescent feeling of potential change by doing volunteer work.Most of all, they are staying put.When the demonstrations first began, Vigen Sargsyan, 37, a developer at Inomma, the start-up, was halfway through submitting the paperwork needed to move to Canada.Then he joined the protests, including blocking a street with his 1994 black Zhiguli, a small Russian sedan.He has since abandoned his effort to emigrate. \u201cNow, everything has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted my country to be someplace where I wanted to live.

{"Headline": "Now Free, Malaysia\u2019s Anwar Ibrahim Attacks System That Jailed Him Twice", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday, the two men, after years of bad blood and the imprisonment of Mr. Anwar, have retaken their places at the top of Malaysian politics: Mr. Mahathir is prime minister once again, at age 92, and Mr. Anwar, newly pardoned by the country\u2019s king on Wednesday, is waiting to inherit the leadership.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Anwar, 70, newly free after five years of detention, vowed that ending the influence of politics over the country\u2019s justice system would be a priority.\u201cWe must stop this once and for all,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most significant lesson one can learn from prison life is the value of freedom.\u201dHe has twice been deprived of his freedom, both times in what was widely seen as political manipulation coming from the leadership of the governing party, the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, which at one point included Mr. Mahathir, Mr. Anwar and Mr. Najib among its top ranks.Mr. Anwar had been a top deputy to Mr. Mahathir, who was prime minister from 1981 to 2003, and was seen as his likely successor. But after a falling-out between the two in 1998, over how to respond to the Asian financial crisis, Mr. Mahathir fired Mr. Anwar as deputy prime minister.He began his protest movement against Mr. Mahathir and UMNO, and was quickly arrested and convicted of corruption and sodomy. Human rights groups and his supporters say those cases were trumped-up at the behest of Mr. Mahathir, who after the arrest publicly condemned Mr. Anwar, saying, \u201cI cannot accept a man who is a sodomist as leader of the country.\u201dMr. Anwar was released in 2004 and elected to Parliament in 2008 after the five-year restriction on his return to politics expired. That year, he was again accused of sodomy under a British-era law that human rights groups say is archaic. That case was also seen as being manipulated by his political rivals, including Mr. Najib, who became prime minister in 2009.After years of suspension and legal jeopardy, he was sentenced to five years in prison on a sodomy charge in 2015. Originally scheduled to leave detention in June, he instead walked free on Wednesday morning.He left Cheras Rehabilitation Hospital in Kuala Lumpur, the capital, where he was recovering from shoulder surgery, at 11:30 a.m. along with his wife, Dr. Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who is to become deputy prime minister.Mobbed by well-wishers, the two got into a vehicle together to travel to the royal palace, where they had an audience with Malaysia\u2019s king, Sultan Muhammad V, who made it official: Mr. Anwar had been fully pardoned, lifting a statutory five-year ban on his political activity and allowing him to pursue elected office quickly.The ouster of Mr. Najib last week marked the first time UMNO had been out of power since Malaysia\u2019s independence from Britain in 1957. Many voters said they were upset about reports of widespread corruption, including accusations of the misappropriation of billions of dollars from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state fund he once led.On Tuesday evening, the government released the executive summary of a 2016 report by the country\u2019s Auditor General, a ministry, which Mr. Mahathir said Saturday would be declassified. While the contents of the report had been previously reported, the release showed the new commitment to transparency on the case. The Auditor General\u2019s website was down most of the evening, apparently from high traffic.While Mr. Anwar is now free, much more must happen before he could become prime minister. First, he must become a member of Parliament. Dr. Azizah has said in recent months that she could step down and allow him to run for her seat in a by-election, just as she did in 2008.\u201cI am overjoyed with his release,\u201d said Maria Chin Abdullah, an advocate of government reform who was elected to Parliament last week.\u201cThe nation is ready to enter into its democratic reformation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe certainly need someone like Anwar to help heal this nation and unite the various parties.\u201dMr. Anwar gave little indication of when he might return to office. He said that he planned to first travel and give lectures at universities around the world.\u201cI think I have a small contribution to make to show that the voice of reason and moderation in Islam is paramount, and, No. 2, that Muslims can also be counted upon to ensure that there is freedom and justice for all citizens,\u201d he said.Mr. Anwar said he had forgiven Mr. Mahathir for turning on him two decades ago.\u201cHe supports the reform agenda,\u201d Mr. Anwar said. \u201cHe has facilitated my release. Why would I harbor any malice toward him?\u201dDespite Mr. Mahathir\u2019s autocratic past, many of his former rivals have said they believe Dr. M, as the physician turned politician is informally known, is a changed leader, more concerned with polishing his legacy than amassing power.But he and Mr. Anwar must still show they can cooperate, said Terence Gomez, a professor of political economy at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur.\u201cIs this an alliance where these two men are comfortable with each other? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cThey came together because of the common need to get rid of Najib. Having succeeded in doing so, now comes the difficult part of reinventing their relationship to one that is truly workable.\u201dSharon Tan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Then they use meth at night to stay awake, he said, because they have nowhere to sleep.In Brooklyn last winter, Jonathan Roman recounted how employers took advantage of him, knowing he was desperate for money. His dealer used to pick him up after work on payday and take him straight to the ATM.In Frenchburg, Ky., on the first day of spring last year, Wendy Collins fought back tears as she said that 30 of her friends had died from opioid overdoses.I\u2019ve traveled all over the country in recent years as a national correspondent and political reporter with the goal of hearing from people and vulnerable communities who feel abandoned or left behind. Along the way I have spoken to a lot of people about heroin and painkiller addictions.Distance, I\u2019ve learned, isn\u2019t the only barrier we have to cross in writing about this crisis. It can be even harder to cross conceptual ones, to think beyond stereotypes and the stories we have already written.That\u2019s been true outside rural dollar stores, in urban laundromats, at suburban Walmarts.Going to Humboldt County took me in directions I didn\u2019t expect. I was there to talk about heroin, but every person in the community also wanted to talk about homelessness and needle litter. Methamphetamine abuse and the struggling economy were never far away from the conversation either. I had no idea, from the opioid death data I was viewing, that these public health crises had collided in such a way.Late last year, I began to dig into the surge of opioid-related deaths in the Bronx, which had not received significant attention in the mainstream press but has devastated the borough. The Bronx is just a subway ride north of Manhattan, but is an entire world away in many people\u2019s imaginations. When I first started looking into the community\u2019s struggles with opioids, several people assured me that the Bronx had always had a problem with heroin and that it wasn\u2019t surprising.The story was much, much more complicated. Certainly there was a long history of drug use in the Bronx, but opioid-related deaths were in fact on a downward trend until a shocking and persistent increase at the beginning of the decade.What was behind the rise? A pipeline of cheaper, stronger heroin entering the United States; a surge of supply in the Bronx, where many more people were becoming addicted; and the emergence of the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl in the drug supply. Community activists and leaders were desperate for help but struggled to get much compassion or attention.Adriana Pericchi, a community health worker, said something to me while sitting at a McDonald\u2019s that I thought spoke eloquently to the shared despair wrought by opioids across all types of communities.\u201cA lot of us are doing our best, but it\u2019s just not enough, it\u2019s not enough,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re mourning for one particular person who you knew and loved.

Moody\u2019s currently gives Italy a Baa2 rating, its second lowest \u201cinvestment grade\u201d rating.Just the threat of a downgrade is likely to increase pressure on Italy\u2019s government.Moody\u2019s said two main concerns drove its decision. The ratings agency said there was a \u201csignificant risk of a material weakening in Italy\u2019s fiscal strength, given the fiscal plans of the new coalition government.\u201d Moody\u2019s also said there was a risk that overhauls aimed at making Italy\u2019s economy more efficient might now stall.- Peter EavisThe governing coalition\u2019s majority in the upper one \u2014 the Senate \u2014 is slim: six votes. In the course of a sharp increase in borrowing costs triggered by an irresponsible budget (or its anticipation), that majority may well erode quickly.But even if Italy\u2019s government backed away from its policies, the country\u2019s problems \u2014 a high debt load and a sluggish economy \u2013 would remain. It might thus only be a matter of time before Italy again attempts to stand up to the E.U. Some analysts might contend that Italy should soldier on with orthodox, fiscally responsible policies and become more like Spain, whose economy has done well in recent years. But, as Ben Chu, economics editor of The Independent, asserted on Twitter, Italy\u2019s governments in recent years have not been profligate.- Peter EavisUltimately, the incident wasn\u2019t as awkward as it might\u2019ve been \u2014 the couple was discussing hardwood flooring. But it raises questions about the accuracy of the A.I. assistants on these devices, what they do with your data, and how that might be regulated.Misidentification of a wake word by a device \u2014 on Amazon\u2019s, that\u2019s \u201cAlexa\u201d by default \u2014 automatically sends data to the company\u2019s servers. Why? Because the small speakers don\u2019t have the computing power required to make sense of entire sentences, so that must be done on the cloud.You can\u2019t turn off the always-listening feature of these devices, because, if you could, they wouldn\u2019t be able to respond to your voice, rendering them useless. But misidentification of words can, according to Amazon, set in motion a chain of events that are troubling from a privacy perspective.The question: What happens to that data? And what should these devices be able to do with it?Did you know all that? Maybe not. While companies like Amazon do explain in their terms of service that user data will be stored on servers and used to improve their products, it\u2019s perfectly possible to start using such a device in your home without being alerted to the fact. Data privacy is weakly regulated in the U.S., and there\u2019s no rule that demands Alexa tell you through its speaker what it will do with your data. So many people remain unaware of how their data is being used.Responding to a request for details about the ways in which Amazon is making its Echo devices G.D.P.R.-compliant, a spokesperson told DealBook:\u201cProtecting the privacy of customers has always been a top priority for Amazon. The Alexa privacy settings give customers insight and control over their data; they can use it to easily manage and delete their audio recordings, configure third-party skill permissions, and opt-out of having their voice data used to develop new Alexa features.\u201dSo, that\u2019s Europe. What about the U.S.? Big tech firms \u2014 in particular, Facebook \u2014 say they are responding to those new European rules with policies that will also apply in America. The same is likely to be true of smart speakers.But for now, the best way to control what\u2019s done with your data is to regularly delete the audio recorded by the devices, and opt out of any arrangement that allows the companies to use it to improve their services.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeIt\u2019s not surprising to hear that many C.E.O.s are handsomely paid \u2014 Doug McMillon of Walmart, for example, earned $22 million last year. (That said, the $102 million collected by Frank Bisignano of the credit card processor First Data is still eye-popping.)As part of a bail package negotiated in advance, Mr. Weinstein will have to put up $1 million in cash, surrender his passport and agree to wear an ankle-monitoring device. But the charges may not be the last against him, according to the NYT:An investigative grand jury, still convened, will look into other sexual assault allegations against Mr. Weinstein as well as possible financial crimes relating to how he paid women to stay silent, people familiar with the proceedings said.The auto maker warned owners not to use cruise control until the cars, S.U.V.s and trucks can be fixed with a software update.

Forget Uber versus Lyft. Forget Amazon versus \u2026 well, everybody.The technology world\u2019s most bruising battle for supremacy is taking place in China. And it could point to Big Tech\u2019s future everywhere else, too.Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group are ratcheting up their no-holds-barred contest to dominate the ways 770 million internet users communicate, shop, get around, entertain themselves and even invest their savings and visit the doctor.The two titans long ago branched out from their core businesses \u2014 games and social media for Tencent, e-commerce for Alibaba \u2014 to duke it out in ever more realms of Chinese life. They have competed in messaging, microblogging and delivering takeout. They go head-to-head in video streaming and cloud computing.But in the internet realm, China still offers a spooky potential vision of the future, one in which online behemoths like Tencent and Alibaba become the gatekeepers to the entire economy, wielding immense power over traditional industries and becoming very, very rich in the process.\u201cSometimes I think, \u2018Ah, we\u2019re competing in this now, too? All right then,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ma said, chuckling. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201d\u201cAs profitability reduces, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Now I need to monetize my customer base,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rajgopal said. \u201cThe innovation we\u2019re seeing in China could be seen in the U.S. in the next three to five years,\u201d he added. \u201cCustomers are demanding that.\u201d\u201cIf you can become so big, and so successful in so many areas, this in itself shows that you must have maintained very good, very friendly relations with the government,\u201d Mr. Hu said.Neither giant is done getting bigger.Each has a market capitalization of close to $500 billion, making them among the most highly valued technology firms on the planet. Google and Facebook still claim more users, but the Chinese heavyweights arguably do more \u2014 and more, and more \u2014 for theirs.They have both funded ventures that offer online education, make electric cars and rent out bicycles. For the giants, such initiatives represent new opportunities for people to use their digital wallets \u2014 Ant Financial\u2019s Alipay and Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay \u2014 and new ways to collect data on consumer behavior. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein counted 247 investment deals by Tencent in recent years and 156 by Alibaba, though given the pace of the companies\u2019 deal-making, they said their database was \u201clikely to be perennially incomplete.\u201dOnce the companies have locked people into their payment systems, they can become the enablers of commerce and financial services of even more kinds. In a sign of investors\u2019 excitement about the possibilities, Ant Financial is making plans to go public, in a blockbuster stock offering that could give the company a market value larger than Goldman Sachs\u2019s.China has become a model for tech\u2019s world-swallowing tendencies partly out of circumstance.With the country\u2019s high-speed churn of well-funded start-ups, planting flags on new turf is often the only way for large players not to be constantly losing ground.\u201cThe whole China internet market is way more competitive than the U.S. market,\u201d said Xiaoyan Wang, an analyst at 86Research in Shanghai. \u201cEveryone is trying to expand their presence in every sector.\u201dAlso, both Alibaba and Tencent have struggled to make much money outside their home market. That means their surest way to keep growing is to get more deeply involved in more areas of their Chinese users\u2019 lives.In a report this week, Morgan Stanley predicted that by 2027, the total market in China in which Alibaba could be making money will be worth $19 trillion \u2014 more than Amazon\u2019s potential market worldwide.At the moment, both Chinese giants are hustling to find more ways for people to transact using their wallet and not the other\u2019s. Alibaba\u2019s shopping sites and physical stores do not allow users to pay for stuff with WeChat. Tencent-backed companies, such as the retailer JD.com or the service platform Meituan-Dianping, either downplay Alipay as a payment option in their apps or do not accept it at all.Whether any of this will give either camp an enduring lead in payments is unclear. Eric Wen, the founder of Blue Lotus Research Institute, expects them to end up at roughly 50-50.The payments contest will at least propel both companies to keep expanding their kingdoms, including overseas. Alibaba is pouring billions of dollars into online shopping ventures in India and Southeast Asia. Tencent is backing start-ups around the world that have even a distant chance of enriching its ecosystem.George Favvas did not know too much about Tencent before it invested in his company in San Francisco, Circle Medical, whose app lets users summon doctors on demand. He also had no specific plans to take his business to China in the near future, if ever.\u201cMy first question was, \u2018Why are you interested in us?\u2019\u201d Mr. Favvas said.He gets it now, he says. \u201cThey\u2019re just such a big player, and health care is so broken,\u201d Mr. Favvas said.

And some may be voting in the presidential election only because they fear what will happen to them if they stay home.Mr. Maduro\u2019s government denies that the humanitarian crisis exists. The truth is that failed government policy has ruined the economy, resulting in hyperinflation and severe shortages, and millions of Venezuelans cannot afford to buy food on the open market. Government-controlled rations are their only option.The country held an election last July to effectively replace the opposition-controlled National Assembly legislators with a pro-government Constituent Assembly. Mr. Maduro told voters to scan their special IDs after voting, adding \u201cwe will know who fulfilled their obligations to the Fatherland.\u201d Venezuelan law does not require citizens to vote.This is not just about recording whether someone voted. Many Venezuelans remember when under former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, government employees who supported a referendum on his presidency were fired from their jobs or the state-owned oil company, or when the same thing happened to supporters of a referendum against Mr. Maduro two years ago.In a country where people desperately need the food boxes, many see the government\u2019s demand to use the special ID near the voting site as a threat: Vote for Mr. Maduro or your family won\u2019t eat. Defying the authorities in the polling booth is too big of a risk.For example, one night last year, in the middle of an antigovernment protest in Caracas, one of us spotted a woman on the street talking to a member of an armed pro-government gang.Protesters recognized the woman as the neighborhood distributor of the government\u2019s food boxes. She, in turn, noticed her neighbors looking at her and screamed that people who had participated in antigovernment demonstrations would no longer get the boxes of food. And most haven\u2019t.Our organizations have repeatedly received credible allegations of similar discriminatory behavior elsewhere.More than a dozen regional governments and the European Union have called on the Venezuelan government to postpone the election for not meeting international standards for free-and-fair elections. In the coming days, foreign governments should press the Maduro government to abandon any effort to use the carnet to record if they voted.And representatives from the Americas and Europe should urgently convene a high-level meeting with key international aid groups to look for ways to open a humanitarian channel so there are no more hostages of hunger in Venezuela.Food should not be used to intimidate hungry people.Rafael Uzc\u00e1tegui is the director of the Venezuelan rights group Provea.

The pageantry was shown at length on China\u2019s state-run evening television news, with the two men looking like friends, if rather stiff ones.The Chinese leader appeared intent on showing that the frayed relationship with North Korea was now repaired, and that China was as important to resolving the problems of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons as the United States.A Chinese statement, which was issued on behalf of both leaders after Mr. Kim left, showed the differences between the Trump administration on the one hand, and China and North Korea on the other, over the question of how to rid the North of its nuclear weapons.It envisioned a far more drawn-out process for the denuclearization of North Korea than the demands of the Trump administration, which has talked about dismantling the North\u2019s arsenal in six months to a year.Mr. Kim wanted \u201cphased and synchronous measures in a responsible manner\u201d and hoped to \u201ceventually achieve denuclearization and lasting peace on the peninsula,\u201d the Chinese statement said.The statement said Mr. Kim expressed his \u201cgratitude to China for its longstanding and significant contribution in realizing denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d phrasing that seemed to extol China\u2019s role in hosting talks among six countries on North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons in the mid-2000s. Those talks fell apart, and the Trump administration has been scathing about them.North Korea\u2019s bare-bones economy \u2014 which has been long kept afloat by China, but is now being pummeled by United Nations sanctions \u2014 featured in the Dalian talks, the statement said. Mr. Kim told the Chinese that he wanted to develop his economy, a move that China said it supported.Mr. Kim recently met the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, who is eager to help the North with economic aid, although within the bounds of the United Nations sanctions. That meeting gave the North Korean leader new leverage with Mr. Xi.In essence, Mr. Kim can say that if China does not help ease the North\u2019s economic pain, South Korea will.Mr. Xi was joined in the talks by Wang Huning, one of his close aides, as well as others from the Communist Party hierarchy, and Mr. Kim brought a large retinue of officials, including his foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho.Chinese television footage showed the two delegations seated at a long table during formal discussions, with Mr. Xi doing most of the talking.The flight from the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to Dalian is under one hour. Even so, the surprise arrival of Mr. Kim was a departure from protocol, which the Chinese usually take pride in following to the letter, said a Chinese analyst, Cheng Xiaohe.After Mr. Kim\u2019s visit to Beijing at the end of March \u2014 his first foreign visit after being in power since 2011 \u2014 it was Mr. Xi\u2019s turn to travel to Pyongyang.Mr. Xi was expected to wait to go to the North Korean capital until after Mr. Trump\u2019s summit with Mr. Kim. But under that schedule, Mr. Xi would have not seen Mr. Kim again until the end of June or July.It is without modern precedent for a leader to come to China on back-to-back visits as Mr. Kim has done, Mr. Cheng said.\u201cThis second meeting demonstrated that North Korea wanted China to play a larger role in the denuclearization process,\u201d said Mr. Cheng, a professor at Renmin University. \u201cWhen Kim enters the meeting with Trump, he will feel more confident, simply his positions on a variety of issues were consulted and sanctioned by the Chinese leader.\u201dBut some Chinese analysts said the warmth between the two leaders on display in Dalian \u2014 they sat for a while in wicker arm chairs on a bucolic outdoor terrace \u2014 should not be overstated. Mr. Kim retains a streak of independence, they said.\u201cNorth Korea was never a vassal state,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, also a professor at Renmin University. It is even less of one now that the United States has agreed to deal with Mr. Kim, he said.Chinese officials will be heading to Tokyo for meetings on Wednesday with South Korean and Japanese counterparts as part of the recent burst of diplomacy over North Korea. Japan, the host of the talks, has been pushing the United States to continue a tough line against Pyongyang.North Korean state news media on Tuesday criticized Japan for continuing to support tough sanctions against the North, with Rodong Sinmun, the country\u2019s official newspaper, calling it \u201ctantamount to throwing cold water over easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\u201dBut Mr. Moon, who as South Korea\u2019s leader has pushed for engagement with Pyongyang, urged Japan to consider normalizing ties with North Korea.\u201cI think dialogue between Japan and North Korea should be resumed,\u201d Mr. Moon said in an interview Tuesday with the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun.\u201cIf Japan-North Korea relations are normalized, that would greatly contribute to peace and security in Northeast Asia beyond the Korean Peninsula,\u201d he said in written answers to questions submitted by the newspaper.Dalian was also the site of a 2010 meeting between Mr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, and Li Keqiang, China\u2019s premier.Iris Zhao contributed research.Advertisement"}

In fact, the new prime minister, who comes from a rival party, has said he will not do so.Her appeal partly speaks to a populist impulse from the political left, a David-versus-Goliath belief that it is high time someone stood up to giant corporations, particularly those that exert so much power. But not everyone views her as a heroic regulatory warrior.Critics also accuse her of grandstanding, and of displaying bias against American companies.\u201cI think she has this vision of what the law should be, and it seems to me that when this radically affects major companies that are headquartered in the U.S., you might want to have more of a dialogue with the U.S. regulators and the U.S. government about it,\u201d said Joe Kennedy, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington.For the moment, the attention is on data privacy, and whether it is possible to regulate how technology companies share and profit from users\u2019 personal information.\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating about her role is that in her mind, the new antitrust is about data, not about market power,\u201d said Randy Komisar, a veteran Silicon Valley executive and now a general partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.He added: \u201cI believe the European approach is more appropriate than the U.S. laissez-faire approach. The U.S. economy sort of lives or dies by the notion of free markets, and I think what we\u2019re seeing is a perversion of free market economics that is very difficult to counter without regulation.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s what my generation looks for in a politician,\u201d said Corina Stoenescu, a Harvard Business School student who helped organize a conference in March where Ms. Vestager was the keynote speaker. She added: \u201cThe moment tech giants come into question, then Vestager comes into question. She\u2019s the only person on the planet who has a voice about it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good if we can inspire each other globally,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in a recent interview in Copenhagen.She was juggling interviews and preparing for a speech, as a bag of knitting rested nearby. She likes to knit in meetings, and has recently been making elephants, after moving on from socks. (She also sometimes sews her own clothes.)Trained as an economist, she grew up in Glostrup, a suburb of Copenhagen, the daughter of two Lutheran ministers. (She\u2019s not a fan of organized religion, she said, and follows a \u201cBelieve in God, fear the church\u201d philosophy.)She entered politics at 21, joining the tiny centrist Danish Social Liberal Party, which was founded by her great-grandfather. Elected to Parliament in 2001, she rose to become the party\u2019s parliamentary leader six years later \u2014 she was already national chairwoman \u2014 and was blamed as being too young, too boring and female when the Social Liberals lost half their seats in the subsequent election.\u201cShe was very, very young, but if she had been a man, people would not have complained in the same way,\u201d said her biographer, Elisabet Svane.As for the boring part: \u201cShe has a lot of humor, but she is a little boring sometimes,\u201d Ms. Svane said in an interview. \u201cThe party is boring. They are technocrats and teachers, and they always know what is best for society.\u201dMs. Vestager brought in a media consultant, Henrik Kjerrumgaard, who advised her to drop the dull platitudes, simplify her message and stick to her beliefs \u2014 even if they made her unpopular. She rethought how to present herself.\u201cAll of us have multiple selves,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing a public figure is not about changing yourself, but maybe bringing out some other side of yourself.\u201d She learned to smile more, she said, \u201cto be more direct, less detailed, not like an economist lecturing.\u201dHer party rebounded in the 2011 elections and joined a three-party governing coalition led by the Social Democrats under Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Appointed to the new post of economics and interior minister, Ms. Vestager pushed through deeply unpopular cuts in retirement and unemployment benefits \u2014 forcing Ms. Thorning-Schmidt to renege on her own campaign promises \u2014 while helping enact more liberal immigration policies.She made a fair share of enemies, among them a group of long-term unemployed workers angry about reductions in their benefits. She still keeps the sculpture they gave her, of a middle-finger-brandishing hand, in her office in Brussels, saying it was \u201ca reminder that you will make mistakes, and people will have a different point of view, and that should be part of your understanding of yourself.\u201dIn 2014, Denmark made her the country\u2019s appointee to the European Commission, and she took charge of the competition portfolio.Ms. Vestager appears to have found that rare thing, a decent work-life balance. (By comparison, the fictional character she and Ms. Thorning-Schmidt are collectively said to have inspired, Birgitte Nyborg, the central figure of the Danish political drama \u201cBorgen,\u201d struggles unsuccessfully to hang onto her marriage.) Ms. Vestager\u2019s husband, Thomas Jensen, a math and philosophy teacher, lives in Copenhagen with their youngest daughter, 15. Their two older daughters are in college.\u201cHere, it\u2019s more the rule than the exception to be a working mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI have sometimes been asked if I\u2019m a bad mother to my daughters, and I say, \u2018They don\u2019t know any different \u2014 this is the mother they\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d\u201cPower is not something you own,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s only something you\u2019re borrowing.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels, and Ben Berke from Boston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Population Growth Slows, Populism Surges", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Auerswald is an associate professor at George Mason University\u2019s school of policy and government. Mr. Yun is the founder of the Palo Alto Longevity Prize.It\u2019s probably no coincidence that mayors in small Italian towns are making such offers at about the same time as a populist coalition is on the verge of taking over Italy\u2019s government.The shift from global population growth toward population decline is emerging as one of the least appreciated forces that is, along with urbanization and digital disruption, upending the political and economic status quo.In the world\u2019s largest cities, where populations are densely concentrated and growing, economies are generally thriving and cosmopolitanism is embraced. Where populations are sparse or shrinking, usually in rural places and small cities, economies are often stagnant, and populism sells.Why does it hold such appeal in these places? Nativist, nationalist rhetoric \u2014 \u201cMake America (or Whatever Other Country) Great Again\u201d \u2014 appeals because it promises to restore the rightful economic and cultural stature of \u201ccommon people\u201d in relation to a decadent urban intelligentsia. In Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Thailand and Turkey, populism has been fed by the juxtaposition of rural population and economic decline against the growth and increasing prosperity of the largest cities.When fertility rates get low enough, it\u2019s only a matter of time before population levels start to decrease. We have heard about the seemingly exceptional story of Japan\u2019s steady depopulation and economic deflation. But the trend toward population decline is not limited to Japan and a few East European countries.Iran, Brazil and other emerging-market countries are on this list as well. Fertility rates are falling rapidly in India, the world\u2019s most populous country after China.As youth have continued to migrate from rural areas to cities, their movement has widened not only the median age gap between rural places and cities, but also gaps in attitude, since the young, regardless of where they live, tend to associate more with urban outlooks.Election data from the past two years plainly describe the consequences of these demographic dynamics: Most advanced industrialized countries are dominated by two competing political movements that either awkwardly inhabit the bodies of existing political parties or create new ones more to their liking. One movement extols the values that are a practical necessity in dense, interconnected cities: interdependence, internationalism and the embrace of \u201cdiversity\u201d (defined along multiple dimensions). Another movement extols the equally necessary virtues of people in rural areas: self-reliance, autonomy and the embrace of immediate community and place.A consistent theme is the relative decline of native-born populations in relation to immigrants. In the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, the immigrant share of the population increased from 5.4 percent in 1960 to 13.5 percent in 2016, while in parallel the fertility rate halved, going from 3.6 to 1.8 births per woman overall.Only Japan, the country most identified with population decline, appears to have resisted the current populist wave \u2014 arguably either because its restrictive immigration policies immunize its native-born population from fears of demographic obsolescence, or because it already experienced a populist surge, with disappointing results, when the tradition-breaking Democratic Party of Japan was voted into power in 2009.As reassuring as it is for us in America to view our politics in narrowly domestic terms or for our friends elsewhere to do the same, populist surges are, curiously, among the most wholly internationalist of contemporary political phenomena. Where populations decline, populists arise \u2014 more often than not, promising to reverse history and restore past glory if not demographic dominance.In an age when the internet has collapsed distance and artificial intelligence threatens to supplant human intelligence in one domain after another, the density of people in places turns out to matter more than ever.Population decline is here, but unevenly distributed. When it comes to the politics of the 21st century, that geographical unevenness makes all the difference.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fall of the German Empire", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistThe third German empire is a different animal altogether. Repudiating both militarism and racist mysticism, it has been built slowly and painstakingly across three generations, in cooperation with other powers (including its old enemies the French), using a mix of democratic and bureaucratic means. Today Germany bestrides its Continent, but German power is wielded softly, indirectly, implicitly \u2014 and when the fist is required, it takes the form of fiscal ultimatums, not military bluster or racial irredentism.But still the system is effectively imperial in many ways, with power brokers in Berlin and Brussels wielding not-exactly-democratic authority over a polyglot, multiethnic, multireligious sprawl of semi-sovereign nation-states. And thinking about the European Union this way, as a Germanic empire as well as a liberal-cosmopolitan project, is a helpful way of understanding how it might ultimately fall.As this crisis has developed and encompassed grievances beyond the economic \u2014 immigration and national identity above all \u2014 it has been covered more and more as a clash between liberalism and illiberalism, between freedom and authoritarianism. In the wave of liberalism-in-peril books written since Donald Trump\u2019s election, the European and American experiences tend to get folded together into a story of democratic values threatened by ethnic chauvinism and would-be strongmen \u2014 by Putin imitators, to borrow a common trope, who want to use the democratic part of liberal democracy as a ladder up to power and then burn away the liberal part.This story has some truth to it. There are ideological affinities as well as funding streams linking Moscow and many of the nationalists to Russia\u2019s west, and the most empowered populist within the European Union, Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban, is explicit about his intent to replace liberal democracy with a form of \u201cChristian democracy\u201d that looks suspiciously like de facto one-party rule.But if the test of Europe\u2019s unity feels like a test for liberal democracy, it\u2019s a mistake to see it only in those terms. It is also a struggle of nations against empire, of the Continent\u2019s smaller countries against German mastery and Northern European interests, in which populist parties are being elected to resist policies the center sought to impose upon the periphery without a vote. And the liberal aspect of the European system wouldn\u2019t be under such strain if the imperial aspect hadn\u2019t been exploited unwisely by leaders in the empire\u2019s German core.This disastrous imperial dynamic was first manifest in the fiscal policy imposed on Southern Europe in the wake of the Great Recession \u2014 a policy that manifestly made more sense for Germany\u2019s economy than for Italy\u2019s or Spain\u2019s or Greece\u2019s, even as it was confidently presented by German bankers as a hardheaded necessity that no merely national government could be permitted to reject.Then the same dynamic repeated itself on immigration, when Angela Merkel took it upon herself to make migration policy for the Continent, in atonement for Germany\u2019s racist past and in the hopes of revitalizing its aging society. The resistance from other Europeans to her open door to refugees and migrants, the refusal to let the German chancellor and her admirers determine immigration policy, is one reason among many that populists won the Brexit referendum and find themselves on the cusp of power in Italy \u2014 and it\u2019s the major reason that populist parties rule today in Budapest and Warsaw.When one draws a line from Estonia to Greece \u2026 one notices that all currently existing countries along that axis were during the past several centuries (and in some cases, the past half-millenium) squeezed by the empires: German (or earlier by Prussia) Russian, Hapsburg, and Ottoman. All these countries fought, more or less continuously, to free themselves from the imperial pressure \u2026 their histories are practically nothing but unending struggles for national and religious emancipation.Most of these nations, Milanovic continues, experienced the events of 1989 primarily as a national liberation, and only secondarily as a victory for liberal principles over totalitarian or authoritarian alternatives. And the nation-states that emerged from \u201989 tended to be ethnically homogeneous and proudly so, with their political independence and sense of shared identity inextricably linked.As Marusic writes in his essay, from a liberal-cosmopolitan perspective that \u201csees 1989 primarily as an ideological triumph\u201d for universal values, \u201cmuch of the politics of the past 10 years in Eastern Europe can only be seen as backsliding,\u201d with leaders like Viktor Orban \u201ca symptom of political decay.\u201dBut from the vantage point of those same countries, for whom independence itself feels hard won and precarious, it seems strange that they should be expected to surrender to a different form of empire just because it dresses its appeals in the language of universal liberalism \u2014 especially when the language has a distinctly German accent.But there is a complexity that\u2019s lost when the situation is framed as simply about enlightenment versus authoritarianism. Political norms matter, but so does sovereignty and the substance of policy disagreement. And the problems that have pitted populists against Berlin and Brussels \u2014 a common currency that remains misbegotten even though the fiscal crunch has eased, a demographic-economic imbalance between Europe and neighboring regions that promises migration crises without end, a democratic deficit in how the European Union is governed \u2014 cannot be resolved by simply appealing to an abstract liberal project.In the meantime, it is a grave mistake for liberalism\u2019s champions to portray the tensions between the center and the periphery in Europe as just a choice for liberal values or against them. Because framing the choice that way, to people who recognize all too well that it can also be a choice for or against their own sovereignty, is a good way to hasten the fall not only of Germany\u2019s third empire but of liberalism itself.Advertisement"}

The only heritage United States carmaker that didn\u2019t go bankrupt in the Great Recession of 2008, it had become one of its greenest. But its decade\u2019s worth of investment in developing more fuel-efficient cars is now taking a back seat to profit.To be sure, today\u2019s crossovers and S.U.V.s are safer, cleaner and more fuel-efficient than their predecessors. But they\u2019re still no real match for passenger cars \u2014 sedans, hatchbacks and wagons \u2014 when it comes to fuel economy and reduced emissions. High-riding S.U.V.s resist the wind more, which decreases economy (and hurts handling), as does the additional weight of these big-tired behemoths.Ford received a $5.9 billion loan from the Department of Energy in 2009 to build more fuel-efficient vehicles. And indeed, it developed several internal combustion engines with notably reduced thirst for gasoline. Within a few years, it had a fine full line of passenger cars. The company was well positioned for a greener future. But something changed.So what changed? The return of cheap gas, for one thing. It makes larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles affordable again to many consumers. American carmakers spent the years around their great bailout professing their ardor for a new generation of fuel-efficient vehicles, but in the end they were only too happy to steer people back into S.U.V.s, which are more profitable.The unwillingness of Congress to tax gasoline more heavily did not help. Nor did the readiness of the Obama administration to accommodate so much of Detroit\u2019s pro-S.U.V. agenda in its regulations. Though they did raise federal mileage standards, the rule makers rewarded companies that built bigger vehicles by setting standards matched to vehicle size, with large cars allowed to burn more gas and pollute more. And now the Trump administration is moving to reduce even those standards.What\u2019s more, the move effectively cedes the passenger car market in North America to competitors old (Japanese, Korean) and new (Chinese).American carmakers have been trying to impress the market with radical short-term surgeries. Whatever the momentary boost to share prices, the decision to go all out for S.U.V.s poses a long-term risk: Ford will be much more susceptible to the ill effects of rising oil prices. One severe oil price spike could send consumers back to passenger cars, the ones Ford is no longer making.High oil prices, at least, Ford understands. Autonomous cars and ride sharing, on the other hand, could spell the end of business as Ford knows it. So while American automakers are preparing, or at least thinking of preparing, for the world of tomorrow, they are also trying to make as much money as they can as fast as they can. They don\u2019t know what this future will be, and they\u2019re kind of afraid of it, but they sure hope it includes S.U.V.s.\u2610Jamie Lincoln Kitman is the New York bureau chief for Automobile Magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Massachusetts Gains Foothold in Offshore Wind Power, Long Ignored in U.S.", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW BEDFORD, Mass. \u2014 On the waterfront of this fabled former whaling hub, the outlines of a major new industry are starting to appear.Crews of research boats perform last-minute tuneups before heading out to map the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. A large weather buoy decked out with gear for measuring wind speeds waits on the quay for repairs. And a 1,200-foot stretch of the port has been beefed up to bear enormous loads.New Bedford hopes to soon be the operations center for the first major offshore wind farm in the United States, bringing billions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs to the town and other ports on the East Coast.The groups must now work out the details of their contracts with the states\u2019 utilities.\u201cWe see this not just as a project but as the beginning of an industry,\u201d Lars Thaaning Pedersen, the chief executive of Vineyard Wind, which was awarded the Massachusetts contract, said in an interview.Jeff Grybowski, chief executive of Deepwater Wind, which won the Rhode Island portion, said that together the two projects add up to a European-scale package. \u201cThis shows the U.S. is catching up rapidly to the developments in Europe,\u201d he said.Such projects have run into opposition here over both cost and aesthetics \u2014 utilities are typically required to opt for the cheapest sources of power, and communities have resisted plans regarded as eyesores. Senator Edward M. Kennedy helped block a wind project off the coast of Cape Cod that would have been visible from the family estate.But the technology has the potential to bring large supplies of energy to the Northeast. Arrays of wind turbines with generation capacities comparable to major conventional power plants would be mostly out of sight, albeit within easy transmission reach of large population centers like Boston and New York City.\u201cWe could run the whole East Coast on offshore wind,\u201d said Amory B. Lovins, co-founder and chief scientist at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Colorado-based nonprofit organization that advises on renewable energy.Developers say the state\u2019s plan includes a series of projects large enough to help spawn a network of local suppliers of everything from components for the turbines to services like maintaining them, and drive down costs. Other states are pushing forward as well. Connecticut will soon name a developer for an offshore wind project of its own, while New York and New Jersey have both announced ambitious plans.New England is particularly well suited to offshore wind farms. There is not enough land for wind turbines onshore, and the area is not ideal for solar power. At the same time, Massachusetts has been under pressure to find new sources of energy to replace aging conventional and nuclear plants, as well as meet targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions blamed for climate change.The state is betting that, by investing in offshore wind decades after Northern Europe first tested the technology, it can avoid some of the growing pains experienced across the Atlantic.The global wind turbine industry has transformed from a collection of small companies in Denmark to corporations pulling off enormous feats of engineering.Two of the three bids in Massachusetts came from European developers. The winner was a joint venture of Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, a Danish renewable energy investment firm, and a subsidiary of Iberdrola, a Spanish utility. The other bids came from a consortium led by the Danish wind giant Orsted, and Deepwater Wind, which is based in Providence, R.I., and mainly owned by D.E. Shaw, an investment firm.\u201cWe know in light of Northern Europe\u2019s experience with offshore wind that many U.S. ports will benefit from the arrival of the industry here,\u201d Jon Mitchell, the New Bedford mayor, said in an interview.New Bedford has benefited from a lucrative sector before. In the mid-19th century, its whaling industry made it one of the wealthiest cities in the United States. \u201cNowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford,\u201d Herman Melville wrote in his epic novel, \u201cMoby-Dick.\u201dIn the hopes of another such boost, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, the state agency, has already spent $113 million dredging the harbor and expanding and reinforcing a 29-acre marine commerce terminal. The state is preparing it to load the components of turbines that stretch up to 600 feet high and weigh many tons onto special vessels for installation at sea.Whether Massachusetts can pull of its ambitious plans will depend to some degree on local issues \u2014 and not everyone in the area is enthusiastic.In particular, some of New Bedford\u2019s fishermen are worried. The city\u2019s port is already home to hundreds of fishing boats, as well as seafood auction houses and processing plants. It generates about $3.3 billion a year and supports about 6,200 jobs, according to the local authorities.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to destroy one type of sustainable energy harvest with another one,\u201d said Kevin Stokesbury, a professor at the School for Marine Science and Technology at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.Eric Hansen, a scallop fisherman, said that he and his colleagues were concerned about threading their way through a relatively narrow allotted path through spinning turbines.\u201cThink fog, heavy seas,\u201d he said.Even so, wind power is gaining its adherents.The area\u2019s high electricity prices may prove, counterintuitively, to be a plus. Power prices in Massachusetts are the second highest in the nation, behind only Hawaii\u2019s, and high rates prevail in much of the rest of New England and in New York. As a result, customers might be more willing to pay the increased early prices for power generated by offshore wind.The economic boost, too, is appealing, especially in a once-affluent city of 100,000 people.Kevin McLaughlin employs more than 100 people in his shipyards across the harbor at Fairhaven, and has already won additional work from offshore operators.\u201cAs long as there are boats that will be here,\u201d he said, \u201cit is business for us.\u201dStanley Reed reported from New Bedford, and Ivan Penn from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Does It Mean to Look at This?", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn PhotographyA photograph of a group of suffering people: We look at them, and from the sadness of their expressions and gestures, we know something awful has happened. But finding out exact details, through the photograph alone, is more difficult. Who these sufferers are, why they suffer, who or what caused the suffering and what ought to be done about it: These are entirely more complex questions, questions hard to answer only by looking at the photograph.The accounts journalists typically give of their motivations, particularly in photographing violence, aren\u2019t always convincing. Why go off to wars or conflict zones at great personal risk to take pictures of people whose lives are in terrifying states of disarray? The answer is often tautological: The images are physically dangerous and psychologically costly to make, and therefore they must be the right images.Susan Sontag, probably the most influential writer on the intersection of violence and photography, didn\u2019t buy this argument. With forensic prose, she cut through complacent apologias for war photography and set photojournalistic images of violence squarely in the context of viewers\u2019 voyeurism. This was the argument advanced in her 1977 essay collection, \u201cOn Photography.\u201d Sontag believed that a certain passivity was inescapable in spectatorship, and that any image of violence would be tainted by this passive distance. \u201cThrough the camera people become customers or tourists of reality,\u201d she wrote. Looking at those images, she seemed to suggest, was both self-absorbed and self-absolving.She revisited the subject near the end of her life, with more complexity and focus. In \u201cRegarding the Pain of Others\u201d (2003), she still viewed photojournalists with skepticism (she dubbed them \u201cstar witnesses\u201d and \u201cspecialized tourists\u201d), and remained averse to the kind of prurient gaze that images of torment can foster. But she amended some of her earlier positions. She previously argued that photographs, despite their capacity to generate sympathy, could quickly shrivel it through overexposure. She became less sure about that. She also queried the idea, implicit in her earlier arguments and explicit in the work of theorists like Guy Debord and Jean Baudrillard, that the abundance and distribution of images made reality itself little more than a spectacle:It suggests, perversely, unseriously, that there is no real suffering in the world. But it is absurd to identify the world with those zones in the well-off countries where people have the dubious privilege of being spectators, or of declining to be spectators, of other people\u2019s pain, just as it is absurd to generalize about the ability to respond to the sufferings of others on the basis of the mind-set of those consumers of news who know nothing at first hand about war and massive injustice and terror.Sontag wondered, near the end of \u201cRegarding the Pain of Others,\u201d whether \u201cone has no right to experience the suffering of others at a distance, denuded of its raw power,\u201d and she came to the conclusion that sometimes a bit of distance can be good. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with standing back and thinking,\u201d she wrote. (Even more than the incisiveness of her judgments, Sontag\u2019s willingness to rethink her views is what endears her to me.) The challenges of viewership have only intensified in the 21st century. Images of violence have both proliferated and mutated, demanding new forms of image literacy. Some recent scholars of photography have argued with some of Sontag\u2019s assertions in \u201cOn Photography.\u201d One of those scholars, Ariella Azoulay, has questioned the claim of voyeurism. Azoulay reads images of conflict or atrocity as constituting a more interwoven set of actors, displacing the question from one of voyeurism, and even of empathy, to one of participatory citizenship. We are all in this together, Azoulay seems to be saying (and I don\u2019t think the Sontag of \u201cRegarding the Pain of Others\u201d would disagree). In making such an argument, Azoulay attends to a different tradition in photography writing, one connected to an assertion made in 1857 by Lady Elizabeth Eastlake in The London Quarterly Review: \u201cFor it is one of the pleasant characteristics of this pursuit that it unites men of the most diverse lives, habits and stations, so that whoever enters its ranks finds himself in a kind of republic, where it needs apparently but to be a photographer to be a brother.\u201dBut in Azoulay\u2019s view, it is not only being a photographer that grants a person admission to this imaginative republic. Taking photos, looking at photos and being the subject of photos are mutually reinforcing activities in which the participants are interdependent and complicit. The meaning of any given image arises from their various roles as well as that of the camera itself. This is one of the points Azoulay makes at length in her lucid and indispensable 2008 study, \u201cThe Civil Contract of Photography.\u201d She pins her argument on the civic relations between people: \u201cWhen and where the subject of the photograph is a person who has suffered some form of injury, a viewing of the photograph that reconstructs the photographic situation and allows a reading of the injury inflicted on others becomes a civic skill, not an exercise in aesthetic appreciation.\u201d Azoulay\u2019s project arose out of her own experiences as a Jewish Israeli citizen who, nevertheless, had to interpret the images she was seeing of Palestinian suffering. Are these people radically other, or are they somehow included in the general \u201cwe\u201d?The scholar Susie Linfield critiques Sontag in different terms. In \u201cThe Cruel Radiance\u201d (2010), Linfield defends what she sees as the noble ideals of documentary photography. She finds fault with a number of notable photography critics (Sontag, as well as Roland Barthes and John Berger, among others) for being distrustful of photography, for not loving it enough. Sontag is, to Linfield, a \u201cbrilliant skeptic,\u201d and Linfield finds this a much less attractive persona than the one of the \u201csmitten lover,\u201d which is what she deems the film critic Pauline Kael.For Linfield, what photography can do especially well is present the ways in which the ideals of human rights fall short. A photograph cannot show human rights, but it can depict, with terrifying realism, what a starving person looks like, what a human body looks like after it has been shot. \u201cPhotographs show how easily we are reduced to the merely physical, which is to say how easily the body can be maimed, starved, splintered, beaten, burnt, torn and crushed.\u201dThis is sharply observed. But the devil is in the details, and the kind of details photographs are good at are visual and affective, different from the kind of details we might call \u201cpolitical,\u201d which have to do with laws, fine shades of linguistic meaning and the distribution of power. For all her optimism about the efficacy of photography, Linfield admits that \u201cwe, the viewers, must look outside the frame to understand the complex realities out of which these photographs grew.\u201dIn \u201cRegarding the Pain of Others,\u201d Sontag wrote: \u201cThe photographer\u2019s intentions do not determine the meaning of the photograph, which will have its own career, blown by the whims and loyalties of the diverse communities that have use for it.\u201d The truth of the statement is obvious in certain cases. A number of now-notorious photographs were made in late 2003 by Pvt. Charles Graner Jr. and others at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. In stripping prisoners naked, piling them up into a pyramid or ordering them to masturbate, Private Graner and other American soldiers might have intended to use humiliation to \u201csoften\u201d their prisoners up for interrogation. But the images, once they were released into the world, had a much more shocking and enraging meaning.Or consider the case of the Syrian photographer code-named Caesar. He was making photographs, with a team, as part of his military-police job. Disturbed at the increasing number of gruesome murders he had to photograph, he began to smuggle out large numbers of images \u2014 thousands of people starved, beaten or tortured to death \u2014 between the fall of 2011 and the summer of 2013. Caesar himself eventually escaped Syria. His images, initially made for one purpose (as the regime\u2019s records of its enemies), came to take on a different significance (as evidence of astonishing crimes against humanity).The gap between the photographer\u2019s intention and the subsequent life of the image is usually not as significant as in these two cases. But there\u2019s always some kind of disjuncture, a disjuncture that arises from photography\u2019s tendency to show only so much but to often mean much more: A photograph connotes more than it denotes. As the scholar Tina Campt has written, photographs don\u2019t speak, but they are not mute. They are quiet, and solicit a kind of listening.But what does the photograph, by itself, tell us? Not much. Unless it is supported with extraphotographic evidence, it will be mired in platitudes about human brutality or the universality of grief, truths for which no photographic argument is required. At the most basic level, that extra evidence begins with the photographer\u2019s name and a caption: \u201cSusan Meiselas. Neighbors watch as dead bodies are burned in the streets of Estel\u00ed, 1979.\u201d The caption establishes a place and time, as well as a plain description of an event. But if we stop there, we have only decorated the image with a bit of knowledge.Further investigation might reveal that Estel\u00ed is a city in northern Nicaragua, and that in early 1979, a popular struggle by the Sandinistas to unseat the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle was gaining strength. We might discover that the dead bodies just out of shot in Meiselas\u2019s picture were of people who were killed by Somoza\u2019s National Guard. Meiselas told me that the people in the photograph were reacting to \u201cthe intensity of putrefied bodies that have been on the street for three to five days in the hot sun.\u201d Out there photographing, she could smell them. We almost can, too.This single photograph could be supported by a shelf\u2019s worth of books: about the history of Nicaragua, about right-wing regimes, about South America in the late \u201970s, about leftist dreams of revolution, about American foreign policy, about the sense of smell, about the personal courage of a woman photographing in a war zone, about the political economy of Estel\u00ed and so on. The photograph cannot do that by itself, but it can occasion those investigations.Recognizing the frustration of trying to make photographs speak to the incredible complexity of civil conflict, Meiselas has written (of her time in Nicaragua): \u201cI had photographs, they have a revolution.\u201d In the course of her time in Nicaragua, in 1978 and 1979, she made hundreds of photographs. She made many more in subsequent visits. What difference did those photographs make? After all, what could be more irritating, and even offensive, than to have someone photographing you while you mourn, horror-struck, the burning of a relative\u2019s body? Would you want a photographer there, clicking away, on the worst day of your life?Conflict photography arises out of a huge set of moving variables that in unpredictable, unreliable but unignorable ways help make the demands of justice visible. Taking photographs is sometimes a terrible thing to do, but often, not taking the necessary photo, not bearing witness or not being allowed to do so, can be worse.Teju Cole is a novelist, a photographer and the magazine\u2019s photography critic.

{"Headline": "Unemployment Rate Hits 3.9%, a Rare Low, as Job Market Becomes More Competitive", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Labor Department released its April hiring and unemployment report on Friday, providing the latest snapshot of the economy.\u25a0 The unemployment rate was 3.9 percent, the lowest rate since 2000 and a sign that the job market has become even more competitive. It had been 4.1 percent since October.\u25a0 164,000 jobs were added last month. Wall Street economists had expected an increase of about 193,000, according to Bloomberg.\u25a0 The Labor Department revised the job figures for February slightly downward, but revised the numbers for March sharply upward. The result was a net increase of 30,000 jobs, compared with previous estimates.\u25a0 Average earnings rose by 4 cents an hour last month and are up 2.6 percent over the past year.American employers continue to find reasons to expand their payrolls. April marked the 91st consecutive month of job gains, far and away the longest streak of increases on record. The average monthly gain has declined each year since 2014, but that\u2019s normal for an economy that\u2019s been in recovery for such an extended period.\u201cWe\u2019ve continued to add jobs routinely every month for so long, and the unemployment rate we have reached is amazing,\u201d said Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job site ZipRecruiter. \u201cIt\u2019s very incredible.\u201dThe drop in the unemployment rate may be partly explained by a contraction in the labor force last month. Still, the jobless rate is reaching historically low levels. In the last 60 years, there has been only one sustained period where unemployment stayed below 4 percent: the late 1960s.Ms. Barrera said it was too early to worry about whether the economy is overheating. When the jobless rate hit these levels right before the dot-com bubble burst, the labor-force participation rate was significantly higher than it is today.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to try to analogize and say that\u2019s what we should be preparing ourselves for right now,\u201d Ms. Barrera said. That kind of thinking might prompt some employers to cut back on investments or hiring, which could begin to slow growth.President Trump\u2019s flirtation with a trade war has thrust uncertainty into the overall economic picture. The White House has offered little clarity about whether its newly imposed steel and aluminum tariffs will extend to allies like Mexico, Canada and the European Union, and it seems no closer to smoothing over economic tensions with China.Uncertainty over the price of raw materials could prompt factories to cut back from their recent hiring spree. Manufacturers added 73,000 jobs in the first quarter, much more than in the same period last year.Economists expect that low unemployment will lead to increasingly big pay bumps for workers as employers fight over a dwindling number of candidates. But this recovery has so far bucked that conventional wisdom.\u201cWage growth is just not picking up as we would have expected at this point,\u201d said Matthew Luzzetti, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank. As a result, he said, the Fed will be able \u201cto continue moving gradually.\u201dOne mystery of the American economy is this: How can employers can continue to raise pay so gradually, when the labor market keeps getting tighter? In the 1990s and early 2000s, the last time the job market looked like this, wages for rank-and-file workers rose at an annual rate of around 4 percent.A host of explanations \u2014 ranging from globalization to slow gains in productivity \u2014 have been offered to explain the disconnect. Ms. Barrera says businesses may just be stuck in their ways.\u201cPeople are creatures of habit,\u201d Ms. Barrera said. \u201cIf you have been using a strategy that has been working for you for a number of years, you aren\u2019t going to suddenly change it.\u201dEven though the labor force shrank over all, the report offered signs that the strong economy is coaxing some people back into the working world. A measure of unemployment that includes people who had given up looking for work hit 7.8 percent, a level not seen since 2001.\u201cWe have realized that there were even more workers on the sidelines than we previously thought,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, an economist at Indeed.com, a job-search site. Ms. Gimbel said that her site had seen an increase in people searching for things like \u201cbackground check\u201d and \u201cfull time,\u201d which could indicate that the bustling job market has become irresistible for workers who might have been discouraged by a particularly bruising recession a decade ago.If the numbers were reversed, \u201cthe country would be up in arms,\u201d said Andre Perry of the Brookings Institution, whose research focuses on race and structural inequality. Differences in education or degrees don\u2019t explain that gaping disparity, according to federal data.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iranians Fear Deeper Crisis as Trump Ends Nuclear Deal", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 The sense of crisis in Iran runs deep and wide. The economy is in free fall. The currency is plummeting. Rising prices are squeezing city dwellers. A five-year drought is devastating the countryside. The pitched battle between political moderates and hard-liners is so perilous that there is even talk of a military takeover.The chief loser will be the country\u2019s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, who now looks weakened, foolish and burned for the risk he took in dealing with the Americans.Addressing the nation on live television after Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, Mr. Rouhani said Iran would take no immediate action to restart uranium enrichment and that it would negotiate with the other parties to the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.If Iran\u2019s interests can be secured under the agreement, \u201cwe will continue the process,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if the deal is to be just a piece of paper, then our next steps will be clear.\u201dIf Mr. Rouhani is weakened, his opponents are likely to gain influence, analysts say.\u201cTrump has violated the international agreement by his predecessor, Obama, under the intrigues of the Israeli prime minister and Saudi Crown Prince Bin Salman,\u201d said Ali Khorram, a former Iranian ambassador to China and an adviser to the nuclear negotiating team. \u201cNow he has played in the hands of hard-liners in Iran.\u201dBut in the long term, the unraveling of the nuclear agreement could be bad news for the entire Iranian leadership, already buffeted by mounting popular dissatisfaction over the economy and a lack of freedoms and prospects. It could be bad news for average Iranians, too.\u201cWe will see more migration, more unemployment, more bankruptcies, more impoverishment,\u201d said Amirhossein Hasani, who once made kitchen equipment but now tries to make a living selling foreign exchange. \u201cSome might think this will lead to regime change, but protests will be cracked down and the government will be able to run the country. We will just get poorer.\u201dEven before Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, the nuclear deal had not lived up to its promise of economic salvation for Iranians. Mr. Rouhani sold it as the solution to many of the country\u2019s problems. He promised that foreign companies would flood Iran with investment and know-how, bringing jobs and opportunity to millions of unemployed people.He also said that the compromise would lift Iran out of its international isolation. Indeed, several airlines resumed connections to Tehran after the deal was struck.But deeper-rooted problems such as uncompetitive investment laws, widespread corruption and arrests of dual nationals by hard-line security forces dampened the boom the president had promised. Foreign businesses showed up in sizable numbers but balked at the conditions that confronted them.But what really diminished the potential benefits of the agreement were the American sanctions that remained in place despite the agreement, and which have continued to prevent any serious bank from working in Iran. They also prevent almost all normal financial transactions, depriving Iran of much-needed credit and foreign investments.The return of even broader sanctions could put even more pressure on the economy.\u201cSomeone, please change our fate, whoever, even Trump,\u201d said Ali Shoja, a cleaner who said he can\u2019t afford to support his three sons. \u201cI used to be a driver, now I clean. What\u2019s next? I cannot become a beggar.\u201dHard-liners, who have long lost popular support but control security forces, the judiciary and state television, were set to declare victory, since they have always argued that the United States could never be trusted in any deal.They will use the opportunity to undermine Mr. Rouhani and to try to seize power. But Mr. Rouhani came in after eight years with a hard-liner, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, at the helm. That both moderate and hard-line approaches have now failed has only deepened the sense of crisis.Dissatisfaction over state policies is so widespread that many wonder if the Islamic Republic and its current ideology are even sustainable, fueling talk of bringing in a military strongman to set things straight.\u201cThis is a big failure for Mr. Rouhani \u2014 America has cheated on him by not keeping its promises,\u201d said Jalal Jalalizadeh, a former member of Parliament. \u201cBut in the end we are all losers. Now it is clear that only direct and open talks with the United States can ever solve this.\u201dHard-liners say Iran should return to enriching uranium, as it was doing before the nuclear agreement.The restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program under the deal could survive.But others point out that such moves could invite military action.\u201cI am for direct talks and transparent talks between Iran and America, the sooner the better,\u201d said Abolghasem Golbaf, an analyst promoting change in the country. The talks should be open, for all to follow, he said. \u201cWhen they talk secretly, they may make mistakes and nothing can be corrected. Iran and America should sit face to face at negotiation table.\u201d\u201cWe could witness a blind explosion of anger and we will not know the outcome of such an event,\u201d said Davoud Hermidas-Bavand, a professor of international relations who has taught at the National Defense University.\u201cMany people are ready to support anyone who can provide them some hope,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to take into account that Iranians are also nationalistic and will definitely not blindly follow countries they view as harmful to Iranian interests.\u201dSome say they are surprised to even hear people saying they support Mr. Trump, whom they see as someone willing to solve their problems.\u201cWhen I sit in the taxi or bus I sometimes overhear common people saying they adore Trump, he at least honors his promises in campaign, they say,\u201d said Ali Sabzevari, a now-unemployed publisher. \u201cPowerless people take resort to a hero, no matter who is the hero \u2014 Hitler or Trump, anyone can be their hero.\u201dOthers disagree.\u201cThe common people will hate America more,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst. \u201cThey will face hardship and be poor.

{"Headline": "The Irish Exception", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistThere\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that the politics of Ireland have a way of lagging 30 or so years behind the Western times. The island nation\u2019s version of the American 1960s, for instance, only really arrived in earnest in the 1990s, when divorce was finally legalized and the sexual revolution and secularization began to reshape Irish life in earnest.Likewise in our own era, when much of Europe is being reshaped by populist revolts against the continent\u2019s establishment, Irish politics still partakes more of the comfortable consensus of the 1990s, with a two-party duopoly that hugs the center, an intelligentsia in thrall to banal progressive optimism, and a friendly (or, in the wake of the financial crisis, supine) attitude toward the European Union\u2019s technocrats.If the clich\u00e9 holds, Ireland will vote \u201cYes\u201d next Friday on a ballot measure that would overturn the Eighth Amendment to its Constitution, and allow the government to legalize abortion well beyond narrow cases involving threats to the mother\u2019s life. The Eighth was passed in 1983, in response to the legalization of abortion elsewhere in the West \u2014 a conservative Irish exception to a general liberalizing trend. To repeal it in our own populist moment would be likewise exceptional: It would vindicate the island\u2019s political and cultural establishment (from the leaders of both major parties to the members of U2) and bring Ireland into alignment with the general secular-liberal consensus \u2014 even as elsewhere that consensus is under sudden strain and threat.At the same time, it would put an end to an all-but-unique experiment in Western public policy: an attempt to combine explicitly pro-life laws and generally pro-family policy making with a liberalized modern economy and the encouragement of female independence and advancement.Some pro-life conservatives make their own versions of this kind of all-or-nothing argument \u2014 claiming that serious abortion opponents must reject feminism entirely, suggesting that legal contraception makes legal abortion inevitable, implying that you can\u2019t really make pro-life laws or pro-family policy without a counterrevolution that essentially repeals the 1960s and 1970s (and perhaps even abolishes the welfare state).In sum, with its restrictive abortion laws, generous family policy and otherwise modern economy, Ireland seems to have achieved or maintained some notable pro-life and pro-family goals without compromising women\u2019s health or female opportunities relative to countries with abortion on demand. By being \u201cbehind the times\u201d in some ways and more up-the-minute in others, the island\u2019s experience suggests possibilities outside the normal lines of feminist-versus-social conservative, right-versus-left debate.This is not an achievement to lightly throw away \u2014 and indeed, the Irish may still defy expectations and \u201ccatch up,\u201d as it were, to this era\u2019s anti-establishment, anti-center-left mood by voting to keep the Eighth instead.But however they vote Friday, the Irish experience up till now will remain an example of how history\u2019s direction is never morally straightforward, and how sometimes in what seems like anachronism there may be a model for a better society than ours.Advertisement"}

He faces skepticism from both Pyongyang and Washington that he can be an honest broker. North Korea still considers South Korea an American stooge. In the United States, conservatives who have the president\u2019s ear worry that progressive South Korean leaders like Mr. Moon will ease sanctions, breaking ranks with Washington in their eagerness to reconcile with the North.\u201cA matchmaker can succeed when boy and girl like each other,\u201d said Moon Seong-mook, a senior analyst at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy in Seoul. \u201cBut the United States and North Korea have very different ideas on how to achieve denuclearization.\u201dIt remains unclear whether the North\u2019s sudden shift in attitude signals a return to brinkmanship or mere posturing before the summit meeting, which is slated to take place in Singapore.On Thursday, Pyongyang dug in its heels, calling Mr. Moon\u2019s government \u201cimpudent\u201d and \u201cshameless\u201d for asking for inter-Korean talks while it continued joint military exercises with the United States. The two allies started their \u201cMax Thunder\u201d air force drill last week, which the North condemned as a rehearsal for invasion.\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy to sit down again with the current government of the South until it resolves the grave situation,\u201d Ri Son-gwon, a senior North Korean negotiator, told the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency.While most South Koreans support Mr. Moon\u2019s role as an intermediary, North Korea\u2019s actions on Wednesday give political ammunition to his conservative enemies, who call him a na\u00efve amateur who has fallen for Pyongyang\u2019s trap of \u201cfalse peace.\u201d They fear that Mr. Moon will not denuclearize the North, and will weaken Seoul\u2019s alliance with Washington.Mr. Moon\u2019s government vowed on Thursday to \u201cstep up a mediator\u2019s role,\u201d urging North Korea and the United States to \u201crespect each other\u201d and \u201cthink in the other\u2019s shoes,\u201d despite occasional setbacks.\u201cThe situation we have is part of the long and hard process of creating the same painting,\u201d said Mr. Moon\u2019s spokesman, Yoon Young-chan.North Korea and the United States have the same name for that painting: a \u201cnuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\u201d But they differ sharply on the best way to complete it.The Trump administration, particularly the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, wants North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program as soon as possible. Only when denuclearization has become irreversible, it says, will the United States ease sanctions and reward the North economically.But North Korea says it will not bargain away its nuclear weapons for the sake of its economic future. Mr. Kim insists that he will take only \u201cphased\u201d steps toward denuclearization, and that Washington must match each with \u201csynchronized\u201d measures to satisfy North Korean demands for security guarantees. These include normalized ties and a peace treaty with the United States, as well as the lifting of sanctions.\u201cThere is a huge gap between the North and the United States over denuclearization,\u201d said Lee Seong-hyon, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. \u201cThere should be a lot of soul-searching going on in Seoul over whether it has been a mediator and communicator trusted by both sides.\u201dMr. Moon has repeatedly argued that Mr. Kim would be willing to trade away his nuclear weapons for the right incentives. He called Mr. Kim \u201copen-minded,\u201d \u201cfrank\u201d and \u201ccourteous.\u201d\u201cThrough many hours of frank and serious discussions with Chairman Kim, I could again and again confirm his willingness for complete denuclearization,\u201d Mr. Moon said last week.His government hopes that North Korea and the United States can meet halfway by exchanging denuclearization with security guarantees in a \u201cphased\u201d manner, as the North demands, while carrying out the deal quickly, as Washington wants \u2014 perhaps before the end of Mr. Trump\u2019s term in early 2021.South Korean officials are confident that such a deal is possible. They say that Mr. Kim is desperate to rebuild his nation\u2019s economy and knows that he cannot do so without resolving the nuclear crisis, and that Mr. Trump is eager to make a deal before the midterm elections in November.But as Mr. Moon acknowledged, \u201cthe devil will be in the details\u201d \u2014 particularly who should make the first move and how to verify that promises are kept.When China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, met the South Korean leader in Tokyo last week, he warned that North Korea thought it was doing its part to show its intention to denuclearize \u2014 by unilaterally announcing a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests and by inviting outsiders to monitor the shutdown of its nuclear test site.Pyongyang was \u201cwaiting for a corresponding feedback from the United States,\u201d Mr. Li was quoted by South Korean officials as saying. Instead, North Korea saw the United States and South Korea pressing ahead with their annual military exercises.Mr. Bolton also called for the removal not only of nuclear arms but also of chemical and biological weapons from North Korea.This week, North Korea pushed back, threatening to cancel the summit meeting with Mr. Trump.The developments showed how delicate Mr. Moon\u2019s task is in bringing Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim together \u2014 and getting them to see eye to eye.If Mr. Kim does not cooperate, Mr. Bolton has warned, it could be a \u201cpretty short meeting\u201d in Singapore.\u201cThen we will see the crisis rapidly rising on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul. \u201cThe mediating role by South Korea and China has become more urgent than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As the island rebuilds in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the economy and prompted an exodus of Puerto Ricans left with few options, the protesters said they feared that looming austerity measures would decimate what remained of the island\u2019s middle class and force even more residents to leave.\u201cWe\u2019re overwhelmed,\u201d said Carlos Cofi\u00f1o, a 20-year-old political science student, as he prepared to march. \u201cWe need to express our indignation and let the government know that there are people who are suffering.\u201dProtesters met at several points in San Juan and marched down Ponce de Le\u00f3n Avenue, known as the Gold Mile, in the heart of the financial district.

A scuffle by the stage forced nearby police officers in riot gear to fall back, before a drizzle briefly dampened the fervor.About an hour later, as the main crowds began to thin and police seemed ready to depart, the officers clashed with a few dozen protesters, many of them young people holding wooden shields, dressed in black and covering their faces with bandannas. They left amid tear gas and chaos. The Public Safety Department said that 13 people had been arrested and that 15 police officers had been injured by projectiles or irritated by the gas.\u201cThis kind of violence damages the good name of Puerto Rico,\u201d Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 said in a news conference late Tuesday.He said that the smaller group of protesters had tainted the demonstration by throwing \u201cprojectiles\u201d at police officers.

Participating meant losing a day\u2019s pay, since the government did not declare Tuesday a holiday.\u201cWe found out from the press,\u201d said Lourdes Torres Santos, 31, who teaches at Rep\u00fablica del Per\u00fa, a San Juan middle school scheduled to close. \u201cA lot of the teachers cried.\u201dIn the coming weeks, Ms. Torres expects to lose her job.An earlier version of this article misidentified the party that ratified the tuition increase at the University of Puerto Rico.

In the rare instance a newcomer or two needs transport, they travel in a fuel-efficient economy car.And in southwest Houston, a 1,500-square-foot storage room is loaded to the ceiling with furniture, toys, bedding and other items donated for refugee families, all collecting dust.The flow of refugees to the United States has slowed nearly to a halt, demonstrating that what President Trump\u2019s administration could not achieve by executive order, it is accomplishing by bureaucracy.The administration has cut the staff that conducts clearance interviews overseas, intensified the screening process for refugees, and for those people it characterizes as high-risk, doubled the number who need to be screened. As a result, if the trickle of refugees admitted continues at its current pace, just 20,000 are projected to enter the United States by the end of this year, the lowest figure since the resettlement program was created with passage of the Refugee Act in 1980.The machinery of refugee resettlement has ground down accordingly.\u201cEvery stage in the process works like the assembly line in a factory \u2014 each station knows exactly what to do and how to do the handoff to the next step,\u201d said Barbara Strack, who retired in January as the chief of the Refugee Affairs Division at United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. \u201cThis fiscal year,\u201d she added, \u201cthe administration essentially \u2018broke\u2019 the assembly line in multiple places at the same time.\u201dThe steepest decline has been in the number of Muslims who have been resettled. In fiscal 2016, 38,900 Muslim refugees came to the United States, according to statistics from the State Department. The following year, that number fell to 22,861. This fiscal year, just 2,107 have arrived.A total of 13,051 refugees of all backgrounds have been admitted, making it unlikely that the administration\u2019s originally planned cap of 45,000 \u2014 about half the number that came during the last year of the Obama administration \u2014 will be met.\u201cIt\u2019s death by a thousand papercuts,\u201d said Jennifer Sime, senior vice president at the International Rescue Committee, one of the nine national resettlement agencies contracted by the State Department. \u201cLittle by little \u2014 until you get to the point where nobody is coming.\u201d\u201cThe United States will also continue to lead the world in humanitarian assistance and support displaced people close to their homes in order to help meet their needs until they can safely and voluntarily return home,\u201d Carol T. O\u2019Connell, principal deputy assistant secretary of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, said in a statement.Refugees from all nations who had already been through initial screenings waited to be interviewed by officers of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services at camps and cities around the world. But the frequency of those interviews slowed considerably.One of the reasons was a large backlog in applications from immigrants seeking refuge in the United States under a different process \u2014 filing applications for asylum from persecution in their homelands, mainly Central America. Under international law, the United States cannot turn away or place caps on applicants who, unlike those applying for refugee status from the other side of the world \u2014 actually show up at the border.In recent months, the immigration agency diverted 100 of its 215 refugee officers to conduct asylum interviews. That, said Jennifer Higgins, associate director of Refugee, Asylum and International Operations, part of the Department of Homeland Security, is part of \u201can effort to address the massive asylum workload.\u201dRefugees interviewed overseas undergo extensive background checks by United States law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The administration has now required refugees to list phone numbers and addresses going back 10 years, instead of five, as well as social media and email accounts, adding to the paperwork. And it has ordered an additional layer of vetting for refugees from 11 high-risk countries, meaning that many in the pipeline already approved had to be rescreened, leading to further delays.Previously only male refugees were subject to such vetting, but now it includes females ages 14 to 50, which has exacerbated the backlog.During the Obama administration, Ms. Strack, the former head of the Refugee Affairs Division, said there was pressure to reach the 85,000-person cap, but under Mr. Trump, there is no commitment to attain the allowed number.\u201cWhat is strikingly different this year is that there is no apparent urgency to address the dramatic backlog in completing security checks,\u201d she said.The backlog has left refugees in limbo abroad.Few refugees from the designated high-risk countries have arrived in the United States since January: 11 from Syria, 36 from Iraq and 22 from Sudan.The refugee program slowed before \u2014 after the Sept. 11 attacks, when the government began implementing tougher security checks. Before this year, the fewest refugees arrived when President George W. Bush was president in 2002: 27,131. But by 2016 under President Barack Obama, the number had climbed to 84,994, which included 12,587 Syrians fleeing a bloody civil war.Scaling down of the program comes at a time when there are approximately 22.5 million refugees in the world, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which designates people for refugee resettlement.The slowdown has thrown the partnership between the government and refugee resettlement agencies into disarray. The State Department contracts with nine nonprofits whose affiliates receive refugees in cities across the country.\u201cIf I don\u2019t get the refugees, eventually I won\u2019t be able to sustain the staffing capacity and the operations,\u201d Mr. Sudani said. For the moment, he is deploying staff to run other programs.The State Department, which oversees the agencies, announced in December that affiliates might be eliminated if they resettled fewer than 100 refugees annually. Already, from Miami to Garden City, Kan., to Minneapolis-St. Paul, nearly 50 of the 350 affiliates nationwide have closed, according to the State Department.Canopy Northwest Arkansas opened in Fayetteville at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis in 2016 with great enthusiasm from volunteers from churches, schools and the Rotary Club. It is the only refugee resettlement organization in Arkansas.Canopy works with the nearby Bentonville Church of the Nazarene, which was assigned a family in late 2016 that was expected to arrive in early 2017. The wave of travel bans delayed the refugees\u2019 departure and then their medical exams expired; then their security checks had to be repeated, according to Canopy, whose volunteers are still hoping they will come in the next few months.The church\u2019s basement is stuffed with donations for the family, and the pastor is considering holding a tag sale if they do not arrive soon.Canopy received 55 refugees in 2017, and was told to prepare for 75 this year. But between July 30 and March 20, the group did not receive a single refugee. Volunteers were upset. \u201cPeople direct that frustration at us,\u201d said Canopy\u2019s executive director, Emily Linn Crane.Before Easter, about 20 church members, students and teachers channeled their frustration by marching into lawmakers\u2019 offices in Washington, demanding action. In the ensuing weeks, the community received two refugee families.The fallout of the slowdown extends beyond volunteers, refugee agencies say: In Idaho, employers who rely on a steady stream of newcomers from Congo, Myanmar and Iraq, among other countries, are having trouble filling jobs they normally tap refugees to do in the lodging, retail and dairy industries.Across the country, resettled refugees who fled war zones are so anxious about their loved ones still stranded overseas, they can\u2019t acclimate to their new lives.\u201cIt has re-traumatized a lot of people,\u201d said Rama Deen, the executive director of Tidwell Social Services in Boise, which provides mental health counseling. \u201cYour children you have been working so hard to bring here are stuck.\u201d\u201cThe refugee program reflects the priorities of every administration,\u201d said Melanie Nezer, senior vice president at HIAS. But what\u2019s happening is unlike anything she has seen before, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had extreme vetting for years, but refugees have cleared the process. Now they don\u2019t. It\u2019s not extreme vetting any more, it\u2019s a closed door.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Places New Sanctions on Venezuela Day After Election", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration placed new sanctions on Venezuela on Monday, seeking to block President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from selling off government debt to enrich himself the day after he claimed victory in what the United States government called a \u201csham\u201d election in his crisis-ridden country.President Trump signed an executive order imposing the new penalties, which would bar United States companies or citizens from buying debt or accounts receivable from the Venezuelan government, including Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the government-owned oil company that is the parent of Citgo Petroleum Corporation.The measures were devised to close off an \u201cavenue for corruption\u201d that senior administration officials said they had observed Mr. Maduro and members of his government using to enrich themselves. The officials, who described the sanctions on the condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to be named discussing them, declined to reveal any specific instances.The action comes as Venezuela reels from an economic collapse that has caused a humanitarian crisis, as citizens flee a country suffering from food shortages, soaring prices, a broken-down health system and a rash of crime.\u201cThe illegitimate result of this fake process is a further blow to the proud democratic tradition of Venezuela,\u201d Mr. Pence said in a statement, adding, \u201cThe United States will not sit idly by as Venezuela crumbles and the misery of their brave people continues.\u201dOne senior administration official said Mr. Maduro, afraid to risk real competition in the contest, had choreographed the election process to his advantage, stacking the courts and National Electoral Council with his cronies, banning opposition leaders and parties, cracking down on news media that was not sympathetic to him, and selectively parceling out food and money on Election Day to manipulate hungry Venezuelans into voting for him. The official said Mr. Maduro had set up tents just feet away from polling locations where voters had to scan \u201cfatherland cards\u201d to show they voted in exchange for cash or food.The sanctions imposed Monday, the third round that Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has placed on Venezuela, are intended to stop Mr. Maduro and his government from using a strategy they have pursued to raise cash as their ability to siphon money from the strapped economy weakens.The government has been selling off debt held by government entities, including accounts receivable, for a pittance of what it is worth, the officials said, pocketing the cash and leaving Venezuela\u2019s finances in shambles.The sanctions fall short of direct penalties on the oil sector, which the Trump administration has said would harm the Venezuelan people and American companies. They do not bar United States companies or citizens from selling oil products to or importing them from Venezuela.Last August, when Mr. Trump imposed his first financial sanctions on Venezuela, his administration provided an exemption for financing of petroleum imports and exports and an explicit carve-out for Citgo.At the time, the White House said Citgo\u2019s exemption was a bid \u201cto mitigate harm to the American and Venezuelan people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Profits Are Soaring. The Stock Market Has Barely Noticed.", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesEarnings season is underway on Wall Street and, thanks to a heady combination of core business strength and tax windfalls, the results have been exceptional.In fact, based on the numbers so far, profits among the biggest American corporations are growing so fast that you may expect the stock market to be soaring like a rocket.That\u2019s not the direction the market has been heading, of course. Since February, most stocks have been sluggish \u2014 or downright negative \u2014 and the spectacular earnings reports have received less fanfare than they probably deserve.Add the negative impact of rising interest rates and heightened expectations for inflation \u2014 both of which tend to hurt share prices \u2014 and it\u2019s easy to see why the stock market weakened as much as it did.Tax windfalls are certainly inflating the numbers, but the core earnings of American corporations look solid, nonetheless.Consider the picture for the first three months of 2018, the period for current earnings reports. By one measure, the quarter is actually turning out to have been the best for corporate America in decades. The tax cuts that went into effect this year have transformed excellent earnings into exceptional ones.David Aurelio, a senior research analyst for Thomson Reuters, says nearly 80 percent of the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index that have reported so far have outstripped the expectations of Wall Street \u2014 16 percentage points higher than the average number of companies that beat expectations. \u201cThat performance is the best since our records started in 1994,\u201d he said.Earnings per share have grown 26 percent since the same quarter a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. Net operating income \u2014 essentially, profit after taxes \u2014 has risen nearly 25 percent in the same period. Almost half of that gain, 11.6 percentage points, comes from the big cut in corporate taxes that took effect this year.The tax windfall alone accounts for a larger earnings increase than the stock market typically receives from conventional sources, the data shows. Expectations of a tax cut may help explain the run-up in stocks in 2017 and earlier this year.But writing off the current earnings surge entirely as a pure artifact of tax cuts would be a mistake. Before taxes, earnings grew 13.2 percent for the quarter. That is a breathtaking figure.\u201cWhenever you get double-digit earnings growth coming from core earnings, it is really healthy,\u201d Mr. Aurelio said. \u201cWhat I find surprising is that, aside from the tax cuts, fundamentals are really looking strong,\u201d he added.The tax changes mean that Apple suddenly has \u201cincreased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our global cash,\u201d which had been stranded abroad, said Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer. So Apple announced a $100 billion increase in what had been a $300 billion share buyback program, as well as a 16 percent dividend increase.Apple\u2019s operating income rose more than 10 percent in the quarter, an impressive figure in its own right, and the end of the Apple profit machine is nowhere in sight.Apple isn\u2019t the only company to have churned out outstanding earnings. Profits have been rising for most big American companies, and Wall Street expects that to continue for at least the next year or two.Edward Yardeni, an independent market strategist, points out that double-digit earnings growth isn\u2019t likely to be sustained by corporate America. Profit growth is likely to decline to the roughly 7 percent annual rate that has been the historic norm, he says. And the norm is that stock market will rise at about that rate over the long run. He expects that to continue.While the market has barely noticed the current avalanche of profits, the combination of stagnant prices and rising earnings means that market valuations have already improved rapidly. If that trend continues, many stocks will again begin to look like bargains.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Will Trump\u2019s moves on Iran and trade push markets over the edge?\u2022 What\u2019s next for business after Eric Schneiderman?\u2022 D.E. Shaw grapples with an ousted executive who\u2019s fighting back.\u2022 What Rupert Murdoch will weigh if Comcast makes another bid for Fox assets.President Trump\u2019s antagonistic foreign policies have yet to cause serious losses in the stock market.But investors\u2019 stoicism could face greater tests in the coming weeks. They have to contend with the repercussions of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran and the increasing likelihood of a trade war with China and the European Union. And all this is happening at a time when a boom in corporate earnings, the chief driver of the stock market, appears to be cooling.Up until January, investors were willing to pay high valuations for stocks because they expected corporate earnings to accelerate this year. But the best may already be behind us. Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, on Monday wrote that analysts now believe that earnings growth for this year likely peaked in the first quarter (at 23 percent over last year\u2019s first quarter.) After such peaks, the stock market tends to remain weak for a while, she added.Investors likely won\u2019t have a big new jump in profits to look forward to. Earnings are expected to grow 10 percent next year, according to estimates compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s. Without sustained support from corporate earnings, investors may be more willing to sell stocks in response to geopolitical events.And in the coming weeks, there will be plenty of potential trade war triggers. The Trump administration could decide to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from a number of countries, including those in the European Union, when exemptions expire at the end of this month. Proposed tariffs on $50 billion of goods from China could also be imposed this month, and the White House could release details on a second batch of tariffs on $100 billion of Chinese products.Since neither the European Union nor China looks close to caving to Mr. Trump\u2019s threats, global trade tensions look set to escalate and a full-blown trade war is possible.Investors may continue to hang tight, of course. The stock market is flat for the year, not a bad performance for a period in which the underpinnings of the international economic order are under assault.But that support will most likely convince him that he is on the right track \u2013 and he will press on with his hard-edged international policies. But more than at any time in his presidency, he should not expect the stock market to tag along.\u2014 Peter EavisDisney reported its strongest quarterly results in two years. It beat Wall Street expectations for profit and revenue growth. But even that strong performance was shadowed by analyst concerns over maneuvering by Comcast to upend Disney\u2019s pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets.Robert Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, never mentioned Comcast and presented the Fox deal as a fait accompli. \u201cWe are confident that the assets that we are in the process of acquiring easily fit within our new structure once the deal is approved.\u201dMany analysts have recoiled at such a bid, which could leave Comcast with more than $170 billion in debt \u2014 a sum that would make it one of the largest corporate debtholders in American history. \u201cWe do not believe Comcast needs another media asset,\u201d Gregory Williams, a Cowen and Company analyst, wrote in a research note.Recently, he pushed himself to the forefront of the #MeToo movement, announcing a lawsuit against the company once run by the former filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of decades of sexual misconduct. \u201cWe have never seen anything as despicable as what we\u2019ve seen right here,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said at the time.Mr. Schneiderman has denied the women\u2019s allegations.The NYT\u2019s Mark Landler reports:\u201cPresident Trump told President Emmanuel Macron of France on Tuesday morning that he plans to announce the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, according to a person briefed on the conversation.\u201d\u201cThe United States is preparing to reinstate all sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord \u2014 and impose additional economic penalties as well, the person said.\u201dHere\u2019s what Joe Papa, the company\u2019s C.E.O., said:\u201cThe Bausch name embodies the rich history of innovation, fortitude and dedication to patient health dating back to when J.J.

Here\u2019s a breakdown courtesy of Dealogic:\u2022 It is the biggest deal announced this year, beating Cigna\u2019s $55 billion acquisition of Express Scripts.\u2022 It is not just the largest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company, but the biggest by a Japanese company.

She served as deputy attorney general under President Barack Obama. The Trump administration asked her to stay on as acting attorney general until Jeff Sessions was confirmed to be attorney general.Ms. Yates worked at King & Spalding as a civil litigation associate from 1986 to 1989.The firm\u2019s bullying and threats against me over the last week, however, have revealed that the firm is so concerned with creating the appearance of supporting women that it is willing to cast false aspersions on me (and perpetuate false aspersions cast by others) and make me a scapegoat with a proverbial hanging in the town square.\u2022 Mr. Murdoch already spurned a Comcast offer 16 percent higher than what Disney\u2019s, saying regulators were more likely to block it.

{"Headline": "A Fast-Food Problem: Where Have All the Teenagers Gone?", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA quarter-century ago, there were 56 teenagers in the labor force for every \u201climited service\u201d restaurant \u2014 that is, the kind where you order at the counter.Today, there are fewer than half as many, which is a reflection both of teenagers\u2019 decreasing work force participation and of the explosive growth in restaurants.But in an industry where cheap labor is an essential component in providing inexpensive food, a shortage of workers is changing the equation upon which fast-food places have long relied. This can be seen in rising wages, in a growth of incentives, and in the sometimes odd situations that business owners find themselves in.This is why Jeffrey Kaplow, for example, spends a lot of time working behind the counter in his Subway restaurant in Lower Manhattan. It\u2019s not what he pictured himself doing, but he simply doesn\u2019t have enough employees.Mr. Kaplow has tried everything he can think of to find workers, placing Craigslist ads, asking other franchisees for referrals, seeking to hire people from Subways that have closed.Yet there he was during a recent lunchtime rush, ringing up veggie footlongs and fountain drinks. He feared that if the line grew too long, people might get frustrated and not come back.\u201cEvery time there\u2019s a huge line, the next day the store is nowhere near as busy,\u201d he explained later as he straightened tables and swept up crumbs.Across the country, Keith Miller, another franchisee, is dealing with the same problem. \u201cWhat employees? We don\u2019t have them anymore,\u201d joked Mr. Miller, who can\u2019t find enough workers for the three Subways he owns in Northern California.\u201cWe used to get overwhelmed with the number of people wanting summer jobs,\u201d Mr. Miller said, adding that he now gets maybe a handful of such applications, at most. \u201cI don\u2019t know what teenagers do all summer.\u201dGavin Poole, a 17-year-old senior at Montville Township High School in New Jersey, likes the idea of being his own boss \u2014 that\u2019s one reason he created a small business out of after-school landscaping and handyman work. The money has helped cover his cellphone bill and the payments on the Jeep Wrangler he leased last year. \u201cI want to be prepared for the future, because you don\u2019t know, financially, what situation you could be in,\u201d he said.Now, after years of benefiting from low-cost labor, many employers are starting to pay more. Fast-food wages began rising in 2014, and have increased faster than overall wages since. But at $10.93 an hour, the pay is still less than half the average for an hourly employee, pushing companies to offer more incentives \u2014 like dental insurance, sign-up bonuses and even travel reimbursement \u2014 to entice workers.That\u2019s good news for workers like Juan Morales, who has assembled sandwiches at a Subway on Staten Island for more than 15 years.\u201cIt\u2019s much better than before,\u201d said Mr. Morales, who earns a little more than $15 an hour. \u201cBut for my boss, I see that it\u2019s harder.\u201dRestaurants are notorious for churning through employees. But people are coming and going faster than they have in recent memory, according to data from TDn2K, a restaurant research firm. Last year, the turnover rate reached 133 percent, meaning that positions often had to be filled more than once.That has forced business owners to adjust.Tamra Kennedy, who owns nine Taco John\u2019s franchises in the Midwest, started offering $100 as a bonus to new employees who reached 100 hours. She has started offering merit increases twice a year, and she pays all employees more than the minimum wage.\u201cHiring has been more challenging in the last two years than probably the previous 10,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said.About half of her stores are understaffed. So she has devised workarounds: Digital probes, not people, now record food temperatures. She has also invested in expensive new registers that can produce reports that employees used to do by hand.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the industry in this kind of situation,\u201d said Robert S. Goldin, a partner at the food consulting firm Pentallect. \u201cIt\u2019s never been like this.\u201dThat $150 million might seem like a lot. But replacing workers is also expensive: It costs about $2,000 to replace the average hourly restaurant worker, according to data from TDn2K.\u201cThirty years ago, I would not put up with the stuff I put up with today,\u201d said John Motta, a longtime Dunkin\u2019 Donuts franchisee in Nashua, N.H. When an employee recently missed a shift, one of his stores could serve only drive-through customers for about an hour.\u201cYou try not to be too harsh on them,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you\u2019re afraid tomorrow they\u2019re not going to show up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Netanyahu, Vindication and New Risk After Trump\u2019s Iran Decision", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 He offended the last United States president by trying to sink the Iran nuclear deal in Congress, antagonized the countries that had negotiated it, and helped make support for Israel a partisan issue in American politics.For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, President Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday to abandon the 2015 agreement was such a wholesale vindication that he abruptly cut short a trip to Cyprus to be in Israel when it was announced.It would have been unseemly, after all, to gloat while on foreign soil.\u201cIsrael fully supports President Trump\u2019s bold decision today to reject the disastrous nuclear deal with the terrorist regime in Iran,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said moments after Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cIsraelis opposed the nuclear deal from the start because we said that, rather than blocking Iran\u2019s path to the bomb, the deal actually paves Iran\u2019s path to an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs, and this within a few years\u2019 time.\u201dEven as Mr. Netanyahu spoke, Israel was bracing for the possibility that Mr. Trump\u2019s move could free Iran of constraints that may have held it back from retaliating against recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria. Those attacks have come amid a shadow war in which Iran has used the cover of the Syrian conflict to build a military infrastructure there to confront Israel.Anticipating an Iranian attack along its border with Syria, Israel\u2019s military late Tuesday said it put its troops on \u201chigh alert,\u201d called up some reservists, set up Iron Dome antimissile batteries and warned local authorities in the Golan Heights to unlock and ready bomb shelters following the detection of what it said was irregular activity of Iranian forces.About an hour after Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, Syrian state news media reported what it called an Israeli attack south of the capital, Damascus. An official from the pro-Iran alliance in the Middle East said four missiles had been fired at an Iranian position in Al Kiswa, where there are bases used by the Syrian Army and its militant allies including militias backed by Iran. The official said two of the missiles were blocked by Syria\u2019s air defenses, while the other two hit the site, destroying a truck with a radar in it.Israeli media described the airstrike as a pre-emptive one, saying one target was a convoy of missiles en route from a base in Syria to the frontier with Israel. An Israeli military spokesman declined to comment.Mr. Netanyahu waged an Ahab-like struggle against the nuclear pact from before its inception during the Obama administration. Now, President Trump has adopted his point of view \u2014 not only about the agreement\u2019s flaws but also about Israeli evidence that Mr. Trump said \u201cconclusively\u201d showed Iran had lied when entering into it. Mr. Trump also aligned with Israel on the need to increase pressure on Iran in hopes of curtailing its expansionism in the Middle East.\u201cFor the first time, Bibi\u2019s doctrine is going to be tested on a much wider scale,\u201d said Anshel Pfeffer, a Haaretz columnist and author of a well-received new Netanyahu biography titled \u201cBibi,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s nickname.Being seen as fiercely taking on Israel\u2019s most fearsome adversary while standing shoulder to shoulder with its most critical ally can only help Mr. Netanyahu politically as he awaits a likely indictment in a sprawling corruption investigation. He is counting on being seen as indispensable to Israel\u2019s national security.Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s decision also creates a new set of risks for Mr. Netanyahu and for Israel. After more than a decade without a major war, the country now faces threats from almost every direction.Even Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s most ardent detractors treat his obsession with the strategic threat posed by Iran as a sincere one.\u201cHis worldview is very clear,\u201d said Ari Shavit, an Israeli journalist who has long covered Mr. Netanyahu. \u201cIran is Nazi Germany. Israel is England. He is Churchill and America is America. His main goal has been to persuade Roosevelt to get into a conflict that will crush Iran. It didn\u2019t work with Obama. But with President Trump he sees a golden opportunity.\u201dMr. Shavit added that Mr. Netanyahu sees Iran as both dangerous and fragile, like the weakening Soviet Union that Ronald Reagan confronted, and wishes for a similar American approach to it: very assertive American diplomacy and sanctions that exploit Iran\u2019s weakness to eliminate its danger.In that dream scenario, Iran\u2019s economy melts down under stiffened sanctions and the government follows.While cheering Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, Israel could face some undesirable outcomes as a result of it.If Britain, Germany, France and perhaps Russia and China respond by backing up the nuclear deal and giving Iran added incentives to stick with it, the United States could wind up having squandered its leverage. Israel would have gained nothing and a wedge could be driven between the United States and some of its closest European allies.Alternatively, if Iran reacts by abandoning the agreement and restarting its nuclear program, it will be up to the United States and its allies to stop Iran \u2014 \u201cor the nuclear deal will have been proven to have been the best deal available, and relying on Trump to be a very stupid move,\u201d Mr. Pfeffer said.Ehud Barak, a former prime minister who was defense minister under Mr. Netanyahu when the two pressed for an Israeli strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, said he believed Iran would be even more cautious, following Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, \u201cnot to make a mistake which would draw them into a direct conflict with the U.S.\u201d\u201cThe real nightmare of the ayatollahs is to find themselves in a real clash with the U.S.,\u201d said Mr. Barak, who was in Washington promoting a new memoir. \u201cThey play brinkmanship very artfully, but also out of careful calculation. And with this administration, they cannot really calculate.\u201dWar is, however, a distinct possibility \u2014 and one for which the Israeli public is being prepared almost hour by hour.Iran\u2019s nuclear program is by no means the only or even the most urgent threat that the country poses to Israel. For months, the two adversaries have been engaged in an increasingly bloody and overt conflict in Syria, where Mr. Netanyahu says Iran is bent on establishing an offensive threat to Israel with drones, precision-guided missiles and Shiite militia members under Iranian leadership. And he is determined to prevent it.In recent days, the Israeli news media have been filled with feverish assessments and speculation that the Iranians, with the Lebanese elections and Mr. Trump\u2019s decision behind them, will be freed to retaliate for recent airstrikes attributed to Israel on Iran\u2019s growing military infrastructure in Syria.Nightly news broadcasts have opened with unnerving scenarios of missile attacks launched by Iran\u2019s Shiite proxies and a possible infiltration attempt from Syria or Lebanon. Television crews have been checking the readiness of bomb shelters in northern Israel. On Tuesday, the United States chimed in, warning its employees in Israel not to venture into the Golan Heights, which borders Syria.Israel has also exposed an unusual amount of additional intelligence material, from grainy aerial photos of Iranian drones to the Iranian nuclear archive captured in a daring Mossad operation. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s disclosure of that archive last week was an extraordinary departure for a country that, only weeks ago, acknowledged its 2007 bombing of a Syrian nuclear reactor.\u201cThese are warning shots directed not just at the Iranians, but also the Syrians and Russians,\u201d Ehud Yaari, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said of the public-relations campaign. He said it was \u201cintended to tell the Iranians if they think they can disguise what they are going to do and cover their fingerprints through some proxy in Syria, that is not going to work.\u201dThis is not the first time that Mr. Netanyahu has rattled sabers toward Iran. But it is playing out quite differently than in 2010, when he first began agitating for a military strike to cripple Iran\u2019s nuclear program.At the time, Israel\u2019s generals opposed him, as did much of his own cabinet. Now, however, even moderate Israelis are concerned about Iran\u2019s belligerent moves, which have become more evident over time.\u201cThe conventional Iranian threat is much more clear, and this is why Netanyahu has the support of most of the Israeli military establishment, which he didn\u2019t have on the nuclear issue,\u201d said Mr. Shavit. \u201cThere are signs of weakness in Iran domestically, which he thinks can be exploited. And with megahawks in the White House, they listen to him in a totally different way than the previous team did.\u201dThere has been debate within Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government, to be sure \u2014 but it has largely concerned not whether to confront Iran, but how to sequence that confrontation.One group, according to Ofer Zalzberg, an analyst at International Crisis Group, said that the nuclear agreement was flawed but that Israel faced more pressing challenges from Iran in Syria, and that the nuclear deal bought time for Israel to build the offensive capacity it would need to destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear program if it came to that.The other group, including the prime minister, views this as the most opportune moment to squeeze Iran with economic pressure and a credible military threat, Mr. Zalzberg said.\u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018We have Bolton, we have Pompeo \u2014 where will we be in two years or four years?\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the new American national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. \u201c\u2018We have a president who views this deal as a disaster. Now is the time.\u2019\u201dIsabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Cardinal Pell Case Has Been So Secretive", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCardinal George Pell, the Vatican\u2019s third-highest-ranking official, will stand trial on several charges of sexual abuse from multiple complainants, an Australian court ruled on Tuesday.It is occurring in a country where where defamation law favors plaintiffs, where criminal law protects defendants more than it does in many other countries, and where a number of legal standards restrict reporters\u2019 ability to publish information related to criminal cases.Here\u2019s a guide to why many of the details of Cardinal Pell\u2019s case may remain obscured, and to what we know about the cardinal and the case so far.Australian criminal law tends to be more favorable to defendants, and its proceedings more secretive, than in the United States.Depending on the type of offense, journalists cannot publish information in a wide range of categories, including specific accusations against an individual; any prior convictions the person may have, or affiliations with convicted criminals; and material that might be deemed unreasonably favorable to a defendant\u2019s case.All news organizations in Australia are subject to these restrictions, which creates the potential for vast differences between articles about a case published from inside Australia and the work of organizations based elsewhere.In many cases, suppression orders are used to further restrict what journalists can report in Australia, placing certain details that appear in court records off limits.In rare cases, even reporting the existence of a suppression order can be forbidden, meaning that journalists cannot tell readers precisely why certain details are missing from their coverage. These are sometimes referred to as superinjunctions.\u201cQuite often, orders will be made to protect the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial,\u201d said Jason Bosland, a law professor at the University of Melbourne, whose research has focused on court proceedings. \u201cThat\u2019s the main purpose of an order.\u201dBut, he added, such orders are often approved without a rigorous determination of whether they are in fact necessary.In a report published before Cardinal Pell\u2019s case began, Mr. Bosland wrote: \u201cOpen justice is increasingly being undermined in Victoria due to the inappropriate use of suppression orders by the courts.\u201d Melbourne is in the state of Victoria.In an interview, Mr. Bosland added: \u201cThe problem in Australia is that the courts tend to make orders that don\u2019t comply with the strict requirements of the law.\u201dThe son of a Catholic mother and an Anglican father, George Pell grew up in Ballarat, a mining town northwest of Melbourne, where he also served as a priest from 1971 to 1984.During that time, accusations of abuse by priests swirled through the area, but Cardinal Pell later said that he had no memory of hearing about specific substantiated cases of sexual abuse.His rise through the church was swift. He became bishop of Melbourne in 1996. Less than a year later, he formed the \u201cMelbourne Response,\u201d a process to investigate local accusations of sexual abuse against Catholic clergymen.More than a dozen priests accused of abuse stepped down during Cardinal Pell\u2019s time in Melbourne, but he also protected the church\u2019s finances. The Melbourne Response capped payouts to victims at 50,000 Australian dollars ($38,000), far below what victims in other countries would later receive.In 2007, he was appointed to a council of cardinals assigned to improve the Vatican\u2019s finances. In 2014, Pope Francis named him prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively making him the Vatican\u2019s treasurer and its third most senior figure.Last June, his legal team received the charges against him in the state of Victoria. Pope Francis gave him a leave of absence to return to Australia to mount his defense.Cardinal Pell has been charged with \u201chistorical sexual offenses.\u201d No further details of those charges have been publicly released by the courts.Cardinal Pell previously denied knowing about abuse in the 1970s and \u201980s, but the description of the crimes that have been made available to the public would suggest that he is now being accused of having been personally engaged in sexual offenses by multiple complainants.Of the various charges, about half of which will move to trial, most appear to be linked to two locations where the alleged offenses took place, spanning many years. But the vast majority of charges against the Cardinal were either withdrawn or dismissed, including several of the most serious allegations, which were said to have taken place in a playground, on an altar, on a mountain top, and during a 1970s screening of \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind.\u201dWhat\u2019s also known is that Cardinal Pell is the highest-ranking Vatican cleric to face charges of sexual crimes, and that he has aggressively denied the charges.\u201cThe whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,\u201d he said at a news conference in Rome last June.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chance of Nafta Deal in 2018 Diminishes as Talks Drag Past Congressional Deadline", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The prospect of rewriting the North American Free Trade Agreement this year appeared to diminish significantly on Thursday, as a deadline set by congressional Republicans passed and the lead American trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said the countries involved were \u201cnowhere near close to a deal.\u201dTo get an agreement approved by the current, Republican-controlled Congress, Speaker Paul D. Ryan set a May 17 cutoff for the White House to notify Congress of an impending deal. As that deadline came and went on Thursday, Canada, Mexico and the United States remained at odds over significant portions of the sprawling 24-year-old agreement.Trade advisers across the political spectrum cautioned that the current Congress could still vote on the deal this year if negotiators wrapped up their talks in the next few weeks. But with significant disagreements remaining among the three countries as well as disparate views among the lawmakers who must approve the deal, the chance of Nafta\u2019s quick resolution is diminishing.In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said that \u201cgaping differences\u201d remained between the countries on intellectual property, agriculture, energy and other areas. \u201cWe of course will continue to engage in negotiations, and I look forward to working with my counterparts to secure the best possible deal for American farmers, ranchers, workers and businesses,\u201d he added.The delays could leave the future of a revised Nafta in the hands of Democrats, if they win one or both houses of Congress in this year\u2019s midterm elections. And that in turn would most likely increase the chances that President Trump\u2019s Nafta deal would not be ratified by Congress at all, trade experts say.Trump officials had been angling for a quick agreement to avoid that possibility and appeared to be making progress last week on key provisions related to automobiles. But the three countries have yet to finalize the auto terms and remain divided on some provisions, as well as other controversial points, like the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to add a five-year sunset clause to the deal and scale back legal protections for foreign investors.Further complicating the talks is Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that Mexico address the flow of migrants into the United States and his threat to tie immigration to the revised agreement.American officials have proposed limiting the flow of migrants into the United States by creating what is known as a \u201cSafe Third Country\u201d agreement with Mexico. That would allow American border officials to turn away asylum seekers who use Mexico as a path to the United States.The United States has such an agreement with Canada, and forging a similar pact with Mexico could significantly reduce the number of migrants flowing in over the southern border. But such a deal would create logistical and financial burdens for Mexico in dealing with asylum seekers, many of whom travel from Central America and through Mexico on their way to the United States.Mexican officials \u2014 including the economy secretary, Ildefonso Guajardo, who is leading the Nafta talks \u2014 have insisted that the negotiations be confined to the content of the agreement itself, and not include immigration.But the issues remain linked for Mr. Trump, who tweeted last month: \u201cMexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement.\u201dOfficials from both countries met on Thursday for the first of two days of scheduled talks on a range of issues related to immigration.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, declined on Thursday to comment on continuing negotiations but said that, on immigration, \u201cthe president does want to see Mexico step up and do more.\u201dUntil last Friday, Mexican officials thought they had come to a compromise with their American counterparts on a key part of Nafta as they neared agreement on rules that would raise the share of an automobile\u2019s content that has to be made in the region to qualify for zero tariffs, and rules governing the minimum wages of those working on autos, according to a Mexican government official with knowledge of the talks.The Mexicans have been eager to finalize an accord before their presidential election, which is scheduled for July 1. The Americans, believing the Mexicans would bend on the automobile rules to get a deal quickly, insisted on a toughened position last week and the Mexicans responded by rejecting the proposal, saying they would rather have no deal than a bad deal, according to officials briefed on the talks.Michael C. Camu\u00f1ez, a former official in the United States Commerce Department, said Mr. Lighthizer was pressing last week for the three countries to come to a separate agreement on the auto industry. In return, Mexico had expected flexibility on some points of contention, he said.Mexican and Canadian negotiators insist that the Trump administration faces its toughest hurdles internally. Republicans now control both houses of Congress and could greatly accelerate or impede the ratification of a revised Nafta deal. But congressional Republicans, along with many business groups, oppose several of the Trump administration\u2019s signature proposals for overhauling Nafta, including the sunset clause and changes to investment rules.The congressional calendar provides a short window for the current Congress to approve a revised pact. If Democrats take control of one or both chambers of Congress in the midterm elections, that could diminish the administration\u2019s chances of getting a vote at all.Republicans are now urging the administration to come to a quicker resolution, which may require leaving some of those more difficult proposals on the cutting room floor.\u201cWe\u2019ll see if they can get this done by May 17 and get us the paper to Congress,\u201d Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said on May 9. \u201cWhich then we could have this vote by December. If we can\u2019t, then we won\u2019t.\u201dRepresentative Kevin Brady, the chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, reiterated those comments on Tuesday.\u201cWe believe for the 115th Congress to vote this year on a new, modern Nafta, that this week is important for the negotiators to complete their work,\u201d said Mr. Brady, Republican of Texas. \u201cSo we\u2019re hopeful they\u2019ll continue to make progress on this agreement.\u201dThe pressure from congressional leaders may be an indication that they are losing their motivation to hold a vote this year.Daniel Ikenson, the director of trade policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that if the administration notified Congress of its intent to sign a deal by the end of the month, that should be enough time for lawmakers to consider it in the lame duck session. He said Mr. Ryan\u2019s deadline was most likely an effort to get the Trump administration to pare back some of the demands that lawmakers think are not in the best interest of companies or workers.\u201cI think the best way for Trump to secure Republican support is just stop the charade, recognize you\u2019ve made a go of it, maybe some things in the agreement will be updated, but it\u2019s time to stand down,\u201d Mr. Ikenson said. \u201cI do think that\u2019s what Ryan and Republicans are hoping for.\u201dStill, trade experts agree that the timeline for getting the colossal agreement through the current Congress is drawing uncomfortably close. And on June 1, the Trump administration\u2019s exemption for Canada and Mexico from the steel and aluminum tariffs will once again expire, adding another source of tension to the talks.Gardiner Harris and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As U.S. and Chinese Teams Meet on Trade, One Side Has an Edge in Expertise", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China is struggling to find people in Washington who can provide insight into the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive moves on trade. One senior American trade insider tried to help \u2014 and wound up in Beijing with little to do but check out the pottery.That insider, Alan Wolff, a veteran senior adviser to the top United States trade representative and a frequent visitor to Beijing, came to China two weeks ago to speak at a conference on agricultural trade and sought to make contact with top Chinese policymakers.But they did not respond to his requests for meetings, and they said days later that they had not known who he was. Mr. Wolff, an admirer of ancient pottery, instead spent a quiet Saturday in a Beijing museum browsing 2,200-year-old bowls.As members of the Trump administration delegation arrived in Beijing on Thursday for two days of high-level talks, they sat across from Chinese officials with limited experience in trade matters.After a bureaucratic reshuffling, the members of China\u2019s new negotiating team have deep backgrounds in economics and finance, but they are less comfortable with the minutiae of trade laws. And although they are familiar with the American delegation\u2019s main players, they are less acquainted with who does what among lower-level advisers and officials when it comes to United States trade policy.Both countries have played down the possibility that the negotiations will resolve the simmering tensions between them. Still, Chinese officials\u2019 lack of experience in international trade law could make it even harder for the two sides to find common ground before the talks end on Friday.\u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where the Ministry of Commerce doesn\u2019t have all the people in place that it wants to have,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a former four-time chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, citing the Chinese agency that traditionally handles trade matters. \u201cI really think they are unprepared for the negotiation that is taking place.\u201dChinese officials dispute that characterization, saying the reorganization will not hurt a stance that they describe as tough but flexible.\u201cI don\u2019t think it is a problem, or that this process of organizational reform will affect the ability to negotiate,\u201d Li Gang, the vice president of the Chinese commerce ministry\u2019s research and training academy, said in a recent interview.The new team of top Chinese negotiators, few of whom come from the Commerce Ministry, is led by Liu He. Mr. Liu, an economist by training, is a close adviser and longtime friend of President Xi Jinping. Senior Chinese officials and their advisers spoke about economic policy at a three-day Tsinghua University seminar that ended on Monday. Most of them insisted on anonymity for reasons of diplomatic sensitivity.Those attending the seminar said that Chinese negotiators had a warm relationship with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who is a member of the American delegation and a former Goldman Sachs executive. He was described as easy to talk to.Chinese officials said they felt less of a connection to the rest of the group, which includes, among others, Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who was described as brusque by people on the Chinese side; Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser and longtime critic of China; Larry Kudlow, who leads the National Economic Council; and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary.Many of the negotiators representing the United States are more comfortable than their Chinese counterparts with the fine points of trade policy. Mr. Lighthizer, for example, has been immersed in trade issues continuously since the Carter administration, working closely throughout with Mr. Wolff, and has taken a harder stance.By contrast, after a series of bureaucratic reorganizations in recent months, many of China\u2019s top trade negotiators are now economists and bankers with little practical experience in trade matters. The Commerce Ministry\u2019s two main officials for trade talks with the United States, veterans who have negotiated with Washington since the 1990s, were each awarded ambassadorships last year and dispatched to Europe.One senior Chinese official at the seminar who insisted on anonymity said there was deep frustration among his colleagues that, when the two sides talked in the past, American negotiators continually raised details about Chinese trade practices and international trade laws, while those on the Chinese side preferred to discuss a coherent economic strategy.Chinese policymakers are also annoyed about the number of United States agencies involved in the talks. Officials in China are accustomed to dealing with the Treasury, which coordinated American economic policy toward Beijing for nearly two decades. They are less accustomed to dealing with the office of the United States trade representative, which has consistently tilted toward more assertive policies and has a prominent role under President Trump.The senior Chinese official said he missed the old Treasury-led team every day, and Chinese officials have suggested regularly this year that the United States revive that approach. Doing so could allow Treasury to take charge again, even though United States law says the trade agency should be in charge of trade issues.On the Chinese side, the rise of economists and bankers is part of a broad reshuffling meant to consolidate the Communist Party\u2019s political power.As part of the reorganization, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry was broken in March into three separate groups each focused on different issues. The ministry\u2019s office of trade negotiations still exists and has numerous trade lawyers, but people involved with the negotiations say the shuffling has robbed the office of resources and support.What the commission largely lacks are trade lawyers.Chances that the talks would yield major progress appeared slim on Thursday. China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, reiterated Beijing\u2019s stance that should a trade war break out, the country was better prepared thanks to its centralized leadership, strong domestic consumer base and greater desire to protect the current structure of trade.At the seminar over the weekend, Chinese officials also struck a defiant tone. Peng Guangqian, a retired major general who remains an influential military strategist, said, \u201cPresident Trump wants to curb our development.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Break, or Kickback? Energy Benefit Becomes a Lightning Rod", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut a growing chorus of public agencies complain that they were prevented from benefiting from this same incentive in their own building projects. Conflicting interpretations of the law and how it should be applied, they say, have caused taxpayer-funded schools, prisons, military bases and libraries throughout the nation to lose out on millions of dollars in savings.The issue has heated up as state and local governments, and other public entities, move more aggressively to claim a piece of this federal subsidy. Lobbyists and lawyers have joined the scramble as Congress revisits this incentive and decides whether to extend it along with a raft of other tax breaks left out of last year\u2019s tax overhaul.\u201cIt rarely gives the benefits to the parties you intended to give it to,\u201d he said, \u201cand more often rewards parties that you never intended to reward.\u201dThe law did not specify whether a public project or agency should get anything in exchange for the transfer. But taxpayer advocates argue that enabling a public entity to negotiate with a private contractor for a reduced fee or a rebate in return for signing away the 179D deduction was clearly the point.\u201cThe whole purpose of the tax deduction was to incentivize owners, and our situation as a governmental entity is no different from Apple or any other corporate entity,\u201d Philip Aldridge, vice chancellor for business development at the University of Texas, said. The University of Texas System and the University of Houston System have filed a lawsuit arguing that they were misled into transferring incentives worth millions of dollars without compensation.\u201cWe own the building, we financed 100 percent of the building, and we, as the owner, determined whether the building was going to be energy efficient or not,\u201d Mr. Aldridge said.\u201cGovernment can\u2019t give away things of value without being compensated,\u201d Mr. Duchac said.A few lawmakers have also warned federal officials that asking for fees in return for allocating the deduction might amount to a \u201ckickback.\u201dBut more and more state agencies, public entities and others are pushing back against that interpretation.The question of who deserves to benefit from the 179D tax deduction is particularly complicated because both contractors and governments are often unaware of it until after the project\u2019s completion.That\u2019s where the consultants come in.\u201cNot many know about this,\u201d said Barry Fischman, a partner at the accounting firm Marcum. Most of the time, he said, the deduction is sought when \u201cthe job is already done, finished and closed.\u201dNo matter that the tax break did not work as intended \u2014 since it did not act as an incentive to invest in energy efficiencies that wouldn\u2019t have been done anyway. It can still be claimed.Tax consultants, pointing out that recent tax returns can be amended, urge private contractors to take advantage of a windfall and request 179D transfers related to previous public projects.Public agencies, however, complain of simultaneously being told that they have no right to engage in a parallel look back and ask for a share of that money in return for the transfer.In a statement, Alliantgroup said: \u201cWe are disappointed that the University of Texas System and University of Houston System have been led into a frivolous lawsuit against Alliantgroup and our client.\u201dThe firm also noted that members of Congress and other government agencies had said 179D \u201cwas not intended to provide kickbacks to government entities who do not pay taxes in exchange for a tax-deduction allocation letter.\u201dSenator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, raised the issue of kickbacks, too, in 2016 when the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development asked for compensation in exchange for transferring its energy deductions from a completed project.A spokeswoman for Mr. Cardin said the senator\u2019s objection referred solely to public agencies demanding a fee for administering the confirmation letter, and not to \u201cusing 179D writ large as a way to negotiate a project\u2019s cost.\u201dOther schools have also taken issue with applications overseen by Alliantgroup. The University of Connecticut discovered that the firm had solicited a 179D transfer from unauthorized employees on behalf of different clients for the same project.\u201cI was dismayed,\u201d said Scott A. Jordan, the University of Connecticut\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cThere seemed to be a bounty sort of system where companies like Alliant were coming in and pressing owners to sign off on behalf of clients.\u201d The incident, he said, prompted the university to devise a formal policy on how to handle the incentive.As for the broader issue of who should benefit, Mr. Jordan pointed out that the university\u2019s board already required buildings to be energy efficient. \u201cIf we have already established policy, we don\u2019t need an incentive to do that,\u201d he said.But if the federal government is going to subsidize energy efficiency, he added, then \u201cthe owners should be the recipients of the subsidy and not the builder.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple and the Fruits of Tax Cuts", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistBut they have a problem: Public perceptions about who benefits from the tax cut, and who doesn\u2019t, are accurate, a point Apple just nicely demonstrated with its announcement of a huge stock buyback.To be fair, the notion that a big tax cut for corporations \u2014 which was the main element of last year\u2019s law \u2014 might eventually redound to the benefit of workers isn\u2019t crazy. But the two key words here are \u201cmight\u201d and \u201ceventually.\u201dThe story tax-cut boosters tell runs as follows: America is part of a global capital market in which capital flows wherever it yields the highest after-tax rate of return. By cutting taxes on corporations, Trump and his allies have given corporations an incentive to invest here. Investment will expand capacity, driving up the demand for workers and thus lead to higher wages.But what does \u201cbringing money to America\u201d mean? Apple didn\u2019t have a huge, Scrooge McDuck-style pile of gold sitting in Ireland, which it loaded onto a homeward-bound ship. It has digital claims \u2014 a bunch of zeros and ones on some server somewhere \u2014 which in effect used to bear a label saying \u201cthis money is in Ireland.\u201d Now it has changed the label to say \u201cthis money is in America.\u201d What difference does this make?Well, it alters the company\u2019s tax liabilities to the U.S. and Irish governments, which was the point of the change. But otherwise it makes no difference at all.But why aren\u2019t the benefits of the tax cut flowing to workers?One answer is that even if the pro-tax-cut story were true for the long run, it would take many years of extremely high investment to achieve the kind of capacity expansion that would cause major wage gains. Another is that the global capital market isn\u2019t as global as all that \u2014 the investment world, we might say, is still a long way from being flat. America is a huge economy, and even in the long run it can\u2019t attract the kind of capital inflows tax-cut enthusiasts envision without offering significantly higher rates of return \u2014 which means more for stockholders and less for workers.And at a deeper level, tax-cut enthusiasts may have a fundamentally out-of-date view about where profits come from.Apple, however, is nothing like that. Its profits come from its market position \u2014 its brand, if you like. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you think it deserves its role as a quasi-monopolist; what matters is that given its position, it can and does charge what the market will bear, pretty much regardless of costs. If Trump cuts its taxes, it gets to keep more of its profits, but it has no real incentive to change its behavior by, say, building more Apple stores. It just takes the extra money and either sits on it or hands it back to stockholders via buybacks.And these days a lot of corporate America is at least a bit like Apple. Not all of it; there are still businesses \u2014 say, trucking companies \u2014 whose value resides largely in the stuff they own. But economic \u201crents,\u201d profits not tied to physical capital, are a big, growing story. And when you cut taxes on rents, there\u2019s no reason at all to expect workers to share the bounty, even in the long run.The bottom line \u2014 which will remain true no matter how much the Kochs spend trying to convince you otherwise \u2014 is that what looks like a big giveaway to wealthy investors is, in fact, a big giveaway to wealthy investors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The U.S. and China: More Alike Than We\u2019d Like?", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistIt is impossible to visit China these days and not compare and contrast the drama playing out in Beijing politics with the drama playing out in Washington politics. While the differences are many, I am sorry to report that some of the parallels are getting too close for comfort.Let\u2019s start with the fact that the anti-corruption crackdown by President Xi Jinping has created a climate of fear in China these days \u2014 whether about interacting with foreigners or saying the wrong thing or behaving too extravagantly so as to attract the state \u201canti-corruption\u201d detectives.But because \u201ccorruption\u201d has not been clearly defined \u2014 and can be used to get rid of anyone for any reason \u2014 people don\u2019t know where the line is, so they\u2019re extra cautious. That\u2019s why during a week in Beijing the most frequent expression I heard was, \u201cYou\u2019re not quoting me on this, right?\u201dAt the same time, in China today, if you\u2019re a Communist Party official or senior bureaucrat, you have to toe the ruling party\u2019s line or you could be quickly purged or imprisoned. In America today, if you\u2019re a Republican Party congressman or senator, you, too, have to toe the ruling party\u2019s line or you could be quickly purged or primaried \u2014 or get a tweet in the back from the president.But there is one difference: In China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, it\u2019s never safe to criticize the president. In America\u2019s ruling Republican Party, you can criticize the president, or vote your conscience, if you\u2019re dying, retiring or whispering.Or, as a dying Senator John McCain observed in his new book: \u201cThis is my last term. \u2026 I\u2019m freer than colleagues who will face the voters again. I can speak my mind without fearing the consequences much. And I can vote my conscience without worry.\u201dI suspect President Xi has a far higher truth batting average in his public statements than President Trump.The fawning and lack of skepticism with which China Central Television covers Xi, though, is indistinguishable from the fawning and lack of skepticism by \u201cFox & Friends\u201d and Sean Hannity when discussing Trump.That probably partially explains why more and more Chinese do not think that we are as \u201cexceptional\u201d a nation as we think we are \u2014 and they are now ready to say so: loudly. I was struck by how many officials and experts at a Tsinghua University seminar I attended were so willing to baldly state that their top-down, one-party system of governance and state-directed capitalism was superior to our multiparty, democratic, free-market system.And the two big pieces of evidence they always cited was that they never went through the kind of 2008 economic meltdown that we did, and their system never put up a leader as undisciplined, dishonest and unstable as Donald Trump (at least not since Mao).But Xi and the Chinese Communist Party at least stimulated their economy in order to avoid a real economic crisis \u2014 for themselves and the world. Trump and his Republican Party just added $1.5 trillion to America\u2019s debt to pay for tax cuts for businesses and individuals at a time when our economy was already on the rise. Trump did so knowing that he would be here to take credit for any boom \u2014 and be long gone when we have to do the belt-tightening necessary so that interest on the debt doesn\u2019t devour all nondefense spending and lead to a bust.One contrast, Chinese are ready to sacrifice to make China great again. Trump wants to make America great again without asking us to do anything hard \u2014 just cut taxes and regulations for rich people and corporations and keep pumping fossil fuels, and not invest in public goods like education and infrastructure, which have been the real engines of China\u2019s resurgence.Chinese foreign policy has always been transactional, saying to neighbors, \u201cGive us access to your markets and we will build you infrastructure that we can both use \u2014 then we will be allies.\u201d U.S. foreign policy, while it has always had its cynical, transactional side, particularly in the Cold War, has tended more toward, \u201cShare our values and then we can be allies.\u201dBut Trump clearly wants us to act more like China: \u201cDon\u2019t show me your values. Show me your money and your arms purchases. Don\u2019t think of me as your ally. Think of me as your landlord. Pay for our protection and we can be friends.\u201dBut they will have to hold for at least another two and a half years, and that will not be easy with a president like Trump, who was surely not 100 percent joking when he said in March of President Xi: \u201cPresident for life. \u2026 I think it\u2019s great. Maybe we\u2019ll want to give that a shot someday.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Iran Move May Swamp Greece", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Konstandaras is a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini and a contributing opinion writer.After eight years of being kept afloat by loans from its European Union partners and the International Monetary Fund, Greece suddenly risks being swamped by waves caused by President Trump\u2019s unilateral stirring of the Middle East\u2019s caldron of tensions and conflicting interests.Compared with the immediate danger of regional conflict and even greater bloodshed, the danger to Greece may seem secondary, but it illustrates the unforeseen consequences of impetuous American actions.Washington\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran and its decision to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem could trigger a chain of events that would jeopardize Greece\u2019s fragile economic recovery. With the last of three international bailout agreements set to end in August, the government has been pressing the message that Greece will soon be a \u201cnormal\u201d country, able to hold its own in the international economy. Turbulence in the region would create new threats to its economy, its security, even its relations with its key partners \u2014 the United States and the European Union.Greece already has problems with neighboring Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is campaigning for re-election in snap polls on June 24 and has invested in stoking nationalist fervor \u2014 primarily against Kurds in Syria, Turkey and Iraq, but also against the United States and Greece.Ankara\u2019s worsening relations with Washington and European capitals over a host of issues have led to more pressure on Greece: a sharp increase of immigrants and refugees crossing from Turkey in recent months, the ongoing detention in Turkey of two Greek soldiers who strayed across the border in early March and a series of confrontational military actions by Turkey. These all highlight the dangers that Greece faces as the European Union\u2019s frontier state in a turbulent region.Mr. Erdogan presents himself as the victim of an attempted coup, allegedly by a United States-based former ally, Fethullah Gulen, and as the champion of Muslims everywhere, including the Palestinians. Lately, in the region\u2019s fluid network of rivalries and alliances, Turkey, a NATO member, has cultivated closer ties with Russia and Iran while chafing against American constraints on its occupation of part of northern Syria. The drawing of battle lines over Mr. Trump\u2019s recent actions could lead to greater tension among Turkey, the United States and Israel.For Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose radical left-wing Syriza party is in a coalition with the far-right nationalist Independent Greeks, closer relations with the United States and Israel at this time could also create domestic complications. If the United States and Israel become embroiled in further bloodshed, such as that which attended the opening ceremony of the American Embassy in Jerusalem, the government will not want to appear too close to them. Several leftist groups are keen to prove they have greater \u201canti-imperialist\u201d credentials than Syriza. Last month, after the United States, Britain and France carried out missile strikes against Syria in response to the regime\u2019s alleged use of chemical weapons, Communist Party demonstrators in Athens tried to pull down a statue of Harry Truman.Even more ominous than the tension with Turkey is the possibility that Mr. Trump\u2019s policy on Iran and Israel could drive a wedge between the United States and the European Union, especially if American officials carry out their threat to impose sanctions against European companies doing business with Tehran.Athens would then face difficult and dangerous choices. Greece, a NATO member, has relied on the United States as its major ally since 1947, when Washington, through the Truman Doctrine, helped the government win a civil war against Communist forces.But Greece is also a member of the European Union. Its partners in Europe pledged most of the 326 billion euros that, in three bailouts since 2010, have kept the country from bankruptcy. The United States has contributed only through its share of the 32.1 billion euros that the International Monetary Fund lent Greece.Greece\u2019s economic recovery depends on negotiating with its European partners a reduction of its public debt (318.3 billion euros last year), so Athens cannot afford to isolate itself in Europe by taking the United States\u2019 side in any major dispute. But neither can it depend on the European Union\u2019s nascent defense capability in an increasingly unstable region.This instability is the greatest immediate threat. Greece needs high growth and an annual primary surplus of 3.5 percent until 2022 to meet conditions set by its creditors in exchange for any debt write-down. And the economy\u2019s viability will depend on the size of this reduction. Any significant rise in oil prices, skittishness in the markets and regional security fears that could keep tourists and investors away would undermine the recovery effort. The country is heavily dependent on tourism, which last year contributed 10.3 percent of G.D.P. (18.3 billion euros).The bailout may be ending and the government may be declaring that it does not need an emergency credit line after August, but after eight years of austerity, reforms and sacrifices, Greece is clearly not out of trouble. And factors beyond its control could soon determine its immediate future.Nikos Konstandaras, a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Abandons Iran Nuclear Deal He Long Scorned", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump declared on Tuesday that he was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, unraveling the signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor Barack Obama, isolating the United States from its Western allies and sowing uncertainty before a risky nuclear negotiation with North Korea.Iran said it will remain in the deal, which tightly restricted its nuclear ambitions for a decade or more in return for ending the sanctions that had crippled its economy.So did France, Germany and Britain, raising the prospect of a trans-Atlantic clash as European companies face the return of American sanctions for doing business with Iran. China and Russia, also signatories to the deal, are likely to join Iran in accusing the United States of violating the accord.Mr. Trump\u2019s move could embolden hard-line forces in Iran, raising the threat of Iranian retaliation against Israel or the United States, fueling an arms race in the Middle East and fanning sectarian conflicts from Syria to Yemen.The president, however, framed his decision as the fulfillment of a bedrock campaign promise and as the act of a dealmaker dissolving a fatally flawed agreement. He predicted his tough line with Iran would strengthen his hand as he prepared to meet North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to begin negotiating the surrender of his nuclear arsenal.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement drew a chorus of opposition from European leaders, several of whom lobbied him feverishly not to pull out of the agreement and searched for fixes to it that would satisfy him.It also drew a rare public rebuke by Mr. Obama, who said Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal would leave the world less safe, confronting it with \u201ca losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East.\u201dThe response from Iran itself, however, was muted. President Hassan Rouhani declared that the Iranians intended to abide by the terms of the deal, and he criticized Mr. Trump for his history of not honoring international treaties. Mr. Trump won strong backing from Saudi Arabia and Israel, whose leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hailed him for a \u201chistoric move\u201d and \u201ccourageous leadership.\u201dThe restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program under the deal could survive.Three times previously, the president\u2019s aides had persuaded him not to dismantle the Iran deal. But Mr. Trump made clear that his patience had worn thin, and with a new, more hawkish cohort of advisers \u2014 led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton \u2014 the president faced less internal resistance than earlier in his administration.While Mr. Trump had long scorned the Iran deal, threatening repeatedly to rip it up during the 2016 presidential race, his impulse to act now was reinforced by what he views as the success of his policy toward North Korea. He has told aides and foreign leaders that his policy of maximum pressure had forced Mr. Kim to the bargaining table, and that a similar policy of overwhelming pressure would enable the United States to extract a better deal from Iran.As Mr. Trump abandoned one diplomatic project, he accelerated another \u2014 announcing that Mr. Pompeo was flying to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, to continue discussions with Mr. Kim about the upcoming summit meeting. He expressed hope that three Americans who are detained in the North would be released soon.\u201cThe message to North Korea,\u201d Mr. Bolton told reporters, \u201cis the president wants a real deal.\u201dHe rejected the suggestion that the United States could not be trusted to keep its agreements when political winds change. \u201cAny nation reserves the right to correct a past mistake,\u201d Mr. Bolton said, citing President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2001.The Trump administration, he said, would continue to work with Europeans to pressure the Iranians. He dismissed those who said the United States was on a path to war with Iran, though he did not present any new diplomatic initiatives. Another senior administration official acknowledged that there was no Plan B.Months of intense negotiations with the Europeans to keep the accord in place collapsed over Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that the limits placed by the agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear fuel production were inadequate. Under the provisions of the deal, those limits, or \u201csunset clauses,\u201d were to expire in 2030 \u2014 15 years after the deal was signed.As a result, the United States will reinstate all the sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord, and it will impose additional economic penalties that are now being drawn up by the Treasury Department.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined on Tuesday to specify what additional sanctions the United States might impose, but he expressed confidence that they would still be powerful even if other American allies did not follow suit.\u201cWe do not want to let Iran use the U.S. financial markets and financial system and transact in dollars until they agree that not only will they not have a nuclear weapon now, but we\u2019ve put in provisions that they will never have one,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.In his announcement, Mr. Trump recited familiar arguments against the deal: that it does not address the threat of Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles or its malign behavior in the region, and that the expiration dates for the sunset clauses open the door to an Iranian nuclear bomb down the road.Even if Iran was in compliance, he said, it could \u201cstill be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.\u201d In fact, under the deal, the limits on Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and stockpiles of nuclear fuel mean that Iran would not be on the verge of a nuclear breakout until 2030.Still, Mr. Trump said, the United States and its allies could not stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon \u201cunder the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.\u201d\u201cThe Iran deal is defective at its core,\u201d he concluded.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement capped a frantic four-day period in which American and European diplomats made a last-ditch effort to bridge their differences and preserve the agreement.That effort began Friday, when Mr. Pompeo called his counterparts in Europe to tell them that Mr. Trump was planning to withdraw from the deal, but that he was trying to win a two-week reprieve for the United States and Europe to continue negotiating. Mr. Pompeo, people familiar with the talks said, suggested that he favored a so-called soft withdrawal, in which Mr. Trump would pull out of the deal but hold off on reimposing some of the sanctions.The next day, the State Department\u2019s chief negotiator, Brian H. Hook, consulted with European diplomats to try to break a deadlock over the sunset provision, under which the restrictions on Iran\u2019s ability to produce nuclear fuel for civilian use expire after 15 years.The Europeans had already agreed to a significant compromise: to reimpose sanctions if there were a determination that the Iranians were within 12 months of producing a nuclear weapon. But officials said that still did not satisfy Mr. Trump, and the Europeans were not willing to go any further.By Monday, the White House began informing allies that Mr. Trump was going to withdraw from the deal and reimpose sanctions on oil and impose new sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran.Under the financial sanctions, European companies will have 90 to 180 days to wind down their operations in Iran, or they will run afoul of the American banking system. The sanctions on oil will require European and Asian countries to reduce their imports from Iran.Mr. Mnuchin insisted that the restrictions would not drive up oil prices because other suppliers would pick up the slack. \u201cMy expectation is not that oil prices go higher,\u201d he said. \u201cTo a certain extent, some of this was already in the market on oil prices.\u201d\u201cThe international regime against nuclear proliferation is at stake,\u201d he added.In a joint statement, Mr. Macron, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain noted pointedly that the United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the nuclear deal remained the \u201cbinding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute.\u201d That raises the possibility that the United States will be found to be in violation in the Security Council.Few people were more stung by Mr. Trump\u2019s decision than those who worked for Mr. Obama. Though he has moved methodically to dismantle his predecessor\u2019s legacy, his reversal of the Iran deal was particularly painful, given the five years of effort that went into imposing sanctions, and the more than two-year-long negotiation led by Secretary of State John Kerry that yielded the accord.\u201cNo rhetoric is required,\u201d Mr. Kerry said in a statement. \u201cThe facts speak for themselves. Instead of building on unprecedented nonproliferation verification measures, this decision risks throwing them away and dragging the world back to the brink we faced a few years ago.\u201dReporting was contributed by Peter Baker, Alan Rappeport, David E. Sanger, Gardiner Harris and Nicholas Fandos.Advertisement"}

According to federal law, hospitals are required to provide emergency care and to stabilize all patients regardless of a patient\u2019s ability to pay. A result is that hospitals provide billions of dollars in uncompensated care to uninsured patients every year.But when patients don\u2019t pay for their hospital care, those costs are shifted to government and private health insurers, who are charged higher rates by hospitals to make up for the losses they incur from nonpaying patients.

Asking frightened patients to diagnose their illnesses without the benefit of training is absurd on its face.Anthem, like most health insurers, is obligated to maximize the wealth of its shareholders. The company has been very successful in this regard, generating profits of $3.8 billion in 2017, and paying an effective tax rate of 3.1 percent, according to Healthcare Finance.The practice of threatening not to cover an E.R. visit is consistent with this goal. What does it matter if a few patients die or are injured because they are afraid of getting hit with a large medical bill?

{"Headline": "California Sues Trump Administration Over Car Emissions Rules", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA coalition led by California sued the Trump administration over car emissions rules on Tuesday, escalating a revolt against a proposed rollback of fuel economy standards that threatens to split the country\u2019s auto market.In a lawsuit filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, California and its coalition \u2014 16 other states and the District of Columbia \u2014 called the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s effort to weaken auto emissions rules unlawful and accused the agency of failing to follow its own regulations, and of violating the Clean Air Act. \u201cStates representing 140 million Americans are getting together to sue Outlaw Pruitt \u2014 not Administrator Pruitt, but Outlaw Pruitt,\u201d Gov. Jerry Brown of California said at a news conference, referring to Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cThis is about health, it\u2019s about life and death,\u201d Governor Brown said. \u201cI\u2019m going to fight it with everything I can.\u201dTuesday\u2019s lawsuit represents an important step in a brewing battle between the state and the Trump administration over climate change regulations. That battle could break into war in the coming weeks if the E.P.A. moves to substantially weaken the nation\u2019s current greenhouse gas rules for tailpipe emissions or challenges a legal waiver that allows California to set its own greenhouse gas emissions regulations. It is not yet clear if the E.P.A. will take those steps, but Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit could strengthen California\u2019s legal hand if that were to happen. California has long been authorized under the 1970 Clean Air Act to write its own stricter air pollution rules, and a dozen other states have traditionally followed those standards, which are designed to curb earth-warming emissions from cars and light trucks.California officials have said they will fight in court any attempt by the Trump administration to revoke or bypass their power to set their own auto emissions standards. Here are three big issues for the state.In 2012, when the Obama administration set a comprehensive set of standards on greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy for cars and light trucks \u2014 aiming to roughly double the average fuel economy of new cars, S.U.V.s and light trucks by 2025 \u2014 California agreed to harmonize its regulations with the new federal standards.But last spring, executives from the Big Three automakers went to the White House to ask for more lenient emissions rules, kicking off an effort by the administration to roll back those standards. California had said it would stick with the tougher regulations and threatened to sue should Washington try to challenge its authority to follow its own air pollution rules. \u201cThis is California saying: You really want war? We\u2019ll give you war,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, an advocate for stronger emissions rules. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal to the administration that they\u2019re not going to get away with anything in this space.\u201dA legal battle with California brings the nation\u2019s auto industry closer to a split into two markets as its legal challenge plays out in court: one that continues to follow stricter rules requiring cars to be more efficient and less polluting than the other.The 18 jurisdictions joining in Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit represent more than 40 percent of the United States auto market, California said. According to its news release, they are: California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.Automakers are scrambling to avoid that outcome, urging continued talks for a unified national program. They have asked for a direct meeting with President Trump to try to avert an all-out weakening of regulations that they fear will now go well beyond what they themselves initially sought, according to two people with knowledge of the automakers\u2019 plans.Separately, Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, sent a letter to the secretary of the Department of Transportation, Elaine Chao, and Mr. Pruitt asking that they abandon the rollback.\u201cSuch a proposal, if finalized, would harm U.S. national and economic security, undermine efforts to combat global warming pollution, create regulatory and manufacturing uncertainty for the automobile industry and unnecessary litigation, increase the amount of gasoline consumers would have to buy, and runs counter to statements that both of you have made,\u201d Senator Carper wrote. \u201cI urge you to immediately disavow this proposal.\u201dHiroko Tabuchi reported from New York and Coral Davenport from Washington.

{"Headline": "On Trade, the U.S. and China Consider the Unthinkable: Breaking Up", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The economic relationship between China and the United States has defined the modern era. It helped lift hundreds of millions of people in China out of poverty. It gave affordable iPhones and other gadgets to American consumers, handed big profits to American companies and delivered 1.3 billion hungry customers to American farmers.Now some people in both countries want to tear it apart.As a top Chinese economic policymaker meets with the Trump administration this week in hopes of heading off a potential trade war, some officials in both countries are planning for a time when the world\u2019s two biggest economies do not need each other quite so much any more. They are seeking nothing less than a fundamental rethinking of a trade relationship that encompasses more than $700 billion in goods and services that flow between the countries every year.Full disengagement is impossible, leaders on both sides acknowledge. But the plans being developed in Beijing and Washington anticipate a time when the economic engines of China and the United States are not so closely linked, particularly in high-tech industries.\u201cIn the next step of tackling technology, we must cast aside illusions and rely on ourselves,\u201d President Xi Jinping of China said last month after visiting a new computer microchip factory in the country\u2019s center.Beijing has Made in China 2025, a plan that calls for the country to become largely self-sufficient and globally competitive in 10 advanced manufacturing sectors now dominated by the West. These include commercial aircraft, robotics, 5G mobile phone communications and computer microchips.China currently depends on the United States and its allies for those elements of a high-tech future. Washington showed that last month with its move to deny American-made components to ZTE, bringing the Chinese company\u2019s factories to a halt.But Washington is also worried about China\u2019s efforts to build homegrown champions. The Trump administration blocked the chip maker Broadcom\u2019s proposed acquisition of Qualcomm, a rival, this year, over concerns that the deal would give China\u2019s Huawei an advantage in 5G technology.The United States has outlined its own strategy of sorts to wean itself from China. Should the Trump administration enact its threatened tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese-made goods, the thinking goes, American corporations would begin to reduce their reliance on Chinese-made small components, machinery and other dull-but-essential parts in the global supply chain.President Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs are partly targeted at industries where customers would have an easier time switching to a supplier based in either the United States or a friendly ally like Germany, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico or India. In most of the initial product categories the administration has identified for tariffs, less than half of the goods imported by American companies come from China.Levi\u2019s has a plan for protecting itself should tensions escalate further. If the Trump administration imposes a levy on clothes made in China, the company could sell American consumers jeans made in Vietnam, Cambodia or one of the three dozen or so other countries where it has suppliers.\u201cIt\u2019s a shell game,\u201d said Chip Bergh, the chief executive of Levi\u2019s. He added, \u201cWe\u2019ll probably still be making a lot of product in China but it just won\u2019t be coming to the U.S.\u201d He noted that jeans made in China could be sold to consumers in Mexico instead.The tariffs are also geared toward the products that will shape the future. China exports almost nothing now in some categories that the Trump administration carefully included in its list for planned tariffs, like electric cars and satellites. But China\u2019s leaders hope that with government nurturing, such industries will soon become big exporters.American laws and World Trade Organization rules allow countries to impose tariffs on subsidized goods from overseas that harm domestic industries. But the Trump administration is trying to pre-empt Chinese exports of subsidized high-tech goods to the United States by imposing tariffs in advance.United States trade officials are counting on tariffs to have long-lasting effects. Decades-old levies on imported pickup trucks, for example, help explain why essentially all pickups sold in the United States \u2014 even those made by Japanese companies like Toyota \u2014 are made in America.American trade policy \u201cwill respond to hostile economic competitors, will recognize the importance of technology, and will seek opportunities to work with other countries that share our goals,\u201d Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, recently told the Senate Finance Committee.ZTE\u2019s punishment, in particular, exposed big gaps in China\u2019s economic prowess.\u201cIt seems likely that the current trade dispute, and the ZTE sanctions in particular, will spur the Chinese government to double down on its economic autarky model, where they seek self-sufficiency in a wider array of technology-based products,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington policy research group backed partly by Western technology companies.The Chinese and American plans both face long odds.At first glance, China\u2019s might seem to have a better chance of success. The country\u2019s state-controlled banking system can steer huge loans at very low interest rates to any industry the central government chooses. Local governments have also been urged to promote targeted industries, which they can do through subsidies like providing downtown land at virtually no cost. Semiconductor factories are now rising in major cities all over China, posing a formidable challenge to the industry\u2019s global players.But China has a long way to go. It trails the United States significantly in crucial areas like microchips, software design and high-end precision manufacturing. As one example, semiconductors designed in the United States make up half the chips China buys every year. American companies can already design and will soon be manufacturing semiconductors with circuits just one-fifth of the size of Chinese circuits.But the United States faces its own challenges. Washington could find it extremely difficult to lure back factories that moved to China over the years. Chinese workers may be more expensive to employ than they once were, but they are still paid a quarter or less than American workers. China has also become a vast new market in its own right \u2014 one that companies are loath to leave \u2014 and has invested huge sums in highways, bullet trains and other systems that make connecting buyers and sellers cheap and easy.And some industries simply may never come back. For example, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs will not touch the consumer electronics industry, in an acknowledgment that the business of making iPhones and Xboxes will stay in China for the foreseeable future.\u201cThey were very bullish on India,\u201d Mr. Fadnavis said, \u201cand now I\u2019m getting more and more inquiries from the U.S.\u201dBut politics, not economics, have played a major role in those decisions, and progress has been slow. Despite a plan to build factories employing 50,000 people in the western Indian state of Maharashtra by 2020, Foxconn now has 16,500 workers in all of India. In China, it has one million.\u201cWe are continuing to invest in expanding our presence and capabilities in locations throughout China,\u201d Foxconn said in a statement.Jie Zhao, a public policy specialist at Fudan University, predicted that increased economic self-reliance in the United States and China would not come quickly, but that it may lie ahead anyway.\u201cNeither China nor the U.S. can eliminate the economic interdependence of each other at this moment in time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut reducing their dependence could be an option for getting ahead in the technological competition and world-power reorganization.\u201dNatalie Kitroeff contributed reporting from New YorkAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Did Ireland Go? Abortion Vote Stuns Those on Both Sides", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBLIN \u2014 Some were joyous. Others were devastated. But most of all, in the hours after Irish voters swept away a ban on abortion, many were simply astonished.However they felt about the result of the referendum, they were witnessing, they knew, the culmination of a fundamental shift in Irish society \u2014 and one that has come about with stunning speed.In a remarkably compact span of time, the country has gone from being a bastion of social conservatism in the West to a place that wholeheartedly embraces positions that would have been unthinkable just a generation ago.The culture of silence and deference to religious authority that long dominated Ireland is gone. The country that has emerged is an unlikely leader of liberal values.\u201cIreland has changed 180 degrees on everything,\u201d said Adam Tyrrell, 24, struggling to take it all in as he smoked a cigarette outside a pub and watched the street fill up with crowds of cheering yes supporters after the results were announced.The nation of 4.8 million people has experienced some of the fastest social and economic change in the world. In a matter of 30 years, Ireland has gone from being a poor and deeply Roman Catholic country to one that is seeing high growth rates and has installed a gay man as prime minister.Long associated with exporting cheap labor, it has accepted a sizable number of immigrants and is home to foreign tech companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook.In 2015, in another popular vote, Ireland approved same-sex marriage by a landslide.\u201cIreland has gone from criminalizing gays, having just one television channel and priests running the show, to now a liberal, European society,\u201d said Mark Neiland, a business owner in his 60s.When he was growing up, Mr. Neiland recalled, Irish families had to decide between cooking dinner on the stove or watching television because electricity was scarce. \u201cIreland was a really poor country,\u201d he said.When Mr. Neiland graduated from high school, he said, every classmate, including him, left for the United States, Canada or Australia.\u201cI would never think of leaving this place for America now,\u201d he said.While the landslide result of the abortion referendum may have surprised much of the world, many Irish were less shocked. They have seen the changes in the country building over time.Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who is half Indian, spoke of a \u201cquiet revolution that has been taking place in Ireland over the last couple of decades.\u201dIreland\u2019s impoverished past, as well as the outsize role of the Catholic Church, had set it apart from much of the rest of Europe. Many saw the referendum as the final step in aligning the country with the rest of the continent.The vote, said Mr. Tyrrell, \u201ccements us as a progressive nation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to change the optics of how people view us after these two landslide victories,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of Ireland.\u201dAlan Barrett, director of the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin, said the results of the abortion referendum indicated a \u201cconvergence with European norms.\u201d\u201cIf you take the standard mainstream views in continental Europe, Ireland was the outlier, and it was always economically behind Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the Catholic Church being moved aside, you\u2019ve got the Irish accumulating their values and views the same way that the French, the Germans or the British get theirs.\u201dThere are many factors behind Ireland\u2019s dramatic makeover. The most dominant reason is the collapse of the Catholic Church\u2019s influence in most spheres of Irish life. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to know that Ireland has been secularizing for a long time,\u201d said Diane Negra, a professor of cultural studies at University College Dublin.The credibility of the church has been battered by a string of scandals, some involving pedophile priests and the cover-up of their crimes.Another major factor driving the change: an economic transformation.As recently as the 1980s, Ireland was a very different place.With a weak economy in that decade, many young Irish left the country to look for jobs abroad, leaving behind an older, more conservative population that was loyal to the church. It was during this period that Ireland voted for restrictive rules on abortion and marriage.In 1983, Ireland voted in favor of the Eighth Amendment in the Constitution, which effectively banned abortion \u2014 the amendment that the Irish voted to repeal on Friday. Three years later, the Irish rejected a proposed amendment to remove a ban on divorce.Attitudes shifted notably in the 1990s with the first revelations of the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, and the beginning of an economic boom.From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, Ireland was proclaimed the \u201cCeltic Tiger.\u201d The decade of prosperity attracted multinationals, increased living standards and brought back Irish expatriates who carried with them new ideas and values.The economy soured for a few years, but then recovered. Last year, Ireland posted a 7.8 percent growth rate, the highest in the European Union \u2014 though many Irish say that inequality has also risen.Ireland\u2019s decision to make secondary schools free improved education, and the introduction of contraception significantly reduced the number of children per family. That helped more women enter the paid work force.Anthony Fannin, 70, a retired engineer, said the economic boom \u201cgave self-confidence to the Irish that they had lacked.\u201d\u201cThey felt equal to the rest of the world, that they could get a share of the luxuries of life,\u201d he said.Pointing to the church sex abuse scandals, he said, Ireland\u2019s changing fortunes also meant that \u201cinstead of people bowing their heads whenever a priest passed by, they could actually stand up and say, \u2018Hang on, Father, what happened back then?\u2019\u201dLuke Hussey, 25, who comes from a working-class family, said his family had jumped into the middle class almost overnight during the boom, buying a car and going on vacations to Spain.\u201cIt was weird, almost perverse that we were now a middle-class family,\u201d he said.It was during the boom years, in 1993, that Ireland decriminalized homosexuality. Two years later, the country finally voted to allow divorce.The referendum on abortion, many Irish said, was the final crack in the foundation of the old Ireland.The debate in the days and months before the referendum released, for some, decades of pent-up emotions and anger against the church. Mr. Barrett described it as \u201cnational therapy.\u201d The referendum also forced a national debate on subjects that were long taboo, especially around sex.\u201cIreland had a culture of silence and that\u2019s broken now,\u201d Mr. Tyrrell said.\u201cTo be Irish now means to be open,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re sick of being quiet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Deadly Protests, Gazans Ask: What Was Accomplished?", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cost was clear: Over 100 Palestinians killed by Israeli snipers, 60 of them on Monday alone, and over 3,500 wounded since the campaign began on March 30, Gaza medical officials said.Hamas, the Islamic militant group that governs Gaza and organized the protests, did gain a victory in international messaging, with Israel widely condemned for what critics said was disproportionate use of force against mostly unarmed protesters.In Geneva on Friday, the United Nations Human Rights Council voted overwhelmingly to censure Israel and called for an inquiry.But to many Gazans, the tangible benefits of so much bloodshed were hard to discern, with plenty of blame to go around \u2014 including for Hamas.At a market near the main protest camp, Abdul Rahman, 59, a vegetable trader, called the effort a total waste. \u201cZero,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, less than zero.\u201dHe condemned the Israelis, the Arab allies who he said had betrayed the Palestinians, and the leadership of Gaza. \u201cWe didn\u2019t open the fence, and the blockade has not been lifted. There was only killing.\u201dIn his sermon at noon prayers on Friday, Ismail Haniya, the leader of Hamas, put a positive spin on the protests, called \u201cThe Great Return March,\u201d a reference to the goal of Palestinian refugees to return to lands lost to Israel in 1948.\u201cWe are living in the throes of victory and the beginning of the end of the humanitarian tragedy,\u201d he proclaimed.Mr. Haniya hailed Egypt\u2019s rare gesture of good will toward Gaza in opening its border crossing at Rafah, on the southern edge of the territory, for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began a day earlier. The opening would ease the 11-year-old blockade of Gaza, he said, adding that the border protests would continue until the blockade was entirely lifted.But many Gazans, having lost friends or suffered grievous wounds in the protests, feel cheated by Hamas.Eight lean young men, some still wearing bloodstained clothes, dragged away clumps of barbed wire on Thursday that protesters had torn from the fence dividing Gaza from Israel.Selling the wire as scrap for 70 cents a kilo, they could at least salvage something from of the protests.\u201cNothing achieved,\u201d said Mohammed Haider, 23. \u201cPeople are dead. They deceived us that we would breach the fence. But that didn\u2019t happen.\u201dInside Hamas, a very different debate has erupted. The harsh response of Israeli soldiers on Monday has created \u201cstrong pressure\u201d inside the movement for a military response, said Basem Naim, a former minister of health in Gaza who now works with the Hamas international relations office. \u201cPeople say \u2018If we have the capacity to resort to armed resistance, why not do it?\u2019\u201dBut the Hamas leadership was resisting such \u201cemotional\u201d calls, Mr. Haim said, in recognition of the rare public relations coup that their movement, once better known for suicide attacks and rocket strikes, had attained this week.The strains of the blockade on Gaza, which Israel and Egypt imposed, citing security reasons, have been obscured in recent years by other crises in the Middle East. Now Hamas hopes to capitalize on the widespread outrage at images of Gazans being shot by Israeli solders to pressure Israel into making some concessions.The effort seemed to make headway Friday with the vote by the United Nations council.Israel, which considers the council biased, said in a statement by the Foreign Ministry that the council \u201conce again has proved itself to be a body made up of a built-in, anti-Israel majority, guided by hypocrisy and absurdity.\u201dAs the Gaza protests evolved, they had a series of shifting goals in addition to casting Israel in a negative light: breaching the fence to symbolize the return to the lost lands; challenging the blockade to ease economic distress; and, ultimately, expressing Palestinian rejection of moving the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.Israel said the protesters were being used as cover by militants who intended to attack its soldiers and nearby communities.To prove that point, Israeli officials pointed to a statement by a Hamas leader this week that 50 of the 60 protesters killed on Monday were members of the group.Mr. Naim, the Hamas official, said the 50 people described were Hamas supporters as well as militants, and that all were unarmed when killed.The Israeli military said eight armed militants were killed in a shootout with its forces at the fence during Monday\u2019s protest.In any event, the \u201cgreat return\u201d did not occur, given Israel\u2019s determination to prevent any breach of the barrier. By the end of the week, the world\u2019s attention had moved to North Korea, the latest Trump administration scandal and Britain\u2019s royal wedding.And Hamas is no closer to improving the lives of increasingly restless Gazans. The group lacks money to even pay public employees\u2019 salaries or other expenses of governing.Its plight has been deepened by the faltering reconciliation efforts with its archrival, the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority run by President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank.\u201cOverall Hamas is in the same corner it was a month or two ago,\u201d said Nathan Thrall, director of the International Crisis Group\u2019s Israeli-Palestinian project. \u201cIt simply doesn\u2019t have an answer about how to get out of this predicament or even how to capitalize on these protests.\u201dOn Friday, organizers called for people to gather at the protest sites in the late afternoon. Mr. Haniya and other Hamas leaders were there. But others showed up in relatively low numbers, seemingly another measure of the waning popular appetite for the protests, which are planned to go on until the end of Ramadan in early June.With Gaza unemployment at 43 percent and tens of thousands of employee salaries slashed by the Palestinian Authority sanctions, Egypt is encouraging a step-by-step approach to reconciliation that would see the Western-backed authority gradually take over governance of the coastal enclave.The United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay E. Mladenov, said the most urgent need for Gaza was to start development projects that were already approved. That would create jobs, increase access to potable water and electricity and create a more conducive atmosphere for reconciliation.\u201cThe economy has disappeared,\u201d he said. \u201cEffectively, we need to revive life in Gaza.\u201dBut after three international donor meetings in the past three months, and years of stalled projects, Mr. Mladenov said people had a right to be skeptical.At Gaza\u2019s main Shifa hospital, where entire floors were packed with young men recovering from gunshot wounds, many insisted they were happy to have paid such a high price. But other former protesters expressed bitter recrimination, blaming their own leaders as much as Israel.\u201cOur future is lost because of the Jews, and because of Hamas,\u201d said Mahmoud Abu Omar, a 26-year-old with one arm wrapped in bandages.He\u2019d been shot, he said, as he aimed his slingshot across the fence. He had hoped the protests would somehow ease the frustrations of his life \u2014 his impatience to marry, to earn some money, to travel outside Gaza. They did not.Declan Walsh reported from Gaza, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem. Iyad Abuheweila and Ibrahim El-Mughrabi contributed reporting from Gaza.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Patagonia v. Trump", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "The outdoor retailer has supported grass-roots environmental activists for decades. Now it is suing the president in a bid to protect Bears Ears National Monument.Supported byVENTURA, Calif. \u2014 The offices of Patagonia occupy a low-slung complex of stucco buildings in this sleepy beachside town in Southern California. There are solar panels and picnic tables in the parking lot, day care with a jungle gym by the main lobby and easy access to the beach, where employees surf during lunch break. It is a corporate Eden of sorts, where idealistic Californians run a privately held company that sells about $1 billion of puffy down jackets and organic cotton jeans each year.But on an unseasonably hot and windy Monday morning in early December, Patagonia headquarters were transformed into something that quickly resembled a war room. There were emergency conference calls with Washington lawyers. Court filings were prepared. Web designers remade the company\u2019s home page.It wasn\u2019t a business crisis that had mobilized the company, however. It was politics.Mr. Trump said the decision was about reducing federal overreach. \u201cSome people think that the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd guess what. They\u2019re wrong.\u201dYet to the tribal groups and conservationists who had been monitoring the situation, including Patagonia, the decision realized some of their worst fears: that the Trump administration would be waging an assault on public lands, and potentially opening up protected areas to drilling and mining.Patagonia was as ready for this moment as any company could be. For more than 45 years, the company has mixed business and politics to a degree unusual in corporate America. While companies are expected to weigh in on everything from gun control to transgender rights these days \u2014 and many do so uncomfortably \u2014 Patagonia has been unapologetically political since the 1970s.It bills itself \u201cthe Activist Company\u201d and publicly advocates for environmental protection, fair trade and stricter labor standards. It supports thousands of grass-roots environmental activists, and has been involved with Bears Ears since 2012. But until December, Patagonia had never tangled with a president.That Monday morning, about 50 Patagonia employees gathered in a conference room to watch Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. The mood was somber. Then, within an hour of the president\u2019s remarks, Patagonia updated the home page of its website. Instead of promotional images advertising colorful products, there was a stark message against a black background: \u201cThe President Stole Your Land.\u201dAt the same time, Patagonia\u2019s legal team set into motion a plan that had been in the works for months: It would sue the president.Working with a handful of local groups and the law firm Hogan Lovells, Patagonia filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Washington. The lawsuit named as defendants Mr. Trump, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, the secretary of agriculture, the director of the Bureau of Land Management and the chief of the Forest Service. And the argument was simple: The Antiquities Act of 1906 gave presidents the power to create national monuments. But it did not grant the power to reduce them.\u201cFor as much authority as it gave to the president to create these monuments, Congress gave the president no authority to revoke or modify those monuments,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cCongress is the sole authority that can undertake such changes.\u201dThe barbs only stiffened Patagonia\u2019s resolve. The company\u2019s founder went on CNN and called the Trump administration \u201cevil.\u201d And Rose Marcario, Patagonia\u2019s chief executive officer, made the protection of Bears Ears one of her top priorities.\u201cWe\u2019ve always given to grass-roots organizations; it\u2019s part of our D.N.A.,\u201d she said in a recent interview at company headquarters, an American flag flying outside her window. \u201cBut the fight got a lot more urgent after the election. This was totally unheard-of.\u201dIt would have been enough for one day if Patagonia had just been caught up in a public spat with the president. But hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, a more urgent crisis emerged: A brush fire was reported in Santa Paula, Calif., a small community not far from Patagonia\u2019s headquarters.The hot, dry Santa Ana winds blowing that day whipped the fire into an inferno, and much of Ventura was soon evacuated. At the very moment Patagonia was preparing to sue the president, its campus was shut down indefinitely and employees fled their homes.\u201cWe did a lot of scenario planning for the lawsuit,\u201d said Corley Kenna, Patagonia\u2019s head of communications. \u201cWe didn\u2019t put on the list that life-threatening fires would be happening at the same time.\u201dPatagonia was founded by Yvon Chouinard, an enigmatic mountain climber with an interest in Zen Buddhism and a passion for the environment. In 1957, he taught himself to blacksmith, and began making and selling climbing gear that was less damaging to the rocks he and his buddies were scaling in Yosemite National Park.Within a few years, he had set up shop in Ventura and was doing a brisk business selling clothing for outdoor enthusiasts. He eventually called the company Patagonia, a homage to the vast mountainous region at the southern tip of South America, where he had recently traveled.Patagonia developed a cult following and expanded its offerings. But for the most part, the company was a means to an end, a source of funds that enabled Mr. Chouinard and his friends to surf, climb and travel their way around the world.That changed in 1972, when Mr. Chouinard attended a City Council meeting to hear about development plans along the Ventura River. Under a proposal being considered, the flow of the river would have been changed, and a prized surf break could have been ruined.At the meeting, it looked as if the development would proceed. Then a young environmental activist, Mark Capelli, took the floor. He presented a slide show and argued that the proposed changes would harm the birds, water snakes and muskrats in the estuary. The development was halted, the river was protected, and the surf break was preserved.Mr. Chouinard befriended Mr. Capelli and began to support his work, giving free office space to his nascent organization, Friends of the Ventura River, and helping to fend off several more attempts to develop the river.That set the template. Patagonia would offer small grants to local activists, give in-kind support through marketing know-how and business savvy, and amplify their message with customers. Mr. Chouniard also resolved to give one percent of Patagonia\u2019s sales to support environmental activism.\u201cPatagonia has established a unique role in the political and policy ecosystem, and are willing to be very public about their advocacy,\u201d said Neil Kornze, who was a director of the Bureau of Land Management under President Barack Obama and now runs an environmental consulting firm. \u201cThey are a group of avid environmentalists who just happen to sell coats.\u201dBusiness is booming under Ms. Marcario. A former private equity executive who walked away from finance to study Buddhist meditation in India for two years, Ms. Marcario joined Patagonia in 2008 as chief financial officer, drawn to the company\u2019s environmental activism.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m not on Wall Street right now making a ton of money,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of worried about the planet.\u201dShe was named chief executive in 2014, and has overseen Patagonia\u2019s continued expansion. Revenues and profits have quadrupled over the past 10 years, according to the company.And the company maintains a team of 18 people focused on supporting activism and distributing grants. Since 1985, Patagonia has given away some $90 million to environmental causes.\u201cScience without activism is dead science,\u201d Mr. Chouinard said in a recent interview. \u201cWe want to fund the little activist organizations that are out there on the front lines, the grandmothers in front of the bulldozers.\u201dIn 2012, one of the little activist organizations that Patagonia supported for the first time was Friends of Cedar Mesa, a small nonprofit organization advocating for the protection of a wide swath of sensitive desert in southern Utah, including the area that would become Bears Ears.At the time, Republicans in Utah, notably Representative Rob Bishop, were intensifying efforts to reduce federal protections of some lands in the state. Doing so could open the door for more oil and gas drilling and uranium mining, bringing in additional state tax revenue.\u201cPatagonia has been interested in this area for a long time,\u201d Mr. Ewing said. \u201cMore than any company I\u2019ve ever seen, they put their money where their mouth is.\u201dAs Patagonia learned more about Bears Ears, which was a favorite of rock climbers, it came to appreciate the area\u2019s significance. Sacred land to tribal groups and home to Hopi and Navajo ruins and petroglyphs carved into rock walls, it was a largely unspoiled terrain that could be threatened by expanded drilling and mining.\u201cAs we got more involved, we recognized the cultural and spiritual importance of the place,\u201d said Lisa Pike Sheehy, Patagonia\u2019s vice president of environmental activism. \u201cThis was a place that should have been protected 50 years ago.\u201dIn total, Patagonia has spent some $2 million on efforts to protect Bears Ears, including making grants to nonprofit groups, producing films and other marketing materials, and buying television ads. And at least for a brief moment, they worked.\u201cWe never got the chance to celebrate the monument being created,\u201d Mr. Ewing said. \u201cThe writing was on the wall. There wasn\u2019t ever a moment when we thought the monument was safe.\u201dInside Patagonia, Ms. Marcario and her staff knew their resolve would soon be tested. On the morning after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Ms. Marcario sent out an all-staff email. \u201cDefending our air, soil and water has never been more important,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn the last few years, our voice and reach has grown louder and stronger \u2026 we won\u2019t stop.\u201dDuring a monthslong public comment period, the Interior Department received more than two million submissions, the majority of them supporting the continued protection of public lands. Patagonia said its customers had submitted more than 150,000 comments.During the first months of the new administration, Ms. Marcario and another Patagonia employee, Hans Cole, made numerous attempts to meet with Mr. Zinke as part of outdoor industry delegations, according to internal Interior Department emails reviewed by The Times. No meeting with Mr. Zinke ever took place, but Mr. Cole joined two meetings with Interior Department staff.Around this time, Patagonia also began planning for its eventual lawsuit. It enlisted Hogan Lovells, which tracked developments on the issue and organized a weekly conference call for the eventual plaintiffs.The retailers added an economic argument to the campaign to protect Bears Ears: Outdoor recreation contributes more than $12 billion annually to the Utah economy, spending that could be jeopardized if public lands are developed.That evening, Ms. Marcario was driving north along the California coast, returning home from a business trip. As she approached Patagonia\u2019s headquarters, she could see flames encircling Ventura.\u201cI saw the whole ridge line on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized we wouldn\u2019t be able to go back to the office.\u201dPatagonia enacted its emergency plan overnight. Employees were instructed to stay away from campus, and the company offered to pay for accommodations for anyone who had to evacuate.A skeleton crew stayed behind at Patagonia, putting out spot fires as they flared up on campus. The fire spread, surrounding Ventura and consuming hospitals and apartment buildings on the outskirts of town.\u201cThere was ash falling like rain,\u201d Ms. Marcario said. \u201cIt was something I have never seen before.\u201dMr. Zinke hit back. \u201cYou mean Patagonia made in China?\u201d he said on a press call, accusing the company of playing politics in a gambit to sell more clothes. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful and appalling that they would blatantly lie in order to gain money in their coffers.\u201dThen on Fox Business Network, Mr. Zinke took issue with Patagonia\u2019s activism. \u201cThey should focus on how to bring manufacturing back to this country, rather than lying to the public about losing federal land,\u201d he said.As Patagonia and Trump supporters traded barbs, the blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, became the largest wildfire in modern California history. Burning for more than a month, it destroyed more than 1,000 structures and forced the evacuation of some 100,000 people. Downtown Ventura and the Patagonia campus were spared, but five employees lost their homes.With the fire still burning out of control on Dec. 6, Ms. Marcario was working from her home in Montecito, 30 minutes north of headquarters. Friends and employees who had fled were staying with her, though Ms. Marcario would later be forced to evacuate, too.\u201cThen in the middle of what felt like the apocalypse, across my inbox comes an email,\u201d she said. \u201cPatagonia versus Donald Trump, et al.\u201dMs. Marcario placed a call to her executive team and informed it that she had approved the lawsuit. Patagonia was suing the president.Since that week in December, the feud between Patagonia and the Trump administration has continued to simmer.\u201cThe decision was nothing more than a political favor,\u201d Ms. Sheehy, the company\u2019s vice president of environmental activism, wrote in a blog post. \u201cThe redrawing of boundaries was deliberate, and directly influenced by an industry that spends millions of dollars lobbying the government to get what it wants.\u201dThe Trump administration has not formally responded to the lawsuit filed by Patagonia and the other plaintiffs. Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said in an email that claims that the redrawing of boundaries was motivated by oil and gas interests were \u201cpatently and demonstrably false.\u201dMs. Marcario draws a link between the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels and the Thomas Fire, which some climate scientists believe was made worse by climate change.\u201cThese are climate disasters, and they\u2019re going to get worse and worse,\u201d Ms. Marcario said. \u201cWe have an administration that isn\u2019t paying any attention to that.\u201dPatagonia\u2019s lawsuit against Mr. Trump is currently tied up in the courts. It has been consolidated with two other cases filed by separate groups, and the government has asked a judge in Washington to transfer the case to Utah. There is no deadline for that decision, and until then, all proceedings in the case are stayed. Hogan Lovells, which has 25 lawyers working the case on a pro bono basis, has billed $1.7 million in hours to date.In the meantime, the area originally protected by Bears Ears National Monument is available for commercial use, including drilling and mining, though there hasn\u2019t yet been any new development.At Patagonia, Ms. Sheehy said that while the company would see its suit against the president through to the end, it had an expansive time horizon when it came to environmental protection.\u201cThese are all long fights,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in this for 50 years, 100 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Oil Prices Hit $70 a Barrel for First Time Since \u201914", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA cutback in world oil output, engineered by some of the biggest producers, has more than doubled prices from their ebb two years ago. Now, a looming decision by President Trump on the Iran nuclear agreement is pushing them even higher.Benchmark prices for American crude oil closed above $70 a barrel on Monday for the first time since 2014 as traders factored in a prospective United States withdrawal from the accord, which eased international sanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program.Investors fear that a withdrawal would lead to new sanctions on Iran, the world\u2019s fifth-largest producer of crude oil last year, further curtailing a global supply that is already relatively tight.\u201cThe market is watching nervously,\u201d Ann-Louise Hittle, an oil analyst at the market research firm Wood Mackenzie, said of the deadline.Analysts estimate that reimposing sanctions on Iran could reduce the country\u2019s daily oil sales by 300,000 to 600,000 barrels, or perhaps as much as one million barrels. But imposing new sanctions would most likely take time. And if prices stay high, Iran could increase its earnings from oil sales in the short run.\u201cOur base case is the rollout of sanctions will be quite slow and messy,\u201d said Ben Cahill, an analyst at the market research firm Energy Intelligence.\u201cIn the very short term,\u201d he added, \u201cthe price run-up could benefit\u201d Iran.OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, has a spotty track record of carrying out production cuts, but compliance has been strong this time. \u201cI think we are where we are because OPEC got their groove back,\u201d said Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.The flow of oil to the global market has been further constricted in recent years as a result of the political and economic crisis plaguing Venezuela, another major producer of crude.The reduced global supply \u2014 combined with the solid global economy \u2014 has helped push oil prices higher since they fell below $30 a barrel in early 2016. The rising tide has lifted the price of the international benchmark, Brent crude, above $75.\u201cIt is mostly a fundamentals-driven market, but the icing on the cake is the worry about Iran,\u201d said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consulting firm.A boom in production in the United States has helped offset some of the tightening in supply in recent months. But higher prices elsewhere have prompted American producers to sell on the global market, driving oil exports to record highs and pulling domestic oil prices higher.That has benefited energy companies, as well as and oil-producing states like Texas. Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell recently reported quarterly profits comparable to what they generated four years ago, when prices topped $100 a barrel.But for large swaths of corporate America, the higher prices mean a hit to profits. Airline stocks fell by more than 1 percent Monday as investors took fuel-price pressures into account.Likewise, consumer incomes will be pinched by elevated gasoline prices. The national average price for unleaded regular has risen above $2.80 in recent days, according to AAA, and is up roughly 20 percent over the last 12 months. That far outstrips the 2.6 percent year-over-year growth in average hourly earnings through April.As a larger chunk of workers\u2019 paychecks goes to fuel, less disposable income is left to be spent elsewhere, a potential problem for an economy heavily reliant on consumer spending. Consumer spending slowed sharply in the first quarter, when it inched up at a 1.1 percent annual clip.Much of that had to do with a slowdown in auto sales after a surge in car-buying late last year to replace vehicles damaged by Hurricane Harvey.Higher fuel prices could also weigh on auto sales. Low gasoline prices have shifted car purchases heavily toward pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles, which tend to be less fuel-efficient than passenger vehicles.\u201cI think you have to get $4 to $5 per gallon before you start having a psychological impact,\u201d said Joseph Amaturo, who covers the automotive industry for Buckingham Research.Oil companies responded to the price crash that began in 2014 by cutting exploration and other spending and negotiating sharply lower rates from drillers and other contractors, who do much of the work in the oil industry.As a result, oil and gas projects that are going forward tend to have sharply lower costs than those begun in the $100-a-barrel era. Jessica Uhl, Shell\u2019s chief financial officer, said recently that a United States oil field in the Gulf of Mexico that Shell was developing would break even at less than $35 a barrel thanks to a 70 percent reduction in its original projected capital costs. \u201cBy applying industry-standard designs, we simplified the scope,\u201d she said.Lower costs, combined with higher oil prices, are likely to raise profits as long as these conditions hold. Of course, cost inflation may return to the industry, and the cash rolling in may eventually loosen spending discipline, as it did a few years ago.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of an oil analyst for Wood Mackenzie.

{"Headline": "A Courageous Trump Call on a Lousy Iran Deal", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistOf all the arguments for the Trump administration to honor the nuclear deal with Iran, none was more risible than the claim that we gave our word as a country to keep it.\u201cOur\u201d?Build on political sand; get washed away by the next electoral wave. Such was the fate of the ill-judged and ill-founded J.C.P.O.A., which Donald Trump killed on Tuesday by refusing to again waive sanctions on the Islamic Republic. He was absolutely right to do so \u2014 assuming, that is, serious thought has been given to what comes next.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]But the problem with this approach is that it only treats symptoms of a failure for which the J.C.P.O.A. is itself a major cause. The deal weakened U.N. prohibitions on Iran\u2019s testing of ballistic missiles, which cannot be reversed without Russian and Chinese consent. That won\u2019t happen.The easing of sanctions also gave Tehran additional financial means with which to fund its depredations in Syria and its militant proxies in Yemen, Lebanon and elsewhere. Any effort to counter Iran on the ground in these places would mean fighting the very forces we are effectively feeding. Why not just stop the feeding?Apologists also claim that, with Trump\u2019s decision, Tehran will simply restart its enrichment activities on an industrial scale. Maybe it will, forcing a crisis that could end with U.S. or Israeli strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites. But that would be stupid, something the regime emphatically isn\u2019t. More likely, it will take symbolic steps to restart enrichment, thereby implying a threat without making good on it. What the regime wants is a renegotiation, not a reckoning.All this means the administration is in a strong position to negotiate a viable deal. But it missed an opportunity last month when it failed to deliver a crippling blow to Bashar al-Assad, Iran\u2019s puppet in Syria, for his use of chemical weapons. Trump\u2019s appeals in his speech to the Iranian people also sounded hollow from a president who isn\u2019t exactly a tribune of liberalism and has disdained human rights as a tool of U.S. diplomacy. And the U.S. will need to mend fences with its European partners to pursue a coordinated diplomatic approach.The goal is to put Iran\u2019s rulers to a fundamental choice. They can opt to have a functioning economy, free of sanctions and open to investment, at the price of permanently, verifiably and irreversibly forgoing a nuclear option and abandoning their support for terrorists. Or they can pursue their nuclear ambitions at the cost of economic ruin and possible war. But they are no longer entitled to Barack Obama\u2019s sweetheart deal of getting sanctions lifted first, retaining their nuclear options for later, and sponsoring terrorism throughout.Trump\u2019s courageous decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal will clarify the stakes for Tehran. Now we\u2019ll see whether the administration is capable of following through.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disarray Plagues U.S. Companies\u2019 Efforts to Win Tariff Exemptions", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For several weeks this spring, a handful of employees at a Texas steel manufacturer stopped producing pipes used to drill thousands of feet below the earth\u2019s surface to concentrate full time on another task: trying to win the company an exemption from President Trump\u2019s metals tariffs.Borusan Mannesmann Pipe U.S. filed 19 separate requests with the Commerce Department asking it to exempt the multiple shapes, sizes and forms of steel pipes that it imports from its parent company in Turkey and then finishes at a plant in Baytown, Tex. Until it gets an answer, the 60-year-old business is paying significantly higher prices for imports of the raw material and is putting off any major projects.In the two months since the Trump administration\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs went into effect, the Commerce Department has been deluged with more than 8,200 exemption requests from companies that import foreign metals. With just a handful of countries temporarily exempted from Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, companies are scrambling to win exemptions for every screw and spring they import, with each width and length requiring stand-alone filings. One company alone has submitted 1,167 of the filings, according to government officials.The imposition of tariffs was supposed to help protect American companies from foreign competition. But they have also created a chaotic, time-consuming process and provoked deep uncertainty among executives, who are delaying investment, expansion and hiring as a result.The disarray stems from the sheer vastness of the administration\u2019s attempt to reshape the rules of global trade in a matter of months, as it threatens a trade war with China and races to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement.This week, the administration will hold three days of public hearings on its plan to impose tariffs on roughly $50 billion in Chinese goods and may also welcome top Chinese leaders to continue trade talks. And it faces a looming deadline to wrap up the Nafta talks in time for the deal to be approved by the current Republican-controlled Congress.Those affected by the steel and aluminum tariffs say the administration\u2019s aggressive approach could backfire on American companies and workers.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict what could happen to us and these families if the exemption process doesn\u2019t go in our favor,\u201d said Joel Johnson, the chief executive of Borusan Mannesmann\u2019s United States operations, which employ 264 people. \u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but for sure we won\u2019t be hiring more people. We might have to reduce our existing base because we won\u2019t have that material coming in.\u201dThe Commerce Department has yet to grant any company an official exemption. A department official said that the agency was making \u201can unprecedented effort to process the requests expeditiously\u201d and that companies with a valid need for foreign products should rest assured that their needs will be met.To deal with the flood of applications, the department has added about a dozen workers dedicated to processing the applications, bringing the total number to 19. So far, the department says it has reviewed most of the filings, but only 1,700 had been posted online as of May 8 \u2014 and that is just an early step in a lengthy process. Domestic steel and aluminum companies have 30 days to file an objection to any application. Government officials then have 60 days to make a final decision.\u201cWe knew that the process was going to be messy,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIt just prolongs this pain of not knowing what is going to happen.\u201dMr. Johnson said the potential for permanent tariffs on the raw materials his company imports from Turkey had \u201cput our customers into full panic mode. They need our product to extract oil and gas.\u201dWithout a supply of unfinished steel from its parent company, the United States plant, which uses a special heating process to ensure that the finished pipe is strong and resilient, may not make sense to continue operating. American competitors may be reluctant to supply the company with unfinished products that will ultimately end up competing with their finished pipes. Mr. Johnson says its American operations may face a $25 million to $30 million hit annually to bring in the materials it needs.Its vendors are already worried. Automation Engineering Company, a South Carolina company that provides equipment to Borusan to move pipes within its factory, sent a letter to the Commerce Department on Tuesday saying that Borusan\u2019s business helped support 75 jobs in its own factory.Borusan Mannesmann has filed for a two-year exemption for products from its parent company in Turkey, arguing that imports are what allows its American factory to thrive. If it wins an exemption, Mr. Johnson said, the firm will invest $50 million to $75 million to build another factory in Baytown, which would employ upward of 170 people.The tariffs\u2019 most ardent proponents, including some domestic steel and aluminum makers, have argued against granting many exemptions, saying they will create loopholes that ultimately make the measures less effective at defending American industry. The administration, in imposing the tariffs, said national security was at risk from foreign metals that were weakening American manufacturers.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has said the department will grant exclusions that \u201cfurther hone these tariffs\u201d to protect national security while also minimizing the impact on American industries.Companies have been appealing to the Commerce Department with a variety of arguments, including that they depend on some foreign goods but ultimately strengthen the American economy.Union Pacific, the railroad giant, filed an exemption for a specialized longer steel rail from Japan that it says is not available in the United States. While the company buys some American-made rail, the longer Japanese rail is safer because it requires less welding and reduces the potential for derailments on its highly trafficked routes, the company says.Even if the Commerce Department is sympathetic to those arguments, other American companies have a chance to scuttle any exemption. Under the process, domestic manufacturers can make filings saying they can or would be able to make an imported product, potentially giving them an influential voice over competitors seeking exemptions.In April, Orrin G. Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Ron Wyden, the Democratic ranking member, sent a letter to Mr. Ross urging him to improve the process, saying it has lacked \u201cbasic due process and procedural fairness for stakeholders, especially American small businesses.\u201d They also expressed concern about whether the Commerce Department was taking steps to prevent the program \u201cfrom being abused for anticompetitive purposes.\u201dBecause steel and aluminum are used in so many products, the effects will be felt not just among direct importers, but their customers as well, said Teresa Fort, an economist at Dartmouth College\u2019s Tuck School of Business. \u201cIt will go down through the chain,\u201d she said.The Federal Reserve\u2019s April \u201cBeige Book\u201d included a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis about a manufacturer of tractor-trailers that said it could not increase prices fast enough to keep up with its rising material costs. And the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reported that a local toy manufacturer said that tariffs had raised threefold the price of a type of thin-gauge foil produced only in China. \u201cThese tariffs are now killing high-paying American manufacturing jobs and businesses,\u201d the company said.Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But 120 sitting lawmakers from the two parties lost in the recent parliamentary primaries.Breaking with his former boss\u2019s tradition, Mr. Mnangagwa said he had invited international and regional election observers, including from the European Union and the Commonwealth and representatives from countries that Mr. Mugabe deemed enemies of his government.But Obert Gutu, deputy president of a splinter faction of the Movement for Democratic Change, said he worried about the fairness of the vote. \u201cThe electoral playing field is far from being even for all political contestants, particularly the opposition parties,\u201d he said.The July vote has the potential to help transform Zimbabwe\u2019s economy, said Tawanda Majoni, the national coordinator at the Information for Development Trust, a media advocacy group \u2014 provided that the result is not contested.\u201cIf the ruling post-Mugabe establishment wins to form a government on its own, the results may be contested, meaning that the resulting government may lack legitimacy among key international powers and aid providers,\u201d Mr. Majoni said.\u201cIf the opposition wins and the current government, in which the military has a high stake, accepts the outcome,\u201d he added, \u201cthis may also encourage international investors, development agencies and embassies to render substantial economic, social and political support to the new government.\u201dPrevious disputed elections have hurt the country\u2019s economy. Elections that Mr. Mugabe was accused of winning through unorthodox means drew the ire of Western countries, including the United States, which imposed economic sanctions on Zimbabwe.The subsequent runoff vote resulted in a unity government that held power until the 2013 elections.Zimbabweans living abroad will not be able to vote in the July elections, according to a Constitutional Court ruling that was also issued on Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Industrial Revolutions Are Political Wrecking Balls", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before.Compared with previous industrial revolutions, Schwab continued,the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.First Schwab looked at the bright side:The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.Schwab then turned his attention to the downside. Many \u201cworkers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate,\u201d he said, and the \u201cmiddle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.\u201dIn this modern migration, smartphone maps, global positioning apps, social media and WhatsApp have become essential tools. Migrants depend on them to post real-time updates about routes, arrests, border guard movements and transport, as well as places to stay and prices, all the while keeping in touch with family and friends.Long before this, Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, described the link between immigration and technology in a 2003 paper, \u201cPatterns and Processes of International Migration in the 21st Century\u201d:The same processes of economic globalization that create mobile populations in developing regions, and which generate a demand for their services in global cities, also create links of transportation, communication, as well as politics and culture, to make the international movement of people cheaper, quicker, and easier.There are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses. In politics, however, the emphasis has often been on the negative.With remarkable understatement, Schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences:As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor.The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second. The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations \u2014 a factor of about 200,000 difference \u2014 and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second.In point of fact, the use of robots \u2014 and of other methods of replacing workers with machines \u2014 has been growing in every advanced economy, particularly in Europe.The authors note that \u201cboth technology and trade seem to drive structural changes which are consequential for voting behavior.\u201d\u201cJob losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., said by email:In fact, some of the places where Trump made the biggest gains relative to McCain or Romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs.Hostile voter reaction to automation, according to three scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University \u2014 Carl Benedikt Frey, Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen \u2014 was crucial to Trump\u2019s victory.Support for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. Other things equal, a counterfactual analysis shows that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the Hillary Clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College.Along similar lines, Frank Levy, also an economist at M.I.T., wrote in a December 2017 paper:AI (artificial intelligence) is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical (\u2018mid-skilled\u2019) jobs into lower wage work. The result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off-shored services.On balance, near-term AI will have the greatest effect on blue collar work, clerical work and other mid-skilled occupations. Given globalization\u2019s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term AI and globalization replace many of the same jobs.Take the case of truck drivers. Driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines, and, according to Levy, \u201cthere should be a sizable number of fully automated U.S. port facilities, mines and other industrial facilities\u201d by 2024. With these developments, he estimated, there will be 76,000 fewer truck driving jobs in 2024 than the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently projects.Assessing the full range of employment, West observes thatRobots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drones and the Internet of Things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods. For millions who work in occupations like food service, retail sales and truck driving, machines are replacing their jobs.Levy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace,the stock of robots in the U.S. would be 105,000 higher in 2024 than in 2014. If I conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators, the 105,000 additional robots would result in 210,000 fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in 2024 than otherwise would have been the case.Where do these displaced workers look for a way to make a living? Levy\u2019s answer is: farther down the ladder:AI\u2019s near-term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in a slowly growing number of persons moving from mid-skilled jobs into lower wage workinto such fields as food preparation and serving, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services.For many men, moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to a job in a fast-food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow. (Not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women\u2019s and reproductive rights movements.)Levy points out that the cuts resulting from A.I. and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term, but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers:Job losses will appear as accelerating trends. Over time, trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories. Increased numbers of people will be working side-by-side with robots. When a media story describes an AI-induced layoff in occupation, other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk. These developments will occur against a backdrop of monopoly-like firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook.What is the political significance of the A.I.-driven changes in the work force? They are the grist for the populist mill.Levy writes:A populist politician who campaigned on AI-induced job loss would start with ready-made definitions of the \"people\u201d and the \u201celite\u201d based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the 2016 presidential election. This politician also would have a ready-made example of disrespect: the set of highly educated coastal \u201celites\u201d who make a very good living developing robots to put \u201cthe people\u201d out of work.IT-driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising. Because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth, IT advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial.The favorable view, according to Kurz, masks thedark side: by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power, IT innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth.While operating legally \u2014 indeed with the full support of the legal system \u2014 contemporary corporate technology leaders, including Brin, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs (who died in 2011) and Mark Zuckerberg, accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth. According to Kurz:Once an IT monopoly is established, it endows the company with the advantage of first mover. A combination of associated factors \u2014 additional patents, intellectual-property rights, trade secrets, falling computing and storage costs, and decreasing network user costs \u2014 then enable the company to consolidate market power, raise barriers to competition, and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power. IT networks endow a market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly. Using their market power, such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position, often by purchasing competing firms.According to Kurz, the concentration of economic power, and with it political power, in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences:Monopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades, from near zero in the early 1980s to $2.1 trillion \u2014 equivalent to 23 percent of total US corporate income \u2014 in 2015. During the same period, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by 23 percentage points.The result is a cascading effect causedboth by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor. It has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers, workers, and suppliers. And it has had a profoundly negative impact on lower-skill workers, in particular.The history of automation \u2014 and how the U.S. economy has handled it over the last several decades \u2014 suggests that even if AI is similar to previous waves of automation, that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation.Furman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs:The concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable. The traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience.Instead, Furman contends that the problem lies in \u201cthe process of turnover,\u201d which \u201ccould lead to sustained periods of time with a large fraction of people not working.\u201d In the short run,not all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by AI. Moreover, this \u201cshort run\u201d could last for decades and, in fact, the economy could be in a series of \u201cshort runs\u201d for even longer.A short run that lasts for decades \u2014 or a series of short runs that last even longer \u2014 would seem to warrant grave alarm.Of all the jobs in the UK, a greater proportion of those held by women compared to men are likely to be technically automatable, and women make up a smaller proportion of people in high-skill occupations that are resilient to automation or complemented by technology.Among liberal-leaning economists and public policy experts, there is a loose consensus on what should be done to manage the adverse consequences of both automation and trade.Furman lists some initiatives:expanding education and training so more people have skills that complement and benefit from innovations, increasing the progressivity of the tax system to make sure that everyone shares in the overall benefits of the economy, and expanding institutional support for higher wages, including a higher minimum wage and stronger collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice.Other related proposals include a major increase in the earned-income tax credit, a focus on job-specific training at community colleges, portable pensions, liberalization of occupational licensing and, more controversially, the creation of a universal basic income.These proposals \u2014 some underwhelming or undoable \u2014 find strong support among Democratic elected officials.Still, opposition from Republicans is adamant \u2014 not only do they oppose increased domestic spending, but it appears to be in the political interests of the party to exacerbate the negative consequences of automation and free trade.David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., examined the political consequences in congressional districts hurt by increased trade with China and found a significant increase in the election of very conservative Republicans.Using the same techniques to examine the 2016 election, Autor calculated that if the post-2000 increase in China trade had been half as large as it in fact was, Hillary Clinton would have won majorities in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That would have been enough to make her the victor in the Electoral College, as the accompanying graphic shows. There is also a dose effect.Rather than directly opposing free trade policies, individuals in import-exposed communities tend to target scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities. This drives support for right-wing candidates, as they compete electorally by targeting out-groups.The authors conclude that in areas affected by trade, the scapegoating of immigrants \u201ctakes place across the board and is not limited to manufacturing workers.\u201dIn other words, job losses and plant closings are a political gold mine for the Republican Party, crucial to their victories in House and presidential races and almost certainly in Senate, gubernatorial and state legislative races as well.The determination of the Trump wing of the Republican Party to profiteer on technologically driven economic and cultural upheaval \u2014 and the success of this strategy to date \u2014 suggests that the party will continue on its path. For this reason and many others, it is critically important that Democrats develop a more far-reaching understanding of the disruptive, technologically fueled economic and cultural forces that are now shaping American politics \u2014 if they intend to steer the country in a more constructive direction, that is.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Drives Up Rent Costs in Manhattan and Brooklyn, Report Says", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAirbnb\u2019s growing influence caused rents to increase significantly in tourist areas and gentrifying neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn, where the majority of the company\u2019s rentals are concentrated, according to a report released on Thursday by the city comptroller\u2019s office.In Manhattan\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Chelsea neighborhoods and the Midtown Business District, which accounted for about 11 percent of all Airbnb listings in New York City in 2016, average monthly rents increased by $398 between 2009 and 2016, of which $86, or 21.6 percent, was a result of Airbnb\u2019s presence, the report said. In Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, the study said, rents went up 18.6 percent in those years because of Airbnb listings.Airbnb makes it easy to rent apartments to tourists, taking units off the market for full-time residents, the report said.\u201cFor years, New Yorkers have felt the burden of rents that go nowhere but up, and Airbnb is one reason why,\u201d the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just simply supply and demand. Fewer apartments to rent means higher prices, and that\u2019s the Airbnb effect.\u201dAirbnb has more than 50,000 apartment listings in New York City, the company\u2019s largest market in the United States. The comptroller\u2019s report shed light on the clash of the so-called sharing economy with city neighborhoods struggling to preserve their stock of affordable housing and rein in skyrocketing rents, though the report also found that the online rental site had a negligible effect on most neighborhoods outside of Manhattan and Brooklyn, where listings are sparse.The study drew on data scraped from Airbnb listings and used regression analysis to compare what rents would have been across 55 neighborhoods if thousands of units had not been listed on the home-sharing website. Still, the report has limitations: An apartment listed on Airbnb does not always translate into a unit lost in the long-term rental market, because apartments may be rented for a short amount of time a year.Airbnb officials said the report confused causation with correlation by blaming the company for higher rents that could have been raised by other factors, like rezoning. However, the comptroller\u2019s study included variables like household income, population, and employment rates.\u201cComptroller Stringer\u2019s report severely misrepresents the impact of our platform on housing and is full of elementary methodological mistakes,\u201d said Andrew Kalloch, a policy manager at Airbnb. \u201cNew Yorkers deserve better from their chief financial officer.\u201dMr. Stringer said in response, \u201cThe methodology is sound.\u201dMr. Kalloch said Airbnb\u2019s effect on rents was insignificant because listings represent less than 1 percent of apartments in the city. But he acknowledged that some neighborhoods have a significantly higher share of Airbnb rentals. He also said that using 2009 as a starting point distorts the findings because rents in New York tanked during the Great Recession that year.Most New Yorkers, Mr. Kalloch said, use Airbnb as a source of extra income to make ends meet and that entire apartments are rented for a median of 60 nights a year. But Airbnb has long been scrutinized by officials because some landlords use Airbnb to effectively run illegal hotels in residential buildings.And some New York tenants use the platform to rent spare bedrooms to travelers year-round, often in violation of housing rules or without the permission of their landlords.One Airbnb host in Chelsea, a 45-year-old singer and songwriter from California, has rented a room in a two-bedroom apartment for more than three years to tourists who stay an average of four to five nights. The singer spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of being evicted.The singer charges $40 to $110 per night during the summer, which helps cover the $3,050 monthly rent.\u201cIt\u2019s a great way to make money,\u201d the singer said. \u201cI get to keep my apartment clean for guests and meet new people in a world where everyone is disconnected.\u201d\u201cIt really isn\u2019t a good idea to turn our residential housing into illegal hotels so that a $30 billion company can get their I.P.O.,\u201d said Tom Cayler, a member of the West Side Neighborhood Alliance, a coalition of tenants who advocate for the preservation of affordable housing.As in other areas around the world, Airbnb has had a contentious history in New York.The attorney general\u2019s report said Airbnb was dominated by operators with multiple listings, finding that 6 percent of the hosts made 37 percent of the revenue \u2014 or $168 million. The company said it had already expelled thousands of commercial operators from its platform.Despite the ongoing feud with New York officials, Mr. Kalloch said his company welcomed certain regulations to rid its platform of abusers.\u201cAlong with proactively removing bad actors from our platform,\u201d he said, \u201cAirbnb is supporting legislation in Albany that would provide for rigorous enforcement against illegal hotel operators, among other things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Post Malone and Rae Sremmurd, Hip-Hop Impressionists Shaping the Stream", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookRemember the album? There once was a time when it had reliable structure and meaning: a collection of songs with a narrative arc, or a set of tracks that showed an artist attempting a range of themes and styles. A summation statement. The endpoint of a sometimes arduous climb toward self-realization.That was before streaming, though, back when the album was the dominant consumption unit, with players \u2014 turntable, Walkman, Discman and so on \u2014 to match. The album\u2019s primacy was in trouble as soon as iTunes and the iPod encouraged shuffling. In the current music economy, in which Spotify, Apple Music and other streaming ecosystems set the terms, it has become, as a structural concept, largely meaningless.In hip-hop, especially, an album is now a data set \u2014 bytes first, music second. Not a complete, stand-alone journey with beginning and end, but a sort of formless middle, designed to lull listeners into slumber and trap them there, in hopes that they might never press stop.\u201cStoney,\u201d his 2016 debut album, was successful, but almost too distinct. Post Malone operates at the intersection of hip-hop, rock, soul, even a little country \u2014 on \u201cStoney,\u201d he was making a bid for musical seriousness.\u201cBeerbongs & Bentleys\u201d skips that altogether. It is a submerged \u2014 and submersive \u2014 listening experience. Strong, but rarely in a thrilling way. As a vocalist, Post Malone excels in syllables with blurry edges and tightly controlled melodies that lull. Just as one syllable decays, the next begins. He is perpetually narcotized, endlessly plaintive, borderline disoriented.This melancholia is the new dream-pop, and Post Malone has found like-minded musical collaborators \u2014 Louis Bell foremost among them, and also Frank Dukes, who offers a more nuanced take on the sound \u2014 partial to gloomy tempos and synths that seep into every available corner of a track. At times, the thickness of the production approximates the tricks of new age music, sounds that encourage a kind of hypnosis.There are occasional intrusions of other ideas, like the agonized rock on \u201cOver Now,\u201d and when far more formalist artists like Nicki Minaj or G-Eazy arrive, they sound like teachers trying to enforce order in detention. But in total, \u201cBeerbongs & Bentleys\u201d is admirably committed to form, one long song of the decontextualized now.Hip-hop has been moving in this direction for the last few years, from Future\u2019s purple opiate haze to Travis Scott\u2019s head-in-the clouds bleats \u2014 styles that lend themselves easily to ambient bliss. They\u2019re ideal for streaming services, and the playlists that anchor them, which depend on consumption that doesn\u2019t rely on a beginning or an end. That is part of the reason there has been a slow creep in certain corners of hip-hop toward longer albums. And it is at least part of the reason \u201cSr3mm\u201d arrives as it does \u2014 as a set of three albums, one for the duo and one for each of its members, Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmi. (It is, however, shorter than the ne plus ultra of peak-CD-era bloat, Eightball\u2019s three-disc \u201cLost.\u201d)Like Post Malone, Rae Sremmurd deploys a set of hypnotic strategies \u2014 stacked vocals for thickness, arrangements that drag at the edges. On \u201cPerplexing Pegasus,\u201d even alliteration is retrofitted into lullaby. Unlike the tragic-catatonic Post Malone, Rae Sremmurd\u2019s Swae Lee can be a disarmingly sweet singer. His voice is chirpy-thin, making his stories of debauched after-hours excess sound like child\u2019s play.Unsurprisingly, his solo album here, called \u201cSwaecation,\u201d is the most liquid, the most soft-focus of the three. (The duo album is a close second.) At times it verges on the quiet-storm R&B of the early 1980s, though he is far more flexible with tempos than Post Malone, and sometimes veers toward ecstatic 1980s synth-pop. By contrast, Slim Jxmmi\u2019s solo album, \u201cJxmtro,\u201d is a more conventional contemporary hip-hop album, buoyant and loose.\u201cSr3mm\u201d is long, but listening to it in one sitting, on its own, from top to bottom, is not how it\u2019s truly designed to be engaged with. It will be carved up and parceled out, used as chum for various playlists. (With its breadth and length, it is itself a kind of playlist already.) This parallels what has been happening with Atlanta rap over the past couple of years. Thanks to a plenitude of releases and frequent cross-hybrid collaborations, it has become increasingly decentered, an album from Migos or Lil Yachty or Young Thug no more of an anchor than a Quality Control compilation or Spotify\u2019s Rap Caviar playlist.In spirit, this owes a lot to Gucci Mane or Future\u2019s mixtape saturation of years ago, but the current sound and approach are less reliant on an individual cult of personality than a scene-wide adherence to a post-trap production sound and a handful of ideas about flow patterns.In this world, album releases are just pretenses \u2014 or more to the point, album releases are what\u2019s required for the fulfillment of record company obligations. But as they lose their centrality, so do the artists themselves, who now exist in service of a greater vibe.There are rewards for this, of course \u2014 the Billboard chart has rightly evolved to better reflect how crucial streaming has become as a delivery mechanism. But success on the Billboard album chart has become less an indicator of album sales than of how effectively data travels \u2014 do the songs bleed into each other, obscuring obvious pause points? Are the songs easily ingestible into the sorts of playlists that are central to the dominance of streaming services?Disruption is no longer prized, which is to say, personality isn\u2019t much prized either. What that makes for is not a generation of stars you\u2019ll always remember, but a moment that will last until it evaporates, maybe taking everyone with it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Go All-Out to Avoid Disaster in California House Races", "Date": "2018-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIRVINE, Calif. \u2014 National Democrats, confronting mushrooming political chaos across Southern California, are pouring millions of dollars into congressional races to avert a self-inflicted disaster that could undermine their chances at taking control of the House.After months of optimism that the state\u2019s June 5 primary would position them to pick off seven Republican-held districts in November \u2014 a substantial down payment on reclaiming the House \u2014 Democrats are now trying to ensure that they do not hurt themselves because of their unusually crowded slates of candidates.With so many Democrats running, the party\u2019s fear is that the vote will be splintered, allowing Republicans \u2014 who have fewer candidates \u2014 to dominate some primaries. The party and allied groups are spending more than $4 million on just three campaigns, intervening in one contest to prop up a favored candidate; attacking a Republican from the right in another; and even reminding people not to waste their votes on \u201cghost candidates\u201d who have dropped out yet remain on the ballot.As any progressive activist will explain through gnashed teeth, the head-snapping scramble is because of the state\u2019s \u201ctop two\u201d open primary system, which allows the two leading vote-getters \u2014 regardless of political parties \u2014 to advance to the general election.The \u201ctop two\u201d system was meant to create incentives for political moderation in a state where about a quarter of the voters are independents, but it has created immense stakes for Democrats: They need to win 23 seats to take back the House, and party officials believe the path runs through the seven competitive California districts, all of which Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Gail Reisman, a retired gerontologist and Toronto native who lives in Representative Dana Rohrabacher\u2019s district, said after attending a candidate forum Tuesday. \u201cIf we have two Republicans running I think I\u2019m going back to Canada.\u201dAfter three of the Democrats opposing Mr. Rohrabacher had taken a turn speaking at the forum, held at a synagogue, the moderator briefly came back on stage to alert the audience that the parking lot was so crowded the police intended to ticket those cars parked more creatively than legally.The overflow of Priuses and Mercedes was a particularly vivid reminder of the California candidate logjam. Confusion and frustration among Democrats here only seems to grow by the day, as the state and national party back different contenders and spending sprays forth like an out-of-control garden hose. Some voters are not sure whom to back to feel confident that a Democrat will advance past June 5, and they increasingly worry that Republicans will foil the party\u2019s chances to stop President Trump\u2019s agenda in the House next year.The painful twist is that what seemed like the Democrats\u2019 most valuable asset in the midterm campaign \u2014 the wave of liberal activism unleashed by President Trump \u2014 has metastasized into a mortal threat because of the glut of candidates.Nowhere is the danger more acute than in a pair of contiguous districts that stretch from Orange County\u2019s Seal Beach down the Pacific coastline to the cliffs of La Jolla.It is here where national Democrats, deeply concerned their voters are scattered among little-known House candidates, are staging a rescue mission to ensure they are not locked out this fall in Mr. Rohrabacher\u2019s district and the one farther south held by Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican who is retiring.Opposition research and hard-edge direct mail pieces are flying between candidates, too, some of them tinged with accusations of #MeToo impropriety. But surveys show many of the candidates bunched together in the teens and few operatives have a firm grasp for what will unfold.Actual policy issues are largely secondary: The differences between the Democratic hopefuls are a matter of degree, with all of them vowing a progressive agenda on health care, the environment and gun control while taking aim at Mr. Trump. The Republicans are focused on gains in the economy, a gas tax repeal measure and warning the largely moderate and center-right voters in the districts that Democrats are turning sharply to the left.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party\u2019s arm in House races, is most concerned that two Republicans might prevail in the primary for Mr. Rohrabacher\u2019s seat. The committee has broken with the state Democratic Party to endorse a candidate, Harley Rouda.Meanwhile, the main House Democratic \u201csuper PAC\u201d is pouring over $600,000 into commercials in the Los Angeles market, which reaches 27 congressional districts, to try to drive down Republican candidate Scott Baugh\u2019s share of the vote against Mr. Rohrabacher, in hopes that a Democrat can finish in the top two and face the incumbent in November.And the national campaign committee is supplementing the air attacks with a ground game that includes alerting voters about five \u201cghost candidates\u201d who remain on the 16-person ballot.The national party\u2019s involvement has angered Hans Keirstead, a stem-cell scientist who has the support of the California Democratic Party and is now scorning the national campaign committee after a mutual flirtation for much of the last year.An official with the national campaign committee said they did urge Mr. Keirstead to offer evidence refuting the charges, but they did not demand the students appear on camera.Mr. Keirstead, citing favorable polling figures, said he was not dropping out. But the candidate logjam is exasperating area activists who have been organizing for a year and a half against Mr. Rohrabacher, a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump.\u201cI get anxious just thinking about it,\u201d said Tara Steele, a marketing executive active in the Newport Beach Democratic Women\u2019s Club. \u201cIf the disorganization of the Democratic Party is the reason he gets re-elected, it will be incredibly disheartening.\u201d\u201cIt feels like they got a million dollars\u2019 worth of concern and they\u2019re dropping it right on top of my head,\u201d he said.In Mr. Issa\u2019s district, the airwaves are so saturated that when officials for one statewide campaign inquired about buying more commercials this week in San Diego, they were told there was no advertising time left.But to the frustration of some of the Democratic candidates, the national campaign committee has not taken sides in Mr. Issa\u2019s district.\u201cI\u2019m pissed off that they gave Harley that and they aren\u2019t giving me that,\u201d said Doug Applegate, who is running again after nearly defeating Mr. Issa in 2016, referring to a spending push House Democrats are doing jointly with Mr. Rouda.Mr. Applegate, a retired Marine officer, notes that his former wife has denied he ever abused her and he has a ready response: \u201cBelieve the woman.\u201dHe ventured on more dangerous ground, though, when he was asked in an interview about one of his top Democratic rivals, 29-year-old Sara Jacobs.\u201cI think she\u2019s extremely bright, she\u2019s going to be real capable,\u201d he said, before invoking his time in the Marines. \u201cI like 20-year-olds. I put my life in the hands of 20-year-olds. But they were more experienced, knew their area of position better and were probably more competent with their weapon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s much easier for people to believe that it\u2019s some man, my grandfather, behind the scenes pulling strings than me because of my gender,\u201d she said.Ms. Jacobs\u2019s California-based pollster, Amy Levin, urged Democrats to rally behind the only woman their party is fielding in Mr. Issa\u2019s district.\u201cOur polls and others show that Democrats need to man up and get behind the woman so we don\u2019t lose this seat in June,\u201d Ms. Levin said.\u201cWinning back the House without California is not impossible but will be very, very difficult,\u201d said Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat who represents the Palm Springs area.Many California Republicans also believe the open primary law, which was adopted in a 2010 referendum, has proved to be a political science experiment gone terribly awry.\u201cI hate the top-two,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader and California\u2019s most prominent Republican.In the tradition of many reforms enacted by voters in the state that helped pioneer direct democracy, the move to do away with partisan primaries has triggered a host of unforeseen consequences.\u201cIt has created mass confusion,\u201d said Dave Gilliard, a longtime Republican strategist here. \u201cAnd the people who have been empowered are not people from the districts. It has really just increased the power of outside forces.\u201dIt is, however, the people from the districts who are the most frustrated.When one of the lagging Democrats, Omar Siddiqui, took his turn on the microphone at the candidate forum, applause filled the synagogue when he was asked if he would consider dropping out.And when Mr. Siddiqui defended himself by citing an internal campaign poll, in which he said he would gain support once voters learned more about him, one woman in the audience warned against Democratic wishful thinking.\u201cIn one week?\u201d she yelled out.An earlier version of this article misstated a distinction of Sara Jacobs\u2019s candidacy. She is the only Democratic woman in her race, not the only woman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seven States, Led by Texas, Sue to End DACA Program", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpening another front in the battle over immigration policy, Texas and six other states sued the federal government on Tuesday in an attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\u201cThe executive unilaterally conferred lawful presence and work authorization on otherwise unlawfully present aliens, and then the executive used that lawful-presence \u2018dispensation\u2019 to unilaterally confer United States citizenship,\u201d the lawsuit says.It says the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas has the authority to \u201cimmediately rescind and cancel all DACA permits currently in existence because they are unlawful,\u201d and asks it to block the government \u201cfrom issuing or renewing DACA permits in the future, effectively phasing out the program within two years.\u201d\u201cThree activist federal judges have blocked the federal government from canceling DACA,\u201d Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, whose office filed the lawsuit, said at a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cThat means that unelected federal judges are forcing the Trump administration to leave an unlawful program in place indefinitely as legal challenges drag on.\u201dAnd so, while the heads of the Department of Homeland Security and its constituent agencies are the ones being sued, the real targets are the judges who have ruled against the Trump administration. Mr. Paxton hopes that the judges who rule on it \u2014 perhaps ultimately the justices of the United States Supreme Court \u2014 will let Mr. Trump proceed with the repeal he already wants.A Homeland Security spokeswoman said the agency would not comment on pending litigation.The lawsuit drew condemnation from the Texas Democratic Party \u2014 whose chairman, Gilberto Hinojosa, said Mr. Paxton\u2019s \u201ccruel anti-immigration agenda will rip over 124,000 Texans away from their families and jeopardize our economy\u201d \u2014 and other supporters of the DACA program.Mr. Paxton \u201csaid he is challenging DACA not to be cruel or inhumane, which the lawsuit is both, but to determine the legality of DACA,\u201d Jessica Azua, the immigration campaign coordinator for the Texas Organizing Project and a DACA recipient, said in a statement. \u201cBut DACA is already being contested in the courts, so its legality will be determined in due time.\u201dThomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit was \u201cextremely late,\u201d given that DACA was introduced six years ago and federal courts have been acting in favor of its preservation for months.In June 2017, Mr. Paxton threatened to challenge DACA as well. Because Mr. Trump ordered an end to DACA three months later, Mr. Paxton delayed that challenge \u2014 until now.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the lawsuit\u2019s request. The suit states that the court has the power to \u201cimmediately rescind and cancel all DACA permits currently in existence\u201d; it does not ask the court to do so.Manny Fernandez contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Populists Get a Green Light to Govern, in New Threat to Europe", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 The populist parties that won Italy\u2019s elections two months ago by demonizing the political establishment, the European Union and illegal migrants in often vulgar terms were granted the go-ahead on Wednesday to form a government, crystallizing some of the biggest fears of Europe\u2019s leaders, who were already bracing for turbulence.The rapid ascent of populists in Italy \u2014 the birthplace of Fascism, a founding member of the European Union, and the bloc\u2019s fourth-largest economy \u2014 shattered the nation\u2019s decades-old party system.It also gave fresh energy to the nationalist impulses tugging at the Continent and moved the greatest threat to the European Union\u2019s cohesion from newer member states on the periphery, such as Hungary and Poland, to its very core.Critics assert that he will be but a pawn of the populist parties behind him: the Five Star Movement, a web-based protest party untested at a national level; and the League, a hard-right party that campaigned on a stridently Italians-first platform.Mr. Conte promised \u201ca government of change\u201d that would \u201csafeguard the interests of Italians\u201d after emerging from a nearly two-hour meeting with the president at the Quirinal Palace and greeting a throng of reporters.Some analysts agreed, but less ebulliently. \u201cThe wave of populists and anti-establishment forces is still on, and this will continue for the foreseeable future across Europe,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, a political analyst and co-president of Teneo Intelligence.Yet in Italy the sudden ascent of the populists to power was all but unforeseen even four years ago, when Europe looked to the country as a bastion of liberal values and center-left politics.Mr. Conte will now present his cabinet choices to Mr. Mattarella, who has the power to reject individual ministers and is wary of empowering antagonists to the euro. But such a step is rare, and it is likely that Mr. Mattarella will approve the new government in the coming days.Most worrying to many is the threat the new government\u2019s agenda could pose to Italy\u2019s finances: Analysts said the governing agreement announced last week was a potential budget-buster.Matteo Salvini, 45, leader of the League, wasted no time after Mr. Conte\u2019s remarks to promote a eurosceptic, Paolo Savona, as economy minister.Italy, one of Europe\u2019s largest manufacturers, is also among its slowest growing economies. Italy\u2019s enormous government debt \u2014 about 130 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 makes it too big to bail out. If the Italian economy crashed, the European economy could tank, too.\u201cOur political message is very clear,\u201d said Valdis Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm. \u201cItaly needs to continue to reduce its public debt, which is indeed second highest in the E.U. after Greece.\u201dBut the populist leaders stuck with him, saying the alternative to Mr. Conte was new elections.As Mr. Conte met with the president, Mr. Salvini told reporters on the street that the incoming prime minister would have \u201cfull\u201d autonomy. He also said that for Mr. Conte, like for him, \u201cthe well being of Italian citizens\u201d came before European considerations.Five Star leaders applied pressure to the president to give them a chance at the helm, warning Mr. Mattarella against blocking the will of the people.\u201cItaly has voted the first anti-European, no-Europe government among the countries that founded the European Union,\u201d said Sergio Fabbrini, the director of the School of Government at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. \u201cI see instability, not stability, ahead.\u201dThe document jolted the markets and, perhaps even more important, made Mr. Mattarella nervous. It was quickly amended, and the party leaders moved to assure international observers that things would be fine.Often the populist leaders seemed to be performing for an audience of one. But Mr. Mattarella\u2019s power, absolute during the crisis, would transfer to the new government once its leaders took office.Mr. Fabbrini said that government could move Italy beyond its traditional West European partners and closer to countries like the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland that are increasingly challenging the European Union.\u201cThis is a group that would rather hollow it out from the inside, demanding more power over immigration, control of the border, a more loose stability and growth pact,\u201d Mr. Fabbrini said. \u201cIt\u2019s a more insidious coalition.\u201dUnder a Five Star and League government, Italy would be by far the largest voice of such a group, an unwelcome development for officials in Brussels. But the cold shoulder those leaders gave to Italy\u2019s outgoing center-left government on migration only fueled anti-migrant anger that benefited the populists.As the migrants kept coming, the anti-migrant League grew stronger. The Five Star Movement also took a harder line, though its core message addressed the economic frustration of young Italians, especially those in the economically depressed south.Despite its difficulty governing cities, such as Rome, Five Star has gained electoral strength, in part because its studied vagueness on controversial issues has avoided alienating voters on the left and right.Many Italians are unclear where it stands. Its leaders have questioned the country\u2019s membership in the eurozone, supported it, and recently questioned it again. They say they want Italy to be more balanced in its foreign policy, but have grown closer to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Their position on the dangers of vaccines keeps changing.The alliance\u2019s governing contract was ratified in recent days by the parties\u2019 bases. It includes proposals that critics say have the potential to erode Italy\u2019s representative democracy, such as banning members of Parliament from switching parties, or from dissenting from the party line.The League, a more traditional right-wing party with formal associations with France\u2019s National Front and Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia United Party, started as a northern separatist movement.Sofia Ventura, a professor of political science at the University of Bologna, said the new coalition was a \u201cmixture between ideology and incompetence.\u201dBut Europe\u2019s populists welcomed the new alliance warmly.In an article published on Wednesday in the newspaper Corriere della Sera, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front in France, said that the \u201cEurope of nations is close at hand\u201d and heralded the new government as a harbinger for the collapse of the European Union.Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party who helped lead the campaign for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, has relished the prospect of the Italians giving the Germans a headache.\u201cFirst anti-establishment government in Europe,\u201d he said in an interview, saying more would come. \u201cFirst government built on populism and nationalism as its foundation.\u201dOn Wednesday night, Mr. Conte said he was eager to represent that government at home and abroad. \u201cI offer myself as the defense lawyer of the Italian people,\u201d he said.Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bankers Hate the Volcker Rule. Now, It Could Be Watered Down.", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was one of the most significant actions by the federal government to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis.The Volcker Rule, named for the former chairman of the Federal Reserve and signed into law, prohibited banks from making their own risky bets with their customers\u2019 deposits. Banks loathed the rule and Republicans vowed to undo it.Now, a decade after the global financial meltdown, banks are on the brink of realizing their dream. The Fed and other federal banking regulators are poised to soften the Volcker Rule, making it easier for giant banks to engage in a wider range of trading that can be highly profitable, but also very risky.The changes, which are expected to be proposed later this month, are emblematic of the larger deregulatory effort underway in Washington.This week, Congress is expected to take a significant step toward rolling back parts of the Dodd-Frank law, with the House scheduled to vote Tuesday on a bill that would allow thousands of small and midsize banks to avoid tougher oversight. Similar bipartisan legislation passed the Senate earlier this year, clearing a path for President Trump to sign the bill into law.And Mr. Trump on Monday signed a law nullifying a consumer rule intended to prevent discrimination in auto lending.But the real action is at the financial regulatory agencies, like the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which have broad powers over the banking system. The agencies are now largely run by Trump appointees who are sympathetic to Wall Street institutions\u2019 longstanding complaints that they have been hurt by overzealous regulations written after the financial crisis.And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is in the midst of a wholesale retreat. Since taking over the bureau last November, Mick Mulvaney has halted new investigations; instituted a hiring freeze; stopped the agency from collecting certain data from banks; and proposed cutting off public access to a database of consumer complaints.The relaxation of the Volcker Rule \u2014 which was part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank act and was named for its chief proponent, former Fed chairman Paul Volcker \u2014 carries particular weight. The regulation, which has wrought sweeping changes on Wall Street since it took effect in July 2015, is probably the best-known part of the Dodd-Frank act \u2014 and the rare provision that people can remember the name of. Watering it down could serve as a valuable example of the Trump administration\u2019s success in rolling back regulations.An alphabet soup of five federal agencies \u2014 the Fed, O.C.C., F.D.I.C., Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission \u2014 are coming up with the proposed changes to the rule. They won\u2019t go so far as to eliminate the ban on proprietary trading, but they would make it easier for banks to comply and give them more control over defining what constitutes improper trading, according to three people familiar with the regulators\u2019 plans.In practice, the proposed changes could expand the types of trading that banks are permitted to engage in.Banks and their regulators say the changes are needed because the 71-page rule is too complex and interferes with banks\u2019 ability to provide market liquidity. In other words, they claim that the rule is making it much harder for banks to match buyers and sellers of financial products.\u201cRather than reducing systemic risk, the Volcker Rule has impeded the efficient operation of the financial system, driving banks away from providing services valued by their customers, reducing competition in affected markets, and overall acting as a drag on the economy,\u201d wrote Timothy Keehan, an American Banker\u2019s Association lobbyist, in a letter last year to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.Regulators appointed by Mr. Trump appear to agree. \u201cWe want banks to be able to engage in market making and provide liquidity to financial markets with less fasting and prayer about their compliance with the Volcker Rule,\u201d Randal K. Quarles, the Federal Reserve\u2019s vice chairman for supervision, said in a speech to bankers on March 5.While nobody disputes that the rule has been a headache for banks, there is little evidence that it has stanched market liquidity or is in any way disrupting banks\u2019 core functions as custodians of the financial markets.\u201cI just don\u2019t see the market being harmed by an absence of liquidity at this point,\u201d said Thomas M. Hoenig, who stepped down as vice chairman of the F.D.I.C. last month.An analysis published last year by the Securities and Exchange Commission that focused on how financial markets have changed over the past decade found that liquidity in parts of the bond market has actually improved since Volcker took effect. Trading costs declined and volumes rose.Privately, bankers admit as much. Current and former executives, traders, risk managers and lobbyists of the five largest United States banks, including people responsible for overseeing large trading businesses, said in interviews that the rule had neither starved market participants of trading options nor undermined the stability of the markets.The banks\u2019 real concern is that complying with the rule is very cumbersome and that it hurts profits.There are loads of paperwork. Bankers have to be ready to prove to regulators that any particular trade serves a legitimate purpose for clients and does not represent a bet by the bank on the future directions of markets. Some of the rule\u2019s definitions are fuzzy, making compliance even harder.Yet banks have not been cited for running afoul of the rule. Only one institution has been penalized for violating Volcker: Deutsche Bank paid nearly $20 million last year for having failed to show it had the proper systems in place to monitor its trading and collect data to comply with the rule.Most important, the rule has made the trading business, once a key engine of banks\u2019 profits, less lucrative. Star bank traders have decamped to hedge funds. By design, the rule has made trading on Wall Street far less interesting.No one expects \u2014 or is promoting \u2014 a return to the days where banks often had internal hedge funds that made market wagers with the banks\u2019 own money. Senior industry executives say they agree that a ban on trading with depositors\u2019 money is helpful for the industry\u2019s stability and credibility.The question is how exactly to distinguish between trading connected to clients, which is permitted, and trading that amounts to speculation, which is banned.Every time a bank makes a trade with or lends money to a client, the bank tries to protect itself from risks associated with those activities. Those include the risks that the client does not pay back the loan or that interest rates move sharply. To shield itself from those potential problems, a bank can engage in hedging, often using instruments such as derivatives.But those derivatives aren\u2019t used purely for defensive reasons. Until the Volcker Rule, traders inside the banks were also using the same derivatives to make speculative bets on the markets.So, where do you draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable trading? Bankers say this is a gray area that they are struggling to navigate. And they worry that regulators might pounce if a well-intentioned trade goes wrong, incurring losses or hurting clients.Critics of the industry \u2014 including progressive groups like Americans for Financial Reform \u2014 say banks simply want to loosen Volcker\u2019s definition of hedging so that they have greater leeway to return to their casino-like activities.A spokeswoman for Mr. Volcker said he declined to comment.Less controversial are the expected changes to the data that banks have to provide to regulators under the rule. Banks and the authorities agree that so much information floods regulators every day that it is essentially impenetrable.\u201cRight now you have reams of data coming in and the presumption is you have to prove you\u2019re not prop trading,\u201d Mr. Hoenig said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any issues brought up through looking at that data.\u201dThe weakening of the Volcker Rule would add to a growing list of wins for the banking industry.But the measure does little to aid big banks, which is a priority for the banks as well as for regulators who feel that large companies were victimized by regulations imposed by the Obama administration. Congress, so far, has not shown much appetite for helping the biggest banks.\u201cThe significant reforms, if they come, will be from the regulators themselves,\u201d said Justin Schardin, a fellow specializing in financial regulation at the Bipartisan Policy Center.Advertisement"}

Surveillance cameras arrived first, pointed at the doors to rent-regulated apartments. Then came the construction workers, who gutted empty units and sent a dust cocktail of lead-based paint, brick and who knows what else throughout the building.Worried, a pregnant woman and her husband left, dooming their apartment to the demolition derby. Violations were issued; violations were dismissed. And on a Friday morning in early August 2016, Temma Tainow, who had lived in the West Village building for 34 years, was jarred awake by what sounded like an explosion. She stumbled into her kitchen and screamed. A leg dangled from a hole punched through her ceiling.\u201cI think it is imprinted on my brain forever: looking up and seeing five men staring down through the hole,\u201d recalled Ms. Tainow, 70, a tiny therapist with a halo of reddish-brown hair who speaks deliberately and walks with a slow limp. \u201cIt\u2019s been awful. It\u2019s been a nightmare. It\u2019s exactly what the owner wants.\u201dArticles in this series examine New York's broken system for protecting tenants and affordable apartments.Across much of New York City, construction scenes like these play out regularly at buildings with rent-regulated apartments \u2014 the city\u2019s largest stock of affordable housing, where rents are set at a prescribed level and are supposed to increase only a small amount each year.In neighborhoods already gentrified or in the throes of gentrifying, a relatively new class of mega-landlords has driven up rents by exploiting enforcement gaps in a web of city and state agencies. By churning through enough tenants and claiming enough renovations, landlords can raise the rent enough \u2014 beyond $2,733.75 a month \u2014 to wrest an apartment from regulation\u2019s grip and into the free market.New York\u2019s housing system can be complicated to navigate. Here\u2019s a quick primer on what your rights are and how to exercise them.New York\u2019s housing system can be complicated to navigate. Here\u2019s a quick primer on what your rights are and how to exercise them.New York is among the global boomtowns, like London, Los Angeles and San Francisco, where skyrocketing rents \u2014 and the struggle to shelter those who can\u2019t afford them \u2014 have struck a deep political chord. But New York grapples with its own peculiar contradictions.It has the nation\u2019s largest rent-regulation system. On paper at least, it still has some of the most robust tenant protections, bolstered by new city laws designed to fight tenant harassment and give poor tenants free legal representation in housing court.Yet without more fundamental change \u2014 especially in the basic laws governing rent increases \u2014 regulated apartments in New York are in danger of vanishing, one by one.In some ways, this is an age-old story: New York has been in some form of housing crisis for a century. Landlords and tenants have battled for at least that long. But over the last 25 years, the balance of power has been reordered by a confluence of factors: that progressive weakening of the rent laws, an immensely profitable free market driven by a surging local economy, and the evolution of the rental real estate business, with mom-and-pop operations increasingly subsumed by Landlord Inc.In the face of these changes, the regulators are simply overmatched.The regulatory apparatus is fractionalized, divided among three city and state agencies. It is also essentially passive, The Times found. So state regulators, relying on outdated technology, do not systematically check whether a landlord found to have overcharged one tenant regularly does the same to others. City regulators do not investigate whether an owner who has illegally gutted apartments in one building might be doing the same elsewhere. And if building inspectors fail twice to get inside to investigate complaints of illegal construction, they don\u2019t return a third time; the complaint is tossed out.The New York Times would like to hear from people who live in New York City about their experiences dealing with rent overcharge or illegal construction.New York Times reporters would like to hear from you. We may contact you to learn more about your story.Required fields are marked with an asterisk.First and last preferred, please.Street address, city and state (or borough), please.Thank you for your submission.The Times interviewed more than 200 tenants, housing activists and government employees; reviewed thousands of pages of court records and building permits; and examined several government databases. In place of regulatory muscle, The Times found, the system relies on trust: trust that landlords do the right thing, trust that architects and engineers submit accurate permit applications, trust that landlords report rental histories correctly, trust that eviction suits are legitimate.It also places the burden of investigation on tenants. They must ask for their apartments\u2019 rental histories and determine their accuracy, complain about building permits, and sue over harassment. Holding on to an affordable apartment can turn into a part-time job, not to mention a full-time obsession.Agencies rarely take action unless someone complains, and it can take time. In 2015, tenants who filed rent-overcharge complaints waited nearly two years on average for a resolution.11E11A11B11C11D11FEleventh Floor10A10B10C10F10D10ETenth9A9B9C9D9E9FNinth8A8C8F8B8D8EEighth7A7B7F7C7D7ESeventh6A6B6C6E6D6FSixth5A5B5E5F5C5DFifth4C4B4D4E4A4FFourthThird3C3E3F3A3B3D2B2C2D2E2A2FSecond1A1D1E1F1B1CFirst11E11A11B11C11D11FEleventh Floor10A10B10C10F10D10ETenth9A9B9C9D9E9FNinth8A8C8F8B8D8EEighth7A7B7F7C7D7ESeventh6A6B6C6E6D6FSixth5A5B5E5F5C5DFifth4C4B4D4E4A4FFourthThird3C3E3F3A3B3D2B2C2D2E2A2FSecond1A1D1E1F1B1CFirst11E11A11B11C11D11FEleventh Floor10A10B10C10F10D10ETenth9A9B9C9D9E9FNinth8A8C8F8B8D8EEighth7A7B7F7C7D7ESeventh6A6B6C6E6D6FSixth5A5B5E5F5C5DFifth4C4B4D4E4A4FFourthThird3C3E3F3A3B3D2B2C2D2E2A2FSecond1A1D1E1F1B1CFirstEleventhFloor11E11A11B11C11D11FTenth10A10B10C10F10D10ENinth9A9B9C9D9E9FEighth8A8F8B8C8D8ESeventh7A7B7F7C7D7ESixth6A6B6C6D6E6FFifth5A5B5C5E5F5DFourth4C4B4D4E4F4AThird3C3E3F3A3B3DSecond2A2B2C2D2E2FFirst1A1D1E1F1B1CThe New York Times used rent-registration records and interviews to trace the gradual loss of regulated apartments in the building between 1996 and 2018.

| Source: Note: Rents are approximate and rounded to the nearest dollar.To breach the $2,733.75 threshold, mega-landlords and aspiring ones tend to follow the same playbook: After buying a building, they try to get tenants in regulated apartments to leave, often offering buyouts or harassing them with poor services or eviction suits. Once an apartment is empty, they tack on allowed vacancy increases. They often also perform renovations, enabling them to raise the rent even further while annoying the remaining neighbors, sometimes to the point of prompting them to leave.Some landlords willfully flout the rules, The Times found. Applying for construction permits, they say buildings have no occupied apartments when they do. They inflate the cost of renovations or claim the work will be only minor when it is major. Or they falsely claim to have performed renovations, knowing that the state asks for proof only when a new tenant complains. If regulators catch on to one trick, landlords find another. It\u2019s like a giant game of Whac-a-Mole. Punishment, if there is any, is seen as the cost of doing business, often a minor fine in the course of a multimillion-dollar development deal.In 2007, a developer named Ben Shaoul and his partners, private equity firms, bought 17 East Village buildings for $97.5 million. They then included false statements on almost every building permit application, enabling them to skirt tenant-protection requirements.In an interview, Mr. Shaoul said his company renovated buildings left untouched for decades and deregulated them properly.\u201cThe idea was to increase rents,\u201d Mr. Shaoul said, adding that his company no longer purchased buildings with regulated apartments. \u201cThat was the business plan. That was the intent. It\u2019s America.\u201dIn late 1992, Steven Croman, only 26, bought his first tenement building, a five-story walk-up at 221 Mott Street.The block was a slice of old, but ever-evolving, New York. Though still considered part of Little Italy, the neighborhood was by then largely Chinese. Eighteen of its 36 buildings had rent-regulated apartments, 261 units in all.Beginning in the 1920s, New York experimented with regulation to battle a chronically low vacancy rate. Advocates argued that regulation maintained a stable housing stock and limited runaway rents. Landlords countered that regulation increased rents of unregulated apartments, restricted building upkeep and discouraged new construction.By the 1980s, the city had two types of regulated apartments: rent-controlled and rent-stabilized. Rent-controlled apartments, with strict rules and extremely low rents, were being phased out, so most regulated apartments were stabilized, with annual increases set by a board and a menu of tenant protections. Many were stabilized according to the traditional criteria: built before 1974, with six or more units. Others, stabilized through tax-benefit programs, often had much higher initial rents and could be deregulated after a certain time.But these were generally small landlords, limited in what they could legally accomplish.Mr. Croman had good timing. New York was emerging from the dark days of the 1970s and \u201980s, when boarded-up buildings pockmarked many neighborhoods. Rents climbed with demand.He bought more buildings. Almost organically, a similar class of landlords rose up, always looking for buildings with regulated apartments.Some were family businesses that preferred to hold on to their buildings, banking on a return over time.Others had a more corporate face, along with investors. Some got mortgages based not on a building\u2019s current rent roll but on its potential earnings. Some flipped buildings quickly, emptying and renovating as many regulated apartments as possible before selling to the next company, remaking neighborhoods from the inside out.One fairly recent example: In June 2013, BCB Property Management bought 1059 Union Street, in the fast-gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights, for $8.2 million. Twenty-eight of the 32 apartments were rent-stabilized, tax bills show.And while the raw number of regulated apartments has stayed roughly even, that figure hides a particular churn. Traditional regulated apartments pushed into the free market have been replaced by apartments added through tax-break programs, which are often much more expensive. In 2016, the median legal rent of newly registered stabilized apartments was $2,750 \u2014 roughly the median asking rent for all New York apartments on the rental website StreetEasy. In Brooklyn, the median rent of a newly stabilized apartment was almost $3,300.Frieda Taplitz bought 25 Grove Street for $52,500 in 1957. The building \u2014 red brick, tenement-style, built in 1886 \u2014 was a family investment: A Taplitz always lived there. Repairs and modest improvements, such as a new chimney and a new stairway enclosure, were done. Major renovations weren\u2019t. Rents remained low. Tenants like Temma Tainow stayed for decades, and for the most part, the tenants and the Taplitzes got along. Only three complaints were recorded, all in the mid-1990s.In the fall, construction crews arrived.For a landlord seeking to free apartments from regulation, that bureaucratic limbo makes it easier to do rent-enhancing renovations hidden from city inspectors\u2019 scrutiny.So landlords may lie on permit applications, saying that major construction is only cosmetic work, which demands far gentler oversight. They may begin work without obtaining permits at all. Whatever the violation, the median building fine between 2013 and 2017 was $800, pocket change for developers. The city\u2019s finance department does little to ensure that fines are collected. The buildings department does little to ensure that violations are fixed.Most permit applications for apartment renovations get only a cursory review. That is because architects and engineers are allowed to \u201cself-certify\u201d that they follow the rules, letting them quickly obtain permits for what they say is minor work. A self-certified permit is often approved within days. Applications that are actually reviewed \u2014 those for more extensive work \u2014 can take months.A buildings department spokesman, Joseph Soldevere, said self-certification helped make construction easier, faster and cheaper. Adding more red tape would simply drive illegal work further underground, he said, adding that the agency routinely audited self-certified applications, about one in every six last year.But a comparison of building permits, violations and apartment listings indicates how willfully some owners flout the rules.At 165 Avenue A, one of the East Village buildings purchased in part by Mr. Shaoul\u2019s company, two architects submitted eight self-certified permits for apartment renovations between 2007 and 2011. Both claimed the work would not change occupancy. One, Ken Hudes, whose firm, Atelier New York Architecture, has become a favorite of mega-landlords, said his work would involve only minor partition changes.But the work was considerable: Apartments were gutted and converted from one- and two-bedrooms to four-bedrooms.Mr. Hudes denied any wrongdoing. In an email, he said his team turned nonfunctioning apartments into beautiful homes, adding, \u201cTenants and landlords love our work.\u201dJust as permits are easily granted, complaints are often closed for the most basic reason: Inspectors are allowed to dismiss them if they fail twice to get inside. With regulated apartments, that has led to the dismissal of almost 3,000 complaints a year \u2014 even allegations of tenant harassment. Without other evidence, Mr. Soldevere said, the buildings department has little choice but to close complaints when inspectors are refused entry or when a building is locked.The fine was paid. But the apartments are still marketed as having four bedrooms. In November, Apartment 8 was advertised for $5,500 a month. A spokeswoman for Kushner Companies declined to comment.In short order, the architect, Mr. Hudes\u2019s partner, Jonathan Miller, submitted two self-certified permits, saying workers would do only minor work in four units. Within hours, each permit was rubber-stamped. City inspectors then responded to the initial complaint, dismissing it.Landlords are often tipped off to potential problems by complaints automatically logged on a public website. Only then do they file permit applications \u2014 akin to getting a driver\u2019s license after being accused of speeding.\u201cI\u2019m not even as angry at the landlord as I am at the city,\u201d said Collette Stallone, 63, a tenant. \u201cThey\u2019re allowing this.\u201dMr. Sanieoff declined to comment. His lawyer, Joseph Buckley, denied any wrongdoing.Tenants soon complained of excessive dust, of illegal construction, of sloppy work. A drill punctured Ms. Tainow\u2019s ceiling. A saw came through another tenant\u2019s floor.Photographs showed a thick layer of dust inside apartments. Ms. Tainow developed a raspy cough.\u201cI was wearing a mask all the time, even when I was sleeping,\u201d said Humberto Torres, 56, who has asthma and lives across the hall.Photographs later documented that the work was hardly minor: entire apartments taken down to the studs; one-bedroom units altered to have two.On Jan. 13, 2016, the owner and contractors were hit with four violations. Three of them \u2014 for working without permits and lying on one application \u2014 led to fines of $4,000. The fourth \u2014 for excessive dust in Mr. Torres\u2019s apartment \u2014 was deemed \u201cimmediately hazardous.\u201dViolation hearings are usually cozy affairs, with a city hearing officer, a buildings department lawyer and a representative of the building or construction firm. Tenants are not invited. Landlords routinely get the benefit of the doubt.At the dust-violation hearing, Abe Sicker, representing the construction company, argued that the violation\u2019s class should be reduced. \u201cIt is annoying, the dust,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut an immediately hazardous violation?\u201dThe hearing officer agreed \u2014 and then some. She dismissed the violation altogether.\u201cAll he was seeing was dollar signs,\u201d said Cynthia Wilkie, 62, who lived in one of the two occupied apartments at 632 Sterling Place.What happened next shows the flimsiness of the rules and paperwork designed to protect tenants in regulated apartments during construction.On the application, Mr. Sussman needed to check \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on two boxes: Was the building occupied? Did it have rent-regulated units? He checked \u201cno\u201d on both.Mr. Soldevere said examiners had determined that the protection planned for tenants was appropriate for the proposed construction.As with lying about the extent of construction, lying about occupancy or regulatory status is a crime and may mean that owners are compromising safety. If a building has tenants, a tenant protection plan is required to safeguard them.\u201cIt\u2019s not just a bureaucratic check-the-box, not-check-the-box thing,\u201d said Brandon Kielbasa, a tenant organizer with the Cooper Square Committee. \u201cThe consequences are that tenants are put in really dangerous situations or psychologically harassed out of their homes.\u201dYet as at 632 Sterling Place, many architects and engineers submitted tenant-protection plans with few protections, often simply cut and pasted from the building code. And falsified permits are not uncommon, a review of thousands of permits shows. Hundreds of owners lied about both occupancy and regulated apartments.Until recently, the review showed, the city largely ignored the boxes altogether. It didn\u2019t track whether an owner lied about occupancy or whether a building had regulated apartments, considering tax bills unreliable because they were self-reported. Only in December 2016 did the state agency that monitors regulated apartments agree to tell the buildings department whether a building had any.Architects and engineers are rarely held responsible for falsified permits. They are licensed by the state, which seldom punishes anyone. Those disciplined by the city often voluntarily surrender self-certification privileges to avoid more formal punishment. The reasons are never made public.In December, Mr. Soltanizadeh, who had faced up to four years in prison, pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct \u2014 the equivalent of a ticket. He is still licensed, although he gave up his self-certification privileges a year ago.His lawyer, Paul Greenfield, said Mr. Melamed, who spent 20 days in jail and paid $200,000 in restitution, was to blame for the falsehoods.At 632 Sterling Place, after agreeing to buy the building in late 2014, Mr. Sussman had pushed tenants to leave, eventually offering buyouts. Two tenants agreed to move, including a woman with dementia. The other woman said she never received any money.But moving made no sense to Ms. Wilkie, who had lived there for 22 years and paid about $850 a month for the three-bedroom apartment she shared with her brother, daughter and two grandchildren. Ms. Wilkie had diabetes and had undergone double-bypass heart surgery. Her daughter, Wendy, 33, was blind and in a wheelchair because of childhood brain cancer. Ms. Wilkie\u2019s brother had lost his right leg to diabetes.Her neighbor, Arnold Brathwaite, 68, a retired veteran, also wanted to stay.By early 2016, the building started coming down around them, despite the cookie-cutter protection plan. The heat was turned off. The second and third floors were gutted. A staircase was removed. A hole was cut into the roof. Debris was piled in corners, against walls. Dust was everywhere.On Aug. 10, 2016, inspectors issued 10 major building violations. Still, that meant only $23,250 in fines. Neither Mr. Sussman nor the architect was fined for lying.Mr. Sussman, the managing member of the limited liability company 632 Sterling L.L.C., did not respond to requests for comment.Because the building was so unsafe, the city moved the tenants to a Days Inn in Queens, filled mainly with other refugees from damaged apartments, their rent now paid by taxpayers. Ms. Wilkie, her daughter and granddaughter shared a cramped room with two queen-size beds. The hotel\u2019s single, shared microwave became their kitchen.With help from the Legal Aid Society, Ms. Wilkie and Mr. Brathwaite sued to fix the building on Sterling Place.That case will take years. Mr. Brathwaite eventually settled, accepting another apartment from Mr. Sussman. Ms. Wilkie decided to fight.Her family stayed at the Days Inn for more than a year, until the city tried to move her to a homeless shelter in November. To avoid that, she temporarily rented an apartment in Brownsville, a Brooklyn neighborhood still ungentrified, with a bathroom too small for Wendy\u2019s wheelchair. The monthly rent is $2,110, almost triple what she paid before.There is one more line of defense: the state\u2019s Division of Housing and Community Renewal, designated overseer of the rent laws, watchdog against rent fraud, guardian of the $2,733.75 threshold for traditional regulated apartments.Many housing advocates argue that rent fraud is rampant in New York. How widespread such overcharges are, though, is impossible to judge, because the state agency doesn\u2019t collect much of the necessary information. When it does, it is barred from making the data public.Yet it is clear that the agency is often helpless in the face of the myriad subterfuges that some landlords deploy to manipulate rent system guidelines.The agency, for example, requires landlords to report all regulated rents annually, along with vacancy increases and money spent on apartment improvements. But it does not require proof of that spending, unless a tenant files an overcharge complaint, which is rare. Nor does the agency check for a building permit when a landlord claims a rent increase for improvements. A missing permit could indicate that work was illegal, minor or never done.So just as they may lie about the extent \u2014 or even existence \u2014 of improvements to avoid oversight, landlords may claim whatever type and quantity of work is needed to free an apartment from regulation.If the state agency consistently comes up short, it is, perhaps unintentionally, frank about its limitations.On rental histories, the agency admits that it does not \u201cattest to the truthfulness of the owner\u2019s statements or the legality of the rents reported in this document.\u201d On some rental histories, it misspells its own name: \u201cCommuntiy,\u201d instead of \u201cCommunity.\u201dFor an agency created to protect tenants, it often ends up sheltering landlords. In the name of protecting tenants\u2019 privacy, the agency is barred from releasing rental histories, except to the tenant. It is even barred from reporting how many regulated apartments are in a building.In an attempt to quantify rent-rule violations, at least in microcosm, lawyers at the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation, an advocacy group, investigated the rental histories of the 92 apartments at 560 Audubon Avenue. The study, part of a pending 2016 lawsuit alleging rent overcharges, found unexplained rent jumps in 58 apartments and registered rents that didn\u2019t match leases in 33. Thirteen tenants signed riders certifying that their apartments had been \u201ccompletely renovated in a good workmanlike manner.\u201d No renovations had been completed.In court filings, the owner, Hayco Corporation, denied overcharging tenants.The state housing agency is hamstrung, too, by archaic technology. So if a tenant wins an overcharge case, the agency\u2019s 1980s computer system cannot automatically review the landlord\u2019s other apartments for possible violations. In fact, the agency does not look for overcharges, even in the same building.\u201cIt\u2019s like prescribing a Tylenol to a patient that has brain cancer,\u201d said Aaron Carr, founder of the Housing Rights Initiative, which investigates rent overcharges for possible class-action lawsuits.The agency has had to do more with less: In 2017, only 27 examiners looked at overcharge complaints. In 2007, there were 37.In 2012, Mr. Cuomo also set up a Tenant Protection Unit, which undertook the first-ever audits of owners who had reported significant increases for apartment improvements, recovering $4.5 million for tenants. The unit says it has returned 67,000 apartments to the regulated rolls.But tenant advocates called that figure illusory, saying owners were merely allowed to register their apartments as stabilized, but at their current higher rents, without penalties, \u201cratifying their earlier fraud,\u201d said Edward Josephson, litigation director for Legal Services NYC.The state refused to give any information about those apartments, which in any event would barely stem losses. The city now has 6,500 fewer stabilized apartments than in 2011, according to state numbers.The tenant protection unit has enemies. Real estate industry groups sued, challenging its existence. Though the suit was dismissed, they have appealed. State lawmakers, who still rely heavily on industry donations, have consistently denied the unit\u2019s budget request. The state housing agency funds it. Its commissioner, RuthAnne Visnauskas, said she hoped lawmakers would increase the unit\u2019s funding \u201cso that we can do even more.\u201dRecently the unit audited 560 Audubon, looking at three apartments and ordering rent reductions after no proof of improvements was provided. Investigators neither fined the landlord nor examined other apartments there.\u201cI was gobsmacked,\u201d said Matthew Chachere, a lawyer with Northern Manhattan.In 2016, the state started requiring landlords to give new rent-regulated tenants explanations of their rent, and to provide more proof of apartment improvements. But tenants rarely check explanations, and the government rarely investigates the authenticity of landlords\u2019 proof.Christopher Leahy, a landlord and contractor who has testified as an expert witness for tenants, believes some landlords claim improvements and then fabricate evidence if tenants file overcharge complaints.The landlords \u201ckeep doing it because they so often get away with it,\u201d he said. \u201cMost tenants don\u2019t complain.\u201dThe proof was riddled with problems. The check copies were so tiny as to be illegible. One company, Pinpoint Builders, claimed to have done $20,000 of the work. But the address on its letterhead \u2014 5041 16th Avenue in Brooklyn \u2014 did not exist. The new bathroom tiles it claimed to have installed were cracking.Another company, Yankels Demolition and Rubbish Removal, charged $4,000 for \u201crubbish removal\u201d but classified it as an apartment improvement, yielding a $100 monthly rent increase. The company also claimed to have redone the closets. The apartment has no closets.\u201cThat really upset me,\u201d Mr. Pavoni said.Watermark defends the rent increase. The company said Pinpoint was now based out of another office and blamed tenants for the cracked bathroom tiles. As for the closets, Watermark said they were included in the original work order, then omitted.In January, the state housing agency ruled in Watermark\u2019s favor, saying it had never received Mr. Pavoni\u2019s mailed response. He has appealed.The vanishing affordable apartment is having an extended political moment.But the buildings department will be the primary enforcer, and its commitment is unclear.Last week, after questioning by The Times, the department appeared to have changed its mind: Mr. Soldevere said funding had been requested for two new employees for the advocate\u2019s office. In addition, he said that because of the new laws, the agency planned to hire more than 70 new employees to focus on tenant protection and set up a quick-response unit for complaints of work without permits.\u201cWe won\u2019t tolerate landlords who use construction to harass tenants,\u201d he said, adding that since September, the department had issued 547 violations for lying about occupancy and regulation on permits.The Times identified 370 that had been resolved. Out of $1.8 million in fines, about $280,000 has been paid; the median fine was $2,400.With the new scrutiny, some large landlords have stopped lying on permit applications, a review of hundreds of applications shows. They have amended their playbook.But while they are now more likely to check the boxes saying that buildings are occupied with regulated apartments, their tenant protection plans are still pro forma and vague. In the first three months of 2018, Mr. Plotkin of Atelier filed at least 55 identical plans \u2014 475-word statements that used phrases from the building code and garbled statements like, \u201cNoise will kept to a minimum during working while ongoing construction is taking place.\u201dMr. Croman did not go to Rikers. Instead, he ended up at the Manhattan Detention Complex in Chinatown \u2014 more convenient for family and friends.He is to be released next month. His company still owns its buildings, though the state monitors them, as part of his settlement. And his buildings and contractors have continued to rack up violations; as of April, they owed almost $875,000, records show. Since his arrest, 123 of 139 permit applications identified by The Times were self-certified.A spokesman for his company, Sam Spokony, declined to answer questions but said the company was \u201cdiligently implementing\u201d the settlement, \u201cin line with our ongoing focus on using best practices to provide quality housing for our residents.\u201dAt 25 Grove Street, a few regulated tenants eventually sued, winning a temporary rent reduction. After the worker fell through Ms. Tainow\u2019s ceiling in August 2016, the hole was immediately patched. A few hours later, as Ms. Tainow sat at her computer, workers punched another hole, this time in her living room ceiling, sending another large chunk of drywall onto the floor. Ms. Tainow started screaming. Neighbors called an ambulance: Her blood pressure had shot up to a dangerous 190/130.Despite the two cave-ins, a building inspector wrote up only one Class 1 violation, the most serious kind, for a \u201clocalized collapse of ceiling\u201d in the living room and cracks in Mr. Torres\u2019s apartment across the hall.At the hearing, Mr. Sicker, again representing the construction company, argued that the violation class should be reduced. An engineer\u2019s report about the living room, he said, showed \u201cthere was nothing really there.\u201dNo photographs were provided. Vivian Currie, the buildings department\u2019s lawyer, described the two ceiling collapses as \u201ca small localized area,\u201d explaining that he had hesitated calling the building inspector to testify because it would have taken time. \u201cYeah, I mean, to avoid getting the inspector, you know, we will move to amend.\u201dMs. Tainow was not mentioned. Mr. Sicker won his reduction. The fine was halved, to $5,000.January 2017 brought another complaint about illegal construction.

He recognized former Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, who was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in January, and Ray Chavez, a Navy veteran and the oldest living survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor.Mr. Trump also eulogized Lt. Col. David Greene of the Marines and Capt. Mark Stubenhofer of the Army, who were killed in Iraq in 2004, and Sgt. Christopher Jacobs of the Marines, who died in a training exercise in 2011.\u201cAs he covered his troops, he was shot by ground fire, giving up his life for his comrades and for his country,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Colonel Greene, giving a thumbs-up and congratulations to the officer\u2019s son for planning to join the military.Captain Stubenhofer was killed by sniper fire just months after his wife gave birth to a daughter they named Hope, Mr. Trump said.The president said he had met Sergeant Jacobs\u2019s son, 7-year-old Christian, at last year\u2019s wreath-laying ceremony: \u201cChristian walked over to me, with great confidence, shook my hand, looked me straight in the eye and asked if I would like to meet his dad.

Since then, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups in the Strip have fired nearly 10,000 rockets and mortars from Gaza into Israel \u2014 all the while denouncing an economic \u201cblockade\u201d that is Israel\u2019s refusal to feed the mouth that bites it.

It would be condemned as self-destructive, cowardly and almost bottomlessly cynical.Why is nothing expected of Palestinians, and everything forgiven, while everything is expected of Israelis, and nothing forgiven?That\u2019s a question to which one can easily guess the answer. In the meantime, it\u2019s worth considering the harm Western indulgence has done to Palestinian aspirations.If Palestinians want to build a worthy, proud and prosperous nation, they could do worse than try to learn from the one next door.

{"Headline": "One Risk to the Economy \u2014 A Slowdown in Lending: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A slowdown in lending could pose a threat to the economy.\u2022 Could oil prices return to $100 a barrel next year?\u2022 Walmart\u2019s journey to its biggest deal.\u2022 How Michael Cohen made $2 million as a gatekeeper.\u2022 The latest fallout from Trump\u2019s foreign policy.With tax cuts done and deregulation proceeding, some expect the United States economy to grow more quickly than it has in recent years.Borrowing allows companies and individuals to finance purchases that they might not otherwise be able to afford. When borrowing surges, new money circulates through the economy, creating demand that needs to be met with higher production.Lending has certainly not fallen off a cliff like it did during the Great Recession, but it is growing quite a bit slower than it has in recent years. If it doesn\u2019t pick up, that could dampen growth some expect.In March, bank loans to companies (commercial and industrial loans, in the Federal Reserve\u2019s statistics) rose 2.5 percent from a year ago. That is well below the 7 percent average monthly growth rate of the past three years. Real estate and consumer loans also grew below their three-year average rates.Tough comparisons are in part to blame for the lackluster growth. This year\u2019s borrowing is being compared with totals notched up during a surge in lending. And since that boom petered out in early 2017, growth rates in credit may soon look better.But something else may hinder a strong revival in borrowing. Companies may have taken on so much debt that they may not want to borrow much more, or their creditors may not be as willing to lend. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Wednesday noted that the \u201cnet leverage\u201d of investment-grade corporations is now at its highest level since 2002. Debt, after subtracting cash holdings, is 1.82 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the companies, excluding financial firms and corporations in the energy, utilities and metals sectors.Of course, we may now just be in a lending lull that will soon give way to a rebound. But the longer credit growth remains subpar, the less likely a Trump boom becomes.- Peter EavisAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch argue that there is a risk of that happening.They cite collapsing production in Venezuela, continued production restraint by OPEC and Russia, and the rising tensions in the Middle East, which seem set to worsen in the wake of President Trump\u2019s decision to walk away from Iran nuclear deal.The analysts raised their forecast for Brent, the global benchmark for oil, to $70 a barrel this year and to $75 a barrel next year and that there was a possibility of oil going to $100 a barrel.Why the risk of $100 a barrel? There could be a greater than expected drop in Iranian oil exports and OPEC and Russia could continue to curb production. The BofA analysts write:\u201cIf a new Iran deal is not reached in the next six months or OPEC/Russia extend production cuts into 2019, global oil markets would likely tighten further.\u201dAnd United States shale likely will not make up for the falloff in productionBrent last saw $100 a barrel in September 2014.On the earnings call for his Third Point Reinsurance, Mr. Loeb said:Over the past two years, markets were boosted by positive surprises in growth and benign inflation, but during the first quarter, uncertainty returned in each of these areas. Investors have become increasingly concerned about multiples, particularly since after many years of low rates, there\u2019s finally an alternative to equities in the form of relatively riskless 2-year money.We\u2019ve also seen manufacturing indices start to decline from elevated levels.As the markets today grapple with multiples and which inning of the late cycle we\u2019re in, we\u2019re watching closely to see if a recession, which we don\u2019t think is close, might be getting closer.Historically low yields have push investors into increasingly risky assets since the financial crisis and provided crucial support for the stocks. Now that two-year Treasuries yield is more than 2.50 percent, that critical pillar of the nine-year bull market has been weakened somewhat.By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.Down the road: Flipkart and its remaining investors still hope the company will go public someday.

Tens of thousands of people had been singing and chanting at the Republic Square near Parliament throughout the day in support of Mr. Pashinyan\u2019s election.A power grab by Mr. Sargsyan, who was president from April 2008 to April 2018, triggered the demonstrations that united the fragmented opposition and brought together university students, programmers, teachers, cabdrivers and workers.The opposition is a group of minority parties, among them Yelk, or the \u201cWay Out\u201d alliance led by Mr. Pashinyan, the former journalist, who has led the recent demonstrations.Mr. Pashinyan\u2019s rise is partly a challenge to the legitimacy of previous elections marred by fraud. He went into hiding in the aftermath of a disputed presidential election in 2008 and was wanted by the police on allegations of mass disorder. Mr. Pashinyan was imprisoned in June 2009 until an amnesty was granted to political prisoners about two years later.

Apart from the opposition votes, he needed six votes from the Republican Party for his election.On Tuesday, Mr. Pashinyan received the support of 45 members of Parliament, signaling a deepening of the political crisis and a continuation of the peaceful civil disobedience campaign that has often paralyzed the city in the past two weeks.Mr. Pashinyan warned that if the Republicans do not endorse the political mandate he has won on the street, Armenia would plunge into crisis. A second parliamentary vote to elect the prime minister is expected next week.The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for 2022, but if Parliament fails twice to elect a new prime minister, snap elections must be held. If the next round of elections are fair and accountable, the Republican Party\u2019s grip on governance will be smashed and the party will be out of power for the first time in decades. It will also restore integrity in the electoral process and set the foundation for a more inclusive and open society.An earlier version of this article misstated where people were singing and chanting in Yerevan, Armenia.

{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Populist Parties, on Precipice of Power, Fail to Form Government", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s populists seethed and the European Union sighed with temporary relief on Sunday night after an anti-establishment alliance poised to govern the bloc\u2019s fourth-largest economy imploded at the last minute amid concerns that it was planning to sneak out the back door of the eurozone.\u201cI assure you that I gave my maximum effort and attention to carry out this task,\u201d said Giuseppe Conte, a previously little-known lawyer. His selection as prime minister-designate had raised concerns he would be a pawn of the populist forces that had settled on him as their compromise nominee.The announcement, a result of an impasse over the future government\u2019s economics minister, seemed likely to prompt the creation of a technical caretaker government on Monday morning. But it was unclear that such a government would have enough support to pass a confidence vote in Parliament, thus thrusting Italy back into political uncertainty.But Mr. Mattarella, a soft-spoken keeper of Italian institutions, explained in a civics lesson to Italians Sunday night that he was only carrying out his constitutional obligations to confirm a stable government that protected Italian interests.Speaking from his Quirinal Palace, Mr. Mattarella, who is imbued by Italy\u2019s Constitution with great powers during a government transition period, pointed out that Italy was one of the founding members of the European Union. Its membership in the common euro currency, Mr. Mattarella said, was \u201ca fundamentally important choice for the prospects of our country and our young people: If one wants to discuss it, it must be done openly.\u201dIn other words, if both parties had campaigned on leaving the eurozone, that would be one thing. But both had been vague on the subject, especially the Five Star Movement, which backed off talk of leaving the zone in the campaign. It was thus unacceptable, Mr. Mattarella argued, for the parties to install an economics minister hostile to the euro as a way out of the eurozone.\u201cI do not say what I am saying with a light heart,\u201d Mr. Mattarella said. \u201cBecause I did all I could so that a political government could be formed.\u201dHe said he gave the parties extra time, and gave Mr. Conte the mandate as prime minister, \u201covercoming any perplexity on the fact that a political government was to be led by a president who was not elected in Parliament.\u201dThe president said that he had gone out of his way to accommodate the parties\u2019 choices but that his constitutional role of guarantor had required him to oppose their choice of an economics minister who followed a line \u201cthat probably, or even inevitably, would lead Italy to exit the euro.\u201dWhile Mr. Mattarella did not say the name of the populist alliance\u2019s choice, he is Paolo Savona, an 82-year-old economist who has lamented Italy\u2019s joining the euro. Mr. Mattarella said that such a pick would alarm Italian and foreign investors and that the already sharp increases in the spread between German and Italian bond yields \u201cincreases our public debt and reduces the possibilities of the state to invest.\u201dHe said he could not allow stock market losses to torch the savings of Italian companies and families or make it harder for Italians to borrow money.\u201cIt is my duty, in fulfilling the duty of nominating ministers, which the Constitution entrusts to me, to be careful to safeguard the savings of Italians,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this way Italian sovereignty is concretely reaffirmed.\u201dBut Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, argued exactly the opposite on Sunday night.Saying he was as angry as \u201ca beast,\u201d he offered a preview of what is likely to be a long and vicious campaign attacking foreign interests, Italian institutions and Mr. Mattarella himself.\u201cDoes this seem like democracy to you?\u201d he said to reporters. He blamed bankers, Brussels, German politicians in Berlin and \u201cthe big powers\u201d for blocking the formation of a government and asserted that \u201cItalians would not be anyone\u2019s slave.\u201dMr. Salvini said that he had expected, as of Monday, to be Italy\u2019s interior minister, responsible for security and migration, and had been thinking, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to send home a whole lot of illegals.\u201d Instead, he said, the powers-that-be didn\u2019t like his choice for economics minister so they pulled the plug.But Mr. Salvini, a gifted politician, stands to gain the most from new elections. His support has increased throughout the long negotiating process. If Mr. Savona was a poison pill that Mr. Mattarella would never accept, his nomination essentially forced new elections that could send Mr. Salvini back to government as the prime minister of a broad center-right coalition with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.That would leave the Five Star Movement out of the picture. On Sunday night, the party\u2019s political leader, Luigi Di Maio, seemed genuinely apoplectic. After an emergency meeting with his party leaders, he called on Italian television for Mr. Mattarella\u2019s impeachment for blocking the will of the people.It is not clear if Five Star, an ideologically vague party that won more than 30 percent of the electorate, has alienated left-leaning voters upset about its alliance with the hard-right League.What is clear is that the outrage machine of Five Star, a protest party born online, kicked into high gear Sunday. In response, government officials expressed solidarity for Mr. Mattarella.\u201cKeep calm and solidarity with President Mattarella,\u201d Paolo Gentiloni, who remains Italy\u2019s prime minister, posted on Twitter. \u201cNow we must save our great country.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Mattarella is expected to meet at the Quirinal Palace with Carlo Cottarelli, a former director of the fiscal affairs department of the International Monetary Fund, to ask him to form a technical government.Mr. Cottarelli, who has also worked for the Bank of Italy and for the country\u2019s major energy company, ENI, is a preferred choice of Mr. Berlusconi.Mr. Cottarelli recently answered a question on Bloomberg television about whether he would be prime minister by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any possibility.\u201dThere is now a good possibility. But in this unpredictable, dramatic and seemingly unending Italian electoral season, nothing is certain.\u201cGood luck to Cottarelli?\u201d Mr. Conte told the Italian news wire ANSA as he walked out of a meeting with the Five Star Movement. \u201cGood luck to anyone. And especially Italy.\u201dElisabetta Povoledo and Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lisbon Is Thriving. But at What Price for Those Who Live There?", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLISBON \u2014 Not long ago, Portugal\u2019s capital, Lisbon, was a backwater of Europe. Its historical center was dotted with decrepit and semi-abandoned buildings. Some downtown squares were the domain of prostitutes and drug dealers. The city served as a display case for the devastation of Europe\u2019s debt crisis.Then, in 2011, the country embarked upon a series of difficult steps in return for an international bailout of 78 billion euros, or $92 billion, among them a new rental law that liberalized the capital\u2019s housing market.But who has gained and who has lost in Lisbon\u2019s revival has become a divisive issue for residents, and for Europe, as the continent finally emerges from the lost decade of its economic crisis to see what it has wrought.Portugal has been a prime exhibit of Europe\u2019s economic recovery. Unemployment has been halved. Exports are booming. Foreign investors have flooded Lisbon. The country even provides buyers of properties worth \u20ac500,000 or more the chance for a \u201cgolden visa\u201d to reside there.\u201cPortugal\u2019s strategy to exit the crisis was all about attracting foreign investment, which solved a major financial problem but is also now creating new issues for our people, like this housing crisis in Lisbon,\u201d said Ana Drago, a former lawmaker and a researcher in urban studies at the University Institute of Lisbon.The revival of Lisbon feels to many less privileged residents who are being displaced like an abrupt swing from one extreme to the other. On some streets both extremes live side by side.In the medieval neighborhood of Mouraria, a luxury condominium is being built a few yards away from a renovated building that has become a second home for French and other foreign investors.No doubt, most Portuguese, led by those who own real estate, consider Lisbon\u2019s transformation to be an essential part of Portugal\u2019s recent economic recovery.The arrival of deep-pocketed investors and celebrities like Madonna is \u201ccreating housing problems in a few neighborhoods,\u201d said Lu\u00eds Correia da Silva, a director of Dom Pedro, a resort and hotel company.\u201cBut people shouldn\u2019t forget that nobody wanted to do anything to save these same neighborhoods a few years ago,\u201d he added.Portugal had a long history of antagonism toward landowners, dating back to the 1910 revolution that ended the monarchy. Then, during a long military dictatorship, rents were frozen in Lisbon and the northern city of Porto.Fixed rents for new contracts were abolished more than a decade after another revolution, which overthrew the dictatorship in 1974 but not for existing contracts, and downtown Lisbon remained a partly derelict area shunned by locals.When Portugal received its bailout, the inner city had 552,700 inhabitants and 322,865 housing units, of which 50,289 stood vacant, according to the most recent census of 2011. A year later, the new rental law came into force that liberalized the housing market.Politicians sought to lead by example. In 2011, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, who was then mayor of Lisbon, moved his city hall administration from its historic headquarters to a former tile factory building at the corner of Intendente, a square known for drugs and prostitutes.Mr. Costa is now Portugal\u2019s prime minister and Intendente is almost unrecognizable. It has a handicraft shop, cafes and several construction projects in the works. In the center stands a garden, surrounded by red forged-metal barriers designed by Joana Vasconcelos, one of Portugal\u2019s best-known artists.Asked about Lisbon\u2019s transformation, Ms. Vasconcelos said that \u201cthe city is changing fast, but for the better.\u201d\u201cMy impression is that Lisbon is getting back to what it used to be, because this was a multicultural city for centuries, a trading center that was connected to the world,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring a dark period of dictatorship, we lost our way but we\u2019re now back on track.\u201dBut there\u2019s a sad flip side to almost every happy story about Lisbon\u2019s fortunes.Rodrigo Azambuja used to weave traditional Portuguese carpets. In 2013, his landlord raised his rent from \u20ac300 to \u20ac1,200. A few months ago, the landlord told him he needed to be out in July.By August, however, Mr. Azambuja should start getting rental income from a property he bought two years ago, in one of the auctions of derelict buildings held by the city. Rather than making carpets, he will soon be serving wine in a bar that he will open on the ground floor.\u201cI guess that I\u2019m really living both sides of this story,\u201d Mr. Azambuja said. \u201cTo me, the only real drama is that all this change is happening so fast, in a kind of perfect storm, for which many people were completely unprepared.\u201dLuis Mendes, an urban geographer, is a member of a citizens\u2019 platform called Morar em Lisboa (Living in Lisbon) that has been fighting to halt housing evictions. He worries that Lisbon risks \u201ckilling the golden goose\u201d that has made it so attractive to visitors.\u201cIf we\u2019re evicting the old residents and creating gated communities for the wealthy, then what are we going to show tourists who expect to see traditional Portuguese life on our streets?\u201d he asked.Some residents complain a dual economy has emerged, split between those who deal in property and tourism \u2014 and the rest. They also decry the \u201cDisneyfication\u201d of Lisbon, which they see in new shops, like \u201cThe Fantastic World of the Portuguese Sardine,\u201d where tourists can buy a can of fish with their birth year on the label.Far-left politicians want to tighten laws to stop evictions and protect tenants, including those who are over 65 and have lived in their property for more than 25 years.While rules already exist to protect older residents, they are not ironclad.After her husband died, Maria Teresa Alves Ramos Mendes, a 79-year-old seamstress, was told by her landlord that the rent on the apartment where they had lived for more than 30 years would increase several-fold.She consulted lawyers, who warned that she could lose a costly court battle. So she abandoned the place.\u201cI really thought that at my age there was no way that I could be forced out of my home, but I was sadly wrong,\u201d she said.She now lives with her daughter on the outskirts of Lisbon, but the short-term rental market aimed at tourists and developed by companies like Airbnb is spreading even there.Life in upmarket neighborhoods is being hollowed out. In November, Andr\u00e9 J\u00fadice Gl\u00f3ria, a Portuguese lawyer, moved into a new apartment with his wife and two children, in a renovated six-story building.Three Brazilians and two Angolans own the other apartments, but Mr. J\u00fadice Gl\u00f3ria said he barely sees them.\u201cIt\u2019s a first-world problem, but of course this building feels very empty,\u201d he lamented. \u201cIt would have been nice to have some other families around us, people with a real stake in the day-to-day issues of living here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Read the Full Transcript of Trump\u2019s Speech on the Iran Nuclear Deal", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and is preparing to reinstate all sanctions it had waived as part of the accord. The administration is planning to impose additional economic penalties as well.The decision unravels the signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor, President Barack Obama, and isolates the United States from its European allies.The following is a transcript of his announcement, delivered from the Diplomatic Room of the White House.________PRESIDENT TRUMP: My fellow Americans,Today, I want to update the world on our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror. It exports dangerous missiles, fuels conflicts across the Middle East, and supports terrorist proxies and militias such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban and Al Qaeda.Over the years, Iran and its proxies have bombed American Embassies and military installations, murdered hundreds of American service members, and kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured American citizens.The Iranian regime has funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering the wealth of its own people.No action taken by the regime has been more dangerous than its pursuit of nuclear weapons \u2014 and the means of delivering them.In 2015, the previous administration joined with other nations in a deal regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear program. This agreement was known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A.In theory, the so-called \u201cIran deal\u201d was supposed to protect the United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb, a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime.In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and \u2014 over time \u2014 reach the brink of a nuclear breakout.The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for very weak limits on the regime\u2019s nuclear activity \u2014 and no limits at all on its other malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen, and other places all around the world.In other words, at the point when the United States had maximum leverage, this disastrous deal gave this regime \u2014 and it\u2019s a regime of great terror \u2014 many billions of dollars, some of it in actual cash \u2014 a great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the United States.A constructive deal could easily have been struck at the time, but it wasn\u2019t.At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction: that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program.Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie. Last week, Israel published intelligence documents \u2014 long concealed by Iran \u2014 conclusively showing the Iranian regime and its history of pursuing nuclear weapons.The fact is, this was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made. It didn\u2019t bring calm, it didn\u2019t bring peace, and it never will.In the years since the deal was reached, Iran\u2019s military budget has grown by almost 40 percent \u2014 while its economy is doing very badly. After the sanctions were lifted, the dictatorship used its new funds to build its nuclear-capable missiles, support terrorism, and cause havoc throughout the Middle East and beyond.The agreement was so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time. The deal\u2019s sunset provisions are totally unacceptable.If I allowed this deal to stand, there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Everyone would want their weapons ready by the time Iran had theirs.Making matters worse, the deal\u2019s inspection provisions lack adequate mechanisms to prevent, detect, and punish cheating and don\u2019t even have the unqualified right to inspect many important locations, including military facilities. Not only does the deal fail to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, but it also fails to address the regime\u2019s development of ballistic missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads.Finally, the deal does nothing to constrain Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities, including its support for terrorism.Since the agreement, Iran\u2019s bloody ambitions have grown only more brazen. In light of these glaring flaws, I announced last October that the Iran deal must either be renegotiated or terminated.Three months later, on January 12th, I repeated these conditions. I made clear that if the deal could not be fixed, the United States would no longer be a party to the agreement.Over the past few months, we have engaged extensively with our allies and partners around the world, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We have also consulted with our friends from across the Middle East. We are unified in our understanding of the threat and in our conviction that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon.After these consultations, it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement. The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen. In just a short period of time, the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world\u2019s most dangerous weapons.Therefore, I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.In a few moments, I will sign a presidential memorandum to begin reinstating U.S. nuclear sanctions on the Iranian regime. We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail. We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. And we will not allow a regime that chants \u201cDeath to America\u201d to gain access to the most deadly weapons on Earth.Today\u2019s action sends a critical message. The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them. In fact, at this very moment, Secretary Pompeo is on his way to North Korea in preparation for my upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un. Plans are being made, relationships are building. Hopefully, a deal will happen, and with the help of China, South Korea, and Japan, a future of great prosperity and security can be achieved for everyone.As we exit the Iran deal, we will be working with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear threat. This will include efforts to eliminate the threat of Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, to stop its terrorist activities worldwide, and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East.In the meantime, powerful sanction also go into full effect. If the regime continues its its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before. Finally, I want to deliver a message to the long-suffering people of Iran.The people of America stand with you.It has now been almost 40 years since this dictatorship seized power and took a proud nation hostage. Most of Iran\u2019s 80 million citizens have sadly never known an Iran that prospered in peace with its neighbors and commanded the admiration of the world.But the future of Iran belongs to its people. They are the rightful heirs to a rich culture and an ancient land, and they deserve a nation that does justice to their dreams, honor to their history and glory to God.Iran\u2019s leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate a new deal. They refuse, and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019d probably say the same thing if I was in their position. But the fact is, they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people.When they do, I am ready, willing, and able. Great things can happen for Iran. And great things can happen for the peace and stability that we all want in the Middle East. There has been enough suffering, death, and destruction. Let it end now. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you.REPORTER: Mr. President, how does this make America safer? How does this make America safer?TRUMP: Thank you very much. This will make America much safer. Thank you very much.REPORTER: Is Secretary Pompeo bringing the detainees home?TRUMP: Secretary Pompeo is right now going to North Korea. He will be there very shortly, in a matter of virtual \u2014 probably an hour. He\u2019s got meetings set up. We have our meeting scheduled. We have our meeting set. The location is picked. The time and date. Everything is picked. And we look forward to having a very great success. We think relationships are building with North Korea. We\u2019ll see how it all works out. Maybe it will. Maybe it won\u2019t. But it can be a great thing for North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and the entire world. We hope it all works out. Thank you very much.REPORTER: Are the Americans being freed?TRUMP: We\u2019ll all soon be finding out. We will soon be finding out. It would be a great thing if they are. We\u2019ll soon be finding out. Thank you very much.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Keeps Xi Jinping Awake at Night", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 As the leader of the world\u2019s most populous country and biggest communist party, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has plenty to worry about, and a new book sheds light on what probably keeps him up at night.The recent trade dispute between China and the United States has brought new attention to China\u2019s zeal to become technologically self-reliant. The book shows that Mr. Xi was determined that China master its own microchips, operating systems and other core technologies well before this recent quarrel. In two speeches \u2014 in July and August 2013 \u2014 Mr. Xi pointedly said that Western domination came thanks to technology.\u201cAdvanced technology is the sharp weapon of the modern state. An important reason that Western countries were able to hold sway over the world in modern times was that they held the advanced technology. You cannot buy the truly core technologies. It\u2019s been aptly put that \u2018The sharpest weapon of a state should not be revealed.\u2019\u201d\u201cOur technology still generally lags that of developed countries, and we must adopt an asymmetrical strategy of catching up and overtaking, bringing our own advantages to bear. In core technological fields where it would be impossible for us to catch up by 2050, we must research asymmetrical steps to catch up and overtake. Internationally, if you don\u2019t have the advantage of core technologies, you don\u2019t have the political momentum. We must make a big effort in key fields and areas where there is a stranglehold. The same applies to the military.\u201dSince the introduction of the internet, Chinese Communist Party leaders have worried about its deployment as a means of subversion and spying. A speech on propaganda that Mr. Xi gave in August 2013 suggested he was alarmed by the United States\u2019 surveillance capabilities that were exposed by Edward Snowden.\u201cThe internet has become the main battleground of struggle over public opinion. Some comrades have said that the internet is the \u2018biggest variable\u2019 confronting us, and if it\u2019s mishandled it will become a \u2018peril weighing on our minds.\u2019 Western anti-China forces have constantly and vainly tried to exploit the internet to \u2018topple China,\u2019 and years ago some Western politicians declared that \u2018with the internet, we have a way to deal with China\u2019 and \u2018socialist countries will throw themselves into the arms of the West, and it will start from the internet.\u2019 To judge from the United States\u2019 Prism, XKeyscore and other surveillance programs, the capabilities and scale of their internet activities far, far exceed what everyone had imagined. Whether we can stand our ground and win this battle over the internet has a direct bearing on our country\u2019s ideological and political security.\u201dChina has been spending heavily to upgrade its military. In a December 2014 speech, though, Mr. Xi warned Chinese military officials that they risked being eclipsed technologically by the United States.\u201cA new technological and industrial revolution is brewing, a global revolution in military affairs is accelerating, and the pattern of international military competition is experiencing historic changes. The United States is the leader of the pack in this revolution in military affairs, and in many areas it holds the initiative, and it is also striving to gain new advantages in military technology. The United States is accelerating development of global rapid-strike offensive capabilities, and some advanced weaponry has technologically broken through spatiotemporal boundaries. Once they are deployed for actual combat, they will fundamentally transform the traditional array of offense and defense in warfare.\u201dChina\u2019s leadership has become increasingly forthright about the need to defuse financial risks from growing debt, and comments Mr. Xi made in December 2016 explain why.\u201cCurrently, financial risks are volatile and frequent. Although systemic financial risks are generally under control, risks are accumulating from nonperforming assets, liquidity, bond defaults, shadow banks, external shocks, a property bubble, government debt, and internet financing, and the financial markets are also in a mess. Some financial risks are longstanding, lurking sources of infection that are concealed very deep but may erupt in a flash. The United States subprime crisis erupted in a night. If we\u2019re going to have big trouble in the future, it could well be in this area, and this demands high vigilance.\u201dMr. Xi has stepped up the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to reduce smog, soil contamination and other pollution. Remarks that Mr. Xi made in May 2013, when China was in the midst of a smog crisis, showed how alarmed he was about public anger and protests, which Chinese officials call \u201cmass incidents.\u201d\u201cThe public is highly concerned about environmental problems, and the position of ecological issues in the public\u2019s happiness index is inevitably going to become increasingly prominent. As the economy and society develop and as people\u2019s living standards rise, environmental problems are often most liable to trigger mass discontent, and if they\u2019re mishandled they are often most liable to trigger mass incidents.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "There Are Better Ways to Get Around Town", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Massengale is an architect and urban designer.The debate continues over how to make New York City\u2019s streets less crowded, safer and better for people as well as cars. Some, like Gov. Andrew Cuomo, call for congestion pricing in Manhattan, although so far the New York State Legislature has not allowed that. Mayor Bill de Blasio and groups such as Transportation Alternatives promote Vision Zero, aiming for zero traffic deaths in New York City by 2024.It\u2019s worth looking at European cities, which have led the movement to make city streets that are as good for public life as they are for driving. In recent months, I\u2019ve visited four of the cities with the most innovative street designs: London, Stockholm, Amsterdam and Copenhagen.London and Stockholm were the first major European cities to have congestion zones, and Sweden also gave us Vision Zero. Amsterdam and Copenhagen are the cycling capitals of Europe, although they have taken different approaches to making places for cycling and walking.We can use the best of their ideas in New York \u2014 and indeed in other American cities \u2014 to reduce driving, air pollution and traffic deaths, and make streets where people want to get out of their cars and walk.Amsterdam \u2014 Speed Kills and Shared SpaceAmerican traffic laws require pedestrians to cross most streets in marked crosswalks, and painted and protected bike lanes are all the rage in United States cities today. But in Amsterdam, walkers, bike riders and drivers share the streets. Any pedestrian or cyclist may legally walk or ride anywhere on a vast majority of the streets in the center of the city.These \u201cshared spaces\u201d evolved after the 1950s and 1960s, when the Dutch economy boomed after decades of hardship and cars overwhelmed Amsterdam\u2019s streets. In 1954, the Amsterdam police chief, Hendrik Kaasjager, proposed paving over several canals and a part of the harbor to make more room for cars.Amsterdammers fought back. The city had been a cycling capital since the early 20th century. By the 1920s, more than 80 percent of city trips were made on bicycles, but increases in automobile traffic in the decades after World War II led to many conflicts and collisions on the small streets. Traffic deaths in the Netherlands rose to a peak of 3,300 in 1971, including 400 children. So Amsterdam\u2019s urban designers transformed entire streets \u2014 all the space between the buildings, in other words \u2014 into unified \u201cpublic realms\u201d for city life.In changing thoroughfares into shared places, Dutch designers and engineers learned three lessons:1. When drivers slow down to 20 m.p.h. or below, they are less likely to hit people and much less likely to seriously injure or kill people if they do hit them.2. The best way to slow cars down is to throw away all the techniques that traffic engineers developed to make traffic flow quickly.3. When you throw out all the detritus of traffic engineering, it becomes much easier to make beautiful places where people want to walk. Bike riding becomes more pleasant and safer as well.Some old-school traffic engineers in America will tell you that many of the Dutch ideas are unsafe. What they mean is that they make streets unsafe for fast driving. In 2016, the Netherlands had 33 traffic deaths for every million people. America had 118 traffic deaths per million.The Copenhagen LaneLike Amsterdam, Copenhagen in the 1960s had a strong culture of cycling threatened by a booming economy that filled its streets with cars and trucks. In response, Copenhagen went in a different direction than Amsterdam, making some roads in the center car-free while rebuilding major thoroughfares to give pedestrians and bicycles equal access to the city.Copenhagen\u2019s planners thought it was both unsafe and uncivilized to allow city traffic to go faster than 30 m.p.h., so they designed streets that naturally held cars to that speed \u2014 by narrowing the traffic lanes and keeping the streets two-way.They used the extra space between the buildings for wider sidewalks and broad bike lanes, and they designed the wider sidewalks and new cycle lanes to separate the pedestrians and cyclists from the cars.Typically, the bicycle lanes were a little higher than the roadway but a little lower than the sidewalk. The slight level changes, low curbs and subtle paving patterns physically and visually separated the different areas. Frequently, the designs gave as much or more of the space to the use of pedestrians and cyclists as to motor vehicles.When American engineers started adding bike lanes to American streets about a decade ago, they changed the model, creating a \u201cprotected\u201d bicycle lane once misleadingly called \u201cthe Copenhagen lane.\u201dWe see examples on many Manhattan avenues, with parked cars sitting awkwardly between moving traffic and grossly striped bike lanes. Every planner and urban designer I\u2019ve talked to in Denmark and the Netherlands says their countries would never build such ugly, over-engineered streets, which diminish the pedestrian experience and give high priority to traffic flow at 35 m.p.h. and above.London and Stockholm \u2014 Reducing TrafficLondon and Stockholm came to the problem of making streets for people later than Amsterdam and Copenhagen. As they grew rich in the late 20th century, both cities built urban highways to speed cars in and out, rebuilt city streets to make traffic flow faster and turned city squares into parking lots for the new traffic.But by the early 21st century, congested streets, traffic deaths, air pollution and new ideas about climate change persuaded city leaders they needed a faster fix than the decades-long evolution of policies and designs Amsterdam and Copenhagen went through.In 2003, London became the first major European city to introduce a congestion zone. Stockholm followed three years later. Today, both cities have less traffic, quieter streets, cleaner air and fewer traffic deaths.Voters in both cities have given the changes strong support. The former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, who introduced the congestion zone, says it\u2019s the only thing in his political career that \u201cturned out better than I expected.\u201dStockholm had a similar but different experience. Facing public opposition, it held a seven-month trial in 2006. A few months later, a public referendum made the plan permanent.Stockholm has a congestion zone with variable pricing based on demand; London has a flat rate that allows multiple entries in a single day. After more than 10 years, Stockholm\u2019s system has proved more effective. London, one of the most expensive cities in the world, has too many people who simply pay the flat fee, which has been raised over time but not enough. London also shares New York\u2019s problem of congestion caused by Uber.But planners, engineers and urban designers in London and Stockholm have used the eventual popularity of the congestion zone and the public focus on better streets to jump-start new designs for shared space, pedestrian streets and cycle lanes. New York can do that too.New York, New Amsterdam\u201cWe\u2019re not Amsterdam\u201d is something people like me who work for better streets in America sometimes hear. Everyone reading this grew up in the age of the automobile, but in Manhattan and many other cities and towns around the country, walking is the new driving, and we\u2019re ready for something different.CitiBike is the largest bike share system in America. Almost 80 percent of Manhattanites don\u2019t own a car, and that percentage increases every year. Eighty-two percent of New York City residents support Vision Zero, with good reason: Pedestrian deaths have gone down every year since the city began Vision Zero work, and last year there were 32 percent fewer than in the previous year.The number of bicycling deaths has gone up, however, because more people are cycling. And while the protected bike lanes on Manhattan\u2019s avenues are a step forward, they are still a compromise, with too much emphasis on traffic flow. The new design for transportation corridors with bike lanes introduced left-turn lanes all over the island, and those are dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists alike.New York City\u2019s Department of Transportation has led the American movement for better streets. But as long as we build streets that encourage people to drive into the city and to move around it at 35 m.p.h., we will never get to zero deaths. Our streets are safer, but they\u2019re not safe. They are part of an American driving culture that produced 40,000 traffic deaths last year.The next step is to adopt congestion pricing below 96th Street in Manhattan and then:1. Decrease the number of Manhattan streets that function as transportation corridors primarily devoted to moving machines through the city.2. Design and build Slow Zones where people actually drive slowly.3. Make the transportation corridors that remain better urban places, with a better balance between city life and moving cars.Manhattan real estate is too valuable and rare to devote a majority of public space to moving traffic. History \u2014 including our own \u2014 shows that if we make our city streets easy and safe for speeding cars, we will attract so many cars that the streets will be crowded, polluted and unsafe. European cities show that if we build streets for people, we will get better places for everyone.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described a statistic about Dutch traffic deaths in 1971. The 3,300 deaths occurred in the Netherlands as a whole, not solely in Amsterdam.John Massengale, an architect and urban designer, was the founding chairman of the New York chapter of the Congress for the New Urbanism. He is a co-author of \u201cStreet Design: The Secret to Great Cities and Towns\u201d and of \u201cNew York 1900: Metropolitan Architecture and Urbanism 1890-1915.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Gaza Teeters on Precipice, a Hamas Leader Speaks Out", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGAZA CITY \u2014 With a climactic confrontation expected days from now at the fence separating the Gaza Strip from Israel, where Palestinians have been demonstrating for weeks, Yehya Sinwar, the leader in Gaza of Hamas, the militant group that rules the territory, offered little hope for a bloodless encounter.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with hundreds of thousands of people parading through a fence that\u2019s not a border?\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with an influx like that?\u201dMr. Sinwar offered lip service to nonviolence, saying he hoped that the presence of international journalists would constrain Israeli soldiers from massacring people who crossed the fence. But he demurred when asked if he would urge protesters to refrain from trying to cross the fence, as hundreds of others have tried with often fatal results. Since the demonstration began on March 30, 47 people have been killed and nearly 7,000 wounded.The protests are expected to peak on Monday, when the United States formally moves its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, and on Tuesday, the 70th anniversary of what Palestinians call the Nakba, or catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands of them fled or were expelled from their homes in what became Israel.In what was believed to be his first news conference as the leader of Hamas in Gaza, at least with foreign journalists, the press-shy Mr. Sinwar, who took over in February 2017, seemed to vacillate in tone between openness and moderation on the one hand, and vaguely menacing defiance on the other.Here is a look at his key points.Gaza has been under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since 2007, when Hamas seized power from the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority. The blockade strictly limits the flow of people and cargo in and out of Gaza. Under added pressure from Mahmoud Abbas, the authority\u2019s president, Gaza has suffered severe shortages of electricity and widespread layoffs that have sent its economy into a free-fall.\u201cIt\u2019s something Palestinians can\u2019t put up with anymore,\u201d Mr. Sinwar said. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that we would continue dying slowly.\u201dMr. Sinwar, who was serving multiple life sentences for the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers before being released in a controversial prisoner exchange in 2011, said the siege was worse than jail.\u201cI lived 25 years, almost half my life, in Israeli prisons,\u201d he said in Arabic through an interpreter. \u201cLiving in those small rooms was much easier than living the way life is now run in Gaza.\u201d He said that it affected even his own young child: \u201cThe first words my son spoke were \u2018father,\u2019 \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018drone.\u2019\u201d\u201cBut not one single bullet was shot at the Israeli forces. Not one rocket was fired.\u201dHe ridiculed Israeli accusations that the protesters have included members of the military wing of Hamas. \u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs it better that they launch rockets, or go to a peaceful march and end up being killed by armed-to-the-teeth Israeli soldiers?\u201dMr. Sinwar insisted that protesters \u201cpose no life threat to anyone, even the soldiers on the other side.\u201dYet in the next breath Mr. Sinwar likened Gaza residents to a \u201cvery hungry tiger, kept in a cage, starved, whom the Israelis have been trying to humiliate. Now it\u2019s on the loose, it\u2019s left its cage, and no one knows where it\u2019s heading or what it\u2019s going to do.At other points he compared Gaza to a time bomb likely to explode at any moment.Mr. Sinwar was frank in acknowledging what he called the \u201cpower imbalance\u201d between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as a changed Middle East in which the Palestinian cause has diminished in importance compared with geopolitical concerns like the spread of Iranian influence.Given all that, he said: \u201cWe believe that if we have a way to potentially resolve the conflict without destruction, we\u2019re O.K. with that. We want to invest in peace and love.\u201dMr. Sinwar noted that he had some success with nonviolent protests in his Israeli prison, where he led hunger strikes to obtain better food and medical care and even to allow prisoners access to pens and paper.\u201cWhen we went on hunger strikes, the Israelis approached us,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the same thing: We Palestinians are coming out in droves, looking for compromise, so there should be negotiations.\u201dHamas is not giving up its arsenal of rockets, however. \u201cWe would prefer to earn our rights by soft and peaceful means,\u201d Mr. Sinwar said. \u201cBut we understand that if we are not given those rights, we are entitled to earn them by resistance.\u201dMr. Sinwar pushed hard for reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah, the Palestinian faction that dominates the Palestinian Authority, led by Mr. Abbas, in the West Bank. Hamas made a number of major concessions, but Mr. Sinwar said it had received little in return, and he conceded that the opening for a successful unification had narrowed considerably.Yet he insisted that, because the decision to pursue reconciliation was made as a group, his standing within Hamas had not suffered as a result. And he argued that, to the contrary, the protests had promoted the idea of reconciliation by uniting Palestinians of all factions against a common enemy, Israel.\u201cVisiting different encampments I was hugged, people kissed my hand,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d tell me they\u2019re Fatah affiliates, yet they have the utmost love and respect for me.\u201d The protests, he said, were \u201chelping us reorganize our priorities: Instead of blaming each other, we\u2019re expressing our anger at the root cause.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s Embattled Democracy", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bal is a journalist.NEW DELHI \u2014 A fair and independent electoral process, an independent judiciary, a Parliament with a noisy opposition, a relatively free press and an army that has stayed away from politics have defined India since it adopted its Constitution in 1950.India stood apart in the developing world as a country where the Constitution served as the basis for the operations of the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. But it has taken just four years of the Bharatiya Janata Party government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the country to realize how fragile that achievement was, how close it has come to being subverted.India has a fairly decentralized system of governance. States are governed by chief ministers, who are the elected leaders of a political party or a coalition of parties that has a majority of the seats in a state assembly. An Indian state also has a governor, a federal appointee holding a ceremonial, nonpartisan, constitutional position. After an election, the governor invites the party or the coalition that won the most seats to form the government.Instead, Mr. Vala demonstrated his loyalty to Mr. Modi by asking the B.J.P. to form the government. The Indian Supreme Court had to intervene so that a basic task of a democracy could be accomplished: letting the alliance that had a clear majority form a government.The B.J.P. has a strong majority and the no-confidence motion posed no threat \u2014 except that during the nationally televised debate, the opposition would point out the failures of Mr. Modi\u2019s economic policies.Despite the partial opening of the Indian economy the annual budget still has an oversize impact. Lawmakers discuss the allocations for health, education and the like for weeks. If the parliamentary session is ending, the allocations that haven\u2019t been approved yet are consolidated and voted on in a procedure called the \u201cguillotine.\u201dThe desire of Mr. Modi\u2019s government to ensure that the core democratic institutions function not as they are meant to but as it desires has even affected the esteemed Supreme Court. Cases there are decided by two or more judges assigned by the chief justice.Even the Election Commission of India, which had a reputation of overseeing free and fair elections, has faced allegations of modifying election dates to favor Mr. Modi. Unsurprisingly, the commission, until early this year, was headed by a bureaucrat who worked closely with Mr. Modi when he was the chief minister of Gujarat.And further, the Indian news media, with a few respectable exceptions, has turned into cheerleaders for Mr. Modi and his politics. Most of the press not only ignores critical reporting but also actively spins the news to favor the government. The spin resonates with the large segment of Indian society invested in Mr. Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist politics.As India prepares for the national elections next year, Mr. Modi\u2019s ratings are falling. And there is a sense of alarm: If Mr. Modi was willing to drown dissent and subvert national institutions when his government enjoyed popular support, how far down an undemocratic path might he and his party go to ensure a victory?A previous version of this essay misstated how many Supreme Court judges decide cases. Cases are decided by two or more judges, not by a single judge.Hartosh Singh Bal, the author of \u201cWaters Close Over Us: A Journey Along the Narmada,\u201d is the political editor of The Caravan magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Feels Pride but Senses Peril as U.S. Moves Embassy", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 When Israel declared its independence in 1948, President Harry Truman rushed to recognize it. He took just 11 minutes, and Israelis, about to go to war to defend their infant state, were euphoric.Seventy years to the day \u2014 and nearly as long since Israel declared the holy city of Jerusalem its \u201ceternal capital\u201d \u2014 the United States will formally open its embassy on a hilltop here two miles south of the Western Wall.Israelis find it hard to rejoice when they find themselves doing some of the same things they did back in 1948: listening for civil-defense sirens, readying bomb shelters and calling in reinforcements to confront threats to the north, south and east.Now, in East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, Israeli border police and troops are bracing for expressions of pent-up frustration, impatience and rage \u2014 at the United States for seeming to dispense with any pretense at balance; at Israel for its continuing occupation; at the Palestinian Authority for its weakness and corruption; and at the peace process itself, for inspiring hopes that have again and again proved false.\u201cIf you look at it from the outside, you\u2019d see one of the most dramatic success stories of the 20th century,\u201d said the historian Tom Segev, author of a new biography of Israel\u2019s founding prime minister, \u201cDavid Ben-Gurion: A State at All Costs.\u201dWith Israel so strong and its Jewish population larger than ever, Mr. Segev said, \u201cIt\u2019s really the realization of Ben-Gurion\u2019s dream. But at the same time, the future is very bleak, and some of the problems he left us remain unresolved.\u201dIt is hard for Israeli Jews to feel entirely at ease when they remain so estranged from one another and the nearly two million Arab citizens at home, and from millions of people next door: A lasting settlement with the Palestinians seems as elusive as it has been in more than a generation.However besieged many Israelis may feel, objectively Israel has never been more powerful, in almost any sense of the word.Warming relations with Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states are even buoying hopes that Israel could begin to expand its tiny circle of friends in the region.Monday\u2019s move of the American mission to a fortified former consulate along the seam between East and West Jerusalem, from a beachfront bastion in Tel Aviv, is freighted with symbolism in manifold ways.Many Israelis see the relocation of the embassy as simply acknowledging that Jerusalem is Israel\u2019s capital. But Palestinians, who hope to see the eastern part of Jerusalem become the capital of a Palestinian state, see the move as an abdication of any vestige of American impartiality in determining the region\u2019s future.The relocation of the chief American outpost from liberal Tel Aviv, a blue dot on the red political map of Israel, to a capital city that has largely replaced its secular Israeli population with a more religious one, neatly mirrors what is happening to support for Israel in the United States.President Trump has gone further than perhaps any of his predecessors to support Israel and its right-wing leader, and no American president has done more to bestow gifts on an Israeli leader than he has.Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and a senior adviser on the Middle East, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are among the high-ranking representatives sent by the administration to attend Monday\u2019s opening ceremony. Israel said all 86 countries with diplomatic missions in the country were invited to the event, and 33 confirmed attendance.To Palestinians, the official unveiling of the embassy is just the most concrete and latest in a cavalcade of provocations from Washington and the Israeli government.\u201cIt\u2019s might makes right,\u201d said Hind Khoury, a former diplomat for the Palestine Liberation Organization who now heads a sustainable development nonprofit based in Bethlehem. Not only are Palestinians now expected to forget about Jerusalem, she said, but also the losses of their homes in 1948 and again in the fighting of 1967.\u201cAccept Israel\u2019s presence and dominance,\u201d she said. \u201cAccept home demolitions and expulsions and dispossession.\u201cAccept the uprooting of our olive trees, the violence of settlers,\u201d she continued, picking up steam. \u201cAccept settlements. Accept Israel\u2019s control of all the Jordan Valley, and using it for its economic benefit. Accept that Israel didn\u2019t live up to any of its commitments. Accept the siege of Gaza. Accept that East Jerusalem doesn\u2019t belong to us anymore. Accept the racist legislation that Israel passes; that we\u2019re prisoners in our land: I can\u2019t get a visa because we\u2019re \u2018all terrorists.\u2019 Accept the use of \u2018anti-Semitism\u2019 to fight anybody who wants to support Palestinian rights.\u201d\u201cThese are things we have to accept, or we\u2019ll just get more hell,\u201d she said, before adding: \u201cMaybe I speak more like a mother and grandmother, but it\u2019s so sinful to give such a legacy to the next generation.\u201dFor Israeli Jews, a different set of grievances is being assuaged and activated by Monday\u2019s embassy opening and all it stirs up.The American-Israeli author Yossi Klein Halevi, whose new book \u201cLetters to My Palestinian Neighbor\u201d is being published on Tuesday, sees the embassy move as a \u201crare moment of compensation\u201d for what he called \u201cthe campaign to deny any Jewish connection to Jerusalem\u201d \u2014 one expressed in votes of Unesco, or in the speeches of Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, when he invokes the Christian and Muslim attachment to Jerusalem but pointedly omits any Jewish one.\u201cThere\u2019s this deep resentment among Israelis about the war against our history and our rootedness in this city,\u201d Mr. Halevi said.Still, noting that his book \u201cabout reconciliation with my Palestinian neighbors is coming out at one of the worst moments in the tortured history of our relationship,\u201d Mr. Halevi said he wished the embassy move could be accompanied by some kind of \u201caffirmation by both Israel and the United States of the Palestinian presence in the city we share.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be laying out blueprints,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re far from that. But there should be a clear stating of our recognition that we\u2019re not alone in Jerusalem. This would be an apt moment for a generous Israeli statement.\u201dMr. Netanyahu\u2019s advocacy against the Iran deal during the Obama administration did much to sour Jewish Democrats on the Israeli leader. His abandonment of a painstakingly negotiated deal to give Reform and Conservative Jews a bigger stake in Jewish life in Israel, and approval of a measure granting the Orthodox chief rabbinate\u2019s monopoly over conversions to Judaism in Israel, drove a wedge between liberal American Jews and Israeli religious leaders.Other policies, like efforts to deport African migrants, and a continuing legislative attack by Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s political allies on democratic institutions like Israel\u2019s Supreme Court, have only added to many liberal Americans\u2019 discomfort with Israel.In effect, as the Trump administration gives physical expression to its affection for Israel, a rift appears to be widening between the world\u2019s two main centers of Jewish life.The immediate threats to Israeli security could of course fizzle. The rift between American and Israeli Jews could heal with a new administration in either place, if not before. Even the risk posed by the embassy move could prove no more dampening to the celebration, in retrospect, than the smashing of a glass at a Jewish wedding.And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Middle East peace process \u201cis most decidedly not dead,\u201d despite the embassy move, telling \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the United States still hopes to be able to \u201cachieve a successful outcome\u201d to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Mr. Segev, the biographer, said he had learned in his research that Ben-Gurion had never cared much for Jerusalem, and had refrained from trying to take the city in 1948 in part because he knew it would be difficult to guard its Old City from extremists.In that sense, Mr. Segev said, little seems to have changed.\u201cThat\u2019s what Jerusalem is all about,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s been a problem the last 3,000 years. And it may be a problem for the next 3,000 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Denies Reaching Deal With China on ZTE", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump declared on Tuesday that he was not happy with how recent trade talks with China had gone, and said the United States had not reached a deal to suspend penalties on the Chinese telecom firm ZTE, disputing reports that the administration had decided to go easy on the company in return for trade concessions.\u201cThere is no deal. We will see what happens,\u201d Mr. Trump said in response to reporters\u2019 questions about ZTE during a meeting with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. Mr. Trump, when asked if he was happy with how recent trade meetings with China went, responded: \u201cNo, not really. I think that they\u2019re a start.\u201d\u201cChina has made a fortune,\u201d Mr. Trump said, just hours after his closest advisers had last gone on television to promote the success of the recent trade talks. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied, but we have a long way to go,\u201d he said.It was the latest turn in a bewildering negotiating process that has sent the president vacillating between taking a tough stance on China and saying he would try to help the country recover lost jobs. There has been no greater source of confusion than the future of ZTE. The company\u2019s fate hangs in the balance as long as penalties levied by the Trump administration prevent it from buying much-needed American components for its phones.ZTE\u2019s fate has quickly become a sticking point in negotiations with China. Lawmakers and national security officials have been concerned that the administration would ease restrictions on the company after Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion in a Twitter message on May 13 that he was working with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to give ZTE \u201ca way to get back into business, fast.\u201d Recent reports from people familiar with the trade negotiations also indicated that an informal pact of some sort had been struck.Although he denied that a deal had been reached, Mr. Trump still left the door open for a potential future agreement on ZTE, saying on Tuesday that he envisioned an outcome in which the company would be able to buy American products again in return for a fine of more than a billion dollars, strict security rules and replacing its board.\u201cAs a favor to the president, I am absolutely taking a look at it,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to Mr. Xi.The idea of pardoning ZTE, which was punished for breaking American sanctions against countries including Iran and North Korea, has prompted a backlash from many within Mr. Trump\u2019s own administration, as well as lawmakers from across the political spectrum. On Tuesday, senators took steps to limit Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to ease restrictions on ZTE, approving an amendment offered by Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, that would block the president from pardoning the company without first confirming to Congress that it was no longer violating the law.Also on Tuesday, a bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to key trade officials in the administration urging them to protect national security interests during the China trade negotiations, including by rejecting China\u2019s requests to open up transfers of military technologies and not lifting penalties on ZTE.\u201cExport control and sanctions laws should not be negotiable, because fidelity to the rule of law is a key part of what distinguishes the U.S. from a country like China that is ruled by a Communist dictatorship,\u201d the letter said.The president\u2019s approach to the negotiations has left many China hawks flummoxed. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and a longtime critic of China\u2019s economic practices, urged Mr. Trump in a letter on Tuesday to \u201cnot make the same mistakes as previous administrations\u201d by failing to secure commitments from the Chinese to make structural changes to the countries\u2019 trading relationship.\u201cChina is skilled at engaging in dialogue without making meaningful commitments or following through on promises that are made,\u201d Mr. Brown warned.The changes Mr. Brown pushed in the letter include tighter federal oversight of Chinese investments in the United States, an agreement between the countries to reform the World Trade Organization to ensure better protections for American workers and the dismantling of Chinese policies that support its domestic industries.\u201cThere are certain conditions that we want, and I think we\u2019ll get those conditions,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t have the meeting.\u201dSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that the United States was not willing to revisit the penalties on ZTE. But Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, said the company\u2019s path to revival existed, although it ran through \u201cvery, very tough\u201d punitive measures, including fines, compliance measures, and changes in management and board membership.Raymond Zhong contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump to Iran: America\u2019s Word is Worthless", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistOnly Trump can believe that makes sense. But believe it he does, with a vengeance. From Day 1, it has been the deal Trump loves to hate. He knows who authorized it: Barack Obama. Whether he knows its content is another matter.The nuclear accord, reached in 2015, was a watershed. It was not intended to end Iranian-American enmity, virulent since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but it did dent dangerous confrontation through dialogue.It was a gamble on drawing Iran, a hopeful and highly educated society, closer to the world and so weakening the Islamic Republic\u2019s hard-liners. It was not about Iranian interference in neighboring Arab states or about its ballistic missile program. It concerned centrifuges and Iran\u2019s clear but never avowed quest for a nuclear bomb.It was not \u201ca horrible, one-sided deal,\u201d as Trump grotesquely claimed on Tuesday. It was not about delivering \u201cpeace,\u201d as he absurdly suggested. It was not a \u201crotten structure,\u201d as he emptily claimed.It was a painful compromise where each side got less than it wanted: Iran a cash windfall, potential reintegration in the global economy and partial lifting of sanctions; the other signatories, including France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China, a bulwark against a Middle Eastern nuclear arms race. That\u2019s what diplomacy is about: imperfect solutions, arrived at between enemies, that are better than the alternatives, the worst of them all being war.Iran remains a repressive and disruptive regime, with a hideous human rights record, that has jailed several Americans since the deal, pursuing interests opposed to the United States in Syria, and underwriting Hezbollah. The nuclear deal was concluded in full knowledge of the Islamic Republic\u2019s character, perhaps with the hope of tempering Iranian behavior over time, but never with any illusion that Iran would suddenly reinvent itself.Yet this is what the Trump administration has demanded. America has made a mockery of the value of its signature on an international agreement. The world will take note.Nothing in Trump\u2019s speech was more scurrilous than this very Orwellian inversion of the truth: \u201cIf I allowed this deal to stand, there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Everyone would want their weapons ready by the time Iran had theirs.\u201d In fact, Trump has single-handedly fast-forwarded that race by removing the constraints the deal imposed on Iran.What are the president\u2019s alternatives now? Prodded by his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, Trump apparently believes he can bring Iran to its knees, perhaps even precipitate regime change, through new and restored sanctions. At the least he wants a broader, longer-term deal than the one he\u2019s ripping up. All that\u2019s a pipe dream.Iran is not North Korea. Braggadocio will get Trump nowhere with a proud nation used to working around the cost of confrontation with the United States. The diplomatic unity of purpose that led Iran to acquiesce to the deal in 2015 is now frayed. European allies are angered, Russia and China certain to push their own agendas. Iran\u2019s economy is strained, and there are strong internal political tensions, but the 39-year-old Islamic Republic is resilient. Angered, it will not fold.In truth, Trump was led to this decision not by any serious calculus about the deal, but by his susceptibility to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi fury at Iran, the pressure of conservative American Jews who support him and his iron principle that whatever Obama did must be bad. He succumbed to Iran derangement syndrome, a well-known American condition.In an interview in Riyadh, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, told me the deal was bad from the outset, and \u201cWe want to make sure that there is something in place that prevents Iran from ever going nuclear.\u201dHe continued: \u201cWe want Iran to be a good neighbor. We want Iran to comply with international law. We want Iran to stop interfering in the affairs of Arab countries. We want Iran to stop supporting terrorists. We want Iran to stop harboring terrorists. We want Iran to stop attacking our embassies, to stop killing our diplomats. We want Iran to not give ballistic missiles to terrorist groups. Simple. Once they do it, it\u2019s a different Iran.\u201dBut nothing with Iran is simple. The question has always been: Do you change Iran by isolating it or by engaging it step by step? The nuclear deal was a possible starting point in engagement, and it had immense value in itself because it kept Iran much further from the bomb that would lead the Saudis and others to go the same route.Now all that has been thrown up in the air by Trump. Through an act of utter petulance, he has done a grave disservice to American interests and alliances.I saw Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, in New York last month. He said the deal \u2014 \u201ca conscious decision not to deal with everything\u201d \u2014 could have been \u201cthe beginning of a new type of engagement.\u201d Instead, Iran may now restart those centrifuges and race for a bomb.Perhaps something can be salvaged by European powers. I doubt it. Trump has done what he likes to do: express his anger, break things and hope for the best. His Iran decision is a reckless gamble, even by his standards, the shredding of a singular diplomatic achievement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canadian Government to Buy Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain Pipeline", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 The Canadian government on Tuesday said it would buy an oil pipeline to the country\u2019s west coast, ensuring that its widely protested expansion will go forward.Environmentalists and some indigenous groups have strongly opposed the expansion of the pipeline, citing environmental concerns. The province of British Columbia is trying to block it in the courts.But the oil industry and the Alberta government argue that the expansion would bring needed jobs and help the economy.The purchase of the pipeline, for 4.5 billion Canadian dollars, puts the government squarely on the side of the oil industry.Over the past few years the pipeline has prompted large protests in British Columbia, and dozens of people have been arrested for breaking a court order limiting demonstrations near Kinder Morgan\u2019s tanker terminal in Burnaby, British Columbia.John Horgan, the premier of British Columbia, said the province would not back down from its court action challenging the federal government\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction.\u201cToday\u2019s announcement by the federal government does not reduce the risk of a diluted bitumen spill,\u201d Mr. Horgan said at a news conference, using the technical name for the petroleum from oil sands. \u201cI will continue to do my best to protect B.C.\u2019s interests.\u201dThe expansion will put a second pipeline alongside about 610 miles of the 715-mile Trans Mountain pipeline, which opened in 1953. It will increase the system\u2019s capacity to 890,000 barrels a day, from 300,000, at a cost of $7.4 billion.Most of the oil sent through the Trans Mountain pipeline heads to the United States either through a spur pipeline or aboard tankers. Supporters of the expansion argue that it will open Asia as a second market for Canadian oil.Mr. Horgan\u2019s opposition to the pipeline appears rooted, at least partly, in political calculations in British Columbia. His government needs the support of three lawmakers from British Columbia\u2019s Green Party to stay in power. They all adamantly oppose the pipeline.British Columbia\u2019s opposition led Kinder Morgan to suspend nonessential spending on Trans Mountain last month. The company also said it would give up on the expansion if British Columbia did not stop its efforts to halt the plan by this Thursday.Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, has fired back at Mr. Horgan. She briefly stopped wine imports from British Columbia and this month signed a law allowing her government to suspend oil and gas supplies to its neighbor, a move British Columbia is also contesting in court.On Tuesday, Ms. Notley appeared to take credit for the action by Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government.\u201cWe said we would get the pipeline built and we are getting it built,\u201d she said in Edmonton, wearing a button supporting the project and surrounded by members of her caucus. \u201cThis deal and this pipeline will unlock investment in our oil sands.\u201dMr. Morneau, the federal finance minister, said the government would eventually sell the pipeline, in its expanded form, back to the private sector. The government has suggested that it might even turn a profit.Polls indicate that Canadians over all are split about the pipeline and the expansion plan.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals currently enjoy considerable support in the Vancouver area, but his party has long been unpopular in Alberta \u2014 a bastion of conservative politics in Canada, Ms. Notley\u2019s left-of-center government notwithstanding.Keith D. Brownsey, a professor of political science at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, said he expected the Liberals might lose seats in British Columbia in next year\u2019s election because of the Trans Mountain deal.But he said the decision to buy the pipeline will benefit the party on the whole, particularly when combined with its climate remediation steps and its strengthening of environmental oversight of proposed energy projects.\u201cMr. Trudeau has probably saved his political career,\u201d Mr. Brownsey said. \u201cYou may or may not agree with getting more oil to market. But what good is the federal government if they can\u2019t expand an existing pipeline along an existing right of way? He can now say the federal government has done something.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that most Canadian oil is sent to the United States by ship. Generally speaking, only oil sent through the Trans Mountain pipeline is sent by ship to the United States.Follow Ian Austen on Twitter: @ianrausten.Advertisement"}

In fact, Germany is moving at full speed with a plan to channel those refugees into its work force. Germany\u2019s political class is doing the country an egregious disfavor by soft-pedaling its muscular, state-of-the-art efforts in labor market integration.The number of refugee arrivals has fallen dramatically since the 2015 peak, when nearly 900,000 people seeking political asylum crossed the border. New, ever more restrictive measures pared the number down to 280,000 in 2016, and then to 186,600 last year. Germany\u2019s net immigration in 2016 was 500,000 people, from the European Union and elsewhere.There\u2019s a rub, though: This sort of rapid, large-scale labor-force integration has never been done before, which makes Germany a giant laboratory for what could well be the future of the European work force. The plan is to teach refugees the German language and cultural norms, and then the skills necessary to join German workers in factories and hospitals. Overall, Germany plans to spend 3.2 billion euros, or about $3.8 billion, a year on integration.The stakes are high.The challenge involves more than just scale. Poor language skills, insufficient qualifications, cultural alienation, discrimination, bureaucracy and uncertain legal provisions have thrown up barriers that require constant rethinking and adjustment.Germany did not set out to solve these challenges with one omnibus policy. Rather, since 2015 it has been going in pieces, in a trial-and-error method.Among the changes have been a relaxing of asylum rules for hardworking, competent newcomers to stay in Germany and learn a trade, even if they fail to qualify for official refugee status. And now asylum seekers can enter the work force just three months after arrival.Another step has been to beef up language and cultural orientation courses. Though offered by the federal migration and refugee office for years, the curriculums have been revamped and are now available to most newcomers, not just those who are officially recognized as refugees, as in the past. Today 20,000 teachers offer classes at 8,800 locations across the country. According to the latest available data, from 2016, 340,000 people registered for the courses.In the 100-hour orientation class, migrants learn the basics of Germany \u2014 its culture, laws, history, the quirks of daily life. If they pass the exam, they can get a fast-track toward naturalization and, eventually, citizenship. After 600 to 1,200 hours of language instruction (and an exam), refugees have an intermediate grasp of German and can then start working or training.Some do, and Germany has smoothed the way for refugees to enter apprenticeships, remain in them and then be hired. In the past, refugees\u2019 uncertain status worked against them by making it pointless for businesses to train and hire them. If their application for protection was rejected, they could be on the next plane home \u2014 rendering the investment worthless.The new framework ensures that refugees can legally remain in Germany for three years of training and another two as employees. Once in their jobs, they can usually extend their residency permits for much longer.Even today, though, it\u2019s not quite as easy as it sounds, or as it should be. The cultural clefts run deep, and language skills are often still shaky after the basic course. Sometimes the federal bureaucracy undermines even the most straightforward application process. Trainees grow frustrated and drop out.To supplement the government, many hundreds of churches, nonprofits and private companies have developed an array of bridge projects that give migrants a boost: internships, legal advice, literacy programs, classroom courses, mentoring, retraining, skill assessments for those without degrees, on-the-job counseling, coaching for women and youth, and professionally oriented language classes.Public and private funds, for example, pay the bill for a program called Welcome by Friends \u2014 Alliances for Young Refugees, which supports 226 local governments that provide additional language classes, workshops and counseling to immigrant children and teenagers. In gastronomy and other fields, they offer special vocational courses just for migrants, some of them lasting for four years and taken parallel with advanced language instruction.Those are promising percentages, but the numbers are still just a fraction of where they should be, translating to just 27,678 refugees. The labor market integration of today\u2019s refugees is achievable, but it\u2019s a lengthy, labor-intensive, costly endeavor.Economists say that a plausible best-case scenario is 50 percent or 60 percent of the current refugee population being employed five years from now \u2014 a prediction contingent on successful integration. If this happens, economists say that Germany can accommodate a net migration of about 700,000 people a year.Germany is in a bind of its own making \u2014 for too long it both failed to promote birthrates at home and maintained low rates of migration from abroad. And it\u2019s not enough to quietly roll out these initiatives. To get true public support, the country\u2019s leaders have to change the public conversation from one that fears migrants to one that sees how integration can help everyone.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of an online education program in Germany that works with refugees. It is Kiron Open Higher Education, not Kiron University.Paul Hockenos is the author, most recently, of \u201cBerlin Calling: A Story of Anarchy, Music, the Wall, and the Birth of the New Berlin.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Future of the American Left", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistThe Republicans seem to be turning themselves into an aging minority party. Moderate Democrats are no longer a force. There are only two vibrant political tendencies in America right now: Trumpian populism and Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren-style progressivism. As Trumpism loses, progressivism will win.What can we say about the coming progressive regime? First, it will be a decisive break from the moderate liberalism of Bill Clinton and even Barack Obama. Second, despite some silly recent talk, it will not be Marxist.A few of the distinctive features of Marxism are: 1. The belief that the problems of the modern economy are inherent to the capitalist system. 2. Capitalism will eventually collapse. 3. There is an alternative system.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]My sense is these ideas have been rejected by most on the left. It\u2019s become clear, to those on the fair-minded left, that global capitalism has produced the greatest reduction in poverty in human history. The problems with capitalism are more discrete \u2014 mostly with the plight of the working class in rich countries.Moreover, there is no alternative. Economist Dean Baker has argued that it\u2019s silly for people on the left to see the market as the enemy: \u201cThis makes as much sense as seeing the wheel as the enemy. The market is a tool, it is incredibly malleable.\u201d It can be structured to redistribute wealth upward, or it can be structured to redistribute wealth downward.The goal for most on the left is not replacing capitalism, but reforming it to make it work better for all. That would involve two big tasks.The second task would be to ensure economic security for all. This would involve raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, providing universal basic income and having the federal government provide a paying job to all who want one.Nonetheless, I don\u2019t think this is the leftism we will wind up with. Tribalism is in the air, on the left as well as on the right. It is based on a scarcity mentality, the idea that life is a zero-sum war between us and them. It emphasizes division and conflict, not solidarity and cohesion. It draws out the authoritarian tendencies in any movement. On the right, tribalism brings us the ethnic authoritarianism of Donald Trump. On the left, it seems likely to bring us the economic authoritarianism of a North American version of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.You can see authoritarianism entering the left through two avenues. The first is nationalism. Not long ago, most of the American left tended to think transnationally \u2014 partly because problems like climate change are global, partly because it\u2019s hard to regulate a global economy nation by nation, partly because progressives used to be psychologically averse to nationalism.The second stream fueling economic authoritarianism is identity politics. It used to be that big political divides were defined by economic interests; now, the cultural dog wags the economic tail. Identity politics defines the core political divides. When many progressives talk about economics these days, they take the habits of mind they developed when talking about identity groups and apply them to economic groups.It\u2019s the same Manichaeism: oppressor versus oppressed, privileged versus underprivileged, hegemon versus victim. Conflict is inevitable. The apocalypse is near. Preserve the purity of the group. Shut down the other side. It\u2019s sectarian politics to the nth degree.In Venezuela we saw how a politician used demagogic sectarian rhetoric to establish an authoritarian regime and then destroy a people. I\u2019m sure many of my left-wing friends believe that that sort of tribal us/them mentality won\u2019t hijack and corrupt their own movement. But as someone who lived through the last 30 years of conservatism, I\u2019m here to tell you, it can. Politicians these days have decided they don\u2019t need the thinkers anymore.Advertisement"}

I have a hypothesis that may or may not be true, and am throwing it out for further discussion.Start with the puzzle: the unemployment rate is now very low by historical standards.

Yet wage growth remains restrained, well below pre-crisis levels:What\u2019s going on?One answer is that the official unemployment rate is misleading as an indicator of economic slack, and/or that structural changes have shifted the Phillips curve.

So why aren\u2019t they just raising wages?OK, here\u2019s one hypothesis: it\u2019s partly about downward nominal wage rigidity.But that explains why firms didn\u2019t cut wages when unemployment was high.

{"Headline": "Germany Acts to Tame Facebook, Learning From Its Own History of Hate", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "A country taps its past as it leads the way on one of the most pressing issues facing modern democracies: how to regulate the world\u2019s biggest social network.Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Security is tight at this brick building on the western edge of Berlin. Inside, a sign warns: \u201cEverybody without a badge is a potential spy!\u201dSpread over five floors, hundreds of men and women sit in rows of six scanning their computer screens. All have signed nondisclosure agreements. Four trauma specialists are at their disposal seven days a week.They are the agents of Facebook. And they have the power to decide what is free speech and what is hate speech.Germany, home to a tough new online hate speech law, has become a laboratory for one of the most pressing issues for governments today: how and whether to regulate the world\u2019s biggest social network.Around the world, Facebook and other social networking platforms are facing a backlash over their failures to safeguard privacy, disinformation campaigns and the digital reach of hate groups.As the world confronts these rising forces, Europe, and Germany in particular, have emerged as the de facto regulators of the industry, exerting influence beyond their own borders. Berlin\u2019s digital crackdown on hate speech, which took effect on Jan. 1, is being closely watched by other countries. And German officials are playing a major role behind one of Europe\u2019s most aggressive moves to rein in technology companies, strict data privacy rules that take effect across the European Union on May 25 and are prompting global changes.\u201cFor them, data is the raw material that makes them money,\u201d said Gerd Billen, secretary of state in Germany\u2019s Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection. \u201cFor us, data protection is a fundamental right that underpins our democratic institutions.\u201dGermany\u2019s troubled history has placed it on the front line of a modern tug-of-war between democracies and digital platforms.But banned posts, pictures and videos have routinely lingered on Facebook and other social media platforms. Now companies that systematically fail to remove \u201cobviously illegal\u201d content within 24 hours face fines of up to 50 million euros.The deletion center predates the legislation, but its efforts have taken on new urgency. Every day content moderators in Berlin, hired by a third-party firm and working exclusively on Facebook, pore over thousands of posts flagged by users as upsetting or potentially illegal and make a judgment: Ignore, delete or, in particularly tricky cases, \u201cescalate\u201d to a global team of Facebook lawyers with expertise in German regulation.Some decisions to delete are easy. Posts about Holocaust denial and genocidal rants against particular groups like refugees are obvious ones for taking down.Others are less so. On Dec. 31, the day before the new law took effect, a far-right lawmaker reacted to an Arabic New Year\u2019s tweet from the Cologne police, accusing them of appeasing \u201cbarbaric, Muslim, gang-raping groups of men.\u201dThe request to block a screenshot of the lawmaker\u2019s post wound up in the queue of Nils, a 35-year-old agent in the Berlin deletion center. His judgment was to let it stand. A colleague thought it should come down. Ultimately, the post was sent to lawyers in Dublin, London, Silicon Valley and Hamburg. By the afternoon it had been deleted, prompting a storm of criticism about the new legislation, known here as the \u201cFacebook Law.\u201d\u201cA lot of stuff is clear-cut,\u201d Nils said. Facebook, citing his safety, did not allow him to give his surname. \u201cBut then there is the borderline stuff.\u201dComplicated cases have raised concerns that the threat of the new rules\u2019 steep fines and 24-hour window for making decisions encourage \u201cover-blocking\u201d by companies, a sort of defensive censorship of content that is not actually illegal.Other people argue that the law simply gives a private company too much authority to decide what constitutes illegal hate speech in a democracy, an argument that Facebook, which favored voluntary guidelines, made against the law.\u201cIt is perfectly appropriate for the German government to set standards,\u201d said Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of communications and public policy. \u201cBut we think it\u2019s a bad idea for the German government to outsource the decision of what is lawful and what is not.\u201dRichard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for public policy in Europe and the leader of the company\u2019s lobbying effort against the German legislation, put it more simply: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the arbiters of free speech.\u201dGerman officials counter that social media platforms are the arbiters anyway.It all boils down to one question, said Mr. Billen, who helped draw up the new legislation: \u201cWho is sovereign? Parliament or Facebook?\u201dWhen Nils applied for a job at the deletion center, the first question the recruiter asked him was: \u201cDo you know what you will see here?\u201dNils has seen it all. Child torture. Mutilations. Suicides. Even murder: He once saw a video of a man cutting a heart out of a living human being.And then there is hate.\u201cYou see all the ugliness of the world here,\u201d Nils said. \u201cEveryone is against everyone else. Everyone is complaining about that other group. And everyone is saying the same horrible things.\u201dThe issue is deeply personal for Nils. He has a 4-year-old daughter. \u201cI\u2019m also doing this for her,\u201d he said.The center here is run by Arvato, a German service provider owned by the conglomerate Bertelsmann. The agents have a broad purview, reviewing content from a half-dozen countries. Those with a focus on Germany must know Facebook\u2019s community standards and, as of January, the basics of German hate speech and defamation law.\u201cTwo agents looking at the same post should come up with the same decision,\u201d says Karsten K\u00f6nig, who manages Arvato\u2019s partnership with Facebook.The Berlin center opened with 200 employees in 2015, as Germany was opening its doors to hundreds of thousands of migrants.That year a selfie went viral.Anas Modamani, a Syrian refugee, posed with Chancellor Angela Merkel and posted the image on Facebook. It instantly became a symbol of her decision to allowing in hundreds of thousands of migrants.Soon it also became a symbol of the backlash.The arrival of nearly 1.4 million migrants in Germany has tested the country\u2019s resolve to keep a tight lid on hate speech. The law on illegal speech was long-established but enforcement in the digital realm was scattershot before the new legislation.\u201cThey knew that they were a platform for criminal behavior and for calls to commit criminal acts, but they presented themselves to us as a wolf in sheep skin,\u201d said Mr. Billen, a poker-faced civil servant with stern black frames on his glasses.By March 2017, the German government had lost patience and started drafting legislation. The Network Enforcement Law was born, setting out 21 types of content that are \u201cmanifestly illegal\u201d and requiring social media platforms to act quickly.Officials say early indications suggest the rules have served their purpose. Facebook\u2019s performance on removing illegal hate speech in Germany rose to 100 percent over the past year, according to the latest spot check of the European Union.Platforms must publish biannual reports on their efforts. The first is expected in July.At Facebook\u2019s Berlin offices, Mr. Allan acknowledged that under the earlier voluntary agreement, the company had not acted decisively enough at first.\u201cIt was too little and it was too slow,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cthat has changed.\u201dHe cited another independent report for the European Commission from last summer that showed Facebook was by then removing 80 percent of hate speech posts in Germany.The reason for the improvement was not German legislation, he said, but a voluntary code of conduct with the European Union. Facebook\u2019s results have improved in all European countries, not just in Germany, Mr. Allan said.\u201cThere was no need for legislation,\u201d he said.Mr. Billen disagrees.\u201cThey could have prevented the law,\u201d he said. YouTube scored 90 percent in last year\u2019s monitoring exercise. If other platforms had done the same, there would be no law today, he said.Germany\u2019s hard-line approach to hate speech and data privacy once made it an outlier in Europe. The country\u2019s stance is now more mainstream, an evolution seen in the justice commissioner in Brussels.Vera Jourova, the justice commissioner, deleted her Facebook account in 2015 because she could not stand the hate anymore.\u201cIt felt good,\u201d she said about pressing the button. She added: \u201cIt felt like taking back control.\u201dBut Ms. Jourova, who grew up behind the Iron Curtain in what is now the Czech Republic, had long been skeptical about governments legislating any aspect of free speech, including hate speech. Her father lost his job after making a disparaging comment about the Soviet invasion in 1968, barring her from going to university until she married and took her husband\u2019s name.\u201cI lived half my life in the atmosphere driven by Soviet propaganda,\u201d she said. \u201cThe golden principle was: If you repeat a lie a hundred times it becomes the truth.\u201dWhen Germany started considering a law, she instead preferred a voluntary code of conduct. In 2016, platforms like Facebook promised European users easy reporting tools and committed to removing most illegal posts brought to their attention within 24 hours.The approach worked well enough, Ms. Jourova said. It was also the quickest way to act because the 28 member states in the European Union differed so much about whether and how to legislate.But the stance of many governments toward Facebook has hardened since it emerged that the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of up to 87 million users. Representatives of the European Parliament have asked Mr. Zuckerberg to come to Brussels to \u201cclarify issues related to the use of personal data\u201d and he has agreed to come as soon as next week.Ms. Jourova, whose job is to protect the data of over 500 million Europeans, has hardened her stance as well.\u201cOur current system relies on trust and this did nothing to improve trust,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question now is how do we continue?\u201dThe European Commission is considering German-style legislation for online content related to terrorism, violent extremism and child pornography, including a provision that would include fines for platforms that did not remove illegal content within an hour of being alerted to it.Several countries \u2014 France, Israel, Italy, and Canada among them \u2014 have sent queries to the German government about the impact of the new hate speech law.Inspired in part by German data protection laws written in the 1980s, the regulation has been shaped by a number of prominent Germans. Ms. Jourova\u2019s chief of staff, Renate Nikolay, is German, as is her predecessor\u2019s chief of staff, Martin Selmayr, now the European Commission\u2019s secretary general. The lawmaker in charge of the regulation in the European Parliament is German, too.\u201cWe have built on the German tradition of data protection as a constitutional right and created the most modern piece of regulation of the digital economy,\u201d Ms. Nikolay said.\u201cTo succeed in the long-term companies needs the trust of customers,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the latest since Cambridge Analytica it has become clear that data protection is not just some nutty European idea, but a matter of competitiveness.\u201dOn March 26, Ms. Jourova wrote a letter \u2014 by post, not email \u2014 to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer.\u201cIs there a need for stricter rules for platforms like those that exist for traditional media?\u201d she asked.\u201cIs the data of Europeans affected by the current scandal?\u201d she added, referring to the Cambridge Analytica episode. And, if so, \u201cHow do you plan to inform the user about this?\u201dShe demanded a reply within two weeks, and she got one. Some 2.7 million Europeans were affected, Ms. Sandberg wrote.But she never answered Ms. Jourova\u2019s question on regulation.\u201cThere is now a sense of urgency and the conviction that we are dealing with something very dangerous that may threaten the development of free democracies,\u201d said Ms. Jourova, who is also trying to find ways to clamp down on fake news and disinformation campaigns.\u201cWe want the tech giants to respect and follow our legislation,\u201d she added. \u201cWe want them to show social responsibility both on data protection and on hate speech.\u201dSo do many Facebook employees, Mr. Allan, the company executive, said.\u201cWe employ very thoughtful and principled people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey work here because they want to make the world a better place, so when an assumption is made that the product they work on is harming people it is impactful.\u201d\u201cPeople have felt this criticism very deeply,\u201d he said.Nils works eight-hour shifts. On busy days, 1,500 user reports are in his queue. Other days, there are only 300. Some of his colleagues have nightmares about what they see.Every so often someone breaks down. A mother recently left her desk in tears after watching a video of a child being sexually abused. A young man felt physically sick after seeing a video of a dog being tortured. The agents watch teenagers self-mutilating and girls recounting rape.They have weekly group sessions with a psychologist and the trauma specialists on standby. In more serious cases, the center teams up with clinics in Berlin.In the office, which is adorned with Facebook logos, fresh fruit is at the agents\u2019 disposal in a small room where subdued colors and decorative moss growing on the walls are meant to calm fraying nerves.To decompress, the agents sometimes report each other\u2019s posts, not because they are controversial, but \u201cjust for a laugh,\u201d said another agent, the son of a Lebanese refugee and an Arabic-speaker who has had to deal with content related to terrorism generally and the Islamic State specifically. By now, he said, images of \u201cweird skin diseases\u201d affected him more than those of a beheading. Nils finds sports injuries like breaking bones particularly disturbing.There is a camaraderie in the office and a real sense of mission: Nils said the agents were proud to \u201chelp clean up the hate.\u201dThe definition of hate is constantly evolving.The agents, who initially take a three-week training course, get frequent refreshers. Their guidelines are revised to reflect hate speech culture. Events change the meaning of words. New hashtags and online trends must be put in context.\u201cSlurs can become socialized,\u201d Mr. Allan of Facebook explained.Nils and his colleagues must determine whether hateful content is singling out an ethnic group or individuals.That was the challenge with a message on Twitter that was later posted to Facebook as a screenshot by Beatrix von Storch, deputy floor leader of the far-right party, AfD.\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with this country?\u201d Ms. von Storch wrote on Dec. 31. \u201cWhy is an official police account tweeting in Arabic?\u201d\u201cDo you think that will appease the barbaric murdering Muslim group-raping gangs of men?\u201d she continued.A user reported the post as a violation of German law, and it landed in Nils\u2019s queue. He initially decided to ignore the request because he felt Ms. von Storch was directing her insults at the men who had sexually assaulted women two years earlier.Separately, a user reported the post as a violation of community standards. Another agent leaned toward deleting it, taking it as directed at Muslims in general.They conferred with their \u201csubject matter expert,\u201d who escalated it to a team in Dublin.For 24 hours, the post kept Facebook lawyers from Silicon Valley to Hamburg busy. The Dublin team decided that the post did not violate community standards but sent it on for legal assessment by outside lawyers hired by Facebook in Germany.Within hours of news that the German police were opening a criminal investigation into Ms. von Storch over her comments, Facebook restricted access to the post. The user who reported the content was notified that it had been blocked for a violation of section 130 of the German criminal code, incitement to hatred. Ms. von Storch was also notified too.In the first few days of the year, it looked like the platforms were erring on the side of censorship. On Jan. 2, a day after Ms. von Storch\u2019s post was deleted, the satirical magazine Titanic quipped that she would be its new guest tweeter. Two of the magazine\u2019s subsequent Twitter posts mocking her were deleted. When Titanic published them again, its account was temporarily suspended.Since then, things have calmed down. And even Mr. Allan conceded: \u201cThe law has not materially changed the amount of content that is deleted.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a prolific right-wing user of Facebook in Germany. It is Alternative for Germany, not Alternative of Germany.Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Pledges $200 Billion in U.S. Purchases by Overhauling Trade Rules", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 American and Chinese officials made progress on Friday toward an agreement that could help avert a trade war, with China pledging to increase its purchase of American goods by at least $200 billion by 2020, largely by lifting existing barriers that would make it easier for United States firms to sell and operate in China, according to a senior Trump administration official.To help narrow the trade deficit the United States runs with China, the Chinese would reduce tariffs and other nontariff barriers that currently hinder the flow of American goods and services into China. Removing tariffs and other structural barriers would essentially allow another $200 billion worth of goods to enter China through 2020, the official said.Administration officials described the potential deal as a victory that would result in China making some of the structural changes to its economy that the United States has long sought. Right now, China imposes tariffs on a range of American products, including autos, agricultural goods and energy, and has other stiff barriers to entering its market, such as requiring American companies to enter into joint ventures with Chinese firms to gain entry and additional hurdles to shipping goods into the country.But hard-liners within the Trump administration have cautioned that China has a long history of making promises to overhaul its trade practices and open its market to American goods, only to walk back or delay those moves. Those advisers have pushed Mr. Trump to take a tougher stance that would ensure China follows through on changing practices that American businesses have long complained about, including rampant intellectual property violations and discrimination against foreign companies.The official did not specify which barriers would be lifted but said the structural changes would enable American companies to sell a wider array of goods and services in China.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.The deal, which is still being negotiated, would also include provisions to address concerns about American companies being forced to hand over intellectual property if they want to operate in China. And it would include measures to help American companies avoid some of the onerous partnerships they are currently forced to strike with Chinese companies to do business in the world\u2019s largest consumer market.Liu He, a vice premier and top economic adviser to the Chinese president, met on Thursday with President Trump and his top trade officials, and meetings continued into Friday afternoon.Larry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council, said in an interview on Fox Business Network that Mr. Liu had given \u201can excellent presentation\u201d to a small group of trade advisers in the Oval Office on Thursday, in which he outlined multiple remedies for the trade deficit issue, tariff and nontariff barriers and technology theft problems. \u201cPresident Trump was very engaged,\u201d Mr. Kudlow added.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said on Friday that the United States and China are \u201c continuing to have productive conversations.\u201dThough Chinese leaders have presented a strong front to the Trump administration, they are eager to dissuade the United States from imposing multiple trade penalties, including tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods exported to America, pending restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States, and sanctions that are crippling the business of one of its largest telecom firms, ZTE.The measures against ZTE threaten to put tens of thousands of Chinese out of work, and they have provoked a backlash within the country, with some Chinese bemoaning that their country is not technologically strong enough to survive without the United States, a potential embarrassment for President Xi Jinping of China.China also appears eager to act quickly to take advantage of a period of enhanced leverage, as the White House prepares for a historic meeting with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, next month in Singapore that would burnish Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation as a deal maker.Speaking from the Cabinet Room on Thursday, Mr. Trump drew a link between China\u2019s recent meetings with North Korean leaders and Mr. Kim\u2019s threat to cancel the summit meeting. \u201cIt could very well be that he\u2019s influencing Kim Jong-un,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to Mr. Xi.As Mr. Liu met with American officials, China appeared eager to pave the way for a rapid resolution of trade tensions between the economies. On Friday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry announced that the country was dropping its antidumping and antisubsidy investigation into American sorghum. The investigation had effectively shuttered imports of sorghum, which is used to feed pigs and make China\u2019s signature rice liquor, baijiu, and was widely viewed as a direct response to American tariffs on solar panels and washing machines.\u201cThe Chinese want this to go away, and the Chinese are willing to write a check to make it go away,\u201d said Leland Miller, the chief executive officer of China Beige Book International. \u201cThey just want a deal where they can say we came to the table, we answered your problems, we\u2019re not doing it again. This is the major danger with a short-term deal, it extinguishes almost all leverage the U.S. has.\u201dDuring a visit to Beijing in early May, the Trump administration presented the Chinese with a long list of demands to overhaul their economy that went far beyond just reducing the trade deficit they run with the United States. The list also included reducing the subsidies China provides to its own industries and several restrictions that encourage foreign businesses to transfer technology to Chinese companies or the government.Mr. Trump has threatened China with an array of penalties, including tariffs and restrictions in investments in the United States. The administration has cited national security concerns as a reason to limit the inflow of investment from China and the Treasury Department is supposed to outline potential restrictions to the White House by May 21. However, it is unclear whether the administration would take those off the table in exchange for an agreement with China that alleviates some of its broader concerns.Many economists question the ability of the United States to actually sell China an additional $200 billion in goods, given the economy is already at full production, and the total would be more than half of the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China last year.Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that under World Trade Organization rules, China must lower its tariffs not just for the United States, but for all trading partners. But that could lead to a situation where more Japanese, South Korea or European goods are flooding into China, rather than American ones.Scott Kennedy, the deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the American effort to ramp up pressure on China through tariffs, investment restrictions and other measures has substantially raised tensions with China and other American allies, as well as provoked conflict within the administration, interest groups and various branches of government.\u201cIf we get a deal which is essentially about expanding exports, we\u2019ll really want to ask ourselves whether going through all this was worth it,\u201d he said.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington, and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shelter Island, N.Y.: A Paradise That Has Its Challenges", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving In14 PhotosGary Gerth, 74, the recently elected town supervisor of Shelter Island, described this sylvan knob of land tucked in the crook of the East End of Long Island as \u201can emerald jewel set in the bracelet of turquoise waters.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not for everyone,\u201d he added.Georgiana Ketcham, 82, discovered Shelter Island more than 50 years ago, after her husband inherited a boat and the couple combed the Long Island coast between Amityville and Montauk, looking for a place for a summer home. Ten years later, they moved there permanently.\u201cI\u2019m the oldest living real estate broker on Shelter Island,\u201d Ms. Ketcham said. So she knows what she is talking about when she tells you it \u201cisn\u2019t for everybody.\u201dShelter Island is a qualified paradise because of challenges that are the flip side of its charms. The four-by-five mile chunk of Suffolk County, shaped like a disastrous experiment in pancake making, is reached somewhat inconveniently by ferry, but residents say their cares drift away as they cross the waters from the North or South Fork. The island has clams, osprey and golden forsythia foaming like champagne in the spring, but lacks a hospital, a movie theater and home mail delivery. The police mostly deal with small stuff like returning lost wallets or field calls about felled power lines, but if you are caught speeding, your name will be in the local newspaper.\u201cMy mother can\u2019t wrap her head around the fact that there\u2019s no shopping,\u201d said Annemarie Norris, 41, who in 2015 bought a four-bedroom house with her husband, Benedict, for $775,000 in the Silver Beach neighborhood.Which is to say, Shelter Island has a pharmacy, a bookstore, two hardware stores and a grocery store, but nothing remotely resembling a mall. \u201cWe sit around the firepit,\u201d Ms. Norris said. \u201cOr we sit on the back porch. Or we walk around the corner. Or we sit on the beach.\u201dWith a population of 2,400 that explodes to five times that number in the summer, the island has two kinds of residents.The Norrises are part-timers. They live in a two-bedroom Brooklyn co-op with their two young sons and spend weekends in their brick-and-shingle house on Brander Parkway. They even enjoy coming out in winter, when the island is low-key and windswept, and only a few restaurants are open. (A favorite, the Tavern at the Shelter Island House hotel, has recently changed hands and is turning Italian; it reopens as Caci this month.)By contrast, John Kaasik, 62, grew up on Shelter Island and returned after spending much of his 20s in Europe.\u201cI stayed here against the better wishes of my wallet,\u201d he said, referring to the island\u2019s narrow, service-oriented economy, which encourages multitasking. He and his wife, Anu, own the Azalea House bed-and-breakfast and the Go\u2019fors taxi company and stage the annual high school musical. Mr. Kaasik is also a playwright.The permanent population, with its many retirees, is its own clan, residents say. Shelter Island\u2019s churches, school, library and fire department are all volunteer strongholds that keep people active throughout the seasons and raise the quality of services.But the twain do meet at the island\u2019s golf courses, tennis courts, sailing school and beaches. And at Sylvester Manor, a plantation that was run with slave labor into the 19th century and is now an organic farm with cultural events and educational programs; at the farmers\u2019 market on the grounds of the historical society, which is being expanded; and at concerts at the Perlman Music Program, a summer institute for young string players founded by Toby Perlman, the wife of Itzhak Perlman (he leads the faculty).And there are clashes. As Shelter Island attracts wealthy buyers sidestepping the snoot and traffic of the Hamptons, prices are rising and the character is changing.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want it to feel like some sort of gated community in a retirement village in Florida,\u201d Mr. Kaasik said. \u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019s the case now, but it\u2019s trending toward that.\u201dIn August, six residents filed a lawsuit to reverse a rule forbidding short-term rentals. Though the law was enacted to reduce disruptions caused by raucous visitors, the plaintiffs argue that renting gives vital income to homeowners who need help paying mortgages or taxes.Mr. Gerth, the town supervisor, is on their side. Renting for any length of time, he said, brings in tourists, and tourists are often converted into residents. Besides, he added, \u201cRenting is a tradition here.\u201dShelter Island has a variety of topographies and housing styles and one great common theme: water. There are four marinas, as many public beaches and an assortment of ponds, bays and creeks.The Mashomack Preserve, more than 2,000 acres of protected oak and beech forests, meadows, salt marshes and pine swamps, takes up a third of the island. The habitable remainder contains neighborhoods with different aqueous bodies and wealth indexes.Shelter Island Heights, for instance, the neighborhood near the North Ferry terminal, has frilly Victorians sunning themselves on hillsides overlooking the harbor and yacht club. These houses are kept close to the bosoms of multigenerational families and come on the market only once in a while. The cluster of nearby businesses includes Stars Caf\u00e9 on Grand Avenue and Marie Eiffel\u2019s organic market on North Ferry Road.Another attraction is the Chequit on Grand Avenue. Built in 1872 as a Methodist retreat, the 37-room hotel was recently renovated and is now for sale with its restaurant for $9 million.Hay Beach, to the north, is a 1960s subdivision with minimum one-acre lots. Little Ram Island and Ram Island are narrow spits connected by causeways to the east, where almost all of the houses are on the water or have ocean access or views. Silver Beach, to the southwest, is a former postwar summer community on a peninsula where modest homes are routinely replaced with fancier ones. Nostrand Parkway and Westmoreland Farm are both elite enclaves to the west.The center of the island is where Ms. Ketcham lives on two acres, near Gary Paul Gates, the journalist and author, and Eric Demarchelier, the restaurateur and artist (and the brother of the fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier). \u201cIf Shelter Island were a target and you threw darts at it, my house would be in the bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d she said.Asked whether the island has changed in the 40 years he has known it, Mr. Demarchelier, who owns an 1860s clapboard house on a former lima bean farm, said, \u201cNot much. The houses have gotten a little bigger, but there are still no traffic lights and no traffic jams.\u201dDeborah Von Brook-Binder, who sells real estate for Daniel Gale Sotheby\u2019s on Shelter Island, said the market for the first quarter of this year was slower than last year. The new laws affecting property taxes and mortgage interest rate deductions might be discouraging buyers, she added. \u201cAlso, the weather hasn\u2019t been that great.\u201dAccording to the real estate website Trulia, the median sales price of Shelter Island homes as of March 18 was $837,500, a year-on-year increase of 5.3 percent based on 116 transactions.Twenty-three properties were offered on the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island\u2019s website as of May 14. They included a two-bedroom ranch house on 2.2 acres, at 57 North Midway Road, listed at $699,000, and a shingled Colonial-style home with six bedrooms and 600 feet of private beach, at 29 Winthrop Road, listed for $6.9 million.Shelter Island is \u201cchill,\u201d to use Ms. Norris\u2019s expression. On their first visit, she and her husband had paused during a cycling excursion when a child approached them. \u201cHe was maybe 10,\u201d Ms. Norris recalled. \u201cMaybe younger. He said, \u2018Do you need help getting anywhere?\u2019\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just that the boy was polite; he was totally unsupervised. She thought, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want for my children.\u201dKindnesses, small and large, are typical of the islanders, Mr. Kaasik said. After his daughter received a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, he received concerned messages from community members he barely knew.\u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen over and over again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect example of how things should be.\u201dChristine Finn, who became superintendent of the Shelter Island Union Free School District in the fall, said the district has been reversing the greater Long Island trend of declining enrollments, and is showing an uptick. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep the trend going by offering more electives and AP classes,\u201d she said.Ms. Ketcham pointed out that the district just passed an $11.7 million budget, and divided among the 222 students in prekindergarten through 12th grade, that comes to more than $52,700 per student. \u201cCome on, you can send a kid to Choate for that!\u201d she said.Among the elementary school students who took the 2017 state tests, 51 percent met standards in English versus 42 percent statewide; 54 percent met standards in math versus 46 percent statewide.Among the middle school students, 48 percent met standards in English versus 40 percent statewide; 26 percent met standards in math versus 39 percent statewide.The average SAT scores for high school juniors and seniors who took the test in the fall of 2016 were 609 for reading and writing and 557 for math, versus 528 and 523 statewide.Shelter Island is about two and a half hours east of New York City. The North Ferry departs for Greenport, N.Y., on the North Fork every 10 to 20 minutes. The ride takes eight minutes and costs $16 round trip for a car and driver making a same-day return. The South Ferry departs for North Haven, N.Y., in the Hamptons every 10 to 15 minutes. The crossing takes four minutes and costs $19 round trip.In June of 1947, a conference about theoretical physics took place at the Ram\u2019s Head Inn on Shelter Island. Twenty-four of the world\u2019s leading scientists \u2014 including Edward Teller, J. Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann and Richard Feynman \u2014 gathered to discuss the foundations of quantum mechanics. On the way to what is now known as the Shelter Island Conference, the men were given celebrity-style police escorts, tributes to the work many of them had done on the atomic bomb.An earlier version of this article misidentified a music school on Shelter Island.

Mr. Solomon would step in shortly after that.That said, there are some ways to assess whether the current mortgage rate might be a bit high or low for the current conditions in the markets and the economy. One way to put the nominal mortgage rate in context is to adjust for inflation. Subtracting April\u2019s inflation rate of 2.5 percent from the current mortgage rate gives a \u201creal\u201d mortgage rate of around 2.1 percent. That compares with the average real rate of 2.25 percent for the past seven years. The mortgage rate would need to rise 0.15 percentage point to reach that level.Another exercise is to compare the current mortgage with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The difference between the two interest rates on Thursday was 1.5 percentage points, which is smaller than the seven-year average of 1.72 percentage points. Trading at that \u201cspread\u201d would push the current mortgage rate 0.22 percentage point higher to 4.83 percent.Economists expect the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to keep rising, to 3.24 percent in December, according to estimates compiled by The Wall Street Journal.Adding the average seven-year spread of 1.72 percentage points to that forecast gets the mortgage rate within spitting distance of 5 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisBoth sides claimed a victory of sorts, but only one thing was clear: They will all be spending a lot of time in court.Ms. Brennan has resisted doing so, pointing out that the rate the Postal Service charges Amazon and others is bound by contracts, the Washington Post writes.ContextMany have pushed back against Mr. Trump\u2019s comments.

McLoughlin, a member of the Campbell board since 2016, was named to succeed Ms. Morrison on an interim basis.\u2022 Campbell has struggled on Ms. Morrison\u2019s watch to reverse a slide in sales tied to shifting food trends. Campbell reported $393 million loss for the third quarter on Friday, compared with a $176 million profit in the same period a year earlier. The company also expects its earnings per share for the year to slump 5 to 6 percent after previously projecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent.\u2022 With Ms. Morrison\u2019s departure, there are now 23 women leading Fortune 500 companies, or 4.6 percent of the total. They include Mary Barra at General Motors, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo and Marillyn Hewson at Lockheed Martin.\u2022 Campbell\u2019s share price dropped more than 12 percent, to $34.50, after the company\u2019s morning announcement that Ms. Morrison had resigned. It had bounced back a bit by midday. From the start of her tenure as chief executive in August 2011 through Thursday, Campbell\u2019s share price was up 19 percent, although it had tumbled around 30 percent in the past year.\u2014 Tiffany HsuContext\u2022 Chinese antitrust regulators had long delayed Qualcomm\u2019s $44 billion deal for NXP as well as Bain Capital\u2019s $18 billion purchase of Toshiba.\u2022 On Thursday, China approved Bain Capital's acquisitions of Toshiba.Even if the Chinese stopped buying other foreign products, like Airbus airplanes from the European Union or soybeans from Brazil, and purchased solely American products, it would add up to only a small fraction of the $200 billion total they are promising to purchase.Representatives for Brookfield and Qatar said the emirate wasn\u2019t involved, and Brookfield is an established real-estate name in its own right.

To this day, she won\u2019t eat either of them.Kate Medley, a visual journalist, took a summer job shaving ice for sno-balls inside a hot, sticky hut near an Interstate exit in Jackson, Miss. She earned $3 an hour and all the sno-balls she could eat. For a 12-year-old, it was a dream job.But those kinds of summer food memories, born from what was once a rite of passage for American teenagers, are fading as fast as a soft-serve twist at a Midwest water park.You can still find high school and college students boiling hot dogs and cleaning the fryer at the clam shacks, country clubs and state fairs that spring to life when the weather turns hot. But the food that fuels a summer vacation is now more likely being prepared by temporary workers from other countries or local adults trying to make the gig economy work for them.At the same time, demand for summer workers rose. After 9/11, domestic travel acquired new appeal; Americans took more vacations, but shorter ones. With a laptop and a good internet connection, work could be done anywhere.Vacationers started arriving at summer destinations in early May and showed up well into the fall. Trying to staff a fudge shop or marina restaurant with a work force that vanished when classes started in August was a headache.Employers began making use of workers from other countries with H-2B visas, which are granted to businesses that have specific kinds of seasonal work. But those visas became more difficult to obtain under the Trump administration, which made changes to the program that it said were meant to protect jobs for Americans.\u201cWe can\u2019t fill those jobs any way else, but now it\u2019s gotten to where we just need more workers, period,\u201d said Mr. Benser, whose family has three stores on Mackinac Island and two more in nearby towns. Things are so tight this year he might not be able to open the three Murdick\u2019s shops he also owns on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, he said.Mr. Benser, 54, is also Mackinac Island\u2019s tax assessor and the president of the tourist board, and is building a boutique hotel on the same street where John Jacob Astor made his first million trading furs in the early 1800s.Mr. Benser took over the fudge business from his father, Bob Benser Sr., who used to run the Tastee-Freez next door to the original Murdick\u2019s fudge shop, which he bought in 1969. Back then, the season lasted about 75 days. Now it cranks up the first weekend in May and runs until the end of October.For years, teenagers and college-age employees made fudge, waited tables, cleaned rooms and did all the other jobs required in a summer resort town, he said. Now, they make up only about a third of the workers. The jobs are more often filled by people in their 20s and 30s from countries including Mongolia, China, Romania, Bulgaria and Jamaica.\u201cAmerican kids don\u2019t want to work, and the foreign kids need the money,\u201d said Joanna Tamalyn, who was raised on the island and manages room and board for the foreign workers employed at Mr. Benser\u2019s many enterprises here, which include restaurants and hotels.Carnel Samuels, 40, came to Mackinac Island from Jamaica 15 years ago, after Mr. Benser traveled there to recruit workers. He had never heard of fudge. Now, he winters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and spends his summers making fudge and trying to teach each summer\u2019s new batch of workers how to do it.It\u2019s much harder than it seems. First, Mr. Samuels boils water in a copper pot to calibrate the cooking times for the day, which can go up or down depending on heat and humidity.Each batch starts with about 15 pounds of sugar taken from beets grown in the Lower Peninsula (on a map, from the thumb of the state\u2019s glove shape), and butter and cream from dairies in the Upper Peninsula. Some corn syrup is added for consistency, then Belgian chocolate, vanilla, Michigan maple syrup or any other number of ingredients. Murdick\u2019s has recipes for 30 flavors.The hard part starts once the copper pot is emptied onto a slab of old marble in the middle of the store. The boiling mass is initially contained by a frame of stainless steel bars. Once the fudge cools slightly, the bars are removed. The candymaker has to quickly work around the edges of the fudge with a wide paint scraper, flipping it with a controlled motion that new workers learn by practicing on a round salt container.When the candy is set, a worker picks up a long-handled spade and starts moving the fudge with long, rhythmic strokes. Work too slowly and it seizes up; work the fudge too hard and it gets grainy. \u201cYou want to move the fudge only as much as it wants to be moved,\u201d Mr. Samuels said.On its busiest day, when 15,000 people are on the island, 20 batches will come out of that old copper pot over a 10-hour day. That\u2019s nearly 600 pounds of fudge, which leaves the store in half-pound slices carefully wrapped in white paper and packed in a box with a little wooden knife.The new workers never get it right in the beginning.\u201cMost of the kids leave every day with burns on their arms,\u201d Mr. Samuels said. \u201cYou have to spend two seasons to get it right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Once she arrives at her home base in Puerto Carre\u00f1o, visiting other parts along the river can prove equally daunting, forcing her to rely on local health groups or nongovernmental organizations (N.G.O.s) to get to hard-to-reach indigenous communities.There\u2019s no way she can parachute to this story. The river has secrets, as do the people who live there and try to eke out a living. Life has been further complicated by the unceasing flow of refugees from Venezuela who are fleeing economic and political calamity. It all makes for a complex tale as Ms. Escobar has spent the last three years looking at how women live in this region that is approximately the size of Portugal.For Ms. Escobar, the funds will enable her to pursue her project at her own pace, without having to rely so much on others to get around. She traverses a region that is in many ways its own country, where the river\u2019s presence is constant.She likens the local economy\u2019s structure to one dominated by modern day robber barons who have enriched themselves through trade in everything from animal skins and feathers to cocaine and gold. Over all, members of 10 different indigenous groups account for 80 percent of the population. Some of them have been seminomadic, she said, while others have been able to establish themselves far from outside interference.Many of them pass through Puerto Carre\u00f1o, which she said was founded as an outpost by the government 80 years ago. As with any border town, there is a mix of adventurers, rascals, robbers and people trying to survive. But the town\u2019s indigenous residents, she said, face marginalization and discrimination. What is infuriating, she said, is that there is actually a governmental presence in town, albeit one that apparently has absolved itself of responsibility.\u201cFor example, there is a representative of the Institute for Children, the police and military,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the forces of the state are there, but none of them is focused on dealing with these themes and the great amount of discrimination. They say the indigenous have their own law, but that is just one way to absolve themselves of responsibility.\u201dDespite the town\u2019s chaos and the marginalization of the poor, she is determined to explore other themes that show alternative, hopeful perspectives. One group, the Piaroa, have established a community in a distant part of the region. And that remoteness, she said, can be a salvation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Isolate the Russians. It\u2019s What Putin Wants.", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Volkov is a Russian journalist.MOSCOW \u2014 Within the last two months, a pair of dancers from Russia\u2019s Bolshoi Ballet were denied American visas because there was a small mistake in their application, and a team of Russian wrestlers missed a competition in the United States because they had filed their papers late.These cases, widely publicized in Russia, can be explained by a cut in the United States Embassy\u2019s staff, which the Russian government demanded last month after Washington expelled Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning in London of a former Russian spy. It was the second such reduction in less than a year; the first came last summer with a tit-for-tat expulsion of American diplomats in Moscow, after the United States ratcheted up sanctions targeting prominent supporters of President Vladimir V. Putin over what Americans insist was Russian meddling in their elections.The difficulties of a few prominent travelers may seem inconsequential, even petty. After all, most Russians have not yet faced such barriers. But these are uneasy times here, when many already fear what rising tensions between the two great powers may bring. To them, even such small incidents hint at an ominous trend \u2014 an escalating tug of war between the two countries\u2019 diplomatic communities that one day could strip Russia\u2019s people of contact with the West.Nikolai Svanidze, a liberal Russian author and a relative of Stalin\u2019s wife, fed those fears recently in an interview in which he said, \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing for the first time is the Iron Curtain being rolled down over Russia not by us, but against us.\u201d In other words, the West is doing its best to isolate us.Is that true? I disagree, but only because this grim tango requires a pair of dancers. The rhythm goes this way: What Americans see as affronts to their sovereignty lead them to tighten restrictions on Russia\u2019s interplay with the global economy, which then leads the Kremlin to push back harder against Washington.And Russians envision ourselves being caught in between, in our darkest imaginings if not yet in reality. Certainly, many here feel that we soon may find ourselves estranged entirely from the West.The scariest thing about that premonition is our ambivalence. Why? Because we hear applause, not weeping, from the Putin elite whom the sanctions were supposed to target. For them, denying all of us contact with the West would be their best revenge.The plain truth is that Russia\u2019s ruling regime is in a political and economic war with the Atlantic community, one that the West takes as a serious threat to its values and policies. I personally believe that the war was started by Mr. Putin\u2019s regime in a quest for political immortality, and in fear of the effects of its own incompetence at building a sound economy, keeping Russians safe from disasters, and emerging cost-free from intrusions abroad.I must admit that pulling a curtain across the West\u2019s border with Russia at this time, which increasingly resembles the Cold War, may be a natural security measure for the West to take. But Americans and Europeans should consider this: Among the things Mr. Putin\u2019s regime most wants is a Russia in which its people are cut off from Western culture, as well as from freedom to travel widely. So if the West responds in ways like slowing down on visas or making ordinary Russians feel unwelcome, the polarizing effect will only please Mr. Putin and his acolytes.While others of us in Russia may be disgusted at the street language and indecent gestures with which hoodlums in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs express themselves, we are dismayed to see the Western elite giving those hoodlums tit-for-tat responses that can be used to unite Russians in new grievances against the West. How much better it would be for us all if both sides could find a way to keep the diplomatic brawling at arm\u2019s length from the Russian people, who suffered enough through the recurrent tragedies of the last century.To be sure, Russians have long experience of being infected by jingoism, a superiority complex and outright aggressiveness. Now gigantic state propaganda campaigns have re-emerged to nurture these moral sins. And again there will be a price to pay.Three decades ago, Russians had reason to hope that they were becoming family members in a world of pro-Western values. Today, air-raid drills and videos of new missiles teach a new generation to live as if a hot war, begun by an antagonistic West, is just around the corner. However unlikely that prospect is, what the younger generation may not yet realize is how real the threat of a new Iron Curtain is, nor how much it would constrict Russia\u2019s future.Personally, I do not count on crossing a lot of borders in the coming years myself, because old age in Russia mostly discourages travel. But I and others who have experienced isolation before are frightened for our children and grandchildren. (Simple people always tend to hope that their children will get a chance for a better life and a wider understanding of the world, you know.)I cannot hope that any recommendation I could make would impress the diplomats, security strategists and political scientists on either side who relish going toe-to-toe as they tamper with the zero-sum intrigue that they call geopolitics. But I can hope that people in the academic world, the media, humanities and science, and all of the \u201cbleeding hearts and artists\u201d outside \u201cThe Wall,\u201d as Pink Floyd might describe them, will hear this cry of concern:Please don\u2019t try to punish Mr. Putin by punishing ordinary people here \u2014 even if you don\u2019t care very much about them. Because you\u2019d be playing right into his hands. Any indiscriminate travel restrictions that the West might put in place would most likely be met with an exuberant tsiganochka dance by Maria Zaharova, the Foreign Ministry\u2019s celebrity spokeswoman.Dmitry Volkov is a Russian journalist based in Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Single-Payer Health Care in California: Here\u2019s What It Would Take", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf wholesale opposition to President Trump is one litmus test for progressive Democrats, another \u2014 as the governor\u2019s race in California is proving \u2014 is health care.All the leading Democratic contenders in the June 5 primary have pledged support for a single-payer system run by the state. The front-runner, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco, has made it the centerpiece of his campaign.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to wait around on universal health care and single-payer in California,\u201d he has declared.\u201cVoters are thinking about the fundamental values associated with single-payer,\u201d said Kelly Hall, an independent health consultant who works with the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers in California, which has endorsed Mr. Newsom. \u201cAlmost zero voters have thought about the policy implications.\u201dIn this case, \u201cimplications\u201d could be another word for booby traps. Even a state as big, wealthy and liberal as California \u2014 with the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and nearly 40 million people \u2014 would find itself hamstrung by money, a legal and regulatory thicket, and highly motivated opposition.Visionary thinking is needed to create an independent, state-run system that\u2019s responsible for every resident\u2019s health care and prescription drugs \u2014 but so is getting the authority, financing and political support.Any state trying a go-it-alone strategy will face challenges possibly more vexing than the ones Congress would confront in passing a nationwide law.To redirect Medicare funds, California would require a federal waiver \u2014 something unlikely to be granted by any administration.Medicare is popular, and federal officials are unlikely to allow a state to engineer a wholesale Medicare takeover. Californians might not be too happy, either. Once California \u2014 and not the federal government \u2014 were to be the single payer, then the current Medicare program would no longer be an option. If would be replaced by a new California version.A bigger stumbling block comes from employer plans, which cover roughly 43 percent of Californians. Federal law, in effect, prohibits states and localities from dictating how private employers that self-insure should structure their plans. So employers unwilling to take part in a California-run insurance system wouldn\u2019t have to.Officials could try to persuade them by offering cheaper coverage and fewer administrative headaches. But if, say, Google and Disney want to stick with the coverage they have, they can. Changing that law would require an act of Congress.Let\u2019s, for the moment, magically eliminate the legal and regulatory roadblocks: Poof! California transfers its share of Medicaid and Medicare money to its own single-payer system, and it convinces every private employer to drop its existing coverage and join.Broader health coverage could also help reduce pricey emergency-room visits and improve preventive care, which could head off more serious illnesses and higher costs down the road.About half that sum could come from existing Medicare and Medicaid dollars, according to the analysis. What employees and employers currently spend would cover another $100 billion to $150 billion. But the remaining $50 billion to $100 billion would require new taxes \u2014 such as a 15 percent payroll tax on earned income.Ardent proponents, like the California Nurses Association, are undeterred. \u201cIt really is about the political will,\u201d said Catherine Kennedy, a longtime nurse who lives in Carmichael, outside of Sacramento. \u201cWe can find the money.\u201d\u201cI do support a single-payer system,\u201d said Steven Cohen, a retired engineer, who lives with his wife, Terri, a retired schoolteacher, in Valencia. Even though he is on Medicare, Mr. Cohen, 71, said a recent switch in his medication for rheumatoid arthritis caused his out-of-pocket drug costs to rise sharply. The insurance and pharmaceutical industries now have too much clout, he said.When asked if he would still support single-payer if it meant higher taxes, however, Mr. Cohen said no: \u201cRaising taxes to offset the cost of health insurance is not the best approach.\u201d And he is unwilling to trade his Medicare coverage for a state-based version, \u201cunless it changes for the better.\u201dOf course, changing the message \u2014 and the details \u2014 can similarly drum up support, or flop those who previously flipped, but the variability shows how quickly voters can turn.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the organization that conducted a survey on public attitudes toward a single-payer national health plan. It was the Kaiser Family Foundation, not Kaiser Permanente. The earlier version also misstated an estimate of the cost of a proposed California bill that would offer free medical care for every resident. It was $331 billion, not $331 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s 150-Year Opioid Epidemic", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Lawson is a\u00a0doctoral candidate at the University of Montana.In researching opium addiction in late-19th-century America, I\u2019ve come across countless stories like Henderson\u2019s. What is striking is how, aside from some Victorian-era moralizing, they feel so familiar to a 21st-century reader: Henderson developed an addiction at a vulnerable point in her life, found doctors who enabled it and then self-destructed. She was just one of thousands of Americans who lost their lives to addiction between the 1870s and the 1920s.The late-19th-century opiate epidemic was nearly identical to the one now spreading across the United States. Back then, doctors began to prescribe a profitable and effective drug \u2014 morphine, taken via hypodermic needle \u2014 too liberally. After a decade of overprescribing it for minor ailments and even for issues related to mental illness, a colony of American junkies began to emerge.Most started out like Ella Henderson, who suffered from emotional trauma and chronic pain, for which she was prescribed copious amounts of morphine. She became addicted, was abandoned by the medical community and judged by her neighbors, and ultimately overdosed alone in her room. Her case mirrors the thousands of fentanyl and heroin overdoses that led President Trump in October to declare opioid abuse a public health emergency.This first outbreak, typically traced to the popularization of hypodermically injected morphine, began to spread in the wake of the Civil War. It was finally contained by state and federal legislation like the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act of 1914 and the Heroin Act of 1924.But addiction did not go away. Pushed underground during the 1930s and \u201940s, widespread abuse re-emerged in the late 1950s and lasted through the 1970s, although in a less severe form than it had in the late 19th century. This time, the answer to the epidemic was a flurry of bills to regulate doctors and pharmacies, or control the dissemination of drugs, while also striking at the overall supply. It worked for the most part, but yet again did not end America\u2019s turbulent relationship with drugs.In response to a limited legal supply, heroin, cocaine and morphine continued to hold sway in the black-market economies of the streets and side alleys. The government responded by adopting a far more punitive approach to the problem, one centered on incarceration and policing. Over a century after Ella Henderson\u2019s overdose, American cities suffered from a crack-cocaine epidemic that, as it waned, gave way to our current \u2014 and decidedly rural \u2014 heroin and fentanyl problem.In the case of the opioid epidemic, history is literally repeating itself. Once again, too many Americans are dying of drug overdoses, and too many already vulnerable communities are being torn apart. Like our predecessors at the turn of the last century, we are asking what can be done to change the situation. Unlike them, we already know the answers. They solved the quandary for us.First, we must hold doctors accountable \u2014 with fines and possible jail sentences \u2014 for overprescribing habit-forming drugs in the interest of profits. That was one of the immediate steps taken in the wake of stories like Henderson\u2019s, and it quickly showed results.We also must understand that if our nation\u2019s health care remains a privatized, for-profit industry, the incentive to sell potent drugs to addicts will always exist. The health care industry was largely unregulated in the late 19th century; \u201cbuyer beware\u201d applied to quack cures as much as to medical advice, and at first there was nothing the government could do to prevent doctors from overprescribing morphine.Eventually, though, legislators stepped in with regulations on morphine and other products. And even though the health care industry is no longer the Wild West, we have lost our appreciation of the power of regulation to stop drug epidemics.There are also lessons that need to be unlearned. While physicians and politicians of the late 19th century made significant progress in arresting the worst features of the opiate epidemic, they tended to overreact when it came to the context of the epidemic. This led to a shameful media campaign against Chinese immigrants, who often kept opium dens, and the demonization of Italians, Russian Jews, African-Americans, Mexicans, teenagers, musicians \u2014 anyone who, according to stereotypes, was among the typical abusers. We do the same today, at our peril.They also allowed the campaign against opium to justify a general attack on all drugs, even those that present a much lower risk to public health. We are only now beginning to roll back excessive laws on cannabis, for example, because it is painfully clear that the reasons behind its prohibition had more to do with racial prejudice and social hysteria than with public health concerns.Too often we imagine that our opioid crisis is new; the fact that it has been around, to varying degrees, for 150 years is a frustrating, even heartbreaking thought. But we can also take inspiration from the fact that we have tackled the problem before, and have won.The difficult part is developing the will to confront the powerful interests that drive overprescription on one hand and overcriminalization on the other. We need politicians willing to impose new laws and to regulate the pharmaceutical and medical marketplaces in a far more disciplined way. This typically happens at the local level first and gradually makes its way into national policy.We have to maintain our emotional composure, avoid press hyperbole and abandon our impulse to racialize the issue. The tendency to incarcerate our problems often results in entire generations of less fortunate Americans leaving high school for jail. If we do not know our drug history, we can be sure there will be many more Ella Hendersons in our future.Clinton Lawson is a doctoral candidate at the University of Montana.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuelans Have No Choice but to Vote", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMHERST, Mass. \u2014 In their efforts to escape authoritarianism, Venezuelans have run out of options. The opposition has tried everything on the books to restore democracy. Nothing has worked. The regime has become more authoritarian with every passing day.Under normal circumstances, the dignified thing to do on May 20 would be to stay home. But these are not normal circumstances. Venezuelans do not really face a choice when it comes to containing the regime, because choice assumes that there are alternatives. There is nothing, at this point, that can stop Mr. Maduro\u2019s authoritarianism.To understand Venezuela\u2019s lack of choice, it helps to review the factors that political scientists have examined as potential causes of authoritarian breakdowns. They range from least to most likely to succeed. In Venezuela, even the most likely to succeed are improbable.So Venezuelans hoping that the economy, sanctions against the government, protest or a military coup will restore democracy might be hoping against hope.The correct question to ask is not whether voting is ideal \u2014 it certainly is not. We should be asking whether voting is better than doing nothing.And even if the opposition doesn\u2019t win, it can still profit from a large turnout. The more the opposition votes, the more the regime will be forced to either cheat on Election Day or acknowledge publicly its electoral weaknesses, both of which will weaken Mr. Maduro within his own movement.But being an insider does not necessarily mean \u201ccontinuism.\u201d In the Spanish-speaking world at least, there are plenty of examples of epochal turnarounds led by insiders-turned-president.Venezuelans should take advantage of this opening rather than deride it. The worst that can happen is that things don\u2019t change. But the best that can happen is that once again, an insider will rise and become a transformer. By abstaining, Venezuelans throw away this chance.Many Venezuelans are tempted to abstain. I sympathize with them. Like them, I wish Venezuelans had a Nelson Mandela, a Lech Walesa or a Vaclav Havel \u2014 leaders with impeccable democratic credentials, distant from the regime, competing in fair elections and delivering democracy, almost overnight. But this clean exit is unavailable in Venezuela.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Uncertainty Lingers, Italy\u2019s Populists May Give Talks Another Shot", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNor was the fact that Mr. Mattarella had only days ago called on Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund official and spending hawk, to form a technical government to guide Italy to a new election.Mr. Cottarelli, who is unlikely to win a confidence vote in Parliament, had informal morning and afternoon meetings with Mr. Mattarella in the Quirinal Palace. But instead of presenting a list of cabinet picks, he apparently decided to hold off to see if the parties that won a majority of the votes in elections in March could find a way out of their impasse, according to the Italian news agency ANSA late Tuesday night.The developments for which Mr. Cottarelli was waiting were still developing Wednesday afternoon, but they seemed to reflect a significant shift of power within the populist alliance.Nevertheless, he met with Mr. Mattarella, the president he had only days earlier called responsible for the darkest night in Italian democracy.In one of his now regularly scheduled Facebook Live video streams after the meeting, Mr. Di Maio proposed that Paolo Savona, the eurosceptic economist whom Mr. Mattarella found objectionable as finance minister, take on another position in the cabinet and that an unidentified new choice \u201cof the same caliber\u201d take the position of finance minister.He said that his party was on board with this solution, and \u201cnow it depends on the other political force,\u201d meaning the League. \u201cIf they are O.K. with it,\u201d he said, the alliance would ask Mr. Mattarella to allow their alliance\u2019s original choice for prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, to try to form a government.With his support skyrocketing over the course of the more than 85 days of negotiations, he continued to call for new elections as he hit the campaign trail in Pisa, Genoa and other Italian cities on Wednesday, assuring his supporters that one way or another, the League would end up in the government.But simultaneous negotiations with the Five Star Movement seemed to center on a top official in his party, Giancarlo Giorgetti, taking the position of prime minister. Some analysts speculated that Mr. Salvini coveted the position himself, and that he had the leverage of Mr. Savona, and his own popularity, to force the Five Star leadership to accept.The Five Star Movement, reluctant to give up its primacy in the alliance, after winning nearly a third of the Italian vote, is resisting, according to reports in the Italian press. And Mr. Mattarella, who is very much an audience of one for all of the political performances, would also have to sign off.The very notion of a government taking power in Italy seemed to assure the markets after Italian bonds, especially short-term ones, plummeted in the markets. The fears of new elections leading to an exit from the euro prompted the most significant dip in two-year yields in more than 20 years.Central to the populists\u2019 case for receiving a mandate from Mr. Mattarella is their assertion that they never wanted to leave the euro. \u201cIf the markets fear that Italy leave the euro, it\u2019s because someone put around that rumor that this government wanted to leave the euro, but our will was never that,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said Tuesday night. \u201cWe have never conspired to leave the euro, never!\u201d he said in his Facebook post.But the internet is rife with examples of Mr. Di Maio, his party\u2019s co-founder Beppe Grillo, and other top Five Star officials calling either for a referendum on the euro or for leaving the currency outright.In one video, a dejected young Italian looks sadly at the euro in his hand and tosses it into a fountain. He then imagines all the buying power he\u2019d have with a 1,000 lire bill. Then the camera focuses on high-heeled boots moving toward him on the cobblestones, and scans up to reveal a top Five Star official, Paola Taverna, appearing like a fairy godmother. She turns the euro in his hand into that 1,000 lire bill, and tells him that the Five Star Movement can make his dreams come true and it is \u201cpossible to leave the euro.\u201d A thousand lira would be valued at a fraction of a euro.Mr. Salvini said this week that neither he, nor his pick for finance minister, wanted to leave the euro. But in prior interviews, Mr. Salvini has clearly stated he wanted Italy out of the euro and has even failed to rule out leaving the European Union.In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Salvini said: \u201cLeave the euro? Surely yes. Tomorrow morning. Once the monetary sovereignty is retaken, one can make a last attempt to renegotiate all of the treaties, Maastricht, Schengen, Dublin and Lisbon.\u201d Those treaties are the lifeblood of the European Union.Amid a remarkably fluid and high-stakes situation, Italian analysts contemplated a variety of outcomes. Anything seemed possible for the moment, and if Mr. Mattarella decided that the country should go to new elections, either this summer or in early fall, it was not clear what the alliances would be.If Five Star and the League entered into new elections as an alliance and vowed not to leave the euro, which is still relatively popular in Italy, they were nearly assured a landslide victory.The League would also have the flexibility to reunite with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in the center-right coalition with which it ran in March, but this time its nearly 30 percent of the vote, according to recent polls, would make it the undisputed leader of that alliance.Speaking at one of his many campaign events across Italy on Wednesday, Mr. Salvini told an adoring crowd, \u201cMy patience is at the limit.\u201d He was not alone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Political Crisis: The Danger It Poses for the Global Economy", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne thing that has become clear over the last decade is how effects can spread unpredictably across countries in times of financial disruption.Italian political dysfunction is nothing new. Italian political dysfunction that ripples through global financial markets and has the potential to upend Europe is something the world woke up to Tuesday morning.What are markets really signaling, and how much danger is there for the global economy? To answer, it helps to tease apart the crosscurrents between Italian politics, European institutions, financial markets and economies worldwide.The Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, rejected an anti-E.U. nominee for economy minister, setting the stage for elections later in the year that, if a recent pattern repeats, could put in place a parliamentary majority that is hostile to European institutions.In effect, those events have made it more likely that there will be a showdown between authorities in Rome and officials in Brussels, Berlin and Frankfurt over deficit spending, with an unraveling of the European Union one potential outcome, even if not the most likely one.New Italian elections would help decide whether that is the case. In the last elections, in March, populist parties skeptical of European institutions won a comfortable majority of seats in parliament, but included both right-wing and left-wing parties that have struggled since then to form a coalition.If the populists maintain or expand their advantages in elections, it raises the prospect of serious friction between Italian politicians looking to increase spending and a European Commission, European Central Bank and German government that insist upon fiscal austerity as a condition for, among other things, continued E.C.B. purchases of Italian bonds.The movements Tuesday \u2014 a spike in Italian bond yields, and drops in the euro and stocks worldwide \u2014 suggest that the risk of some calamitous outcome for Europe has risen after a weekend of political drama in Rome, but that it\u2019s still an unlikely outcome. So far, there are few signs of \u201ccontagion effects,\u201d in which developments in Italy could create a self-fulfilling crisis in other countries with similar economic challenges. But Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone (and fourth largest in Europe, after Germany, Britain and France) and has one of the largest piles of public debt in the world. A crisis there could endanger banks and investment portfolios everywhere.The Italian government\u2019s borrowing costs for two years soared from 0.94 percent to 2.42 percent Tuesday, as investors demanded greater compensation against the risk that the Italian government might repay them not with the rock-solid euro but with less valuable newly issued currency.Meanwhile, Spanish two-year bond yields rose only slightly Tuesday \u2014 by 0.07 percentage points, not the 1.48 percentage points of Italian yields.\u201cThe contagion has been really muted,\u201d said Megan Greene, global chief economist at Manulife Asset Management. \u201cI think investors are correctly looking at this as an Italy-specific risk for now.\u201dOther European countries, especially powerful Germany, will have little desire to subsidize what they view as fiscal profligacy in Italy. The push toward greater economic unity across Europe since the Greek crisis has included jointly guaranteeing the continent\u2019s banks and the E.C.B.\u2019s purchase of government bonds.If there is conflict, both sides have reason to work things out. Germany and European institutions certainly don\u2019t want a crackup of the eurozone. And within Italy, the economic consequences of peeling away from Europe \u2014 high inflation and lost savings in the near term and the long-term growth consequences from being a less appealing place for investment \u2014 are severe enough that there would be reason to strike a deal.Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro, puts the chance that Italy will exit the euro at only around 10 percent to 15 percent. He argues in a research note that European institutions will probably seek to de-escalate the tensions in the coming months.So far the damage to markets outside Italy is mostly limited to a sell-off in global stock markets, including a 1.2 percent drop in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index Tuesday. As is often the case when the rest of the world looks risky, money flowed into Treasury bonds, lowering interest rates in the United States.No doubt Italy has the most at risk economically, followed by the rest of Europe. But one thing that has become clear over the last decade is how effects can spread unpredictably in times of financial disruption.For the last decade, the world has experienced a rolling series of crises, in which financial turmoil fuels economic despair which intensifies political dysfunction which \u2014 through financial markets \u2014 can spread across oceans and repeat the pattern.No one would have thought that a crisis centered on home mortgages in the United States would prove the trigger for crises in Greece and across Europe all those years ago. If things go badly in Italy, there\u2019s no telling where the damage could end up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Make Money Like a C.E.O.? Work for 275 Years", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Walmart employee earning the company\u2019s median salary of $19,177 would have to work for more than a thousand years to earn the $22.2 million that Doug McMillon, the company\u2019s chief executive, was awarded in 2017.At Live Nation Entertainment, the concert and ticketing company, an employee earning the median pay of $24,406 would need to work for 2,893 years to earn the $70.6 million that its chief executive, Michael Rapino, made last year.And at Time Warner, where the median compensation is a relatively handsome $75,217, an employee earning that much would still need to work for 651 years to earn the $49 million that Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive, earned in just 12 months.This year, publicly traded corporations in the United States had to begin revealing their pay ratios \u2014 comparisons between the pay of their chief executive and the median compensation of other employees at the company. The results were predictably striking.\u201cIt\u2019s grotesque how unequal this has become,\u201d said Louis Hyman, a business historian at Cornell University. \u201cFor C.E.O.s, it\u2019s like they are winning the lottery year after year. For a lot of Americans, they don\u2019t have any savings. When they lose their job, they lose everything.\u201dLive Nation and Time Warner did not reply to requests for comment. After publication of this article, Walmart said it was increasing wages for low-paid workers.As glaring as the ratios may seem, they tell an incomplete story. Some companies reported very low ratios and relatively high median incomes, but rely on outsourced labor for important tasks. Other companies that reported very high ratios employ many workers overseas where pay is far lower than in the United States. And not all companies have reported their pay ratios.\u201cAs much as these numbers reveal, they also hide,\u201d said Mr. Hyman, who in August will publish \u201cTemp,\u201d a book about gig workers and the proliferation of part-time labor. \u201cIt all depends on who you consider to be an employee in this new economy.\u201dFor example, Mattel, the toy company, owns its factories overseas and employs thousands of low-paid workers in Asia. As a result, Mattel reported the second-highest ratio on the Equilar list: The chief executive\u2019s pay was 4,987 times that of the median employee.Contrast that with Incyte, a drugmaker with the lowest ratio on the Equilar list. The chief executive of Incyte made just 64 times what the median employee earned. But unlike Mattel, Incyte outsources its factory work, allowing it to keep its work force small and its median pay high.At least some compensation experts harbor a hopeful view that over time, sustained scrutiny of the income gap might lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth.\u201cThis could have beneficial results about how companies communicate with their employees,\u201d said Jannice Koors, an executive compensation consultant at Pearl Meyer. \u201cIn a good year, if the C.E.O.\u2019s pay goes up, does the median employee\u2019s pay go up, too? Does the company have profit-sharing that goes deep enough into the organization that the median employee is getting equity grants?\u201d\u201cParticularly in low-wage jobs, people are struggling to pay for housing, for health insurance, for child care,\u201d said Jennifer Gordon, a law professor at Fordham University. \u201cWhen people are working two and three jobs and are not able to put together a decent wage, then at a very basic level they don\u2019t have time to be active in their children\u2019s schools, they don\u2019t have the ability to engage in their local politics.\u201dAnd still, executive pay, already excessive in the eyes of many critics, rises.Here are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.For the first time, two chief executives on the list were awarded more than $100 million each. Hock Tan of Broadcom received $103.2 million, while Frank Bisignano of First Data earned $102.2 million.In 2017, the median pay for the 200 highest-paid chief executives was $17.5 million, and they received an average raise of 14 percent, compared with 9 percent in 2016 and 5 percent the year before that.Among the 160 companies of that group that revealed pay ratios, the median compensation for chief executives was also $17.5 million. In contrast, workers earned $75,217, a decent salary in a country with a shrinking middle class, but one that further demonstrates the growing gap between the C-suite and the typical employee. Equilar calculated that the median pay ratio disclosed by these companies was 275 to 1.In defending these lavish awards, companies are quick to point out that much of this compensation is in stock, that many of the biggest awards represent long-term incentive plans, and that in some cases, the stock vests only if the company\u2019s share price hits certain targets. As a result, they argue that the value of annual compensation packages can turn out to be much lower than initially stated.That logic cuts both ways. If the stock does well, the total value of these compensation plans can be even greater than the large sums first reported.In theory, such plans encourage chief executives to focus on creating value for shareholders. And at times, that pay seems to mirror the fortunes of the company. At Morgan Stanley, for example, shares were up about 20 percent last year, while James P. Gorman, the company\u2019s chief executive, received a 16 percent pay rise.\u201cThe design of executive compensation continues to emphasize shareholder alignment,\u201d said Brian Blackwood, an executive compensation consultant at Willis Towers Watson. \u201cWhen shareholders prosper, executives will benefit, and vice versa.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t always work out that way. Shares of TripAdvisor fell by roughly a third last year. Nonetheless, the company\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Kaufer, was awarded a long-term incentive package worth some $43.2 million.David T. Hamamoto, a former C.E.O. who until January was the executive vice chairman of Colony Northstar, a real estate company, was awarded $53 million last year.

By last month, only 3.9 percent of working-age Americans who sought a job didn\u2019t have one.You are welcome.I\u2019m kidding, of course. How could anybody claim credit for the performance of something as vast and complex as the American labor market? My columns probably didn\u2019t have anything to do with the doubling of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, either, or even with the sixfold rise in digital-only subscriptions to The New York Times.To the contrary, as I write what will be the last column of my tenure, I can\u2019t help but acknowledge how little purchase my writing has had on the substance of reality. In particular, it has had no discernible effect on what one might call America\u2019s fundamental paradox.The United States is one of the richest, most technologically advanced nations in the history of humanity. And yet it accepts \u2014 proudly defends, even \u2014 a degree of social dysfunction that would be intolerable in any other rich society.Well, inequality hasn\u2019t abated much. In 2015, the richest 1 percent of American taxpayers drew more than 20 percent of the nation\u2019s income, including capital gains, according to the tabulations by the French scholar Thomas Piketty and his colleague Emmanuel Saez.This set of facts seems to me problematic. Your heart doesn\u2019t even have to bleed to care. The United States risks its prosperity by leaving so many Americans behind.Global inequality, after widening for decades, has stabilized. The share of the world\u2019s income captured by the top 1 percent has shrunk since its peak on the eve of the financial crisis.And yet for all the ink spilled by so many excellent journalists \u2014 from The Times\u2019s own Neil Irwin to Vox\u2019s Matt Yglesias, Bloomberg\u2019s Noah Smith and many others \u2014 America is doubling down on its exceptionalism. The rich got a tax break. Bankers got a break from the pesky rules written in the shadow of the financial crisis to protect the little guy. The poor and near poor were freed from their ability to afford health insurance.And yet writing is, in fact, indispensable. It is because of the writing of journalists and social scientists \u2014 economists and political scientists, historians and sociologists \u2014 that we know what we know about the workings of American society, its economy and its political system.To my colleagues in journalism, I owe the deepest debt of gratitude. From them I have learned how important it is to shine light on power. In this peculiar political moment, as the powerful promote self-serving realities, hoping to bend perceptions to their will, my colleagues\u2019 work to communicate a reality undistorted by political ambition amounts to the last line of defense against autocracy.I will miss writing the column. But I relish the opportunity this opens to write in another form, free of a column\u2019s weekly demands to explore the drama of American life in greater depth.I will be devoting the next few weeks to figuring out what to focus on next \u2014 chatting with my editors, as well as with the sources I have come to rely on for sober, authoritative thinking.

The lawyer, Chen Youxi, said the Shanghai High People\u2019s Court was already preparing for a review.Although the post was subsequently taken down, Mr. Chen\u2019s law firm, Capital Equity Legal Group, said the information was accurate.If Mr. Wu goes through with it, an appeal will be a high-profile test of a court system that convicts nearly everyone prosecutors accuse and that often takes a dim view of open confrontation to its rulings. In pushing back, he could goad the courts into an even harsher sentence.Mr. Wu\u2019s company, Anbang Insurance Group, was seized in February in a case that offered a glimpse at some of the big risks hidden within China\u2019s vast but troubled financial system. His prosecution was widely interpreted as an effort by Beijing to make an example of a firm that had become emblematic of a spree of debt-fueled overseas purchases by Chinese companies.Despite his guilty plea, Wednesday\u2019s post represents the second time that Mr. Wu has disputed the Chinese government\u2019s charges against him. In a March court appearance, he said he did not know whether what he had done constituted a crime, according to the court. But just hours later, it said, he pleaded guilty.Defendants may have little choice. Historically, China\u2019s conviction rate has hovered at well above 90 percent, though more recent statistics are harder to come by. Between 2013 and 2017, Chinese trial courts convicted more than six million suspects in about 5.5 million cases. Only about 6,700 were reopened and retried.In Mr. Wu\u2019s case, he was charged with misleading investors with false financial statements and promotional materials, among other accusations.Prosecutors said Mr. Wu had helped design investment-type insurance products and then misled regulators in efforts to raise money from the public. By the beginning of 2017 the company had sold $116.5 billion of the products, far more than the amount the government had approved. China has been trying to rein in such borrowing, which it fears could destabilize the economy.Because of the company\u2019s sprawling international holdings, the seizure sent shock waves as far as Canada, where the company had bought a chain of retirement homes, and Amsterdam, where it had bought an insurance company.Anbang has said that Mr. Wu has been relieved from all duties as chairman of the company and that its operations are under state supervision.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Delays Tariffs on E.U., Canada and Mexico for 30 Days", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration said on Monday that it would delay a decision to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on the European Union, Canada and Mexico for another 30 days, giving key allies a reprieve as the White House tries to extract concessions from trading partners who have resisted those demands.The extension reflects concerns by the Trump administration of a swift retaliation on American products by European Union nations, and will also give the Trump administration more breathing room to work on a separate trade battle with China.The reprieve will come as a relief to major American allies that were bracing for damage to their economy from lower sales of metals into the United States. But it could fuel criticism that Mr. Trump is more bark than bite and increase the pressure on the White House to squeeze concessions from other nations.In recent weeks, American negotiators have pressed allies to restrain their own metal shipments to the United States voluntarily in exchange for having the tariffs lifted.\u201cIn all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment and protect the national security,\u201d the White House said in its statement Monday evening.But officials have also embarked on unrelated trade discussions. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been charged with negotiating with the European Union, had been pushing for the bloc to reduce its tariffs on imported cars and lower its trade surplus with the United States.Foreign allies and companies that source steel and aluminum from abroad were left in suspense about how the tariffs deadline would play out until late Monday and were fretting about the uncertainty created by the situation.So far, European officials have held firm to their insistence that the trade measures violate international trading law. The temporary extension is unlikely to satisfy the European Union, whose leaders have said they do not want to negotiate under threat and have demanded a permanent and unconditional exemption from the tariffs.If the tariffs do go into effect after the 30-day reprieve, Europe has promised swift retaliation. It has drawn up a lengthy list of American products it would penalize in return, including orange juice, cranberries, motorcycles and bluejeans. It has also asked to join a dispute China brought at the World Trade Organization against the steel and aluminum tariffs.\u201cThe U.S. decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions,\u201d the European Union said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe E.U. should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security.\u201dIn a statement, the British government said the move was \u201cpositive,\u201d while the Australian government said that it \u201cwill ensure our trade relationship continues to grow in a fair and reciprocal manner.\u201dAn extension of the tariff deadline was more widely expected for Canada and Mexico, which are still in negotiations with the United States over Nafta. Although differences of opinion remain, officials from the countries insist they are making quick progress toward a goal of concluding their talks by the end of May.Canada and Mexico have said that putting tariffs in place in the middle of these discussions could upend delicate negotiations. On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that his country would secure an exemption, arguing that the Trump administration understood that tariffs on Canada would hurt jobs on both sides of the shared border.The administration has also been in talks with Japan, the largest American ally to be left off the initial list of countries that were granted a temporary exemption from the tariffs \u2014 in part because of the country\u2019s trade patterns, including a large surplus with the United States, but also because the Trump administration hoped to urge the country into one-on-one trade talks.The monthlong reprieve prolongs the state of uncertainty hanging over the global economy, making it difficult for businesses to plan and discouraging them from investing in new factories or hiring more workers.That unpredictability has plagued even steel and aluminum companies that support the measure. Todd Leebow, the president and chief executive of Majestic Steel USA, which buys and sells American-made steel, said the tariffs were already helping to revive the American industry. Still, he noted that his customers did not know where they would be able to purchase metals from, and where prices might head.\u201cFrom an industry perspective, the challenge that we have is it creates uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Leebow said.But some said the measures are helping accomplish one of the administration\u2019s major goals: combating an overcapacity of metals from China. The European Union and Canada, among others, have introduced steeper measures in recent months to crack down on cheap flows of steel into their markets, and to stop China from shipping steel through their countries to the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s some evidence that the approach is working,\u201d said Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which supports the metal restrictions. He said that temporary exemptions did not worry him, but that they should not be left in place indefinitely or unconditionally.Other nations affected by the tariffs have not been so optimistic.In Europe, the tariffs have driven down steel prices, as countries that did not receive exemptions, like Russia, Turkey and India, redirect their shipments from the United States.The flood of imports has hit the European steel industry just as it is bouncing back from a crisis that began five years ago and was caused by steel sold at dumping prices by Chinese producers.\u201cThey are worried that another wave of imports could throw the industry back into crisis mode,\u201d Martin Theuringer, the managing director of the German Steel Federation, an industry group, said of European steel makers.Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt and Isabella Kwai from Sydney, Australia.Advertisement"}

And for added measure, Mr. Trump brought Vice President Mike Pence, a native Hoosier and a former governor of the state, with him to the gymnasium.Mr. Trump\u2019s only misstep came when he praised Bill Belichick, the coach of the New England Patriots. \u201cNo, no, we like him,\u201d Mr. Trump said to appease the booing crowd, presumably Indianapolis Colts fans.But the crowd enthusiastically bought the president\u2019s pitch, even if Barack Obama successfully sold that brand of flattery here first.Elkhart, on the northern edge of Indiana, is a manufacturing town where recreational vehicle assembly has long been the bread and butter of the local economy. A decade ago, amid the Great Recession, and when the town had one of the fastest-rising unemployment rates in the United States, Mr. Obama often made campaign stops here during his primary race against Hillary Clinton.Taking a chance on Mr. Obama\u2019s message of hope in 2008, Indiana swung Democratic for the first time in decades.But Elkhart went from having double-digit unemployment rates to less than 3 percent, with the most drastic improvement happening while Mr. Obama was in office. On Thursday, however, the mention of Mr. Obama\u2019s name was met with sustained jeers.Indeed, in recent years, the state\u2019s electoral map has veered back to the right. And Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign appears to have effectively steamrolled much of the Obama-era good will.Dan Holtz, the chairman of the Elkhart County Republican Party, said in an interview that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d messaging \u2014 and candidates like Mr. Braun, who carry a version of that message \u2014 resonate in a stronger way with voters than the Obama administration\u2019s story of Elkhart\u2019s recovery ever did.\u201cElkhart has always been sort of a boom and bust town,\u201d Mr. Holtz said. \u201cThere\u2019s no serious person here who credits Obama with that recovery.\u201dDemocrats in the area say Mr. Trump is trying to take credit for the past administration\u2019s progress.\u201cThe numbers tell a clear story, that Elkhart\u2019s amazing recovery in many was the story of the Obama economy,\u201d said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., a Democrat.Mr. Trump, he said, was leaning hard on nostalgia that somehow would magically restore the manufacturing center, which the mayor said was a false hope.\u201cTrying to turn the clock back socially, economically and racially to the \u201950s, that\u2019s attractive to some people,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cBut the alternative is to move to the future.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in Indiana may have different ideas of what they want their political future to be, a point emphasized by the president and vice president during their speeches Thursday night.\u201cThe truth is our administration has faced unprecedented obstruction by Democrats,\u201d Mr. Pence said, \u201cincluding Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s O.K. that the president and vice president are here today for politics, but problems only get solved when you roll up your sleeves and put in the hard work,\u201d Mr. Donnelly said. \u201cI\u2019m Indiana\u2019s hired help in the Senate because I don\u2019t work for any president or any political party \u2014 I work for Hoosiers, and that will never change.\u201dMr. Donnelly may face an uphill battle persuading them. As Mr. Holtz, the local Republican chairman put it, Democrats are increasingly viewed as obstructionists in the Senate, a sign that the Trump administration\u2019s messaging on the subject may be working at the local level.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s triumphant message of recovery, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen people as angry as they are now\u201d over key issues, particularly over the cost of their health care, Mr. Holtz said.Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Pence reminded the crowd, had voted against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.Michael Tackett contributed reporting from South Bend, Ind.Advertisement"}

Mr. Macron promised to set up closed-circuit televisions in slaughterhouses and to ban the sale of eggs from caged hens by 2022, two of L214\u2019s top priorities.But while French lawmakers are debating a law on agriculture and nutrition this week, Mr. Macron\u2019s government has watered down the former campaign promises, dashing L214\u2019s hopes that they could make inroads with the support of political leaders.So its activists, taking a page from the playbook of similarly minded groups in other countries, including the United States, are stepping up a campaign of guerrilla tactics, hoping to shock the Parliament into amending the government\u2019s proposed law.Ms. Gothi\u00e8re and Mr. Arsac said their organization was part of the activist\u2019s legacy (Mr. Spira died in 1998). They founded L214 in 2007, naming it after the article of the French rural code that defines animals as sentient beings and that requires their owners to treat them with respect.With 50 employees and 2,000 volunteers throughout the country, the organization has tried a mix of working with companies or institutions, and pressuring them through bad publicity when negotiations don\u2019t work.The public outcry compelled the government to investigate the country\u2019s slaughterhouses and to acknowledge problems in 30 percent of them, including unsafe workplace conditions and a failure to follow slaughtering rules.\u201cLike Spira, our goal is to make progress one step at a time, to push the peanut forward,\u201d said Ms. Gothi\u00e8re, citing the Ernest-Soulard trial or the ban on battery eggs as examples of breakthroughs that \u201cdon\u2019t resolve everything yet helps reduce animal suffering.\u201d\u201cFor many years, France was rather backwards in terms of its thinking of animals,\u201d he said in a Skype interview. \u201cBut L214 has made a lot of progress based on the methods of Spira, who showed the animal movement that it was possible to win against big corporations and revered institutions.\u201dYet L214\u2019s methods have failed to convince politicians, and their demands have angered many who see in animal products a vital component of France\u2019s culture and economy.\u201cThe animal industry didn\u2019t wait for L214 to tackle animal welfare,\u201d said Jean-Baptiste Moreau, a lawmaker from Mr. Macron\u2019s party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche, and the commissionner of the agriculture and nutrition bill, referring to efforts by the livestock industry to improve animal welfare.As a sign that L214 is fighting an uphill battle against politicians, a majority of lawmakers have chosen to ignore the organization\u2019s call for CCTV in slaughterhouses to defend those who work there.\u201cWhat kind of downward spiral are we going to have if we start filming the employees?\u201d Sandrine Le Feur, a farmer and lawmaker of Mr. Macron\u2019s party, said on the television channel LCP.Mr. Moreau, a former slaughterhouse manager and farmer who divides his time between the Parliament in Paris and his farm in the Creuse area of central France, where he has 100 cows, said he refused to negotiate with L214, which he called an \u201cextremist organization\u201d that looked to harm farmers with \u201cfascistic methods.\u201dHis criticism of L214 echoed a widespread animosity among meat professionals, who argue that the practices the organization denounced represented a tiny minority of slaughterhouses.\u201cL214\u2019s cause isn\u2019t animal welfare, but the abolition of animal farming,\u201d said Marc Pag\u00e8s, director of Interbev, a national organization of meat and cattle professionals.Mr. Pag\u00e8s and Mr. Moreau argued that the priority was elsewhere. \u201cThe end of animal farming would result in the extinction of any life in the countryside,\u201d Mr. Moreau said.Indeed, L214\u2019s ultimate aims would be revolutionary in a country that so cherishes its meat. Ms. Gothi\u00e8re said that only a vegan society would amount to success, but that small steps were progress.\u201cWhen I see how our societies are still struggling with racism or sexism, I\u2019m not very optimistic that I will see the end of spiecism in my lifetime,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I\u2019m not desperate either.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He called the closed section an \u201cerosional hot spot\u201d and said the city has battled it for years, before problems caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.How the Rockaways got to this point is a story of inaction and finger-pointing between New York City officials and the Army Corps of Engineers, whose mission includes reducing risk in coastal areas, and which has played a large role in restoring the region\u2019s coastline after Hurricane Sandy.Long before Sandy hit, beach erosion in the Rockaways had been a continuing concern; a federal study of additional storm protections for the area, including the possibility of more stone groynes \u2014 jetty-like structures that are perpendicular to shore and trap sand \u2014 was ordered in 2003, but was delayed for years because of lack of funding.Things appeared to be on the upswing, as Mr. de Blasio demonstrated his interest in bolstering the Rockaways in other ways. A new ferry line brings towel-toting hordes from Manhattan and Brooklyn to the thin peninsula\u2019s beaches. The mayor has visited the Rockaways to tout its revitalization in two of the last three years in advance of the start of the summer season.But many have noticed the retreating sands; some accuse the Army Corps of dragging its feet in the Rockaways while helping wealthier beach communities on Long Island and elsewhere.\u201cI said we need to come to a vision together,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \u201cWe are absolutely convinced that there\u2019s nothing we can do on our own that will have a lasting impact.\u201dA spokesman for the Army Corps, Michael Embrich, said in a statement that the beaches were designed \u201cfor flood-risk reduction to provide protection for the communities,\u201d adding that they \u201cperformed well during the last storm season in the face of four nor\u2019easters.\u201dRecreational use, Mr. Embrich said, is the jurisdiction of the city.The subject came up again at a City Council hearing last month concerning the Park Department\u2019s budget. \u201cI need sand in Rockaway,\u201d Councilman Eric Ulrich, a Republican, said then.\u201cWe agree that there is sand needed at specific parts of the beach in Rockaway,\u201d Mr. Kavanaugh replied, but he said it would not be prudent for the city to spend its own money to dump sand into the ocean.City officials say the severe series of winter storms that buffeted the coastline this year are the reason the beaches experienced worse-than-expected erosion after their study had found a robust beachfront.All the while, residents of the Rockaways watched as the sands eroded in plain view of one of the busiest sections of the beach.In the interview, Mr. Kavanaugh estimated that about 250,000 cubic yards of sand might be necessary to replenish the problematic section, at a possible cost of $10 million, but he cautioned that the city had not done a formal estimate of how much it would cost.Temporary fencing, erected this spring, now blocks off entrances to the beach \u2014 though in many sections it has been cut, rolled up or pushed to the side. Sunbathers abound, squeezed up near the dunes during high tide on Wednesday afternoon.In the areas where groynes are present, there has been less erosion. But in the section without them, the sands washed away.\u201cTrains stop here; the buses \u2014 this is considered the middle of the beach,\u201d said Fred Catapano, 74, who lounged in a blue beach chair in the Wednesday sun on a closed section of beach. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to take my favorite spot away from us.\u201dHis 79-year-old brother, Joe, sat nodding next to him; for 40 years they have been coming from nearby Howard Beach to sunbathe. On Saturday, Parks Department officers will be directed to keep them, and others, off the sand.Closing the beach was a decision made for safety reasons, Mr. de Blasio said at the news conference, adding that it had come so late because \u201cwe were hoping against hope we could find another outcome.\u201dRepresentative Gregory W. Meeks, a Democrat who represents the area, faulted the city for poor communication that he said had prevented local and federal officials from working together to find a way to open the entire beach. \u201cWe could have been talking about it,\u201d he said, and possibly \u201cfound some money.\u201dThe local economy in Rockaway Beach is seasonal, a three-month bastion of beach culture a train ride from Times Square. At the pastel-painted concessions at Beach 97th Street, Jordan Wolff, 29, said she decided to open a \u201csurf and turf shack\u201d this year, her first foray into business ownership. She had no warning from the city, to whom her rent ultimately goes.\u201cI would have taken that into account,\u201d said Ms. Wolff, who like the others who rent beachfront concessions from the city were told about the beach changes on Monday, just before it was announced publicly. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good year to open a business.\u201dAlong the boardwalk on Wednesday, a new wooden fence marked \u201ctemporarily closed\u201d blocked an otherwise unobstructed view of the water from the picnic tables outside the Low Tide Bar.Its owner, Michael Powers, 38, talked of business considerations \u2014 \u201cour entertainment is booked already\u201d \u2014 and waxed philosophical about the notion of owning a stretch of beach or barring city residents from the waters. \u201cIt belongs to the people,\u201d he said.One possible solution that he shared with the Parks Department earlier in the day: Allow surfers like himself to extend their narrow space into the closed section \u2014 since lifeguards do not watch the surfers anyway \u2014 and create a large surfing beach that would be a draw even if the beach is going to be closed to swimmers for years. (Surfing is already permitted from Beach 87th to Beach 92nd Streets, just east of the closed area.) A Parks official said the idea was being considered.In the meantime, Mr. Powers said, \u201cwe\u2019re going business as usual.\u201dJeffrey C. Mays contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

A Former Top Official Says \u2018Maybe\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf cryptocurrency and blockchain technology really are the future of money, the world\u2019s central banks need to get involved, a former Fed governor argues.Many enthusiasts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are motivated by deep skepticism of the central banks that control the world\u2019s money supply.But what if central banks themselves entered the game? What would happen if the Federal Reserve, or the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan used blockchain technology to create their own virtual currencies? Besides, that is, having some cryptocurrency fans\u2019 heads explode?A former Fed governor \u2014 who was also a finalist to lead the central bank \u2014 thinks the idea deserves serious consideration.If he had returned to the Fed, Mr. Warsh said, he would have appointed a team \u201cto think about the Fed creating FedCoin, where we would bring legal activities into a digital coin.\u201d\u201cNot that it would supplant and replace cash,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it would be a pretty effective way when the next crisis happens for us to maybe conduct monetary policy.\u201dHe added that blockchain technology, which allows reliable, decentralized record keeping of transactions, could be useful in the payment systems operated by the Fed, which enable the transfer of trillions of dollars between banks.\u201cIt strikes me that a central bank digital currency might have a role to play there,\u201d Mr. Warsh, who is now a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, told several reporters Thursday evening.Some central banks are already doing work in this vein, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Bank of England. And Mr. Powell acknowledged the potential applications in his confirmation hearing for the Fed chairmanship in November, saying, \u201cWe actually look at blockchain as something that may have significant applications in the wholesale payments part of the economy.\u201dIt would be quite a twist if a technology whose most ardent fans are motivated by distrust of central banks became a key tool for those banks. But it would address some of the concerns connected to Bitcoin and its many privately created rivals. To the degree that the value of existing cryptocurrencies fluctuates wildly, they are ill-suited as a medium of exchange. Central banks have spent hundreds of years learning how to keep the value of money stable.And to the degree Bitcoin and the like facilitate tax evasion, money laundering and fraud, they will be a target of global law enforcement. Central banks are used to building systems that allow enforcement of those laws.It\u2019s clear that central banks weighing use of blockchain technology don\u2019t share the more anarchist impulses of some of the most die-hard cryptocurrency enthusiasts. But there may be more commonality than it might seem. As Mr. Warsh argues, if people really do believe that digital currencies in some form are the future of money, it would behoove central banks to treat them as more than a novelty.\u201cCongress gave the Fed a monopoly over money,\u201d Mr. Warsh said. \u201cAnd if the next generation of cryptocurrencies look more like money and less like gold \u2014 and have less volatility associated with them so they would be not just a speculative asset but could be a reliable unit of account \u2014 as a purely defensive matter I wouldn\u2019t want somebody to take that monopoly from me.\u201dIn other words, if cryptocurrency enthusiasts are correct that this technology could become a better way of carrying out even routine transactions, the Fed and its counterparts are the institutions that have the most to lose.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australia Is Rich, Strong and Afraid of the World", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 57______Last year, I went to Canberra for the festivities. This year I did not, which gave me a chance to focus on one element of the budget announcement: Australia\u2019s relationship to the wider world.A few items that factor into the equation (with figures in Australian dollars):So what does this all add up to?At first glance, it looked to me like a Trumpian shift \u2014 or at least a continued slide away from treating the world as a stage of opportunity and toward a focus on global threats.I checked that premise with a few experts to see if I was reading the numbers right.The context is striking. Australia is strong not weak, in its 27th year of economic growth, with a government surplus on the way and an economy nearly as large as Russia\u2019s.But by 2030, it is projected to slide the economic rankings and instead of pushing itself and its values further into the world, as China, Indonesia and Japan are doing, Australia still seems more interested in circling the wagons and seeking protection.\u201cThis is also reflected very plainly in the growing worries about China,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cWhere once it was seen overwhelmingly as a source of economic opportunity it is now seen more and more as a source of political, strategic and even ideological threats.\u201dSome analysts argue that there is still a lot of diplomatic work and \u201csoft power\u201d in the mix.Jacinta Carroll, director of national security policy at the Australian National University, defended the budget\u2019s foreign policy priorities, noting that they fall in line with the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, and include a greater focus on Australia\u2019s closest neighbors in the Pacific.\u201cIt\u2019s rare to see a new High Commission open, but a permanent diplomatic presence is vital to a strong relationship so it\u2019s great news that Australia\u2019s commitment to the Pacific is being strengthened by a permanent diplomatic post in Tuvalu,\u201d she said.Still, the Pacific focus is also in response to a perceived threat from China. And a good portion of that aid will go to security, not development or investment.The United States and many other countries have made a similar shift. We\u2019re in the midst of a moment when many of the world\u2019s strongest democracies are looking inward, or investing in bonds centered around security. In a previous interview, Mr. White tied this to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but what I find interesting is how that mood of fear is adapting and finding new sources of anxiety.\u201cYou have to worry, if this approach stressing defense and not foreign aid is a good one, given we don\u2019t face any military threat,\u201d said Stephen Howes, director of the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be a balanced approach.\u201dBut having seen the way a resort to the American military often becomes the default response for foreign policy matters in many countries all over the world, I also wonder about momentum, and whether spending choices today might create self-fulfilling prophecies of conflict tomorrow.Now for the news \u2014 from Trump and Iran to koala chlamydia and Met Gala fun \u2014 as well as a recommendation.________________________News / FeaturesCulture / Fun______I found a copy at a local bookstore and nearly wept when I reached the story\u2019s end.

{"Headline": "Hosted by Putin, Leaders of France and Japan Castigate Trump", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. PETERSBURG, Russia \u2014 The president of France spoke of an \u201cerroneous decision.\u201d Japan\u2019s Prime Minister lamented disruptions to trade. The head of the International Monetary Fund said recent foreign policy positions were \u201cnot the right way to go.\u201dThey were not criticizing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom the United States has tried to isolate on the world stage.Instead, Mr. Putin sat, nodding approvingly, on a stage beside these heads of state and other senior officials at a business forum that veered into what sounded at times like a group-therapy session for world leaders slighted by President Trump.Speaking to an auditorium of business executives, President Emmanuel Macron of France said he had tried to persuade President Trump to remain in the international climate accord, observe a nuclear deal with Iran and refrain from moving the United States embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, only to be rebuffed on all three points. Mr. Macron called the embassy move \u201cerroneous.\u201dPrime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said he was moving ahead with a trade pact with Pacific nations despite Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the deal. \u201cThis is the kind of fairness we need,\u201d he said of the trade deal. \u201cUnfortunately, the U.S. withdrew.\u201dChristine Lagarde, the director of the International Monetary Fund, said the Trump administration\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on Chinese goods was rocking the boat of the global economy. A trade deficit is not reason enough to impose tariffs, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange complaint,\u201d she said, and \u201cnot the right way to go\u201d on trade.It was a peculiar forum for airing grievances against the United States. At the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, an annual gathering for foreign investors and executives who do business in Russia, Mr. Putin was playing host to the leaders of France and Japan, countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia.The United States, which imposed some of the harshest restrictions, sent its ambassador to the conference with the message that \u201cdialogue and communication is the only way to improve ties.\u201dMr. Putin, for his part, spoke of the United States shifting the rules of the international order even as it attempted to police those rules.\u201cThe current situation in the world is such that everybody is playing soccer with the rules of judo,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cSo what we have is neither soccer nor judo. It\u2019s chaos.\u201dThe complaints by the French and Japanese leaders play into Russia\u2019s long-term effort to drive wedges between the United States and its traditional allies.To be sure, Mr. Macron also spoke of France\u2019s long, warm historical alliance with the United States and said disagreements were part of that lengthy friendship. And Mr. Abe, in a speech, drew attention to the lack of a formal peace treaty to end World War II between Russia and Japan, because of a territorial dispute over islands.The vice president of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Wang Qishan, appeared to be the most diplomatic of all, saying China could learn from America. \u201cAmerica is the only global superpower, in soft power and in hard power,\u201d Mr. Wang said.The United States and European allies have sought to isolate Russia economically, and have expelled Russian diplomats, over its military intervention in Ukraine, meddling in foreign elections and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain.The sign of some fracturing of the Western alliance against Russia came as the Russian economy has been pulling out of a recession that had been brought on by swooning global prices for oil, a key export commodity, and Western sanctions.Earlier this month, Mr. Putin laid out ambitious economic targets for his fourth term as president of Russia, saying he would increase life expectancy, cut poverty and, improbably, displace Germany as the world\u2019s fifth largest economy.\u201cNobody is saying today how are we going to achieve every percentage point of this growth, even though such ambitious targets have been set,\u201d said Aleksei L. Kudrin, an economic adviser to Mr. Putin, and an occasional critic of his economic policies.Mr. Kudrin, who also attended the business gathering, said Western sanctions had cost Russia about 0.5 percent of growth annually. However, several top officials in Russia expressed hope that disagreements emerging between European nations and the United States over sanctions politics, such as those stemming from disagreement over the Iran nuclear deal, could help Russia break up what had been a united front against Moscow.Igor I. Sechin, the head of Russia\u2019s national oil company, Rosneft, said the turmoil over Iran policy was responsible for helping to drive up oil prices to levels not seen since 2014.The Trump administration has recently sent mixed signals on doing business in Russia.In April, the Treasury Department issued sanctions against seven wealthy Russians. Then this month, the American ambassador, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., encouraged Americans to attend the business forum.Mr. Huntsman had agreed to provide opening remarks at a panel discussion in which one of the Russians the Treasury Department had just sanctioned, Viktor F. Vekselberg, was scheduled to participate. Mr. Huntsman later backed out of his role with the panel, though he did attend the forum.An investment firm Mr. Vekselberg once described as his American affiliate, Columbus Nova, paid $580,000 to a shell company set up by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed, I would have loved to have him give welcoming remarks,\u201d Alexis Rodzianko, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, said in an interview. But, he said, \u201ca mixed message is better than the message we were getting before.\u201dUnder President Obama, the American policy was to dissuade company executives from attending the economic forum, a gala event backed by the Russian government and modeled on the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland.This year, Mr. Huntsman, Mr. Trump\u2019s ambassador, turned up only to have his boss castigated on stage by the world leaders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Matter With Europe?", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistIf you had to identify a place and time where the humanitarian dream \u2014 the vision of a society offering decent lives to all its members \u2014 came closest to realization, that place and time would surely be Western Europe in the six decades after World War II. It was one of history\u2019s miracles: a continent ravaged by dictatorship, genocide and war transformed itself into a model of democracy and broadly shared prosperity.But now Europe is in big trouble. So, of course, are we. In particular, while democracy is under siege on both sides of the Atlantic, the collapse of freedom, if it comes, will probably happen here first. But it\u2019s worth taking a break from our own Trumpian nightmare to look at Europe\u2019s woes, some but not all of which parallel ours.Many of Europe\u2019s problems come from the disastrous decision, a generation ago, to adopt a single currency. The creation of the euro led to a temporary wave of euphoria, with vast amounts of money flowing into nations like Spain and Greece; then the bubble burst. And while countries like Iceland that retained their own money were able to quickly regain competitiveness by devaluing their currencies, eurozone nations were forced into a protracted depression, with extremely high unemployment, as they struggled to get their costs down.This depression was made worse by an elite consensus, in the teeth of the evidence, that the root of Europe\u2019s troubles was not misaligned costs but fiscal profligacy, and that the solution was draconian austerity that made the depression even worse.Those parties are now set to form a government. While the policies of that government aren\u2019t completely clear, they\u2019ll surely involve a break with the rest of Europe on multiple fronts: a reversal of fiscal austerity that may well end with exit from the euro, along with a crackdown on immigrants and refugees.[Receive arguments and opinions on the pressing social issues and hidden stories around the World Cup right in your inbox. Sign up for Offsides.]I would suggest, however, that there\u2019s a deeper story here. There have always been dark forces in Europe (as there are here). When the Berlin Wall fell, a political scientist I know joked, \u201cNow that Eastern Europe is free from the alien ideology of Communism, it can return to its true path: fascism.\u201d We both knew he had a point.What kept these dark forces in check was the prestige of a European elite committed to democratic values. But that prestige was squandered through mismanagement \u2014 and the damage was compounded by unwillingness to face up to what was happening. Hungary\u2019s government has turned its back on everything Europe stands for \u2014 but it\u2019s still getting large-scale aid from Brussels.And here, it seems to me, is where we see parallels with developments in America.Meanwhile our centrists, along with much of the news media, spent years in denial about the radicalization of the G.O.P., engaging in almost pathological false equivalence. And now America finds itself governed by a party with as little respect for democratic norms or rule of law as Hungary\u2019s Fidesz.The point is that what\u2019s wrong with Europe is, in a deep sense, the same thing that\u2019s wrong with America. And in both cases, the path to redemption will be very, very hard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Poland and Hungary Flout Democratic Values, Europe Eyes the Aid Spigot", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union is largely about money \u2014 who gives it, who gets it and why. In the face of a challenge to European democratic values from Poland and Hungary, Brussels is naturally turning to money to get at least some leverage over the popular, populist governments there.The struggle at the heart of the European Union has infused what would normally be a humdrum moment in the life of its bureaucracy \u2014 the publishing of its proposed long-term budget on Wednesday \u2014 with novel importance.How the European Union disperses its money will be hashed out over months \u2014 debated, amended and approved by the leaders of the member states and by the European Parliament, too.But suddenly at stake in the tedium is whether the money that richer states transfer to poorer ones \u2014 long seen as a means of democratizing former dictatorships, like Portugal, Spain or Greece \u2014 is instead enabling new ones, namely in Poland and Hungary, among the top money-getters in the European Union.But both countries have been criticized for increasing state control over the news media and especially the judiciary, which goes to the heart of European commitments to freedom of the press, the rule of law and democratic transparency.The means to influence or punish member states for violations of European principles are very weak, however. Real censure is subject to veto, making it difficult for Brussels to challenge democratically elected leaders, even when their practices in office are suspect.So the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s bureaucracy, is considering tying new aid to the credibility of the judiciary in member states, on the principle that oversight of European Union spending must depend on the rule of law and independent judges.Such a change would attempt to skirt contentious judgments about \u201cvalues\u201d and instead shift the debate to sound financial management. Importantly, the finance rules work on a form of majority voting, eliminating the veto.Fines would be considered approved unless the European Council, made up of the heads of government, votes to repeal them.And even if those fines and aid reductions are passed, governments that are punished would still be liable to fulfill their budget obligations to fund agricultural and investment subsidies out of their own tax receipts.That all may be too clever to survive the long process of approval. And even if successful, it would not take effect until at least 2021. But it is an effort to hit countries that have flouted European values and norms in the pocketbook.All this is cresting because the European Union is beginning to debate its budget framework for 2021 through 2027, a budget that will have to deal with a significant reduction in funds given Britain\u2019s intention to leave the bloc and stop paying into its budget after a transition period that will end in December 2020. Currently, about 10 percent of the European Union\u2019s budget comes from Britain.That money reflects the bloc\u2019s extraordinary commitment to aiding the development of its newer and poorer members, measured by gross domestic product per capita.

The distribution of regional support would be based not just on national income per capita but on other indicators like youth unemployment and migration burdens.That is a clear effort to help older members like Italy and Greece that have borne the brunt of refugee and migrant flows, and other southern countries like Spain and Portugal, where youth unemployment is high.Cohesion funds for newer member states could be cut by as much as 6 percent to make room for these other kinds of aid.Get the Morning Briefing in your inbox. What you need to know to start your day, each weekday morning.Of course, the talk of cuts also comes in the context of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, along with its hefty contributions.Some countries, like France, Germany, Poland and Hungary, have said that they would increase their future contributions to Brussels to help make up for Britain\u2019s departure.Other countries, like the Netherlands, have said that they do not want to contribute more, but that the bloc\u2019s budget should absorb the loss of Britain by shrinking and becoming more efficient.But the commission itself is expected to propose a larger budget than the current one, and aim for an overall amount of 1.13 to 1.18 percent of the bloc\u2019s gross national income, compared with 1.03 percent when the current framework was approved.But the prevailing mood, led by the Commission vice president, Frans Timmermans, is that the challenge of Poland and Hungary cannot go unmet, and that other countries flirting with forms of \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d like Slovakia and the Czech Republic, should see consequences.In an unusually explicit Twitter thread after the Czech elections last autumn, Juho Romakkaniemi, the former head of the cabinet of another European Commission vice president, Jyrki Katainen, asked: \u201cHow long the other MS [member states] are willing to pay large sums for cohesion if it leads to divergence?\u201dMr. Romakkaniemi noted that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were among the highest net recipients of European Union funds, while their governments indulge in euroskeptic politics. \u201cMy fear is that the populistic path leads to divergence from the E.U. core values of freedom and Rule of Law \u2014 until a breaking point,\u201d he said.\u201cThis would be a very sad and dangerous development,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I can see big risks here.

{"Headline": "Wall Street Gains Ground Under the New Volcker Rule: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump is imposing tariffs on China. Again.\u2022 What deal makers can learn from Bayer\u2019s new antitrust agreement.The public has two defenses against recklessness on Wall Street \u2013 regulations and the regulators themselves. Now, with the Trump administration\u2019s rule loosening in full swing, the public can only hope that the men and women who oversee the big banks are up to their jobs.Federal regulators on Wednesday proposed a sweeping set of changes that would relax the Volcker rule, a major regulation introduced after the financial crisis of 2008 to stop taxpayer-protected banks from speculating for their own profit.The rule, which came into effect in 2015, was always going to create some headaches. Banks trade regularly to meet the demands of customers and to hedge their own risks. The Volcker rule allows that sort of trading, but regulators had to have ways of making sure a bank wasn\u2019t speculating for its own gain under the guise of serving customers or hedging. To do that, the final rule included requirements that effectively forced banks to show that they were only doing the legitimate types of trading. Banks complained about the rule\u2019s complexity, and regulators said it was hard to enforce. The changes proposed on Wednesday give the banks considerable new leeway.Here are three ways in which traders gain ground.\u2022 Currently, a bank\u2019s short-term trading positions are at the outset presumed to be in violation of the rule, and banks must show that the positions were held to serve customers or hedge. The new Volcker rule presumes compliance. The balance of power will tip immediately to traders from regulators.\u2022 Under the Volcker rule now, banks have to show that trading positions held for customers are in line with what those customers\u2019 might actually demand in the near term. Assessing a legitimate level of demand can be difficult. Customers\u2019 appetites can change quickly \u2013 and the metrics used to predict demand were complex. To try and simplify this exercise, the new rule would allow banks to establish ahead of time the \u201crisk limits,\u201d or position sizes, they set for each trading desk. If a bank does not exceed those limits, they would be presumed to have a position that meets customer demand. Regulators on Wednesday said they would try to make sure that the banks\u2019 risk limits was in fact in line with customer demand, but the change clearly gives the initiative to the banks.In theory, as they relaxed the Volcker rule, regulators could have found simple new ways to increase the chances of compliance. For instance, they could have strengthened the part of the rule that requires C.E.O.s to attest that their banks are in compliance with the Volcker rule. But no changes appear to give it more bite.Some of the regulators argue that the Volcker rule was overly prescriptive and that the changes make it more like other banking rules, which, in their opinion, they enforce effectively. Indeed, on a conference call on Wednesday officials said the changes would make it easier to ensure banks comply.But the rank and file regulators can be expected to follow the lead of the political appointees who lead the agencies. If those people want to give the banks a break, the changes to the Volcker rule would clear the way for such a bonanza. \u201cThe proposed changes also put a lot of faith in banks\u2019 own internal risk models and put the onus on Trump-appointed regulators to vigorously police trading activities \u2014 a task I\u2019m not confident they are up for,\u201d Gregg Gelzinis, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said.- Peter EavisStorm clouds are gathering over the global economy, threatening a recovery that seemed to be gaining strength just a few months ago. The winners of Italy\u2019s election are at loggerheads with the E.U.; President Trump is stirring up trouble with America\u2019s biggest trading partners; and the markets and economies of developing countries once again look vulnerable.Blame the trilemma. The \u2026 what?He on Tuesday acknowledged that Italy is facing the trilemma:Here\u2019s how it works.For years, a country may have elected governments that accepted rules entwining it with other economies, reducing its national sovereignty. Italy accepted the fiscal and financial requirements of being part of the E.U., while the U.S. mostly embraced the free trade rules of the postwar era. But then governments came to power in Italy and the U.S. that questioned whether all that international integration was actually good for their respective countries.The United States is probably big enough that it can pull back from international trade agreements without causing itself severe near-term pain. But Italy is in a much weaker position, as the recent sell-off in Italian government bonds shows. Pressure from investors and leaders within the E.U. may well persuade Italy to back away from policies that diverge from the bloc\u2019s orthodoxy. But abiding by the E.U.\u2019s rules may not stimulate Italy\u2019s economy. That could, in turn, increase support for the populists.As Mr. Rodrik wrote:Finally, we can downgrade our ambitions with respect to how much international economic integration we can (or should) achieve. So we go for a limited version of globalization, which is what the postwar Bretton Woods regime was about (with its capital controls and limited trade liberalization). It has unfortunately become a victim of its own success. We have forgotten the compromise embedded in that system, and which was the source of its success.\u2014 Peter EavisHighly targeted research efforts and global collaboration are toward the top of the nation\u2019s checklist for dominating the world of technology.Nothing particularly new there, really. But he also explained some of his plans for making sure that China dominates the R.&D. underpinning those technologies.Part of that includes a focus on basic scientific research into carefully chosen areas with clear, real-world applications \u2014 a \u201cproblem-oriented\u201d approach, as he put it. Much of that might be done at a series of new national laboratories, which will focus on those themes.Also interesting was his insistence that seeking talent and collaborating with other nations would be a vital part of China\u2019s success. He said that solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems,from climate change to food security, would require a global effort. And he called out human talent as a precious resource, and an area in which, he feels China, still lags.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeBeyond scoring points on Twitter, Sanofi inserted itself into the broader issue of how companies should respond to social justice issues.Sanofi\u2019s tweet isn\u2019t nearly the same broad gesture as those.

{"Headline": "Could a Colonial-Era Golf Club Solve Hong Kong\u2019s Housing Woes?", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHong Kong JournalHONG KONG \u2014 The Hong Kong Golf Club is a 129-year-old enclave of privilege whose quiet fairways once catered to the city\u2019s British colonial rulers, but whose parking lot is now filled with the Teslas and Porsches of its wealthy Chinese elite.More recently, this sprawling golf club, with 54 holes, has become something else: the focal point of a raging, citywide debate about how to use Hong Kong\u2019s scarcest and most valuable resource, land.\u201cGolf is a plaything of the Brits,\u201d said Ng Cheuk-hang, 23, a spokesman for the Land Justice League, an activist group that wants the golf course redeveloped into low-rent public housing.\u201cIt\u2019s not a grass-roots sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sport for the people, and it creates a lot of social injustices.\u201dYoshihiro Nishi, 51, the president of the Hong Kong Golf Association, a group representing four private golf clubs in Hong Kong, thinks the activists are unnecessarily politicizing the issue.\u201cAll the members of the Hong Kong Golf Club understand the housing needs in Hong Kong,\u201d said Mr. Nishi, who works as a private banker by day. \u201cWe just want to make sure that we get to say what we want to say. Don\u2019t turn it into a little bit of fight between the haves and don\u2019t-haves.\u201dThe problem is that property prices in Hong Kong have soared to the highest levels in the world; blue-collar and middle-class families are priced out of the market. And so the city is searching everywhere for places to build \u2014 the edges of public parks, a few remaining farms, land reclaimed from the sea and so-called brownfield sites, like former container yards.It\u2019s an affordable-housing crisis whose effects have rippled across the broader economy and inflamed political tensions in a society already divided over Beijing\u2019s refusal to allow free elections.Much of this mountainous, densely populated territory of more than seven million has already been filled with high-rises, shopping centers and concrete sprawl. Hong Kong\u2019s golf courses and other private recreation clubs \u2014 long given special treatment as the city strove to be an attractive hub for global bankers and executives \u2014 are increasingly seen as one of the quickest solutions to the land shortage.But as the golf courses and clubs face growing calls to be redeveloped into public housing, they also are facing angry protests linking the crisis over land use to the city\u2019s broader problems of economic inequality and declining social mobility.In late March, protesters stormed the Hong Kong Golf Club, in the far-flung suburb of Fanling just two train stops from the Chinese border. Chanting \u201cLand for all!\u201d and \u201cWe want public housing! Take back the golf course!\u201d they marched down the neatly manicured lawns before occupying a putting green.When protesters reappeared a month later, they scuffled with security guards who barred them from entering. A golfer who was not a member of the club was seen grabbing a protester by the neck and throwing him to the ground.The dispute has been exacerbated by Hong Kong\u2019s political paralysis.Bitter infighting between its unelected, Beijing-backed leadership and the pro-democracy opposition has left the city\u2019s government unable to tackle tough problems, chief among them the lack of affordable housing. The prohibitive property prices, while a boon for the elite, have hurt the rest of the economy by raising costs for small businesses and start-ups.The activists seemed to get support from a recent government report proposing that the 425-acre golf course be partly or fully redeveloped for housing and other public uses. According to the report\u2019s estimates, the course is big enough to hold 13,200 apartment units, housing 37,000 people.The club is one of six golf courses and 24 private sports clubs on special government leases. Some of the others, including the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club and the Hong Kong Cricket Club, also date to the 19th century, and used to serve a mostly white, colonial clientele.Together, the clubs occupy 828 acres of land \u2014 about the size of Central Park in New York City \u2014 and serve about 56,000 members. They rent their land from the government through the special leases, so-called private recreational leases, that offer often below-market rates, drawing accusations that the government is \u201csubsidizing the rich.\u201dThe private recreational lease policy is a holdover from Hong Kong\u2019s colonial days, when recreational facilities were few and far between. A policy document from 1979 said the private clubs \u201cprovide an important outlet for the upper middle class and business circles.\u201d\u201cWe are lacking in golf facilities severely,\u201d said Arnold Wong, 44, the previous captain of the Hong Kong Golf Club, an elected position in which he represented its members. Mr. Wong, the co-founder of a restaurant company, pointed out that Hong Kong has fewer 18-hole courses than Singapore, which has a smaller population.\u201cIn terms of golf facilities, we are already lagging way behind as a major financial city,\u201d he said.As the debate has grown, the government\u2019s Home Affairs Bureau has proposed changes to the leasing policy, like charging the golf clubs higher rent.Last year, the Hong Kong Golf Club paid 2.5 million Hong Kong dollars (about $320,000) to the government in rent, a mere 3 percent of actual market rental value. Even so, the club had a deficit of the equivalent of $1.27 million in 2016, according to its annual report, suggesting that substantial increases in rent would pose a financial challenge.As the largest of Hong Kong\u2019s private clubs, the Hong Kong Golf Club represents the upper-class elite of the city. A corporate membership can be bought for some $2 million. Individual memberships have a one-off entrance fee of around $64,000, and monthly dues of several hundred dollars, but require personal connections and patience for a waiting list that is years long.For most of its history, the club had the word \u201cRoyal\u201d in its name, and members were predominantly British expatriates. Today, most of the 2,660 members are Hong Kong Chinese, many of whom got rich in real estate or finance after the economy took off in the 1970s. More recently, wealthy Chinese mainlanders have joined in growing numbers.The club opens its gates to nonmembers on most weekdays, though the fee of about $140 per 18-hole round puts it out of reach for many in Hong Kong, where the median monthly income is around $2,150. In recent years, the club has invested in community outreach, like teaching golf to underprivileged students and training talented young golfers.Yet as Hong Kong feels increasingly divided between rich and poor, the debate surrounding the golf course speaks to more fundamental questions about the future of this city, and whether it will be affordable to all, or just a playground of the rich.Some of the most vocal opponents of the course are young social activists who call land ownership the biggest dividing line between Hong Kong\u2019s haves and have-nots.Yam Chun, 24, a community organizer for the Concerning Grassroots\u2019 Housing Rights Alliance, sees the golf course as the epitome of inequitable use of land.Born to a working-class family, she said she grew up in cramped subdivided flats and old tenement buildings while her family sat on a long waiting list just to get into public housing.\u201cWhen my family and I were still waiting for public housing, I thought to myself, does Hong Kong really not have enough land?\u201d she said. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve grown up, I realize that the real problem is the unfair distribution of land.\u201dSome experts say that while the dispute has exposed deeper anxieties caused by Hong Kong\u2019s economic rise, the golf course is not big enough to solve the housing issue.\u201cThe golf course problem is just pure political populism,\u201d said Richard Wong, professor of economics at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cThe golf course is peripheral, completely peripheral, to the solution to this problem,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic.\u201dStill, symbols can be important, and some argue that getting rid of the golf course would hurt Hong Kong\u2019s competitiveness.\u201cAs an international financial city you do need to balance housing needs with sporting needs,\u201d said Mr. Wong, the club captain. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a walled city of just concrete, with no facilities, no attractions to other investors, foreigners, expats, people of different backgrounds.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Populists Offer Giuseppe Conte for Prime Minister; N.Y.U. Claim in Question", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 In a significant step toward forming an anti-establishment government in the European Union\u2019s fourth-largest economy, the leaders of Italy\u2019s populist parties asked the country\u2019s president on Monday to accept a little-known law professor as their consensus candidate for prime minister.\u201cThe name we gave to the President of the Republic is the name of Giuseppe Conte,\u201d Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, told reporters after meeting with the president, who has the power to reject the nomination.Mr. Di Maio called Mr. Conte \u201ca professional of the highest level,\u201d intimately aware with the nation\u2019s problems as a child of the peripheral south. Mr. Conte, he said, \u201cis a self-made man and he\u2019s a tough guy. \u201dHe added, \u201cYou all will see.\u201dA dapper 54-year-old civil law professor with a taste for cuff links and white pocket kerchiefs, Mr. Conte has a long r\u00e9sum\u00e9 working for Roman law firms and associating with top-ranking Vatican cardinals.But with no political base or government experience, Mr. Conte\u2019s main qualification may well be his willingness to carry out a government agenda agreed upon by the populist party leaders.That agenda, which calls for lifting of sanctions against Russia, the revisiting of the bloc\u2019s budget rules and crackdowns on immigration, has already sent jitters through European markets and raised concerns that the erosion of the European Union may come from within its western European core.The nomination of Mr. Conte did not exactly assuage those concerns.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in the history of the Republic that the candidate for prime minister has been downgraded to the role of spokesman,\u201d Andrea Marcucci, a senator in the soon to be opposition Democratic Party, said in a statement.If the president, Sergio Mattarella, gives the green light, Mr. Conte will assemble a team of ministers, who are expected to be preordained by Mr. Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant League party, and Mr. Di Maio\u2019s new coalition partner. Both have designs on critical ministries.Reports in the Italian press suggested that Mr. Mattarella still had significant reservations about the direction of the new government. Late Monday evening he convened leaders of the Italian houses of Parliament to meet with him on Tuesday.But Mr. Di Maio seemed quite pleased with the choice. Smiling broadly under umbrellas outside Rome\u2019s Quirinal Palace, he talked approvingly to reporters about how Mr. Conte, who grew up in the southern region of Puglia, was a known entity to his party\u2019s base.Mr. Di Maio had proposed Mr. Conte as a potential minister for \u201cthe Civil Service, de-bureaucratisation and meritocracy\u201d during the campaign and has known him for five years. ANSA, the Italian state news service, reported that Mr. Di Maio had hired Mr. Conte as his lawyer and that Mr. Conte wrote a good deal of the justice section of the party\u2019s manifesto.(On Wednesday afternoon, the Five Star Movement disputed the ANSA report, saying Mr. Di Maio had never hired Mr. Conte as a lawyer and that Mr. Conte had worked on several sections of the party\u2019s shared policy agenda with its alliance partner, the League.)Mr. Salvini said in a Facebook Live monologue Monday evening that Mr. Conte was \u201can expert in simplification, and de-bureaucratisation, and slimming down of the administrative machine, which is what many businesses ask us.\u201dDuring his debut during the campaign, Mr. Conte, who specialized in public administration law, said that while he had voted for left-leaning parties in the past, he was drawn to the Five Star Movement because \u201ctoday I think the 20th-century ideological outlooks are no longer adequate.\u201dOver the weekend, Mr. Conte changed the profile picture of his WhatsApp account to a picture of John F. Kennedy with the words, \u201cevery accomplishment starts with the decision to try.\u201dHis friends said he was a breath of fresh air.\u201cHe has all the credentials,\u201d said Carla Lucente, a professor of modern languages and literature at Duquesne University and the Honorary Consulate of Italy in Pittsburgh.She knows Mr. Conte through their work together at the Villa Nazareth, a college in Rome associated with Duquesne University that has deep ties to the Vatican, including past and present power brokers like Cardinal Achille Silvestrini and Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli.\u201cThey know each other very well,\u201d said Ms. Lucente of the prelates and Mr. Conte.Nicholas P. Cafardi, dean emeritus and canon law professor of the Duquesne University School of Law in Pittsburgh, said Mr. Conte, whom he called \u201chighly talented,\u201d was his lawyer when he bought his house in Italy and handled legal issues at Villa Nazareth for Cardinal Silvestrini, who is the institution\u2019s president.Two years ago, when Ms. Lucente came to Rome for a Villa Nazareth event with Pope Francis, she said she saw Mr. Conte and his wife and son and noticed he was already a mover and a shaker in law circles.

During the campaign they constantly lamented that Italy had not had a prime minister directly elected by voters for years. Five Star in particular rose to prominence over the last decade excoriating professional politicians and presenting itself as a radical change agent.But now, intent to demonstrate that Mr. Conte reflects the will of the voters, many of whom had never heard of him, they sought to characterize him and the government he would nominally lead as deeply political.\u201cGiuseppe Conte will be a political prime minister chosen by two political forces for a political government with political figures in it,\u201d said Mr. Di Maio on Monday. \u201cAnd most of all with the support of two elected political forces.\u201dBut Ms. Lucente said she considered Mr. Conte\u2019s aversion to politics one of his great credentials.\u201cI never considered him a political person,\u201d she said.Elisabetta Povoledo and Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy Can Handle Steel and Aluminum Tariffs. The Real Risk Is Erratic Policy.", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe near-term costs of steel and aluminum tariffs are manageable; the longer-term costs of potential trade wars with seemingly the entire world are greater.Today, we take pity upon the supply chain managers, the financial planners, the logisticians and procurement chiefs at every American company that uses steel and aluminum in its products. But there\u2019s a longer-term danger for the American economy that\u2019s a lot bigger than the 25 percent tax on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum. It is that the administration\u2019s trade policy is displaying an erratic, improvised, us-against-the-world quality that is anathema to businesses that must make long-term decisions about how to deploy capital.In a market economy, businesses can thrive despite bad policies. Go to any rich country, and you\u2019ll find certain tax and regulatory policies that seem bonkers to an outsider. Japan taxes imported American beef at high rates \u2014 50 percent until recently. Most stores in Germany have to close on Sunday. Go to Sweden or South Korea or Canada and you can find rules that impede the free market, yet businesses do just fine.That\u2019s because those policies may be inefficient, but they are stable in their inefficiency. German stores build into their business models the expectation that there will be no Sunday sales, and a beef importer in Japan builds the tariff into its prices.That stability is part of what differentiates rich countries from poor ones. In poor countries, it tends to be harder for businesses to make long-term investments in part because they don\u2019t know what tax and regulatory policies might come down upon them in the future.And the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies in 2018 have been nothing if not inconsistent and unpredictable. The sequence of events on steel and aluminum over the last three months is a prime example. If you\u2019re a little confused at seeing headlines about the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum on major trading partners, it is understandable. Didn\u2019t that already happen?The administration first announced the tariffs back in early March, portraying them as an aggressive effort to fight the perfidious behavior of China and other countries to subsidize their domestic metals industries, undermining American national security.Then, soon after they were announced, the administration gave exemptions to most major American allies, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico. It extended them by 30 days at the start of May, though that was a down-to-the-wire moment.With those 30 days now elapsed, the administration has this time gone the other direction and removed the exemptions. It\u2019s now tariffs for everybody, including the United States\u2019 closest military allies. And even that is subject to change as the Trump administration continues to dangle relief on steel and aluminum tariffs in exchange for other concessions.There has been extensive behind-the-scenes jockeying over those exemptions for the last three months, but there has been no real public accounting of what criteria led to those exemptions in the first place, or what led to their removal. And it is not at all clear how taxing imports of Canadian and European steel and aluminum is going to get China to cut subsidies for its producers.The imposition of the tariffs on Canada and Mexico added another layer of complexity to the sluggish renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Even more remarkable is that the Trump administration is willing to make threats against all the nation\u2019s major trading partners at the same time. A trade war with China would be a big deal; a trade war with Europe would be a big deal; a trade war with Canada and Mexico would be a big deal. The United States is flirting with all three at once.So imagine you\u2019re a business trying to decide whether to build a big new manufacturing facility in Ohio or Indiana or Michigan. You make sophisticated industrial equipment that is exported around the world \u2014 a sector where the United States has considerable competitive advantages, and where the jobs tend to pay well. You just got a tax cut, and your stock price has been rising, lowering your cost of capital.You may be hoping that the Trump administration\u2019s trade brinkmanship will lead to better access for your products abroad. But in the meantime, that\u2019s a whole lot of political risk that will weigh on your decisions to hire and invest. There will be a lot of focus in the weeks ahead on the direct, first-round effects of the steel and aluminum tariffs. No doubt certain products will cost a bit more. Those supply chain managers are facing some late nights.This bigger cost is harder to measure, but that doesn\u2019t make it less real. That is the risk that the United States is not as stable and reliable a place to do business as you once thought.Advertisement"}

Instead, she said she felt emotionally bullied by an artist who never acknowledged her as a creative partner.\u201cI want them to know what happened in the past between me and Araki,\u201d Kaori said last month. \u201cI was not allowed to speak out. People should know, and they should look.\u201d Mr. Araki declined repeated requests to comment.Maggie Mustard, co-curator of the Museum of Sex exhibition, said Kaori\u2019s allegations were forcing a new conversation about models\u2019 rights.\u201cThis gives us the opportunity to talk about what happens to a muse \u2014 and I use that word with air quotes \u2014 when she doesn\u2019t have a contract or a sense of economic or legal agency about how her image was used,\u201d Ms. Mustard said in a telephone interview.Ms. Mustard added that she had spoken with Kaori and would incorporate her comments into the exhibition\u2019s programming materials. Already, the wall text mentions another model\u2019s anonymous allegations of inappropriate sexual contact by Mr. Araki, noting that \u201cthe controversy surrounding Araki\u2019s work has almost exclusively been about reception and meaning, and far less about the issues of consent and the potential abuses of power that can be at the foundation of artistic practice and artistic production.\u201dArt historians argue that it might be time for artists to rethink the basis on which these relationships are built. Models should have \u201cmore agency in terms of authorship of the work itself,\u201d said Rebecca Zorach, a professor of art history at Northwestern University.\u201cThe art world has a tendency to erase women as makers, and historically it just happens over and over again,\u201d she said.In Japan, Kaori\u2019s disclosures come as women are just starting to raise questions about male power, sexual harassment and assault.For models working in Japan\u2019s art world, it is difficult to make demands of a male artist.Kaori, who trained in Paris as a dancer, began posing for Mr. Araki after meeting him at a party in 2001.She said he paid her 100,000 yen (about $930) to pose in the studio wearing a kimono or performing dances that Mr. Araki would photograph. For nude projects, he took her to so-called \u201clove hotels\u201d and paid her about 50,000 yen for each assignment.But she said he also called her for impromptu, unpaid sessions where he took photos while she walked in a park or sat in a bar at his command.It was not enough to make a living. Asked how she supplemented her income, Kaori demurred. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say,\u201d she said.In public, Mr. Araki described her as his \u201cmuse,\u201d but she said he did not tell her when or where the work would be published or exhibited, and she had no say in how the images were composed. \u201cFor him, a muse means someone who doesn\u2019t speak or have any of her own opinions and just keeps obeying his orders,\u201d she said.Early on, the two did have a consensual sexual relationship, Kaori said.During one photo session, she balked when he snapped Polaroid pictures of her and sold each individually without paying her any royalties. \u201cThat money that he earned is based on my contribution,\u201d Kaori said.\u201cHe says, \u2018I am Araki, and you must be happy and honored that I am taking a picture of you,\u2019\u201d she said.Kazuko Ito, a lawyer whom Kaori consulted last November, said Kaori told her that after nude photos appeared without her permission, a stalker broke into her home. Kaori asked the lawyer for help obtaining some rights to the photos, but Ms. Ito said that such disputes were very rare in Japan and that she was unlikely to win in court.Ms. Ito said she had heard similar complaints from other models for Mr. Araki.Kaori described one incident when foreign photographers came to observe Mr. Araki as he took pictures of her. She did not want to appear nude in front of strangers, she said, but Mr. Araki told her, \u201cThey aren\u2019t here to photograph you, they\u2019re here to photograph me.\u201dBut when pictures from that session came out in print, Kaori appeared in them, naked. \u201cHe invited many photographers into the studio and he ordered me to spread my legs in front of that big audience,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that.\u201dStill, it took her a long time to quit as Mr. Araki\u2019s model. She started working with him when she was young, and he was already famous. When he was hospitalized, she did not want to abandon him.\u201cLooking back now, everything was excessive and extreme,\u201d she wrote on her blog. \u201cSomething in me was numb. He asked me to do abnormal things, and I did them as if they were normal.\u201d At one point, she became suicidal.By 2015, the relationship had soured so badly that Mr. Araki insisted she sign a document vowing not to defame him or his business. In 2016, Kaori, who by then was running her own ballet school, stopped working with him.When she requested that he stop republishing or exhibiting some photographs of her, he warned in a March 2017 letter that she had no rights. \u201cAll models should understand the potential for unlimited use of the work,\u201d he wrote in the letter, seen by The New York Times. \u201cI will decide which publication, which exhibition, when to publish and what kind of products I will give permission to use my work. It\u2019s all up to me.\u201dKaori is not the only model to have objected to Mr. Araki's distribution of photos. In an interview, another woman who occasionally modeled for him between 2003 and 2013, who requested anonymity because she did not want her family to know she had posed, said that when friends discovered nude photos of her online that she had not known about, she asked Mr. Araki to take them down. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the internet,\u201d he told her.The model said a gallery that represents Mr. Araki, Taka Ishii in Tokyo, eventually removed the images from various websites.As for Kaori, she had started to move on with the support of a new partner. But when #MeToo began and the Museum of Sex mounted its Araki retrospective, they inspired her to go public.Many of the comments on her blog offered encouragement and called her courageous. \u201cIt must have been a horrible experience,\u201d one commentator wrote.Kaori said she did not expect an apology from Mr. Araki, and she is not asking the Museum of Sex to remove the three photos of her it is displaying.The work, she said, should serve as a reminder. All she wants, she said, is for visitors to \u201cknow my sad background and experience.\u201dHisako Ueno and Shiho Takezawa contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Moves to Steady Ties With North Korea Before Trump-Kim Meeting", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 As North Korea holds summit meetings with its archenemies \u2014 first South Korea, and soon the United States \u2014 China is hustling not to lose influence.Its foreign minister, Wang Yi, returned Thursday to Beijing after two days in North Korea\u2019s capital, Pyongyang, where he met with the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, shoring up China\u2019s position as the North\u2019s best friend.China holds substantial economic leverage, but in the heightened strategic competition between it and the United States, it worries that Mr. Kim is using that rivalry to reduce dependence on China, his country\u2019s longtime benefactor.One of Mr. Wang\u2019s jobs was to try to stop Mr. Kim from veering toward the United States under President Trump, some Chinese experts said.\u201cBeijing likely would want to ensure that Pyongyang would not develop a closer relationship with Washington than Beijing,\u201d said Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing. \u201cThe visit by the Chinese foreign minister, the first in 11 years, appears to be part of that effort.\u201dBeijing has suspected that Washington might agree to put aside its nuclear disagreements with North Korea and accept the North\u2019s nuclear capabilities if it served to contain China, he said.Mr. Wang could have delivered a careful message, reminding the North that China was its true friend despite the rough patch in the past six years since Mr. Kim came to power, said Xia Yafeng, a Chinese historian at Long Island University.\u201cWang Yi had a mission: to coordinate with the North Koreans on how to talk with Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can advise the North Koreans, but he cannot threaten them. He may say: \u2018Be careful when you talk with Trump. We will always side with you.\u2019\u201dChina grudgingly went along with Washington\u2019s demand last year that it support United Nations sanctions meant to deny the North of critical foreign currency from sales of coal, minerals, seafood and garments.But Beijing\u2019s desire to punish North Korea\u2019s economy is probably wavering, Mr. Zhao said.\u201cI can imagine China taking additional measures to further improve ties with North Korea,\u201d Mr. Zhao said. These would include working to connect North Korea to roads and rail networks in northeast Asia, and embracing the North in its Belt and Road Initiative.There are already signs that China is trying to loosen some of the economic restrictions. Businessmen in the area of northeastern China that borders North Korea say that some North Korean workers are returning to China on short-term visas, and that they expect trade to pick up soon.\u201cI can imagine China already starting studies into options to increase economic cooperation with North Korea in areas that would not violate existing United Nations Security Council resolutions,\u201d Mr. Zhao said.Beijing was miffed and surprised at being pointedly excluded from several items in the joint declaration that North and South Korea issued last Friday at the end of their summit meeting.The two Koreas said they would start talks with Washington to negotiate a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, which ravaged the peninsula from 1950 to 1953.The declaration mentioned \u201ctrilateral or quadrilateral\u201d talks. If the talks were \u201ctrilateral\u201d that would include North and South Korea and the United States but not China, which sent millions of troops to fight on North Korea\u2019s side during the war. China withdrew all its troops in 1958.\u201cThe Chinese heard it was North Korea that got the talks to be broadened to quadrilateral,\u201d said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy.Beyond that, China was not invited to send observers to the planned destruction of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in North Korea at the end of this month. Mr. Kim said he would invite South Korean and American experts to witness the shutdown, a gesture that American officials said would have little impact on the North\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\u201cThe test site is close to the Chinese border,\u201d Mr. Haenle said. \u201cThe Chinese were upset because China is a nuclear power, South Korea is not.\u201dDespite these snubs, the visit of the foreign minister, Mr. Wang, was symbolically important, Mr. Xia said.In the heyday of the China-North Korea relationship when Mr. Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, was in power, top-level visits between the two countries were frequent. The grandfather visited China many times, Mr. Xia said. Even Kim Jong-un\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, made seven trips between 2000 and 2011.The parade of visits stopped after the young Mr. Kim came to power and derailed the relationship to China by ordering the killing of senior Korean officials close to Beijing.Mr. Kim made a surprise visit to Beijing in late March, apparently on his own initiative, maneuvering in a way that made him look less like a supplicant and more like an equal.Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Mr. Kim is likely to take place in the Demilitarized Zone at the border between South and North Korea, Mr. Trump has said. Some diplomats are speculating that the two leaders may meet on the northern side of the zone, drawing a distinction with the summit meeting last week on the South Korean side, and satisfying Mr. Trump\u2019s desire for drama.China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, is expected to go to Pyongyang after the Trump-Kim meeting. One of the foreign minister\u2019s duties was to confirm details of Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, Chinese analysts said.Advertisement"}

The future efficiency losses would increase oil consumption in the United States by between 126,000 and 283,000 barrels a day in 2025, depending on oil prices. By 2035, daily consumption would be between 252,000 and 881,000 barrels higher, according to the Rhodium Group.Even companies like Ford, whose fleet is made up of larger vehicles, say their priority is only more certainty in the rules between what the federal government mandates and what California requires for tailpipe emissions.

But California and the other states, which represent 43 percent of the American auto market, have said they will continue to enforce the current standards even if the federal rules are weakened. The administration has threatened to revoke a waiver California was granted under the Clean Air Act to impose stricter air pollution regulations on cars and trucks.President Trump is pushing to reduce fuel efficiency requirements just as global oil prices rise from $50 a barrel to over $70 \u2014 in part because the oil markets are nervous about the president\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.\u201cThe national gas price average is 45 cents more expensive than a year ago,\u201d at $2.81, according to AAA. \u201cWith the unofficial kickoff to summer just weeks away, prices are expected to increase.\u201dGiven rising oil and gasoline prices, fuel efficiency would seem to be a worthy goal, both for consumers and the environment.Advertisement"}

The next step is to do the same with science and technology. We must cast away false hopes and rely on ourselves.\u201dZTE\u2019s moment of crisis, if it leads to the company\u2019s collapse, could also show how the tech cold war might ripple around the world.Several employees described the situation inside ZTE on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals from their employer. A company spokeswoman declined to comment.In response to the sanctions issued last month, ZTE said it had worked to improve its compliance practices. It has requested a stay on the export ban and has sent additional information to the Commerce Department in support of its argument.\u201cZhongxing\u201d means \u201cChina Prospers.\u201d The company\u2019s controlling shareholder is Shenzhen Zhongxingxin Telecommunications Equipment, which is nearly half-owned by two Chinese state entities. Several members of the firm\u2019s board also have leadership roles at Zhongxingxin. ZTE says Zhongxingxin does not interfere in its business decisions. Unlike China\u2019s state-controlled enterprises, which are often run by Communist Party officials who jump from company to company, most of the top executives at ZTE are veterans with technical backgrounds.\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily impressive, what they\u2019ve done in the U.S.,\u201d said Avi Greengart, a consumer tech analyst with the research firm GlobalData. \u201cSo many Asian companies either said they would come to the U.S. and then had to pull back \u2014 like Xiaomi, like Huawei. Or they invested in the U.S. and weren\u2019t able to make it work.\u201dZTE\u2019s secret, Mr. Greengart said, was a light touch. The company\u2019s American managers have had significant leeway in tailoring their products to the local market. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way many of its competitors work,\u201d he said.The company was, for instance, quick to spot that Americans were gravitating toward larger phones. It offered inexpensive devices with big screens \u2014 if not those with the highest resolution \u2014 and fingerprint readers at a time when such features were considered premium.Some of the company\u2019s deals with cash-stricken governments have attracted accusations of corruption and overbilling. On the whole, though, ZTE is known in Africa for high quality and good service, said Dobek Pater, a telecom expert at the research firm Africa Analysis.\u201cThe initial perception \u2014 of Chinese companies coming in and being very secretive and not wanting to have much to do with the locals \u2014 has changed over the past decade,\u201d he said.In Iran, it was secrecy of another kind that got ZTE into trouble.\u201cAt home, they might have been doing some things not according to standards, and then, when it came time to internationalize, they might not have done so entirely properly,\u201d said Gu Wenjun, chief analyst at ICwise, a semiconductor market research firm in Shanghai.\u201cFor other companies thinking about how to follow the rules and manage internal risks, I think this is going to serve as a wakeup call,\u201d Mr. Gu said.At the very least, the sanctions against ZTE appear to be supercharging Beijing\u2019s determination to upgrade China\u2019s microchip makers, which have struggled to keep up with global industry leaders despite state support.Chris Lane, a telecom analyst in Hong Kong with Sanford C. Bernstein, believes that China now has the resolve to whip its semiconductor industry into world-leading shape, even if it takes a decade to do so.\u201cThey\u2019re going to pour billions of dollars into preventing this from ever happening again,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the long run, strategically, this might be worse for the U.S. than the current situation.\u201dLate last Friday, ZTE management sent an email to staff members updating them on the company\u2019s efforts to reconcile with Washington.\u201cEven the longest road has an end,\u201d the email concluded. \u201cEven the longest night ends in day.

And the action follows growing acrimony between his supporters and the federal bureaucracy that they portray as the deep state.Unions representing government workers were quick to denounce the actions. \u201cThis is more than union busting \u2014 it\u2019s democracy busting,\u201d J. David Cox Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, said in a statement. \u201cThese executive orders are a direct assault on the legal rights and protections that Congress has specifically guaranteed.\u201dThe executive orders come after a series of prominent Republican victories against public employee unions in recent years at the state level and a rollback of Obama-era policies favorable to labor at the federal level.The Trump administration portrayed its new rules as a needed remedy to make a sclerotic work force more efficient and responsive, but Newt Gingrich, who has been an informal adviser to the White House on Civil Service issues, has given a different explanation in the past.In an interview last year, when the administration was considering action, Mr. Gingrich, a former House speaker, said that a major impetus was the federal bureaucracy\u2019s ideological opposition to the Trump agenda.To streamline the process, the official said, the executive order will give poor performers only 30 days to demonstrate improvement, rather than the current limit of up to 120 days, depending on the agency.The official said the administration would also make performance a more important factor than seniority when agencies undertake layoffs.Richard Loeb, a senior policy counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, said appeals were typically handled by union lawyers not paid by the government.The administration said it would also post union contracts online so that Americans could review its efforts to negotiate better deals with government workers.Administration officials said a subset of federal employees had been able to spend as much as 100 percent of their duty hours on union business, and estimated savings of at least $100 million a year once the order is fully in effect.Mr. Bremberg, the White House domestic policy official, said the actions would make good on the president\u2019s call to \u201cempower every cabinet secretary with the authority to reward good workers and remove those that undermine the public trust or fail the American people.\u201dAccording to data collected by the American Federation of Government Employees, more than 1,600 workers have been removed under the provisions of the law passed last year, called the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. Among those removed were over 200 housekeeping aides, nearly 150 nursing assistants and nearly 100 food-service workers \u2014 representing three of the top four positions with the most removals.Donald F. Kettl, a professor of public policy at the University of Texas at Austin who is based in Washington, said the number of low-level employees removed suggested the department was not using the legislation to make structural reforms that would improve veterans\u2019 access to care.\u201cIt makes for a great message,\u201d he said, \u201cbut is it really going to solve the problem?\u201dConservatives were quick to voice support for the measures. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement shows a move toward accountability for poor performers and unions while increasing workplace equity for all the dedicated and hard-working government employees who have had to pick up the slack for far too long,\u201d said Kent Lassman, president and chief executive of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market advocacy group.But Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said in a statement that if the administration were truly interested in restoring public trust in the federal government, it should rein in the excesses of some of its senior appointees, not politicize the Civil Service.\u201cInstead of trying to erode the rights of federal employees and whistle-blowers, the administration should focus on the abuses of cabinet officials taking charter and first-class flights and buying $31,000 dining sets and $43,000 soundproof booths,\u201d Mr. Van Hollen said.Union officials questioned the administration\u2019s use of executive action when Congress had previously addressed the issue through legislation, but administration officials said they were on firm legal ground. They conceded only that legislation was preferable because executive orders can be easily undone by a future president, and because legislation can have potentially broader reach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Sway Trump on Trade, Businesses Turn to Cable TV", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump tunes into \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Monday morning, he may see a familiar face delivering a gentle warning that tariffs are \u201cB-A-D economics.\u201dIn a last-ditch attempt to persuade Mr. Trump to back away from his trade approach, the National Retail Federation has enlisted Ben Stein, the comedic economist famous for his role in the 1980s film \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off,\u201d to offer Mr. Trump economic advice via advertisements that will air on the president\u2019s favorite TV network.\u201cThere\u2019s really an audience of one in this decision making,\u201d said David French, chief lobbyist of the National Retail Federation, which represents the retail industry. \u201cFor the president, this will seem like a winning strategy for a long time until it isn\u2019t.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs and his threat of levies on Chinese goods have spurred concern across industries, including agriculture, automobiles and retailing, which worry they will be caught on the losing end of a trade war. Businesses say Mr. Trump\u2019s approach risks derailing America\u2019s strong run of economic growth with a self-inflicted mistake on trade, one that will ultimately cause harm to consumers and the economy.They hope to pressure Mr. Trump at a crucial moment. American companies will have a chance to air their concerns about the proposed tariffs on Chinese goods during three days of hearings that the United States trade representative will hold beginning on Tuesday. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, China\u2019s top economic official, is also expected to visit Washington \u2014 possibly as early as this week \u2014 for more trade talks with top administration officials. And the White House is in the midst of trying to reach a deal with Canada and Mexico to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement, a deal that has become integral to many American industries.In comments at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump reiterated that Nafta has been a \u201cterrible deal\u201d and said that Canada and Mexico were disappointed to be losing the \u201cgolden goose\u201d that has been the United States. Republican lawmakers have said that the framework of a deal needs to be revealed this month if Congress is going to vote on it this year, putting pressure on the administration to either agree to a revised pact or follow through with Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to abandon the 1994 agreement.Eventually, Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress cooled to the idea and it was shelved.The retail industry hopes to persuade Mr. Trump by once again talking about the impact on consumers\u2019 wallets. The group projects that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs could cause the price of Chinese-made televisions to rise nearly 25 percent. It predicts that if China retaliates with punitive measures of its own, thousands of jobs could be lost in states won by Mr. Trump in the 2016 election.Because so much of the power to make decisions on trade is concentrated in the White House, lobbyists are working to get Mr. Trump\u2019s attention directly rather than by canvassing congressional committees. The six-figure purchase will place the commercial on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d the Fox News morning show that Mr. Trump watches regularly and often quotes on Twitter. It will also be appear on the comedy show \u201cRoseanne,\u201d which seeks to appeal to Trump voters, and on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which regularly mocks the president with impersonations by Alec Baldwin.\u201cYou have a president, it\u2019s no secret, who likes to watch television,\u201d said Evan Tracey, senior vice president of National Media Research, Planning & Placement, a Republican media firm, who noted that advertisers used to try to reach President Barack Obama, a sports fan, on ESPN. \u201cFrom an advertising standpoint, you always want to sort of go where the ducks are.\u201dHe added: \u201cIf you want to get your message in front of President Trump, the strategy to go to cable news is not a bad one.\u201dRetailers are not the only ones seeking to soften Mr. Trump\u2019s trade instincts. In recent weeks, the manufacturing, solar and farming lobbyists have all unveiled their own advertising campaigns to push back against tariffs.\u201cI\u2019m supportive of the Trump administration, but I have a lot of concerns about current actions that have been taken on trade and tariffs,\u201d said Brent Bible, an Indiana soybean farmer in a national television ad produced by Farmers for Free Trade. \u201cThe fact that China is our No. 1 soybean customer makes us very vulnerable.\u201dThat ad appeared on Fox, CNN and MSNBC in Washington and in Florida, where Mr. Trump often spends weekends at his Mar-a-Lago golf resort.While trade policy can be abstract, a bespectacled Mr. Stein, standing before a chalkboard with a lesson on \u201cSmoot-Hawley,\u201d a 1930 protectionist tariff act that helped fuel the Great Depression, tries to make the costs of levies as simple as possible.\u201cTariffs raise taxes on hard-working Americans,\u201d he says in his notorious monotone. \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But a different kind of study will be needed to confirm that. The fact is that years after catheter ablation hit the market, we shouldn\u2019t have this many questions about it.The bar for approval of medical devices is too low. There is no reason we shouldn\u2019t require, as we almost always do for drugs, a randomized placebo-controlled trial showing improvements in \u201chard\u201d outcomes like mortality before approving them.I never heard back.Physicians have become major drivers of the overuse of devices and procedures like these. Doctors are rewarded on a fee-for-service basis, meaning the more that they do, the more they are paid.In this environment, despite their best intentions, physicians cannot be expected to be completely disinterested stewards for their patients.Some argue that regulations are making it too hard for good ideas to come to fruition. But if anything, over time I have become warier of \u201cgood ideas.\u201dThe F.D.A. recently approved a new kind of stent to relieve blockages. These stents would dissolve in about three years, the theory being that patients would prefer this to having metal placed inside them. And indeed they started showing up in clinics demanding these vanishing stents.It is much more difficult to study the efficacy of devices than that of drugs, because the former involves invasive procedures. It\u2019s one thing to give patients a placebo pill to swallow; it\u2019s much harder to pretend to implant a stent. But these so-called sham procedures are necessary if we\u2019re going to find out whether devices work, especially for treating symptoms that are susceptible to the placebo effect.A perfect storm of conflicted physicians, loose regulations and a culture that celebrates shiny, expensive and invasive treatments has led to the fetishization of medical devices. But if the F.D.A. won\u2019t act, change is still possible.In the meantime, we need the F.D.A. to do its job and ensure that devices that can careen patients and the health care system toward bankruptcy are actually making people healthier.Advertisement"}

But she spent nearly as much time driving a car as she spent programming one. Millions of people moved from home to work every day in her city of more than 20 million; her daily commute to work could at times run to three hours or more.Ms. Negm is the new face of tech entrepreneurship in the Muslim world. And she is not alone.This intersection of STEM education and rising entrepreneurship has created the conditions for women in Muslim-majority emerging markets to catch the wave of technological change sweeping the world. But they have done so in a way that looks very different from the West \u2014 and very different from the generations of women before them. They are using technology to trump culture and then changing culture from within.Often young female entrepreneurs are tapping into a market in which they have a comparative advantage: other young millennial women like them who have newfound disposable income.For their grandmothers and mothers, work outside the home was often inaccessible. But the 50 million Muslim women who have joined the work force \u2014 online and offline \u2014 in the last 15 years have led the greatest migration from home to work ever seen in their countries. The economic opportunity unleashed by the combination of education, ambition and technology is massive. The combined income of working women across the Muslim world is already $1 trillion.As more women create entrepreneurial ventures, generating jobs and income for ever-larger segments of the population, governments can facilitate this new avenue of growth for their economies. The social payoff, in the form of women\u2019s empowerment, breaking stereotypes and stronger communities, may be even greater. And as digital platforms and tools make economic activity more easily visible and measurable, policymakers have an opportunity for smarter regulation.Laws are often behind the economic realities of female (and male) citizens. While most emerging markets in the Muslim world have high internet and mobile penetration rates, women still tend to have less digital access than men. While public transport infrastructure in many Muslim emerging markets needs overall improvement, it also needs to take into account women\u2019s concerns around safety and harassment to truly open up mobility options for them.Governments across the economies of the Muslim world will need to reconsider policies in a range of areas \u2014 digital inclusion, labor, parental leave, child care, taxation, safety, access to finance and transport \u2014 and apply a gender lens to developing new areas to fully unleash the potential of their female work force, including entrepreneurs.Globalization and technology have at times had a harsh impact on parts of the working class in the United States and elsewhere in the developed world in recent years. On the other side of the world, those same forces have empowered millions of women, with far-reaching consequences for their families, communities and countries. If the image of a typical entrepreneur in Silicon Valley is a young man in a hoodie, in many urban areas of the Muslim World, it could easily be a young woman in a hijab. The passion, energy and desire to solve local problems are the same. Their governments should now recognize and back these new employers, consumers and taxpayers for the genuine economic force that they are.Saadia Zahidi is head of the Center for the New Economy and Society at the World Economic Forum and author of \u201cFifty Million Rising.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ermanno Olmi, Whose Films Captured Humble Lives, Dies at 86", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byErmanno Olmi, a largely self-taught Italian director who wove family folk tales and unadorned accounts of farm life, class and Roman Catholicism into neorealist films that often starred amateur actors, died on Friday in Asiago, Italy. He was 86.His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by Roberto Rigoni Stern, the mayor of Asiago, the northeastern town where Mr. Olmi had lived since 1959.Chronicling his country\u2019s 20th-century evolution from a backward agrarian economy into an industrial giant, Mr. Olmi \u201cgave voice to a peasant civilization by going back to its origins,\u201d President Sergio Mattarella of Italy said in a statement, \u201chonoring the feelings of simple people and places where nature meets man.\u201dMr. Olmi was more popular at home than abroad, but several of his movies enjoyed international success. He was best known for \u201cThe Tree of Wooden Clogs,\u201d a three-hour epic about 19th-century Lombardian peasant life; he wrote, filmed with a hand-held 35-milimeter camera and edited the movie. It won the Palme d\u2019Or at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival, the festival\u2019s highest prize.He was also known for \u201cIl Posto\u201d (\u201cThe Job\u201d), a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age drama, released in 1961, about the isolating corporate grind in Milan, and \u201cThe Legend of the Holy Drinker,\u201d adapted from a novella by the Austrian author Joseph Roth about a homeless man living beneath the bridges of Paris. It won the Golden Lion at the 1988 Venice Film Festival.\u201cOf all the major Italian filmmakers,\u201d Mr. Sitney added, \u201che has the least problematic relationship with the church. For the most part, his films center upon an individual worker caught between employment and an individual quest to assert dignity through labor.\u201dThe director Martin Scorsese, in a statement, described Mr. Olmi as \u201cone of the last of the great filmmakers of the \u201960s.\u201dMr. Olmi was born on July 24, 1931, in Treviglio, a town in Bergamo province in northern Italy. His mother worked in a spinning mill. His father, a railway worker and militant anti-Fascist, moved the family to Milan when Ermanno was 3.When he was 16, he was hired as a messenger by the electric utility company Edison-Volta, where his parents by then also worked. He abandoned his plans to become an architect and, inspired by the films of Roberto Rossellini, took arts courses and persuaded Edison-Volta to establish a documentary division and place him in charge.From 1952 to 1961 he directed some 40 short documentaries for Edison-Volta. When the company commissioned him to produce a film about a hydroelectric dam, Mr. Olmi ambitiously assembled a crew of 25 and transformed the assignment into his first feature-length film.In that film, \u201cTime Stood Still\u201d (1959), he chronicled in an understated style the rapport between the dam\u2019s watchman and his apprentice.\u201cIl Posto,\u201d his first scripted feature, included a performance by Loredana Detto, whom he later married.

{"Headline": "What It Would Mean to End the Korean War", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Stanley, a former U.S. Army intelligence officer in South Korea, wrote a book about the domestic politics of how conflicts end, including the Korean War.Much ambiguity remains about what exactly it would take to accomplish what Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon vowed to do, and many analysts have expressed skepticism about this diplomatic overture, pointing to a number of other supposed breakthroughs in the past that petered out. Yet this moment does seem different in at least one important respect.After North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, it almost managed to push the United Nations Command, the multinational force defending the South, off the peninsula. By November, the U.N.C. was touching the Chinese border. By January 1951, after the dramatic intervention of Chinese forces, the Communists overtook Seoul again. Come June 1951, the battle line had mostly stabilized near the 38th parallel. Armistice negotiations began.At that point, neither the North nor the South wanted to stop fighting \u2014 yet both were brought to the negotiating table by their respective Cold War patrons. The United States spoke for the U.N.C.; China spoke for the Communists. The two Koreas were their voiceless accessories.The Truman administration wanted to show resolve but also to end the war promptly in order to focus on rearming and preparing NATO for the full-on Soviet attack it expected in Europe. The Chinese and the Soviets were hoping to drag out the conflict, though without triggering World War III: As Mao put it, \u201cnegotiating while fighting\u201d seemed like the least costly way to accomplish that goal. The Communists wanted to tie down the United States on the Korean Peninsula to buy themselves time to industrialize and build up their own defenses.Although it had been North Korea\u2019s idea to start the war, after that its government was mostly excluded from the Communist camp\u2019s military and diplomatic strategizing. Archival evidence, including declassified cables between the leaders of the three Communist states, suggests that North Korea was ready to end the conflict by early 1952: The devastation caused by the fighting and a record-breaking flood had ravaged the countryside, triggering a terrible famine. But the Soviet Union and China ignored Pyongyang\u2019s preferences because prolonging the war served their own interests.China\u2019s view changed after its governing coalition shifted in the summer of 1952. The new leadership group decided to focus on economic reconstruction and industrialization at home, which would require curbing the tremendous costs that China was incurring in Korea. China was ready to settle in August of that year; by then, though, it found itself entrapped by its financial dependence on the Soviet Union. It wasn\u2019t until three weeks after Stalin\u2019s death on March 5, 1953, that the Communist camp finally made concessions on the last major sticking point in the armistice negotiations: the terms under which prisoners of war would be repatriated.While North Korea\u2019s pleas to end the war had been ignored by its allies, the United States repeatedly reined in South Korea\u2019s efforts to prolong it. The South Korean government didn\u2019t want the conflict to stop until the reunification of the Korean Peninsula could be assured, and it staged various mass protests against armistice talks. Its National Assembly passed several unanimous resolutions to that effect: in 1951 proposing to continue fighting for an \u201cindependent and unified country\u201d and in April 1953 opposing any armistice that didn\u2019t also provide for a reunified Korea.American and Chinese negotiators had already agreed in late 1951 to keep the peninsula divided by a demilitarized zone \u2014 and so when the Americans presented the U.N.C.\u2019s final offer to the Communists in May 1953, they did not show it first to President Syngman Rhee of South Korea, for fear of his reaction. When he found out, Mr. Rhee ordered South Korean guards to release some 25,000 North Korean prisoners who didn\u2019t want to go home. Fighting broke out again; there were tens of thousands of new casualties; the armistice was postponed.The conflict had been fought on Korean soil. Some 5.7 million people, soldiers and civilians, were killed, wounded or went missing, and most were Korean. Yet neither North Korea nor South Korea had much weight in their respective side\u2019s decisions about how the fighting was conducted or how it ended. Both Koreas were, in effect, pawns in their own war.Given this historical context, the symbolism of Mr. Kim\u2019s and Mr. Moon\u2019s recent meeting is significant: They met in Panmunjom, South Korea, where most of all those armistice talks took place, but alone, without their powerful allies.The Koreas are no longer devastated client states caught in their patrons\u2019 Cold War web. Today, South Korea is a vibrant democracy and one of the world\u2019s largest economies. North Korea may still be isolated and impoverished, but it already has amassed a significant nuclear arsenal. Their war largely unfolded beyond their control; it is time to let any peace be their own.Elizabeth A.

{"Headline": "A Veritable No Man\u2019s Land, Off the Coast of Scotland", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael Powell\u2019s 1937 film \u201cThe Edge of the World\u201d tells of the desertion of St. Kilda in the Outer Hebrides. Today, the islands\u2019 beauty remains, as do signs of what once was.IT LOOKS LIKE the Island of the Dead as we approach it, rising like an angled furl of black rock from the steel-gray sea, the dark clouds sitting so low and heavy on its head that one fears they\u2019re permanently positioned there, like an irremovable and burdensome crown. The journey to St. Kilda has not been easy. First, there were three consecutive days of last-minute boat cancellations as I sat in Portree on the Isle of Skye off the west coast of Scotland, around 250 miles northwest of Edinburgh, waiting for favorable weather conditions. They arrive, as if by magic, on the very last day that I can conceivably remain on the island before heading back home to London. Without that last-minute salvation, I would have had to return next summer to get to St. Kilda, which is another (nearly) hundred miles farther west. And the phrase \u201cfavorable weather conditions\u201d here means something more obscure than the absence of driving rain. It depends on two things \u2014 \u201cwind speed,\u201d which is obvious enough once it\u2019s pointed out, and \u201csea swell,\u201d a surface state of water that dictates whether a boat can make landing at the bay in Hirta, the main island in the small archipelago of St. Kilda. It rains all morning as I take a taxi to Uig, the port from which boats depart to St. Kilda, and increases in intensity for the first three hours of the four-hour ride.The sea is choppy \u2014 the experience of riding it feels as if the boat is often being lifted up several stories high on a billow, then dashed down from that height onto concrete. Who would have thought that hitting water could be so rough? Our skipper, Derek Gordon, smiles coolly throughout, as if this is a leisurely walk in a manicured English garden on a balmy summer evening.The skipper\u2019s assistant, also smiling, goes about the boat, distributing ginger candies for those who might need to quell their travel sickness. The route is outlined to us as we make our way out west: across a strait called the Minch into the Sound of Harris, which separates two islands of the Outer Hebrides, North Uist on the left, Harris and Lewis on the right. We are picking up a few more people from a tiny island called Berneray, next to North Uist. I\u2019m sitting right at the front \u2014 a calculation ingrained from childhood, probably misconceived, about distance from the driver and its correlation to motion sickness \u2014 so the dashboard sonar is only a few inches away from my face. On it I can see scores of lines, which, it is explained to me, are records of routes taken by the boat on its previous journeys.My sense of perspective, never the sharpest, is now so out of whack that I fail each and every time I scour the map and try to relate its markings to the territories they represent in reality. Is that Pabbay? No, just a rock that has raised its head from under the water temporarily. O.K., surely that hulking landmass to the right must be Harris? No, it\u2019s a tiny uninhabited island called Shillay.For significant stretches of the journey, not much can be seen through the water streaming down the windows. The sense of anticipation that we are being led to a place much like Eden, beautiful, pristine, almost impossible or at least very difficult to get to is dampened by the weather: Are we going to see anything through the scrim of rain and the pall of clouds? As we near St. Kilda, the islands look as if they\u2019re deliquescing. Then the second piece of magic happens: The rain lets up, the low-hanging clouds begin to look, at their lower edges, like plumes of dense smoke, and the black rock of Hirta reveals itself to be the lushest shade of green.\u201cThe Edge of the World\u201d focuses on two families, the Mansons (Peter, the father, and Ruth and Robbie, his adult daughter and son) and the Grays (Andrew and his father, James). A simple oppositional dynamic is set up: All of Robbie\u2019s energies are focused on leaving the island and its way of life, which he considers to be dying, for the bigger world (Norway, in this instance), while Andrew, his best friend and also Ruth\u2019s fianc\u00e9, is more ambivalent. Peter Manson remains implacably opposed to his son\u2019s outward-bound ambitions. The two friends take a bet on the subject: Whoever manages to scale the most difficult cliff first, without ropes, gets to have his way about the decision whether to leave or stay. Needless to say, tragedy ensues. All this is over by the first half, or less, of the film. The rest of the film works out the St. Kildan version of one of the oldest stories in the world: the decay of one unsustainable way of life and the surrender to another. But change is the only constant in our sublunary world, as writers down the centuries have noted; Powell, too, knew this well.The islanders were skilled climbers; their lives depended on it since the meat and eggs of seabirds were their main source of protein, and the birds nested and laid their eggs on precipitous and dangerous terrain. People hauled themselves up cliff faces using ropes, often a group of them tied to one another; children were ideal for this task because they were light. Tragedies were not uncommon. Here is Rev. Donald John Gillies\u2019s firsthand account of harvesting guillemots in spring 1918:This bird was found on Boreray, Stac Birroch, near the Island of Soay, [and] Stac an Armin. ... With the method used to catch this bird, you endeavoured to dress as close to the colour of the rock as humanly possible. You selected a ledge and laid on this ledge at night.... This was my first experience at this type of capturing the guillemot and I remember being a little scared. This bird would fly on to this ledge approximately an hour before dawn.If the idea of clinging to a ledge all night on Boreray appears to be daunting, how about this one of Gillies\u2019s father harvesting gannets on Stac Lee, a precipitous sea stack all of six acres in area, near Boreray?Landing on Stac Lee is not a very easy chore, however; the sea requires to be dead calm. There is a pin stuck to a rock and a rope has to be connected to this pin, then if one is successful in getting the rope around the pin, a man can jump to the ledge. This is the only way landing can be made on Stac Lee. In order to catch this bird, it\u2019s at night.By the end of the film, both Robbie and his father have fallen to their deaths while climbing the precarious cliffs of Hirta. Peter, who originally opposed Robbie\u2019s proposal to leave the island on his own terms at a village meeting, has stubbornly resisted the pressure to make a better, easier life away from the island. When the pressure ultimately becomes impossible to oppose, he relents, but at the last moment, decides to scale a cliff for a guillemot egg that he can sell to a collector. As he climbs, the rope frays and ultimately gives, resulting in the film\u2019s final death, which is heavy with metaphorical weight: The old way of life has to give; it\u2019s no longer viable. Despite the palpability of longing in his backward glance at the tough old way of life on the island, Powell\u2019s sympathies lie with the newer order: The narrative depicts with economy and dramatic eloquence the ravages to which the islanders\u2019 lives were prey. The combination of the breathtaking \u2014 and frequently bleak \u2014 beauty, that splendid and terrifying isolation, and the always already vivid theme of the inevitable death of an old order leading to the emergence of a new, would have proved irresistible to a young filmmaker. You feel that the potential for the visuals alone \u2014 so much shifting, restless drama of wind, sky, water, rock \u2014 could have been the deciding factor.SOME OF THE HOMES in the village on Hirta \u2014 all of one short street \u2014 have been restored, while others are falling into ruins. Behind the village are the most distinctive built structures \u2014 the cleits somewhat resemble igloos and have stone roofs covered with turf, with grass and moss growing on them. These green-topped huts look as if they\u2019ve strayed in from a Germanic fairy tale. They were built to store a whole range of things on which the islanders depended: grains, ropes, salted seabirds, cured fish, peat, seabirds\u2019 eggs. There are some cleits, especially near the village, that look more or less intact \u2014 have they been touched up for tourists? \u2014 but most of them, dotted all over the island (there are about 1,400 on Hirta), are in various stages of ruination, some nothing more than a pile of stones which the grass is claiming in what will be eventually a victorious outcome for the vegetation.I climb the steep slope behind the main village to see what lies on the other side of the hill. It seems like the wettest, boggiest slope ever, with scores of crisscrossing rainwater runnels, turning everything into a churn of mud and sheep droppings. Often the most feasible way of walking from one point to another is not a straight line but a zigzagging, circuitous detour, because we don\u2019t want to be mired ankle-deep in mud. I turn back frequently to look at the sweeping curve of the bay, the houses becoming toylike with increasing distance. The stones of the disintegrating cleits begin to look naturally occurring, left by geological events rather than human intervention. The sun comes out and transforms the bay to a blinding mirror. I am led upward by the illusion that once I get to the visible top, there\u2019s going to be another ridge or hill, or at least a gradual decline into the sea. But when I reach my destination, it turns out to be the edge of a cliff between the two hills of Conachair and Oiseval; nothing prepares me for it falling sheer and vertical into the water separating Hirta from Borerary and its stacks. It is dizzying; you have to step back instantly from the edge. The stretch to Boreray is the blue of the sea in a children\u2019s book. I am two weeks too late for the bird season, but at this distance, without binoculars, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to see the teeming colonies of northern gannets.Is the impulse behind this a kind of purism or a kind of self-deception? After the sheer toil and uncertainty of the journey, and the battle with weather, why would you want to ruin your pictures of a far corner of paradise? For in the end, is this not a kind of collusion, too?An earlier version of the headline with this article referred incorrectly to St. Kilda; it is an archipelago, not a single island.Advertisement"}

The 1.7-acre property it sits on includes a 16-by-30-foot swimming pool, a service suite and a one-bedroom guard house.The front door to the main house opens to an expansive foyer, with a mezzanine, which steps down to a living room with a double-height beamed ceiling. The room has a large wood-burning fireplace and a wooden bar made by a Peruvian artist. (All of the home\u2019s furnishings, which include antiques from Peru, Malaysia and India, are included in the asking price.)Down another set of steps is an open kitchen and a dining area. Off the kitchen is the service suite, which has one bedroom and one bathroom, and the laundry room.To the right of the entrance is a long hallway leading to a guest bathroom, two bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms and the master bedroom, which has a sitting area, a walk-in closet and a Jacuzzi in an en-suite bathroom.On the second floor is a bedroom suite with a walk-in closet and a bathroom that can also be reached by an external stairway. The suite opens to the mezzanine, as well as a large terrace overlooking the property. On the basement level is another bedroom with a separate entrance; it has its own bathroom and views of the garden.The guard house at the entrance to the property has a bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen. There is parking for 12 cars. The grounds were professionally landscaped, with irrigated gardens, hundreds of trees, lagoons, waterfalls and a picturesque chicken coop.The house is in a gated subdivision called Club Sierra Morena, which offers 24-hour security and other amenities, including a clubhouse, a bodega, stables, a chapel, tennis courts, a soccer field, playgrounds, a swimming pool and a small man-made beach. The Lur\u00edn River passes through the subdivision, which also contains the 12-acre remains of a pre-Incan city, said Tim Brace, the general manager of Live in Lima, the real estate agency that has the listing. From the house, he said, you can see the ancient trail that connected Lima and Cuzco.MARKET OVERVIEWPeru\u2019s home prices nearly doubled between 2009 and 2013, on the back of one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, agents said. While the market for homes in American dollars began slowing in 2014, it picked up again after the 2016 presidential election in the United States, and home prices remain strong, according to data from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru.So far, however, agents said the political upheaval hasn\u2019t affected the housing market. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no impact one way or another,\u201d Mr. Brace said. \u201cBut it sure is a reminder that the political situation in Latin America is always a major consideration.\u201dForeign buyers tend to favor Lima, the country\u2019s capital, where the most popular neighborhoods are San Isidro, Miraflores, Santiago de Surco, San Borja and La Molina, all of which offer \u201csecurity, modern architecture, and cultural and recreational areas,\u201d said Alfredo Romero, a commercial manager with Alfredo Graf y Asociados, a real estate agency in Lima.According to data from Peru\u2019s Association of Real Estate Developers, the average price per square meter in San Isidro is $2,676, or about $249 a square foot, Mr. Barragan said, and in Miraflores, it is $2,397 a square meter, or about $223 a square foot.But some new homes in Lima can go for as much as $6,000 a square meter, or about $557 a square foot, Mr. Brace said.\u201cPeruvians, on the whole, very much favor brand-new homes and apartments over those that are even five or 10 years old,\u201d he said, noting that part of the reason is that first owners are exempt from paying the 3 percent transfer tax.Buying homes in new developments that have yet to be built is another way to save a significant amount of money, Mr. Barragan said, as \u201cdevelopers tend to give special offers.\u201dThose who are interested in the resale market should be aware that prices are often negotiable, he said, and it is not unusual for a seller to be willing to come down 10 percent from the asking price.WHO BUYS IN PERUMr. Brace said the foreign buyers his agency deals with tend to be from English-speaking countries like the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. He said he is also seeing an increasing number of retirees, in particular Peruvians returning home after living abroad for decades.Mr. Romero of the Alfredo Graf y Asociados agency said his foreign clients are mostly from Chile, Colombia and Spain, but \u201cin recent months we\u2019ve received a lot of migration from the country of Venezuela.\u201dBUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Peru, except near international borders, said Jos\u00e9 Luis Puertas, a lawyer for Alfredo Graf y Asociados.While notaries handle all property sales, hiring a local lawyer is recommended, real estate professionals said. A typical lawyer\u2019s fee should not run more than $200, Mr. Brace said. And the total cost of the notary, registration and legal expenses will usually be about 1 to 1.5 percent of the home\u2019s sale price, Mr. Puertas said. (The seller typically pays the real estate agent\u2019s commission, which is about 3 to 5 percent of the sale price, Ms. Natteri said.)There is also a 3 percent tax on the transfer of real estate, known as the alcabala, Mr. Puertas said.Foreign buyers can obtain mortgages from Peruvian banks, but without a Peruvian credit rating or verifiable proof of steady and sufficient income in Peru, Mr. Brace said, it can be difficult to secure a loan.\u201cThat being said, interest rates are much higher in Peru than in North America,\u201d he added, \u201cmaking loans really unattractive to buyers accustomed to rates lower by 5 or more percent.\u201dWEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSpanish; sol (1 sol = $0.305)TAXES AND FEESNew homeowners must pay a onetime $10,000 fee to join the Club Sierra Morena Association; monthly maintenance fees are about $650. Annual property taxes on this property are $500 to $600, Mr. Brace said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

Film tends to float on the top layers of the ocean, Ms. Wang said, where it is particularly dangerous to aquatic life.Ms. Wang, a University of Pennsylvania graduate who hails from Canada, has been noodling on the problem of plastic waste since she was a teenager. In high school, she and her co-founder, Jeanny Yao, visited a waste-transfer station in Vancouver, British Columbia, and were shocked at the amount of plastic they saw.Now, using a novel reaction system that employs a liquid chemical catalyst, BioCellection turns unrecyclable, contaminated film waste into chemicals that can be used by consumers and industry. The process is \u201cvery safe,\u201d Ms. Wang said.\u201cIt\u2019s about a practical method that will actually solve the problem,\u201d she said.Michael Riedijk, an investor in BioCellection and an adviser to the company, said in an email that Ms. Wang had \u201cgreat vision\u201d and was a strong promoter and negotiator, essential skills when running a start-up. He said he backed the company because \u201cthe technology they developed is unique.\u201dLater this year, BioCellection will start a pilot program in the San Francisco Bay Area to build its first commercial machine, which can process five metric tons of waste a day. The company is also starting to market its first consumer product: a biodegradable cleaner for electronic screens. And, Ms. Wang said, it is in talks with an electronics company to use its chemicals to make charger cables.Co-founder and chief executive of Fig LoansMr. Zhou, 29, said he wanted to give consumers with marred credit a chance to prove they are better than their credit score \u2014 in part because he was given a chance to excel. He attended Phillips Academy, a prestigious school in Andover, Mass., on a \u201cnear full\u201d scholarship. \u201cThe school took a chance on me,\u201d he said, \u201c and gave an ordinary kid the opportunity of a lifetime.\u201dMr. Zhou and his co-founder, John Li, met when they were graduate business students at the Wharton School and decided that consumer-friendly small loans were a promising market.Fig\u2019s target customers have checking accounts and earn $30,000 to $90,000 a year, but may have made a mistake that excluded them from the financial mainstream. Even though their finances may have stabilized, their history haunts them. Customers can apply online for a loan from Fig, which makes lending decisions based on bank statements, taking into account expenses like rent, utilities and spending, Mr. Zhou said.Loans are $300 to $500 and, depending on the state, are repaid in four or six equal monthly installments \u2014 unlike payday loans, which typically must be repaid in two weeks, often setting up borrowers for failure. Fig\u2019s interest rates sound high \u2014 annual percentage rates are as much as 190 percent and vary by state \u2014 yet are far lower than typical rates for payday loans, Mr. Zhou said. Repayment information is sent to credit bureaus, so borrowers can rebuild their credit.Fig, which is based in Texas, tries to provide a bridge for these consumers, so they can qualify for traditional loans. Vice president of urban mobility at General Motors and chief executive of Maven, G.M.\u2019s car-sharing appMs. Steyn, 42, came to the United States from Russia as a teenager, as part of a youth showcase promoted by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the leader of the Soviet Union at the time. Her classical piano performance during the trip led to a scholarship from a Michigan arts academy. She earned degrees from Oberlin College and the University of Chicago, followed by a career as an investment banker and, later, as a merger and acquisitions executive with Alcoa. She joined G.M. in 2012 and became head of Maven in 2015.\u201cI am O.K. taking risks,\u201d she said.Maven \u2014 similar to competitors like Zipcar \u2014 targets consumers in densely populated cities, where the costs of car ownership are burdensome and parking is elusive. In New York City, Ms. Steyn said, a parking space for a sport-utility vehicle can cost $1,000 a month. Car ownership is declining in such cities, she said: \u201cSo what happens next?\u201dG.M.\u2019s answer is Maven, available in 17 cities in the United States and Canada, including New York, Detroit, Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles. It made its debut in Toronto this year. Maven\u2019s 137,000 members can use an app to access a G.M. vehicle on demand by the hour to run errands, or longer for business trips or personal vacations.Many urban consumers, Ms. Steyn said \u2014 particularly young ones \u2014 prefer access to transportation on demand, rather than car ownership. G.M.\u2019s average driver is older than 49. With Maven, Ms. Steyn aims to build a service company within G.M. and attract younger customers.Maven also offers weekly car rentals to workers in the gig economy, who can use the vehicles to transport passengers for ride-hailing companies, or to deliver food and packages.\u201cI\u2019m a passionate advocate for changes in the business model that consumers are demanding,\u201d Ms. Steyn said. Co-founder and chief executive of Peek.comDuring a trip to Turkey, Ruzwana Bashir realized she wanted a better travel app.While visiting Istanbul, Ms. Bashir, 34, a travel enthusiast who has visited dozens of countries, spent the better part of 20 hours trying to book excursions and contacting tour operators. \u201cIt was a very frustrating experience,\u201d she said.\u201cExperiences make you happier than buying products,\u201d Ms. Bashir said. People enjoy the anticipation as well as the activity itself, she said, and then they have shared memories.Ms. Bashir, who is British and attended Oxford, worked in finance at Goldman Sachs and Blackstone, where she learned about the hotel industry and other travel-related businesses. After graduating from Harvard Business School, she decided that she really wanted to be an entrepreneur.She and her co-founder, Oskar Bruening, bonded after discovering that they had both gone horseback riding in Mongolia.Peek was started in 2012, and has since raised $20 million in venture funding.Booking air travel and hotels online is now fairly straightforward, Ms. Bashir said. But arranging activities once travelers arrive at their destination remains a challenge. Travelers often don\u2019t want to book far in advance, to allow for flexibility for weather or personal preference. But if they wait until they arrive, they may end up spending excessive time researching and calling to schedule outings.With the app, Ms. Bashir said, travelers can get ideas by viewing pictures, then book basic activities like walking tours and museum visits as well as more exotic activities, such as a hot-air balloon ride, sky diving or touring monasteries in Greece.Founder and managing director of Illumen CapitalWith Illumen, Mr. Dodson aims to invest in private equity and venture funds, with a caveat: Managers must agree to undergo training to reduce implicit bias that may be creating blind spots in their choices of employees to promote and companies in which to invest. Illumen focuses on so-called impact investors: Those who aim not only to make a return on their money, but also to spur social or environmental changes.Implicit bias refers to assumptions and stereotypes that may unconsciously affect decision-making. In the financial context, Mr. Dodson said, unexamined attitudes may, for example, cause fund managers to pass uppromising investment opportunities if a company is headed by a woman or a person of color.\u201cUnless you\u2019ve thought about reducing bias,\u201d Mr. Dodson said, \u201cyou may be leaving money on the table.\u201dMr. Dodson, 39, has spent the past seven years as a consultant to the board of the Calvert Funds, a $12 billion pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing. Mr. Dodson, who grew up in Washington, D.C., said working to broaden financial opportunities had been the focus of his career. Illumen\u2019s approach is to use research-based interventions developed in partnership with Stanford University, Mr. Dodson\u2019s business-school alma mater, to help investors avoid race and gender bias. Illumen expects fund managers to commit to three years of training and analysis, he said. \u201cHe knows this is a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business.Illumen also has a nonprofit partner that offers \u201cimpact experiences,\u201d in which investors and fund managers spend time in communities to better understand the context in which their investments are made.People love lists.We want to check out the best places to travel, catch up with the best inventions of the last 100 years, be in the know about the best-dressed people, the best books, the best schools. And on and on.Of course, there is a risk to listmaking. Maybe your choices won\u2019t hold up over the years. Maybe the best book of decades ago seems not so great today.With the listmaking fervor and its risks in mind, we searched for people who would fit our criteria for visionaries. They had to be people who are forward-looking, working on exciting projects, helping others or taking a new direction. We wanted diversity in gender, race and ethnic background.We assigned writers who are knowledgeable about the subjects we deemed most important. And we limited the list to 30.Narrowing down the numbers was a huge challenge. And that\u2019s a good problem to have. It means there are a lot of people out there who are following their visions.We hope this inspires you to follow yours.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Belt-Tightening Demands Put Tunisia\u2019s Democracy at Risk", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTUNIS \u2014 When Tunisians rose up against their longtime ruler seven years ago, a pair of idealistic young teachers joined in, hoping the protests would usher their North African nation of 10 million into the ranks of the world\u2019s democracies.Mr. Jaafri, 35, a high school computer science teacher, recently took a second job installing satellite dishes and moonlights fixing computers. \u201cI still can\u2019t afford my life,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just making it, but we have taken out a lot of loans. Everything is more expensive \u2014 food, schoolbooks for the children.\u201dMs. Jaafri, 34, a university professor of computer programming, finished his lament: \u201cClothes, shoes for the kids. Of course we\u2019re worried. We\u2019re struggling.\u201dTunisia, often hailed as the sole success story of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, is in danger of being crippled by budget-cutting economic policies that critics say are imperiling the country\u2019s democratic experiment.\u201cWhen you impoverish the poor and middle class you undermine democracy,\u201d said Jihen Chandoul, an economist and co-founder of the Tunisian Observatory of Economy, a research institute. \u201cWhat\u2019s hurting the democratic process are austerity measures we\u2019ve been asked to implement to access loans. Tunisian democracy is in danger.\u201dIt is a pattern that has played out around the world, in Latin America, Asia and recently Greece, as the International Monetary Fund and other Western lenders demand that governments balance their budgets and open their economies. Those policies often produce jarring hardship and political upheaval that can undermine support for the very kind of democratic and capitalist systems the West is trying to build.In Tunisia, where the Arab Spring began, those measures are doubly biting for a people who had harbored such great hopes for a fairer society in one of the Arab world\u2019s few democracies.Protests against higher taxes and rising prices broke out across the country in January after new economic policies advocated by the I.M.F. and Tunisia\u2019s Western sponsors took effect. Following their guidance, Tunisia slashed the budget deficit at the expense of popular demands for jobs, adopted free trade policies that may hurt Tunisian producers and allowed a devaluation of the currency that has raised food and fuel prices.Tunisian economists, activists, and politicians cited a dozen more examples of what they described as free-market-style economic prescriptions that have worsened people\u2019s lives and damaged faith in the nascent democracy. One test of that faith may come Sunday, when Tunisians head to the polls for the first municipal elections since the 2010 uprising.Tunisian political leaders say they had few options but to submit to demands by international lenders, including the European Union and the I.M.F., to whom they owed $31 billion, equivalent to 60 percent of the G.D.P.\u201cWe have no choice,\u201d Naoufel Jammali, a lawmaker of the Islamist-leaning Ennahda Party and a former cabinet minister. \u201cWe have to strengthen our ties with the international institutions which advise us to take these steps. Everyone keeps talking about a new economic model, but we have no idea how to create a new model.\u201dThey also blame political infighting in Parliament and the street protests, factors that would have been easier to suppress under the dictatorship.In February, Parliament exploded into shouting matches over the process for naming a new central bank governor. \u201cBefore there was always one strong boss to make decisions,\u201d said Mohamed Saidane, a lawmaker and member of the secular Nidaa Tounes party. \u201cNow, we\u2019re changing. There are 270 deputies and 25 parties and no one has a majority. The electoral system is slowing down the economy.\u201dThe monetary fund, which was roundly criticized in the 1980s and 1990s for imposing painful structural adjustments on developing countries, insists that it is not promoting austerity in Tunisia.\u201cWe advocate well designed, well implemented, socially balanced reforms,\u201d the fund\u2019s spokesman, Gerry Rice, said. \u201cJobs and fairness will come with economic growth.\u201dAllowing Tunisia\u2019s currency to fall, the fund\u2019s defenders say, will jump-start Tunisian industries such as textiles, which are now challenged by imports from China and Turkey.But the monetary fund says it is ultimately the government that calls the shots on the country\u2019s economic direction.Economic strains on ordinary Tunisians can be seen at any secondhand clothing market in Tunis, the capital. The sprawling flea markets known as \u201cfripes\u201d used to draw the poor and the young, as well as a smattering of vintage clothing aficionados. Now middle-aged and middle-class families depend on them, and complain that even there prices have jumped. A jacket that used to cost the equivalent of $3 now costs more than $8. During a recent visit, buyers and sellers recalled that life was easier, costs lower and profit margins higher under the deposed strongman, Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali.\u201cWe no longer buy new things, and even the fripe has gotten more expensive,\u201d said Tawfiq Jendoubi, a 29-year-old employee at a grocery store. \u201cI\u2019m realizing now that everything here is too expensive. I cannot afford any of it.\u201dThe Jaafri family struggles to get by on a combined income of about $15,000 a year. After paying rent, school fees and debts, the family of five is left with about $13 a day for food, transportation, clothes and any extras.\u201cWe\u2019re not able to save anything,\u201d Ms. Jaafri said.In the country where the Arab Spring began, many Tunisians voice longing for a strong leader who can quickly make decisions and put the squabbling political class in its place.Analysts say they worry that the country is edging toward a model of autocracy similar to Egypt\u2019s after a 2013 coup by the former military leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\u201cWe\u2019re moving close to that, very slowly,\u201d said Fadil Aliriza, a Tunis-based analyst and journalist. \u201cWhether we\u2019re going to have some kind of violent rupture remains to be seen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back to the Tried and True Blue (Chip) at Christie\u2019s", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBuyers were looking for works fresh to the market from long-term collections, rather than resales.Christie\u2019s included an impressive gold-framed 1977 \u201cStudy for Portrait\u201d by Francis Bacon fresh from the Monaco-based collection of Magnus Konow, a friend of the artist, who acquired the work soon after it was painted. It was estimated to sell for at least $30 million and \u2014 pushed by four telephone bidders \u2014 it reached $49.8 million with fees, the top contemporary price of the week.The 78-inch-high canvas featured a partially clothed male figure \u2014 and bloody shadow \u2014 inspired by Bacon\u2019s lover, George Dyer, who committed suicide in 1971, just before the opening the artist\u2019s first retrospective in Paris. Paintings from this period that evoke Bacon\u2019s grief for Dyer are among the British artist\u2019s most admired works, and this was a work that had never been offered at auction before.\u201cIt was a good picture and a good price,\u201d said Ivor Braka, a London dealer who specializes in Bacon.Three telephone bidders and one in the room fought for \u201cBlueberry.\u201d Measuring 79 inches high and thickly worked in yellow, white and blue, the painting climbed to a winning telephone bid of $16.6 million with fees, beating the previous auction high of $11.9 million for the artist.\u201cHistorians are recognizing the importance of female artists\u2019 contribution to the Abstract Expressionist movement,\u201d said Andrew Terner, a private dealer and collector based in New York. \u201cAnd this was just such a beautiful painting.\u201dOn the other hand there were fewer takers for salesroom \u201cretreads.\u201d Estimated by Christie\u2019s at $30 million each, Andy Warhol\u2019s 1963 black and white silk-screen painting, \u201cDouble Elvis [Ferus Type]\u201d and Mark Rothko\u2019s monumental 1954 abstract, \u201cNo. 7 (Dark Over Light),\u201d were both reappearing at auction.The 90-inch-high Rothko had at one time been owned by the former Yahoo chief executive and Warner Bros. chairman Terry Semel. Its latest, unidentified owner had paid $21 million for it at auction in 2007.

In recent days, auto-industry representatives quietly met with senior White House officials to prepare for Friday\u2019s planned gathering. In one sign of the uncertain path ahead, there are differing assessments of the White House\u2019s message to carmakers in that meeting.The gathering scheduled for Friday \u2014 plans for which could still change \u2014 will involve top executives from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, as well as from the Japanese and German automakers Toyota, Honda, Daimler, and BMW, that individual said. The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

That kicked off their rollback effort. In its draft, the administration says that the technologies needed to increase fuel efficiency would raise the price of new vehicles, hurting car buyers. It also says that lighter, more fuel-efficient cars are less safe. And it challenges California\u2019s authority to impose its own vehicle standards. They will have a chance to air those criticisms: Once the proposal is reviewed and published in the federal register, it will undergo a public comment period and could see further changes.The administration\u2019s draft proposal, if adopted, would rule out such a compromise.

{"Headline": "Amazon Rankles Australian Customers by Pushing Them to a Local Site", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Amazon\u2019s decision to deny Australians access to its main website has set off a backlash in the country, with customers complaining they may face big price increases and a loss of access to sorely needed products.The e-commerce giant made the move, which it announced on Thursday, in response to changes to Australian tax law that will require online retailers to charge a 10 percent goods and services tax on products sold and shipped from overseas. That tax currently only applies to items bought overseas costing more than 1,000 Australian dollars ($754).Rebecca Wong, a visually impaired Sydney resident, said she feared she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the talking MP3 player that helps her choose and listen to music.\u201cThe companies which produce these sorts of goods often don\u2019t ship directly to Australia, or shipping is prohibitively expensive,\u201d she said. Amazon\u2019s international site, she added, \u201chas the infrastructure to be able to ship them at affordable prices.\u201dBut customers were quick to point out that this was a far cry from the hundreds of millions of products they could browse on Amazon\u2019s main site.Emma Shaw, a musical theater performer, said she was likely to have a hard time finding hard-copy albums for Off Broadway shows like \u201cSpamilton\u201d on the Australian site.Some have accused the Australian government of using the tax to cut down on imports. But Dr. Jim Minifie, an economist with the Grattan Institute, an Australian research organization, said the government was merely trying to make sure overseas-based online retailers didn\u2019t gain an unfair competitive advantage.\u201cThis isn\u2019t an anti-trade move by the Australian government,\u201d he said. Countries around the world were \u201csimply facing the same challenges about how to raise this form of revenue in a global economy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been argued that this is like an import tariff, but for years in Australia we\u2019ve had something of a reverse: Local retailers paying a tax that foreign retailers haven\u2019t,\u201d he added.That view was echoed by Mark Rubbo, the managing director of Readings, a Melbourne bookshop chain.\u201cI\u2019ve been pushing for this for years,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cRetailers like Amazon and their subsidiary the Book Depository have been able to avoid collecting G.S.T. from Australian customers whereas we are legally bound to collect, so immediately we are at a disadvantage.\u201dMs. Wong, the visually impaired Amazon customer, said the company\u2019s main site offered products she just couldn\u2019t get from Australian retailers, including many designed to help visually impaired people like her.In a statement about the change, Amazon said it regretted \u201cany inconvenience this may cause customers.\u201d It also said that in addition to the 60 million items available on the Australian site, \u201cthe global store will allow Australian customers to shop on amazon.com.au for over four million items that were previously only accessible from amazon.com.\u201dDr. Minifie, the economist, said that Amazon would probably continue to build a healthy customer base in Australia despite the change.\u201cAmazon\u2019s huge scale leaves them in a far better position\u201d than other overseas-based retailers, he said. \u201cA lot of smaller online retailers overseas are going to find the new tax an additional layer of complexity.\u201d\u201cThe trade-off here is that the government can make the playing field totally neutral as to whether you are buying overseas or locally, though at some cost to the consumer,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jerome Robbins, the Experimentalist", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookIt\u2019s easy to forget that the choreographer Jerome Robbins was often an experimentalist. Robbins is rightly celebrated as the creator of memorable and popular ballets, as a master of Broadway musicals and as a show doctor of legendary skill. But not all Robbins works were successes; he needed to take risks.The revivals so far have included three difficult, important, problematic pieces: \u201cLes Noces\u201d (1965), \u201cThe Goldberg Variations\u201d (1971) and \u201cDybbuk\u201d (1974). They\u2019re all worth arguing about, and well worth seeing. \u201cDybbuk\u201d was last performed here in 2008; though it doesn\u2019t belong in regular repertory, a revival every 10 years should do us all good.Robbins, gay and Jewish amid the conformist orthodoxies of Western ballet, often pushed the art form where it had not gone. His views of community and gender relations particularly tested the norms at City Ballet because that company was and is the house of the Russian-born and heterosexual Balanchine. Even though Balanchine\u2019s choreography had a few examples of same-sex partnering and all-male ensembles, Robbins sometimes pursued this with far greater dance exposure and emphasis.Some of Robbins\u2019s perceived failures were dear to his heart. One such was \u201cDybbuk,\u201d a dance distillation of \u201cThe Dybbuk, or Between Two Worlds,\u201d S. Ansky\u2019s play, first performed in 1920, about possession and exorcism, steeped in Russian Jewish culture. (It has inspired operas and films. Even the British choreographer Frederick Ashton considered turning it into a ballet.) Robbins, when he felt his first version didn\u2019t succeed, tried a second, \u201cThe Dybbuk Variations\u201d (also 1974), then a third, \u201cSuite of Dances (from \u2018The Dybbuk Variations\u2019)\u201d (1980).After his death, though, it was the original that was revived. It is a baffling, unsatisfactory, memorable piece. The marvelous costumes, by Patricia Zipprodt, make dramatic juxtapositions of pale and black hues, especially on sleeves; when characters suddenly acquire lines of hanging red strands on their arms, like plumage, the impact is high voltage. Especially for the male corps, Robbins provides a range of special arm movements \u2014 now extended while the dancers spin across the stage, now undulating while they stand \u2014 and he makes an explosive series of male solos.\u201cThe Goldberg Variations\u201d is an accumulation of experiments on Robbins\u2019s part. A series of history games, it juxtaposes baroque and modern in successive variations with changing results. He often pares his dance lexicon back to pedestrian movement and to a radically understated version of ballet. And he tests gender norms, with some strikingly relaxed examples of male-male and female-female partnering that anticipate those of right now.The most profound experiment is in the way he tests how these things can fit Bach\u2019s famous 90-minute score. Although Robbins\u2019s dances don\u2019t add up organically \u2014 and the costume designer Joe Eula\u2019s changes of attire feel like a superimposed concept \u2014 they help us to hear the exploratory nature and astonishing economy of Bach\u2019s score.In \u201cLes Noces,\u201d Robbins follows quite closely the scenario of Stravinsky\u2019s 1923 dance cantata. \u201cNoces\u201d means \u201cwedding,\u201d and this marriage is an arranged one. After centuries of ballets and other works about happy-ever-after nuptials, here is a work in which bride and groom are the least willing people onstage. At the end, while solemn bells sound, everyone else bends as if having completed their mission, but the central couple are locked together in imagery that suggests their sexual union is harsh and involuntary. The bride, holding a shape as if in mid-jump, seems a cousin of the Chosen Maiden in \u201cThe Rite of Spring,\u201d tragically fulfilling the collective will.Few Stravinsky scores are more incisive or thrilling: This is scored for four solo singers, a choir (Musica Sacra in the current performances), four pianos and percussion. Its premiere occurred in France; Stravinsky approved both Russian and French versions of the sung (sometimes shouted) texts. Since the fashion is now for Russian \u2014 and since few understand Stravinsky\u2019s partly archaic words \u2014 I wish supertitles were employed.Still, Robbins\u2019s ending is all his own and reveals his compassion. You sometimes hear claims that Robbins\u2019s work is misogynist. Though he occasionally shows women behaving badly (and men, too, as in \u201cFancy Free\u201d), I disagree. The heroines of \u201cNoces,\u201d \u201cDybbuk,\u201d \u201cGoldberg\u201d and many other Robbins ballets aren\u2019t exalted or glorified; they express a particular sympathy on his part. He didn\u2019t sublimate; he showed how things are for humans in this world.Advertisement"}

But Is It Time to Boycott?", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA reader recently asked me about Venezuelan rum.\u201cIs it ethical to still drink it given the current horrific situation politically and economically?\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cI adore dark rum and recently have become enamored with all rums from Venezuela but especially Diplom\u00e1tico. I joke that I am supporting the people of Venezuela but am I really? Should I stop drinking them? Who really owns those companies?\u201dBut is avoiding a country\u2019s products an appropriate response, or even justified? Is there a difference between rum brands like Diplom\u00e1tico and Ron Santa Teresa?\u201cLiving in a country like Venezuela, you have to live ethical dilemmas on a daily basis,\u201d said Alberto Vollmer, the chief executive of Ron Santa Teresa, the oldest and most polarizing of the rum companies in the country, in an interview last week. He likened operating in the country to walking on eggshells, and then reconsidered. \u201cMore like broken bottles.\u201dWhile Venezuela\u2019s economy is dominated by oil, the history of rum in the region goes back to the colonial era. It was made from the byproducts leftover from turning cane into sugar and became a currency of the age.My first call on Venezuelan rum was to Thor Halvorssen, an activist who runs the Human Rights Foundation, which puts on the Oslo Freedom Forum, a conference that honors dissidents from around the world.Mr. Halvorssen is a dual citizen of Venezuela and Norway, with deep roots in both countries. He thinks boycotts should be focused on repressive governments.He also said there is \u201cnot a one-size-fits-all solution or prescription with regards to ethics, boycotts and authoritarianism.\u201d He believes proceeds from purchases of goods from places like Cuba end up helping a repressive government.He had a more nuanced take on Venezuela, and said the question was more situational, depending on the company. But he was vociferous about one rum in particular \u2014 Santa Teresa, and its owner, Mr. Vollmer.\u201cHe acts as an ambassador for the regime,\u201d said Mr. Halvorssen. \u201cNobody should buy Santa Teresa.\u201d\u201cHe received the subsidies from the government and then he went on television to praise the government, in Venezuela and elsewhere,\u201d said Mr. Halvorssen, calling such executives \u201ckey enablers of the regime.\u201dI met Mr. Vollmer last week in New York to hear his side of the story. He is a charismatic executive whose great-grandfather was a merchant from Hamburg who married a first cousin of the Venezuelan independence hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. (Mr. Halvorssen is also a descendant of Bol\u00edvar.)He expressed a measure of regret, though he chose his words carefully, as one might expect, given his situation.\u201cFor me, the main ethical dilemma that I have every single day is basically thinking, is it right to stay here?\u201d he said of his country. \u201cPutting my three kids in danger, I\u2019ve got a 6-month-old baby, a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old, and of course my wife. Every single day they are there, their lives are at risk.\u201d\u201cBut then you think, if we leave, then what are you leaving unprotected?\u201d he added. \u201cAnd so you\u2019re talking about 7,500 families that depend on you, you\u2019ve got the development of the country, you\u2019ve got all that responsibility that\u2019s somehow on your shoulders, that you\u2019re basically leaving behind.\u201dRegarding his appearance last year with Mr. Maduro, he said \u201cI spoke with bad timing and probably the wrong body language. Not probably, surely. You know I\u2019ve heard the speech several times, and when you see the content of the speech, the content wasn\u2019t bad. The body language was bad, the timing was bad.\u201dHe said his company was extended a line of credit by the government, and ultimately used $1 million to buy barrels for aging rum. When I asked him what he thought about the government, he paused.\u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking what the right answer is.\u201d\u201cI would say I think we\u2019ve made mistakes, and when I say we, I\u2019m talking as a country. Decisions that have been taken have been wrong decisions that have taken us to a country that is in crisis, that has been isolated. Now I also believe that the biggest challenge we have as a country right now is coming together in having a unifying vision, a common vision.\u201d\u201cIn such a polarized environment, if you try to be neutral, everyone is going to attack you,\u201d Mr. Vollmer said. \u201cIf you leave, if the good guys leave, who is going to be there? Who is going to help steer things in the right direction? And when things somehow open up, who is going to be there to be build?\u201dOther rum companies have taken a lower profile. Victoria Cooper, a spokeswoman for Diplom\u00e1tico, issued a statement that lived up to the company\u2019s name: \u201cWe are aware of the difficult situation that our country is facing, and it is our duty to support our local community and employees in the best way we can.\u201dMr. Halvorssen, for his part, believes there should be more thought put into the question of the political conditions under which products are made.\u201cPeople are smart when it comes to buying their groceries, buying cage-free eggs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t people have an individual commerce policy?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudis Toughen Crackdown, Blunting Good Publicity Over Letting Women Drive", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe acceleration of the crackdown has come as a surprise because the kingdom is expected, in just three weeks, to grant the activists a victory by allowing women for the first time to drive. An international uproar over the arrests now threatens to drown out the accolades that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the dominant force in the kingdom, had previously won for announcing the rule change.But both supporters and critics of the crown prince said Wednesday that he appeared determined to portray the change as a royal gift to Saudi women rather than any concession to domestic or international pressure, even if silencing the activists overshadows the reform.\u201cThat sort of change has to be seen as emanating from the government itself rather than the West,\u201d said Ali Shihabi, founder of the Washington-based Arabia Foundation and a supporter of the crown prince. He argued that the activists had failed to appreciate the balancing act that the crown prince faced in checking the power of the clerical hierarchy and its conservative supporters, who opposed allowing women to drive.\u201cThese activists got carried away with being celebrated in the West as \u2018the activists driving change\u2019 and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all sounds nice and sexy in New York and London and Paris but in reality it is deadly.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt further provokes an already resentful conservative and clerical class when the government is working very hard to temper their resentment. It puts meat on the bones of the accusation from the religious class that this is all a Western-driven agenda.\u201dRights advocates said the crackdown discredited the claims by the crown prince to be a liberalizing reformer.\u201cThe crown prince wants to be the author, the creator, the narrator and the controller, and nobody else gets a say,\u201d said Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East director for Human Rights Watch. \u201cSo if you think of \u2018reform\u2019 as changes that he happens to think are a good idea, like letting women drive, he supports that. But if you think of \u2018reform\u2019 as opening up space for Saudis to have rights as people, or participate as citizens with views on the reforms, then he is the opposite of a reformer.\u201dSaudi prosecutors have not disclosed the names of those arrested or any charges filed against them, but a government statement has accused them of \u201csuspicious contact with foreign parties\u201d and of undermining \u201csecurity and stability.\u201dPro-government news outlets and social media accounts have called them \u201ctraitors,\u201d with one account splattering the word in red across their faces, or as \u201cagents of embassies,\u201d suggesting they worked for foreign governments. One newspaper said they could face as much as 20 years in prison for treason.Crown Prince Mohammed, 32, is unapologetically authoritarian, and his defenders argue that top-down authoritarianism is the only way to modernize the conservative kingdom, whether by gradually opening up more freedoms for women or by liberalizing the economy to attract foreign investment.Allowing women to drive was among the most visible steps the prince has taken to loosen the kingdom\u2019s ultraconservative social codes, but the arrests of the activists are casting a shadow over that change, too.\u201cA P.R. campaign calling yourself a reformer means nothing if you are arresting peaceful activists simply because they are calling for reforms,\u201d said Samah Hadid, the Middle East director of campaigns for Amnesty International.Mr. Shihabi of the Arabia Foundation said he, too, was shocked when he first heard the news. \u201cThe lack of an adequate explanation until today is very damaging to the kingdom.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Supported byMichelle Hynds was working at a security job seven years ago when she began to take flight lessons at an airport near Ventura, Calif. Ms. Hynds, 42, decided to make flying a career instead of a hobby. She gained experience at the controls, got a job piloting a propeller plane for a traffic reporter in Los Angeles and then went to work for a charter jet company. Now, she thinks she can move up to a regional airline, which would put her on a track for a job with one of the big United States carriers. \u201cIt\u2019s the job seeker\u2019s market,\u201d she said. \u201cI need them, for sure, but there\u2019s so many companies that need me.\u201dThousands of pilots at the country\u2019s largest carriers are nearing retirement, opening up opportunities for those, like Ms. Hynds, who pay up to $200,000 for the training necessary to advance as an aviator.Helane Becker, an airline analyst at the Cowen Group, said in a research note last year that about 22,000 pilots \u2014 about two in five \u2014 at the five largest domestic carriers would reach mandatory retirement age, 65, by 2026. The strengthening economy has also helped drive the increase in demand, with major airlines adding flights in some markets. At the same time, the supply of qualified fliers has dropped, as the stream of military aviators the big carriers have long relied on dwindles, and even the Air Force struggles to find pilots.Many aspiring pilots, drawn partly by wages that can top $300 an hour, want to end up at one of those big carriers. Doing so requires extensive training and years of practice \u2014 with good reason, as an April episode on a Southwest Airlines flight showed.\u201cWe\u2019re not building pilots per se,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to tell our students we\u2019re training them to be decision makers who happen to know how to fly an airplane.\u201dSome flight training also happens on the ground in immersive simulations that can be made to resemble situations that could be catastrophic in the air. Pilots with experience can move on to accumulating flight time in the kinds of jobs that Ms. Hynds has held. The next step is a job at a regional airline, some of which are affiliated with, and provide a pipeline to, major carriers.\u201cThe regionals have been bending over backward to bring pilots in,\u201d said Patrick Smith, a pilot who has written about the profession.Despite the higher pay, the Regional Airline Association, a trade group in Washington, said its members were having trouble finding and keeping pilots.Pilots\u2019 unions defend the new standard, saying it helps ensure the aviation industry\u2019s track record of safety. Many mainline carriers are increasing their own recruiting and training efforts.\u201cWe thought there was a candidate pool out there that was untapped,\u201d said Warren Christie, JetBlue\u2019s senior vice president of safety, security and air operations. The program, he said, created a career opportunity for people \u201cwho might not have thought the industry was an option for them.\u201dThe first group of enrollees, which included a heavy-machine operator and an accountant who was looking for a career change, completed their flight training on April 23.Not everyone believes that the looming retirements will generate a pilot shortage.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that exists,\u201d he said of a shortfall. \u201cWe see clearly a free market operating within pilot labor.\u201dStill, for many newcomers to the industry, moving up to a top position no longer seems out of reach.\u201cYou definitely feel like you have options,\u201d Mr. Shipe said.

Was it about money or culture \u2014 their struggles in the new economy or their prejudices?These conclusions, faithful as they may be to the survey data that underlie them, exemplify a misguided debate about whether culture or economics was the driving force in Mr. Trump\u2019s win. To be sure, racism is a corrosive part of American culture and politics. Nevertheless, those who try to distinguish between the explanatory power of stagnant wages and a declining industrial base on the one hand, and anxieties about the ascent of minority groups on the other, miss the point: These are not two different factors but two sides of the same coin.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]College-educated Americans speak about the economic problems of the working class in terms of trends that can be seen in tables and graphs. Those on the left criticize the federal minimum wage as being too low, while those on the right bemoan the erosion of work incentives. But the people who are experiencing these adverse economic trends express themselves differently, using a moral language that is often rooted in attitudes about work and race.In this way, they construct a positive sense of self despite the limits of their economic class. Perched precariously above the poor, they talk not about their modest incomes but rather about their superior work discipline. In prosperous times, they can take pride in their success compared with minorities.The economic distress of the white working class has been building since the 1970s. What was new in 2016 was a candidate, Mr. Trump, who spoke about that distress not in the language of a college graduate but as a working-class person might. He exploited voters\u2019 feeling that they were being left behind by a Democratic Party that seemingly favored blacks and immigrants.Working-class whites with steady employment may nevertheless consider themselves worse off because their parents made high, unionized wages that are mostly out of reach today. Those with lower incomes may not have expected as much. In other words, what matters is not the size of your paycheck but whether it allows for the standard of living you think you are entitled to.The debate over why the white working class supported Mr. Trump raises a question: Why do we care so much about determining precisely how much political upheaval is due to economics and how much is due to culture?Perhaps we are drawn to this futile quest because economic problems seem more tractable \u2014 more easily dealt with through the levers of government policy \u2014 while cultural issues seem more resistant to change. Perhaps it is because people\u2019s economic troubles are often said to reflect larger, structural problems beyond their control, whereas their cultural deficiencies are sometimes seen as their own fault. When academics and journalists want to express affinity with the working class, in other words, they focus on poverty, and when they don\u2019t, they focus on prejudice.People with unstable or insufficient incomes may express their fears by talking about race because that is the way they have learned to interpret the world. People who are frustrated by their lack of progress may still try to defend the dignity of their work. It is a mistake to see economics and culture as distinct forces. Both propelled Mr. Trump to victory.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Nightclubs Became Museum Pieces", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe two venues defined New York\u2019s night life in the \u201970s and \u201980s and had a lasting impact on pop culture: Studio 54 as the disco-fueled hedonist\u2019s playground, and the Palladium as a meeting place for the city\u2019s cutting-edge artists.Through a collection of night life artifacts that includes a scale model of the Berlin superclub Berghain, a piece of the dance floor from the Ha\u00e7ienda, the Manchester club associated with the rise of rave culture in Britain, and a mirrored sound installation in which visitors can listen to disco and techno playlists, the exhibition positions the design elements of nightclubs as central to their role as incubators for pop culture.\u201cWhen I think about design, whether it\u2019s in a nightclub or hotel, it\u2019s not so much how it looks, it\u2019s about how it makes you feel,\u201d Ian Schrager, the former co-owner of Studio 54 and the Palladium, said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing it to help you sell something else, the design is there just to lift your spirits.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s best if you don\u2019t notice a club\u2019s design,\u201d Jochen Eisenbrand, the exhibition\u2019s chief curator, said. \u201cBut it actually broadens the notion of what architecture and interior design is about because it\u2019s to do with creating an atmosphere.\u201dWhile Studio 54 and the Palladium feature prominently in the show, it also includes ephemera from lesser-known venues. \u201cThere\u2019s an existing canon of which clubs are important,\u201d Mr. Eisenbrand said, \u201cbut we also tried to show the different aspects that clubs can be important for.\u201dThere is a display from a short-lived New York venue called Cerebrum. Designed by John Storyk, the SoHo venue was open for less than a year between 1968-1969 but it graced the cover of Life magazine, which called it a \u201ccabaret for the mind.\u201dIt was more a performance art venue than a nightclub: Guests were required to don white gowns and were then led by attendants through an interactive experience that featured 360-degree psychedelic projections. Each evening was different; one involved projected images of snowy New England, complete with flakes falling from the ceiling and hot cider for the guests.\u201cIt was a sort of virtual reality environment, if you will,\u201d Mr. Eisenbrand said. \u201cThese early clubs created really immersive environments.\u201dWhat was happening in New York during this period also made its way over to Europe. In Italy, a group of young architects were already using nightclubs as testing grounds for their avant-garde designs. Inspired by what they saw at the Electric Circus, Grupo 9999, a collective associated with the Radical Design movement, went on to open Space Electronic in Florence in 1969.The venue, housed in a former engine-repair shop, featured a parachute suspended from the ceiling and was furnished using salvaged washing-machine drums and refrigerator casings. During the day, it housed an experimental architecture school; one project involved planting a vegetable patch on the dance floor. \u201cIt was an interesting moment in Italy because there was discourse about what a club is,\u201d Mr. Eisenbrand said.Ms. Rossi attributed venue closures to a general shift among young people from a culture of \u201chedonism to health,\u201d as well as the rise of dating apps which remove the need to go to nightclubs to meet people.In 2015 the London club Ministry of Sound commissioned the prestigious Dutch architecture firm OMA firm to design a new venue. The ambitious plans for the project, which Ministry of Sound canceled without explanation, feature in the exhibition.The multiuse space included mechanical walls that would change the building\u2019s shape. \u201cWe organized our project as a collage of different components which represent the anatomy of night life today,\u201d Ippolito Pestellini Laparelli, an OMA partner, said. \u201cIt was a catalog of all the programs and activities that have been characterized in night life in the past 30 years and combined them all together in an ultimate club.\u201dVenues that operate solely as nightclubs are becoming increasingly challenging to run, according to Ms. Rossi. But that, she said, was not necessarily an indicator that night life was in crisis. \u201cThe emergence of spaces that operate at different times of day or have multiple functions, suggests there is an ongoing need to go out clubbing,\u201d she said.\u201cClub culture was born in the explosion of youth culture in the 1960s and we\u2019re now in a different environment, so it does make sense that club culture is changing.\u201dFor Mr. Schrager, the spirit of night life is not all that different to how it was during his heyday of the late 1970s and early \u201880s. And it was quite straightforward back then. \u201cWhen you put the design in there, the result is more than the sum of the individual parts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates an alchemy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is oriented around a central courtyard and garden, in traditional Spanish style.The double-height front doors are 300 years old and made of chestnut with large forged-iron nails. Throughout the house are period materials from Spain, Morocco and France installed during the renovation, including plaster cornices and floors of handmade terra-cotta tile. All of the main rooms have period fireplaces with wood-burning stoves, and all of the furniture is included in the asking price.On the ground floor, there is a large drawing room, a dining room and an English country-style kitchen with a vintage Aga stove and two antique chandeliers. There are also five bedrooms, each with an en-suite bathroom and a private terrace, as well as a Moroccan-style indoor pool with red plaster walls, antique tiles and Moroccan lamps.At the rear of the house are terraced gardens and an outdoor pool. The rest of the grounds are covered by trees that produce manzanilla olives, famed for their sweetness. They are harvested in November and December, Mr. Day said, and sold to a local cooperative.The property also includes a single-car garage and a storeroom in the courtyard.Several small villages with restaurants and markets are a 10- to 15-minute drive from the house, Mr. Day said. Seville, the capital of Andalusia and a popular tourist destination near the southern coast of Spain, is about a 30-minute drive. Known for its Moorish castle, old cathedral and other historic sites, it is also the location of the nearest international airport.MARKET OVERVIEWMajor cities like Madrid and Barcelona began recovering first, said Alexander Vaughan, a founder of the Lucas Fox real estate agency in Barcelona. And \u201cnow the second- and third-tier cities are starting to pick up,\u201d he said.An improving economy and increased demand from international buyers are driving sales, agents said, noting that banks have also loosened mortgage restrictions, making it easier for buyers to finance a purchase.\u201cThe financial system is granting mortgages easier than during the crisis, but not as carelessly as it did previously,\u201d said Constanza Maya, the head of expansion and support for the real estate agency Engel & V\u00f6lkers Spain.But there has been little new construction in recent years, which has pushed up home prices in prime locations, said Ignacio Guzm\u00e1n, the director of the commercial division at Kristina Szekely Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, in Andalusia. \u201cFor a year and a half now, demand has exceeded supply,\u201d Mr. Guzm\u00e1n said.While sales in some parts of Spain remain depressed, said Mark Stucklin, who runs Spanish Property Insight, a website that tracks the housing market, \u201cgenerally speaking, demand and prices are rising in regional capitals and tourist destinations like Seville.\u201dSeville\u2019s historic district and architecture play a role in that, giving the area a unique \u201creal estate heritage,\u201d Mr. Guzm\u00e1n said, adding that traditional Andalusian homes are \u201cvery attractive for both local and foreign buyers.\u201dBut in Seville and the surrounding area, where demand has also been increasing steadily, \u201chousing stock is incredibly limited,\u201d said Karina Karlsen, an agent with Fine & Country, the company listing this property.Interest in property there, she noted, is driven by the low crime levels, the availability of land for horses and by \u201chobby farmers\u201d interested in income from crops. This home, she said, could also be converted into a small hotel, another option popular with today\u2019s buyers.WHO BUYS IN SEVILLEWhile most international buyers are looking for a second home or a place to retire, agents said, others are looking for homes to buy as an investment and for rental income.But the Seville area tends to be more of a \u201clocal\u201d market, said Ms. Maya of Engel & V\u00f6lkers Spain, attracting buyers from elsewhere in the country, particularly Madrid, who \u201cdecide to buy when the economy is going well and when buying in the capital is no longer possible for their budgets.\u201dBUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreigners buying property in Spain, although nonresidents must first obtain a tax identification number. There is also a Golden Visa program that provides residency status to noncitizens who invest at least 500,000 euros (or about $588,000) in a property.But foreign buyers would be advised to hire a lawyer to guide them through the process, as \u201cthe Spanish housing market lacks transparency,\u201d Mr. Stucklin said.Also, he said, \u201cforeigners looking to buy need to do much more research to get an idea of pricing and what sells and what doesn\u2019t before they jump in.\u201dA lawyer can research the title and ensure that there are no liens on the property, said Mr. Vaughan, of the Lucas Fox agency. That is especially important in rural areas, he added, where the specifics of deeds and boundary lines are \u201cnot always that clear.\u201dBuyers are generally required to provide a 10 percent deposit when a contract is signed. Mortgages are available to foreign buyers, but rates can be much higher than in other countries and usually cover only 50 to 70 percent of the sale price.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESSpanish; euro (1 euro = $1.18)TAXES AND FEESBuyers can expect to pay 12 to 15 percent of the purchase price in taxes and fees, including a 10 percent transfer tax and notary fees, agents said.The lawyer\u2019s fee is typically about 1 percent of the sale price.

{"Headline": "The Eviction Machine Churning Through New York City", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "Housing court, a system created to protect tenants, has become a powerful tool for landlords.Articles in this series examine New York's broken system for protecting tenants and affordable apartments.When Neri Carranza went to see the apartment on West 109th Street in Manhattan, she folded money into the pocket of her blue jacket, just in case she liked the place. This would be the first apartment she had ever looked at, the first time she could make a home of her own, paid for with the earnings from her first job, at a glass factory. And the apartment was exactly as her friend from church had described it: small but comfortable.So on a freezing Sunday in 1956, Ms. Carranza, then 32, with a crown of black hair and a fierce desire for independence, moved into the narrow two-bedroom apartment. She made it her own, cleaning and decorating every Sunday, planting yellow roses and hot-pink geraniums in window boxes, painting the walls white when they needed a new coat. As landlords came and went, Ms. Carranza stayed, becoming a fixture in the largely Latino neighborhood.Articles in this series examine New York's broken system for protecting tenants and affordable apartments.\u201cI had everything I ever wanted,\u201d Ms. Carranza said.But one day in 2010, when she was 87, Ms. Carranza learned that her new landlord wanted to evict her for what seemed like the most nonsensical reason: She supposedly didn\u2019t live in her own beloved home.She was hardly the only tenant facing eviction by the owners, the Orbach Group, a New Jersey-based company that had recently paid about $76 million for her building and 21 others nearby, a Monopoly move that effectively snapped up most of the residential real estate along a block of West 109th Street. Orbach had filed eviction suits in housing court against scores of her neighbors in rent-regulated apartments.What happened to Ms. Carranza and the others shows how New York City\u2019s housing court system, created in part to shelter tenants from dangerous conditions, has instead become a tool for landlords to push them out and wrest a most precious civic commodity \u2014 affordable housing \u2014 out of regulation and into the free market.New York\u2019s housing system can be complicated to navigate. Here\u2019s a quick primer on what your rights are and how to exercise them.New York\u2019s housing system can be complicated to navigate. Here\u2019s a quick primer on what your rights are and how to exercise them.Rent-regulated apartments, often the only homes in New York that people of modest means can afford, are vanishing as gentrification surges inexorably through the city\u2019s neighborhoods. Mayor Bill de Blasio, now in his second term, has staked much of his legacy on alleviating this crisis of disappearing affordable housing and rising homelessness.It\u2019s not just that the city\u2019s booming population and economy have spawned a wildly lucrative free market. The entire structure of tenant protections \u2014 while probably still the nation\u2019s strongest, at least on paper \u2014 has been steadily eroded by landlord-friendly laws adopted in Albany and haphazard regulation.Landlords, especially the corporate owners who control an increasing share of the market, follow a standard playbook to push tenants out. That is often the first step toward raising the rent enough \u2014 beyond $2,733.75 a month, under current rules \u2014 to break the shackles of regulation. Owners may offer tenants buyouts to leave. They may harass them with poor services and constant construction. And, sometimes on the flimsiest of evidence, they may sue them in housing court.It is impossible to say how many evictions are unjust. Many people sued for eviction do owe some back rent, and some tenants certainly abuse the court system, remaining in their apartments for months without paying. For small landlords, such tenants can mean fiscal ruin.But an investigation by The New York Times illustrates how the Orbach Group and other mega-landlords exploit a broken and overburdened system. In one of the busiest courts in the nation, errors often go uncaught and dubious allegations go unquestioned. Lawsuits are easy to file but onerous to fight. Landlords have lawyers. Tenants usually don\u2019t, despite a new law that aims to provide free counsel to low-income New Yorkers.Landlords rely on what amounts to an eviction machine. A cadre of lawyers handles tens of thousands of cases a year, making money off volume and sometimes manipulating gaps in enforcement to bring questionable cases. Punishable conduct is rarely punished.Process servers, required to notify tenants that they are being sued, sometimes violate the law. Among tenants whom servers had supposedly talked to in person, The Times found several who were abroad at the time. One had been dead for years.Judges sometimes unwittingly ordered the eviction of tenants who had no idea they had been sued.\u201cWhen they sent the marshal, they never gave us no notice,\u201d said Zanden Alzanden, a Yemeni immigrant who was evicted from his home in the historic Dunbar Apartments in Harlem when he was in the hospital in January 2017. \u201cNothing on door, ever. Only that day, the marshal coming in, my son and an old guy sitting in there: \u2018Boom boom, get the hell out of here.\u2019\u201dTo see what happens when vulnerable New Yorkers are cast into this eviction bureaucracy, The Times analyzed a database of more than a million housing court cases filed between 2011 and mid-2016. The Times also interviewed hundreds of tenants, lawyers and tenant organizers and examined in detail more than a thousand housing court cases from the past decade. It looked especially closely at two places: the Orbach buildings on 109th Street and the Dunbar Apartments two miles uptown.What emerged were often-overlapping modes of harassment: by landlords\u2019 fraudulent or exaggerated claims, by disrepair and by overall court dysfunction.About 232,000 cases were filed last year against tenants, roughly one for every 10 city rentals. Most tenants were accused of owing back rent. But in many cases, tenants were sued for rent they did not owe. Sometimes they had paid, only to have landlords claim that the checks mistakenly remained uncashed or had been lost in the mail; sometimes they were sued for money owed by a government program. Sometimes, tenants withheld rent only because much-needed repairs had never been done.New York Times reporters would like to hear from people across the country about their experiences in housing court. We may contact you to hear more about your story.Required fields are marked with an asterisk.First and last preferred, please.Street address, city and state (or borough), please.Thank you for your submission.In recent years, landlords have also increasingly turned to a different kind of eviction suit, like the one against Ms. Carranza. Known as holdovers, these cases involve purported lease violations. Often the violations are minuscule. Sometimes they are simply fabricated. Even as the overall number of eviction lawsuits has fallen over the last decade, the proportion of holdovers has grown, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens, epicenters of gentrification. A decade ago in Queens, about one in six lawsuits was a holdover. Last year, roughly one in four was.The dislocations from housing court can echo for years. Although evictions are relatively rare \u2014 there were about 21,100 last year \u2014 many tenants, tired of battling, decide to leave on their own. Some end up doubled up with relatives or in homeless shelters. At the Dunbar, more than a quarter of the tenants sued since 2013 have left.Fallou Diop, whose family lived a few doors down from Ms. Carranza on 109th Street, was sued twice by Orbach: in 2009 for falling behind on his $1,144-a-month rent, and in 2011 for allegedly subletting rooms in his apartment. He paid his back rent. The \u201csubletters\u201d were relatives who had lived with him for 19 years. But about two years after winning the second case, Mr. Diop agreed to leave.\u201cI was sick of fighting with them and sick of the harassment,\u201d said Mr. Diop, a retired baker who said he took a $50,000 buyout, a seeming fortune at the time. He then rented an apartment in the Bronx for $2,700 a month.The deal did not work out so well for Mr. Diop. The buyout money ran out. At 65, he sleeps on his ex-girlfriend\u2019s couch.With a monthly rent of about $300, Ms. Carranza\u2019s apartment was a prime target.In July 2010, the Orbach Group filed its holdover suit against Ms. Carranza, charging that she was illegally using her apartment as a storage unit while living with a nearby friend. Court documents called the apartment \u201cinaccessible and uninhabitable,\u201d packed with newspapers and trash.Photos taken five months earlier by Ms. Carranza\u2019s niece showed her sitting in the apartment, watching TV. It was crowded with furniture but well kept, with no newspapers, no trash.But mold covered the walls. Light fixtures and kitchen cabinets had rusted out. Parts of the floor had come up. The kitchen ceiling sagged.Housing court was not supposed to be used this way, as a cudgel against tenants in decrepit housing. The system was created in 1973 with a very different mission: to foster the repair and preservation of New York\u2019s aging housing stock. It also aimed to provide a single forum for landlord-tenant disputes, which had overwhelmed civil courts.The court soon crashed headlong into a business opportunity.After years of suburban flight, urban malaise and fiscal crisis, New York in the early 1990s was a city on the rebound. Neighborhoods previously considered off-limits to the upwardly mobile began to gentrify.At the same time, state lawmakers gutted protections for tenants in rent-regulated apartments. Large companies scooped up buildings, trying to flip affordable apartments into luxury rentals or convert them to co-ops or condominiums.Around the same time, Pinnacle advertised its 22 buildings on 109th Street. It wanted a single buyer.The Orbach Group was a relatively new player in New York. Meyer Orbach, who grew up in his family\u2019s real estate business, had formed the company about six years earlier, focusing on commercial and high-end residential properties. But as the 2008 financial crisis hit, the Orbach Group entered the regulated game, buying 13 buildings on West 49th Street. In May 2009, Orbach bought Pinnacle\u2019s buildings on West 109th.Orbach also adopted Pinnacle\u2019s business model. Between 2008 and 2010, it sued 182 tenants, targeting roughly one in three apartments, court records show. Orbach also relied heavily on holdover lawsuits. One in three Orbach eviction cases was a holdover, compared with one in 10 citywide.Holdover lawsuits have a distinct advantage for aggressive landlords: They can be filed with little proof, yet they can require tenants to go to court repeatedly and turn over years of personal information.\u201cThey are fishing expeditions,\u201d said Michael Grinthal, a supervising lawyer with the Community Development Project at the Urban Justice Center.Bringing a holdover case requires so little evidence, Mr. Grinthal said, that one Brooklyn landlord filed 23 identical lawsuits, accusing tenants of \u201csmoking and/or drinking and/or gambling and/or loitering.\u201d Shaken, some tenants moved, Mr. Grinthal said.In response to questions about its use of housing court, an Orbach spokeswoman, Sandra Kittel, said the company was \u201cdeeply committed to affordable housing\u201d and had kept thousands of apartments affordable.To prove that Ms. Carranza was living with a friend, Harry Tawil, the manager of most Orbach buildings in New York, said \u201ca database search\u201d revealed that she had not used her address to apply for credit in almost five years. He also swore that \u201cNeri Carranza admits that she does not reside in the subject premises.\u201dMs. Carranza and her friend said this was not true.Lawyers for Orbach asked Ms. Carranza for documents stretching back almost five years, including hospital bills, bank statements, electric bills, W-2 and 1099 forms, and tax returns. Also any wills and codicils, passport, driver\u2019s license, social security card and birth certificate.Ms. Carranza, who speaks only Spanish, considered every court document, written in English and slipped under her door, an insult. She was lucky enough to get a lawyer working pro bono, and ultimately she won. But the case stretched for more than three years. In the meantime, repairs were ordered but not done. Punitive damages were sought but not awarded. Still, the papers kept arriving. Ms. Carranza kept going to court.\u201cWhen I\u2019d see those papers on the floor, I would say to myself, \u2018Those sons of their mothers!\u2019\u201d said Ms. Carranza, who holds a black belt in karate and prefers Lanc\u00f4me perfume to all others. \u201cI would shake from the anger,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was an injustice.\u201dThe Dunbar Apartments began as one of America\u2019s grandest experiments in housing reform. Built by John D. Rockefeller Jr. in the 1920s and named for the black poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, the complex was the nation\u2019s first large housing cooperative for African-Americans.Eventually, though, the co-ops became rentals, and the Dunbar slid through a series of owners and stages of disrepair. The current landlord is a limited liability company formed by a Brooklyn company, E&M Associates, which bought the complex in 2013 after a foreclosure on Pinnacle\u2019s mortgage. And with Harlem a real estate hot zone, E&M has worked to remake the Dunbar, pushing out longtime tenants, remodeling vacant apartments and charging far higher rents.The churn and renovation have left the Dunbar in turmoil, divided between old tenants and new, and sometimes between black and white. To some longtime residents, the fresh paint and gleaming appliances installed next door signify that the landlord is letting their own homes decay to drive them out.\u201cI\u2019m gonna put it to you straight: They want the black folks to move out,\u201d said Lynette Williams, 80, who has lived in the Dunbar for 21 years. \u201cBecause the white people can come in and pay more.\u201dThrough a web of limited liability companies, E&M has an ownership interest in at least 90 New York buildings with regulated apartments, property records show. Until recently, a section of its website aimed at investors boasted that E&M approached every property \u201cfrom an investor\u2019s point of view, seeking to understand the underlying intrinsic value of the property, as well as the steps that must be taken to unlock that value.\u201d A link to the section for residents was broken.(After The Times reached out to the company, it took down its website. In response to questions, E&M also said it had \u201chad no involvement with Dunbar Apartments\u201d since mid-2017, although property records show no sale. The company did not respond to requests for an explanation.)Housing court has helped E&M unlock value. In less than five years of ownership, records show, the landlord has sued at least 250 rent-regulated tenants \u2014 almost half the Dunbar \u2014 some multiple times. There have been more than 500 lawsuits in all.Housing court records show only six successful evictions. But 15 more tenants may have been evicted: Records show that eviction warrants were issued, and those people are no longer in their apartments. Eleven other tenants agreed to leave to settle their cases.But that tells only part of the story: Dozens of others left after being sued. Many said they were tired of going to housing court to fight over repairs. All told, 67 of the tenants who were sued \u2014 more than one in four \u2014 are no longer living in the Dunbar.Most Dunbar cases examined by The Times were brought over back rent, as are most eviction suits citywide. And many tenants did owe money.But roughly a third of the cases either were discontinued because the rent had been paid or were simply dropped, indicating that the case had been filed by mistake, or that the tenant had paid after being sued or had simply moved. That raises questions about whether such suits are aimed at harassing tenants.In another third of cases, tenants admitted that they had stopped paying rent but also said their apartments needed repairs. By law, tenants may withhold rent to secure repairs.Several tenants said the only way to get problems fixed was to stop paying rent, be sued and then tell a judge.\u201cWhen they took me to court I was frustrated and upset, so I was withholding my money,\u201d said Katrina Stanley, 51, who lives in the apartment her great-grandmother moved into in the 1920s. \u201cThey sent an unlicensed person to fix my ceiling. And just as quick as he fixed it, the ceiling fell again.\u201dMany tenants complained of leaks. One apartment needed so much work, it failed an inspection for federal rent subsidies. One woman was awarded a major rent reduction after complaining of mold, cockroaches and the improper disposal of a corpse in a nearby apartment.Idrissa Sidibe, 54, a truck driver, moved into the Dunbar in 2001. Over the years, he said, he complained repeatedly about a loose hot-water tap in his bathtub.Last July, the Dunbar sued Mr. Sidibe for almost $2,600 in back rent, which Mr. Sidibe disputed. Three days before the first court hearing, Mr. Sidibe tried to add hot water to a lukewarm bath when the running water blasted scalding hot. Shocked by the pain, Mr. Sidibe struggled out of the tub, then collapsed onto the floor.His closest friend found him and called an ambulance. Photographs showed layers of skin peeling off his right foot and burns on his legs. Mr. Sidibe required skin grafts and spent more than seven weeks at Harlem Hospital Center. While he was there, his kidneys nearly failed \u2014 and the judge approved his eviction.\u201cI was in the hospital thinking, \u2018How am I going to get out of here and make a payment?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Sidibe, who staved off eviction and sued the landlord for his injuries. That case is pending.In response to questions, E&M said through its lawyers that because of neglect by previous owners, the Dunbar required vast work to meet the company\u2019s safety, cleanliness and security standards. The lawyers said they could not comment on individual cases but questioned whether tenants had actually left over the lack of repairs or fatigue at going to housing court.\u201cWe believe it reasonable to assume they left without paying rent that was owed and/or to avoid eviction,\u201d wrote Renee Digrugilliers, a lawyer with the firm Horing Welikson & Rosen.Ms. Digrugilliers said many tenants filed \u201cbogus repair claims\u201d and often made it difficult to do repairs by refusing to allow workers into their apartments. The owner, she said, sued only tenants who did not pay rent or otherwise broke the rules.Even when cases are quickly abandoned \u2014 as in a fifth of eviction suits citywide \u2014 there can be significant repercussions.Laurie Weisman says she was not behind in her rent when she was sued by the Dunbar in March 2017. So she was shocked when a reporter informed her of the lawsuit. (Ms. Digrugilliers said her firm had been given ledgers showing Ms. Weisman behind in rent.)\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re throwing a spitball and seeing if it sticks,\u201d Ms. Weisman said.\u201cI feel cornered,\u201d Ms. Weisman said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here, but I can\u2019t leave.\u201dOn April 11, 2017, the law firm Green & Cohen sued three rent-regulated tenants in a building on West 111th Street.One case was filed and dropped. The tenants in another hired a lawyer, who got Green & Cohen to agree that the lawsuit had been filed in error.In the third case, the tenant, Carolyn Opalisky, a retired jazz club owner, didn\u2019t hire a lawyer. She signed an agreement known as a stipulation, affirming that she owed about $1,325. The next day, Green & Cohen filed eviction papers, though her first payment wasn\u2019t due for more than a month.\u201cI did comply!!\u201d Ms. Opalisky wrote in a court response. \u201cSo why eviction???\u201dThe judge sided with Ms. Opalisky.Because few lawyers are ever sanctioned, the system creates an incentive to file as many cases as possible, regardless of merit.Volume is central to the business model of many law firms that represent landlords in New York. One firm, Gutman, Mintz, Baker & Sonnenfeldt, brought almost 110,000 eviction cases over five years, more than 10 percent of all cases for privately owned buildings.Some firms, The Times found, repeatedly sued tenants even after being told that they owed no rent. Sometimes rent ledgers were wrong. Sometimes lawyers sued for money owed by government programs, usually not allowed.Firms often file cookie-cutter suits, filling in rent numbers and landlord names on documents that otherwise remain the same, without verifying landlords\u2019 information. The filings echo abuses committed during the foreclosure crisis, when banks churned through hundreds of documents without reviewing them for accuracy.Most tenants do not have lawyers, even as big landlords keep lawyers on retainer. At the Dunbar, tenants had lawyers in fewer than 10 percent of the cases reviewed by The Times. Landlord lawyers go from courtroom to courtroom, pulling tenants into hallways to agree to stipulations before they ever see a judge. Tenants who do not speak English face particular problems: In Queens, more than 160 languages are spoken, but the court has staff interpreters for just three, the commission reported. Some tenants said they felt pressured to agree to deals they did not understand.\u201cThey go in there with their fancy lawyers, and don\u2019t let tenants speak,\u201d said Pandora Holt, who has lived at the Dunbar for 22 years and has been sued four times by E&M.Judges are hard-pressed to tell if certain landlords are filing inordinate numbers of eviction suits. Housing cases, unlike those brought in other courts, are not available digitally, and often lawsuits identify only the limited liability company listed as landlord, not the underlying owner. Judges can\u2019t even get a full picture of what is happening in one building. On Feb. 5, Horing, Welikson & Rosen sued 38 tenants at the Dunbar. Those cases \u2014 among 60 suits that a single lawyer filed that day against tenants in 18 buildings \u2014 were parceled out to at least six judges.Green & Cohen is considerably smaller than other firms but has represented large landlords like E&M and Orbach. (Orbach appears to have recently stopped using the firm.)An analysis of hundreds of Green & Cohen\u2019s cases revealed sloppy paperwork in many. The firm sued tenants for money due from government agencies, misstated rents and misspelled names. It submitted erroneous rent ledgers and documents that belonged in different cases.In 2015, a federal class-action lawsuit against Green & Cohen said that the firm had seemingly used \u201cthe same template for all the hundreds of cases that they filed against tenants within the State of New York within the past year,\u201d and that it had determined that meaningfully reviewing cases before filing was \u201cnot as lucrative as the filing of pleadings and motions\u201d without review. The case was confidentially settled.Even lawyers who engage in misconduct are unlikely to face penalties. Between 2011 and 2016, landlords or their lawyers were sanctioned or cited for contempt in housing court fewer than 50 times. The court doesn\u2019t even track lawyers or landlords who get in trouble.Housing court judges rarely impose sanctions unless lawyers request them. But more than two dozen tenant lawyers said they feared seeking sanctions.In October 2016, for instance, Orbach sued Margarita Galvez, saying she owed more than $12,000 on her Upper West Side apartment. Green & Cohen pursued that lawsuit even though Ms. Galvez\u2019s lawyer, Rachel Hannaford, insisted that the rent had been paid. The rent ledger itself showed a $138.50 credit.Ms. Hannaford asked for sanctions, but only against Orbach. \u201cI knew that my little lawsuit wasn\u2019t going to get Green & Cohen sanctioned, and didn\u2019t think it was worth the risk and the harm to future clients,\u201d she said.Ultimately, as part of a stipulation, she dropped that request. Ms. Galvez had not wanted to drag out the case.Ms. Carranza also ran afoul of Green & Cohen. In July 2014, almost a year after the last court date in her first case, Orbach sued her again, saying she owed about $5,500, more than half her annual income.\u201cThe neighbors would tell me, \u2018The landlord is saying you owe a lot of money,\u2019\u201d Ms. Carranza recalled. \u201cCan you imagine? I was so embarrassed.\u201dIt took her lawyers almost seven months to prove that whatever rent was missing was owed by a city program.Wesley Moise is a process server, charged with notifying tenants that they face possible eviction. Judging from entries in court records, he also appears to have acquired some of the salient skills of a mountain goat.On March 24, 2017, Mr. Moise reported, he delivered notices to six Dunbar tenants in 12 minutes.The Dunbar has 44 stairwells and 536 apartments. Each stairwell has its own front door. There are no elevators.Yet Mr. Moise claimed that, in those 12 minutes, he raced from the third floor of one stairwell to the fourth floor of another stairwell, to the sixth floor of a third stairwell, to the third floor of a fourth stairwell, to the third floor of a fifth stairwell and finally back to the fifth floor of the fourth stairwell. Each time, he needed to ring a doorbell and be let inside the building.\u201cI know this building,\u201d said Julio Almonte, who lives in the fourth apartment Mr. Moise claimed to have visited that morning. \u201cEven if I wanted to, there\u2019s no way I could go to six different apartments in 12 minutes.\u201d Mr. Moise, he insisted, did not show up at his door.A process server\u2019s job may sound mundane, but it is crucial: A tenant who does not appear in court can end up evicted after a default judgment. \u201cYou have to get notice and be able to defend yourself,\u201d explained housing court\u2019s supervising judge, Jean T. Schneider.The Times examined hundreds of cases involving an agency that contracts with Mr. Moise, Howard Belfer Inc., which is routinely hired by law firms representing Orbach and E&M. A range of problems emerged: improbable routes, hard-to-recreate travel times, signatures by one notary public on top of another\u2019s typed name, and in-person encounters that tenants say never happened.In an eviction case, a landlord must try to notify a tenant in person on two separate occasions, with two separate documents. Each time, a process server should knock and wait several minutes, returning another day if no one answers, according to case law. If there is still no response, the server must leave a notice on or under the door.There is one further opportunity to alert a tenant in person. The landlord is supposed to verify that the tenant is not in the military or dependent on a service member, a federal requirement protecting military families from eviction.But the courts depend on process servers and those who file nonmilitary affidavits to do what they say. Servers must keep GPS tracking data, which is notoriously fuzzy, and log books, but audits are rare.About 33,000 tenants last year faced judgments for failing to appear in court. It\u2019s not clear how often bad service leads to such default judgments. But tenants who first learn about a case from subsequent eviction notices look like scofflaws in court.Mr. Alzanden, the Dunbar tenant evicted while hospitalized, had to pay more than $4,200 to recover his apartment \u2014 for rent he said he didn\u2019t owe, as well as marshal and legal fees and storage of his belongings. \u201cWe had no choice,\u201d he said.A judge can order a hearing when service is disputed; about 800 are held every year. Service agencies are supposed to report them to the city\u2019s Department of Consumer Affairs. Not all comply.Most violations result in modest fines and consent orders. Instead of revoking licenses, the city usually opts to deny license renewals.Others have kept their licenses despite numerous violations. In August 2016, Nationwide Court Services, based on Long Island, settled 287 violations.In 2012, his agency\u2019s license was suspended for a month. In 2013 Mr. Belfer paid a $60,000 fine and agreed to monitor servers.Yet his servers continued to have problems. Camera footage showed that one Belfer contractor, Dwayne Thomas, had not appeared when he claimed to have served a legal notice in May 2015, a federal lawsuit says. In 2016, the city denied a license renewal to another server, Hakeem Jamal, in part because he claimed to have served a woman at Vincent Yeats\u2019s apartment in the Dunbar one minute before serving someone 17 miles away in Queens.\u201cIt was total malarkey,\u201d said Mr. Yeats, who lived alone and found out about the case days before a possible eviction. \u201cI had such hassle from them, I just gave up and moved.\u201dMr. Jamal, who also worked for Nationwide, said it had fabricated the service in Queens. Nationwide disputed that, saying it had been \u201cduped by an unscrupulous server.\u201dMr. Thomas and Mr. Moise did not respond to requests for comment.Ms. Digrugilliers, the lawyer for E&M, said Mr. Belfer\u2019s company was one of several used by her firm. She said the firm was not aware of any fine against Mr. Belfer\u2019s company, and disputed tenants\u2019 claims of being improperly served.Last fall, The Times requested public records on Mr. Belfer\u2019s company from the Department of Consumer Affairs. In late February, after months of extensions to gather documents, the agency denied much of the request, citing an investigation into Mr. Belfer.At the Dunbar, Mr. Belfer handled many of the nonmilitary affidavits himself. He reported speaking with 15 tenants in 2016 and 2017, one twice.But all 15 tenants told The Times they had never met Mr. Belfer. Two were out of the country when he said he visited them. Five had moved out.Mr. Belfer also claimed to have spoken to another tenant, Edward Robinson, on Dec. 5, 2015. Mr. Robinson had died \u2014 22 years earlier.There was significant fallout: Since 2015, six tenants whom Mr. Belfer claimed to have spoken to were locked out. Three had to pay legal and marshal fees to recover their apartments.When a reporter visited his Long Island office, Mr. Belfer said he did not want to discuss his business. But when asked about nonmilitary affidavits at the Dunbar, he responded: \u201cThese people do not pay their rent. They will say anything to anybody.\u201dThe Orbach Group\u2019s buildings on 109th Street illustrate how a landlord can alter a neighborhood. Once an apartment empties out, workers chop it into smaller rooms and install new fixtures, all catering to students at nearby Columbia University.College students don\u2019t complain much, don\u2019t know much about rent regulation and don\u2019t stay long. Every new tenant means an opportunity for a higher regulated rent, until the apartment hits the free market.The plan is working. In 2009, when Orbach arrived on 109th Street, 285 of the 381 apartments were rent-stabilized, the most common kind of regulation, tax bills show. But by 2016, the most recent data available, only 121 were.Percentage of rent-stablilized unitsin each Orbach-owned building:0%255075100NOT OWNED BY THE ORBACH GOUP20092016BROADWAYBROADWAYWEST 109TH ST.WEST 109TH ST.AMSTERDAM  AVE.AMSTERDAM  AVE.WEST 109TH ST.WEST 109TH ST.COLUMBUS  AVE.COLUMBUS  AVE.Percentage ofrent-stabilized units in eachOrbach-owned building:Not owned bythe Orbach Group0%2550751002009AMSTERDAM  AVE.COLUMBUS  AVE.BROADWAYWEST 109TH ST.WEST 109TH ST.2016AMSTERDAM  AVE.COLUMBUS  AVE.BROADWAYWEST 109TH ST.WEST 109TH ST.By The New York Times | Source: New York City Department of FinanceIn November 2014, at age 91, Ms. Carranza was living on about $830 a month in what her lawyers described as \u201chorrendous conditions.\u201d She had been through 19 court dates.That month, a judge ordered Orbach to fix the apartment. Because the work would be so extensive, Ms. Carranza\u2019s belongings were moved into storage. She went to stay with her niece, Melinda Torres in Carlisle, Pa. The family regularly visited the empty apartment to check on repairs. Nothing much was done.By June 2015, the apartment had no running water and was infested with roaches. Ms. Carranza sued the Orbach subsidiary that owned her building in housing court to force repairs. Separately, she sued the Orbach subsidiary; Mr. Tawil, the building manager; and Green & Cohen in federal court for violating the law prohibiting unfair or abusive debt-collection practices.But by spring 2016, tired and worn down, her apartment still in disrepair, Ms. Carranza decided to settle, for about $100,000.Ms. Kittel of the Orbach Group said Ms. Carranza had consistently demanded a six-figure payment to relinquish her apartment, despite the fact that she was living in Pennsylvania. \u201cWe believe that Ms. Carranza truly demonstrates how broken the system is,\u201d she said.Ms. Carranza now lives with the Torreses, near cornfields, barns and woods.

{"Headline": "Chances of China Trade Win Undercut by Trump Team Infighting", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 By the time American negotiators wrapped up high-level talks with a visiting Chinese delegation last week, President Trump\u2019s ambitions for a multibillion-dollar trade agreement had, for the time being, shriveled into a blandly worded communiqu\u00e9 without any dollar figures. It was not clear that the talks set a path to success.Ceaseless infighting and jockeying for influence on the White House\u2019s trade team helped deprive Mr. Trump of a quick victory on his most cherished policy agenda, several people involved in the talks said. The deep internal divisions carried over into how officials characterized the agreement and muddied the outlook for the next phase of the negotiations between Washington and Beijing.On Friday, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told reporters that China had offered to reduce its trade surplus with the United States by $200 billion. Two days later, he said that the number was merely a \u201crough ballpark estimate,\u201d and that the two countries never expected to reach an agreement and merely planned to issue a statement laying out next steps.It was a muddled end to a chaotic process \u2014 one that revealed an American team riven by conflicts over tactics and policy, working for a president eager for a victory but torn by his desire to have a smooth summit meeting next month with North Korea, over which China wields enormous influence.Now the future of the negotiations falls to Wilbur Ross, the 80-year-old commerce secretary, who will travel to China in the coming days to try to nail down the commitments that proved so elusive in last week\u2019s negotiations.It was far from the take-no-prisoners tone he struck before the Chinese arrived, when the president talked about a deal that would overhaul almost every element of the commercial relationship between the United States and its greatest economic competitor.In fact, the Chinese were well aware of the divisions in the administration\u2019s trade team \u2014 and set out to exploit them, according to people briefed on the deliberations. They recognized that Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers were split between implacable critics of China, like Mr. Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, the director of the White House national trade council; and free-traders who were more sympathetic, like Mr. Kudlow, Mr. Ross and Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive.The divisions within the American team revolve around whether the United States should try to secure a short-term deal with China that would benefit some industries and avert a potential trade war, a path that Mr. Mnuchin prefers, or whether they should pressure China to make more fundamental changes to its economy, a path that Mr. Navarro and Mr. Lighthizer say is preferable.Mr. Mnuchin led the Treasury Department in declining to label China a currency manipulator, defying one of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises. He joined Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief economic adviser, in quietly arguing against trade measures \u2014 like withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 that could provoke retaliation and roil the American economy.For months, the Chinese cultivated Mr. Mnuchin as part of a concerted effort to establish him as the primary American interlocutor. And to the dismay of some of his colleagues, he embraced that role \u2014 most visibly when Mr. Trump sent his own trade delegation to Beijing early this month.During that trip, Mr. Mnuchin agreed to a private meeting with China\u2019s top economic official, Liu He, without Mr. Navarro or any other members of the American delegation. He and Mr. Navarro stepped outside to engage in a profanity-laced shouting match, an unmistakable demonstration to the Chinese of their deep differences of opinions. Mr. Mnuchin sought to play down tensions between the American officials, saying on CNBC that Mr. Navarro was \u201can important part of the team.\u201dLast week, the Chinese came to the United States prepared to deal, both by making numerical commitments to buy American goods and by promising structural changes to their economy. Over a period of years, that combination could equal $200 billion in additional trade \u2014 a figure echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s target of reducing the trade deficit by $200 billion.But the Chinese were not willing to make an outright commitment to reduce the trade deficit by a specific dollar figure, believing that trade balances are the result of broader economic factors, such as currency valuations and economic growth, and such a commitment could set off more conflict with the United States down the road.It is not clear that the Chinese ever saw the $200 billion figure as realistic or even relevant, people briefed on their plans said. But they realized its symbolic importance for Mr. Trump, and they were making an effort to give him some kind of victory.In return for concessions, the Chinese were expecting the administration to offer relief to the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE, which had been crippled by national security sanctions that prevented it from buying any American technology.The Chinese also found new resistance to their requests to relax the export controls that prevent them from buying militarily sensitive products. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s openness to this request set off fierce opposition within the administration, especially among Pentagon officials, who feared the sales could compromise American national security.On Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin said at a Senate hearing that the United States would reject any trade deals that included weakening export restrictions on sensitive military technology.\u201cExport control items are absolutely not on the table for discussions, we would in no way look to loosen that,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, explaining that Mr. Trump has asked him to aggressively review deals involving such industries. \u201cI can assure you this president is very focused on, as I\u2019ve said, protecting American technology.\u201dAs the talks with China began, Trump officials put out word \u2014 first in private, and then publicly \u2014 that the Chinese were prepared to meet the $200 billion target. Their motives differed: Some may have blared the figure in an effort to lock the Chinese into their promises. Others may have leaked it as a warning that the administration was focused on reducing the trade deficit at the expense of other priorities, like overhauling the Chinese economy and ending its pattern of forcing American companies that do business in China to hand over intellectual property.Whatever the motivation, the leaks ignited a backlash from the Chinese. On Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry denied that it had offered to reduce its trade surplus by $200 billion. On Friday, the state-run People\u2019s Daily labeled the reports \u201ca misunderstanding.\u201dAlso on Friday, Mr. Kudlow told reporters that \u201cthe number\u2019s a good number.\u201d But on Sunday, he said, \u201cMaybe I got ahead of the curve.\u201dMr. Trump, Mr. Kudlow said, liked the number, \u201cbut it\u2019s too soon to lock that in.\u201dAfter expecting to wrap up talks on Friday, the two sides argued into the night about the wording of their joint statement, and the talks extended into the next day.The final product was vaguely worded and lacked numerical commitments or any firm details.In multiple TV appearances after the announcement, Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Ross presented the deal positively in an effort, some trade analysts say, to paper over divisions with the Chinese until after the summit meeting next month with the North Koreans.Not everyone was so pleased. On Sunday, Mr. Lighthizer released a statement on the talks that many in Washington saw as a not-so-veiled critique of Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s choice to prioritize the trade deficit.\u201cReal work still needs to be done to achieve changes in a Chinese system that facilitates forced technology transfers in order to do business in China and the theft of our companies\u2019 intellectual property and business know how,\u201d it said.\u201cGetting China to open its market to more U.S. exports is significant,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer continued, \u201cbut the far more important issues revolve around forced technology transfers, cybertheft and the protection of our innovation.\u201dCritics said Mr. Trump was at risk of jeopardizing a trade policy that had put China on the defensive for the first time in decades.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely stunning how we snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist and a prominent representative of the nationalist wing.\u201cChina is still in a trade war with us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we\u2019re unilaterally calling a truce.\u201dBut after the talks in Washington, the Chinese, too, seemed bewildered by the divisions, saying that even if they were able to secure concessions from Mr. Mnuchin, they were not sure those promises would ultimately hold, according to people briefed on the discussions.For the moment, it is Mr. Ross, not Mr. Mnuchin, who will be sitting across the table as the two sides continue to work toward a deal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Faces Regulatory Fight on Its Home Turf", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The staging ground for one of the biggest regulatory fights facing the technology industry is far removed from Washington or Brussels, tucked into an alley next to a wine and cheese shop about 30 miles from Silicon Valley.A barely furnished real estate office in an upscale Oakland neighborhood is the headquarters for backers of a proposed California ballot measure that would provide consumers with increased privacy rights, including the ability to demand that companies do not sell their personal data.The proposed ballot measure is the passion project of an unlikely trio: a real estate developer, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst and a financial industry executive. They say they have no political aspirations. They\u2019re not techies and they aren\u2019t your run-of-the-mill privacy zealots. Instead, they say they are like many internet consumers \u2014 a little freaked out about tech firms gobbling up people\u2019s personal data.\u201cPeople want some basic rights,\u201d said Alastair Mactaggart, the 51-year-old real estate developer who has put more than $2 million of his own money to get the measure off the ground. \u201cPeople are resentful but accepting because there isn\u2019t any sense of control about their data.\u201dThe California measure has three major components: It gives consumers the right to ask companies to disclose what data they have collected on them; the right to demand that they not sell the data or share with third parties for business purposes; and the right to sue or fine companies that violate the law.Google, Facebook, major telecommunications companies and California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce have already come out against the initiative, saying it is flawed and a threat to the economic model supporting the internet. They\u2019ve created an organization to fight the measure with a decidedly populist name, \u201cThe Committee to Protect California Jobs.\u201dPolitical consultants have told the initiative\u2019s backers that they should prepare for the opposition campaign to spend $100 million. Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the opposition, declined to put a number on the campaign spending, but acknowledged that there is a lot at stake. \u201cIt\u2019s California,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s privacy initiative hasn\u2019t been certified yet by state officials for the November election, but it is expected to appear on the ballot. The measure\u2019s backers said they have submitted over 600,000 signatures, far eclipsing the 366,000 minimum requirement.Mr. Mactaggart said he first became concerned about data privacy when he asked a Google engineer at a cocktail party if he should be worried about all the information companies were collecting about users. The engineer\u2019s response surprised him: Mr. Mactaggart was right to be worried.Mr. Mactaggart said he then reached out to Rick Arney, a finance industry executive who had worked in the California State Senate as a legislative analyst 20 years ago. Their children go to the same school, and Mr. Mactaggart knew that Mr. Arney was a supporter of ballot measures as a way for ordinary citizens to get something done outside of the political system.\u201cOne of the reasons why it\u2019s brought as a ballot initiative is that there is consensus that Silicon Valley owns Sacramento,\u201d said Chris Hoofnagle, an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and an adviser for the initiative. \u201cThere\u2019s no prospect of any consequential consumer privacy legislation.\u201dBut there was a small problem: neither Mr. Mactaggart nor Mr. Arney was a privacy expert or policy wonk. So they hired Mary Stone Ross, another neighborhood friend, who worked at the Central Intelligence Agency and had been legal counsel for the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, to oversee the effort.They spent months talking to technologists, academics and lawyers. They conducted polls and focus groups to understand what people wanted.After considering various options, they decided against taking a hard-line approach.

They would be restricted, however, from selling or disclosing that data to someone else for \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d upon a consumer\u2019s request.Mr. Hoofnagle said, however, that the measure\u2019s financial punishments for violators give the law teeth that previous attempts at privacy regulation lacked.

{"Headline": "With Demise of Nuclear Deal, Iran\u2019s Foes See an Opportunity. Others See Risk of War.", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisIn 2015, President Barack Obama offered Iran what might have been the biggest opportunity of all: trading its nuclear program for the lifting of sanctions that had stifled Iran\u2019s economy, paving the way for its reintegration into the international system.Now President Trump, Israel and the Sunni Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf want to change all that.But as frustrated as Mr. Trump and his allies were that the Iran nuclear agreement did not curb what they regard as regional troublemaking by Iran, it is far from clear that vacating the deal will either.\u201cIf we are going to confront Iran and roll back this Iranian network, what are we going to put on the table?\u201d said Randa Slim, an analyst at the Middle East Institute in Washington. \u201cAnd if Iran has gained influence and equities from these achievements, how is it going to fight back?\u201dEven as Mr. Trump scrapped American participation in the nuclear deal, Iranian-backed political parties were contesting parliamentary elections in Lebanon and Iraq, and Iranian-aligned rebels in Yemen were firing ballistic missiles at the Saudi capital, Riyadh.The onetime \u201caxis of evil\u201d member has built what it calls an \u201caxis of resistance,\u201d stretching through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon. Iranian forces or allied militias are now basically on the doorsteps of Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s most important regional adversaries.An alliance against Iran has tightened, with the United States, Israel and the gulf countries united in opposition. But if they are now more committed than ever to challenging Iran\u2019s reach, their abilities are limited.The United States is hesitant to get entangled in new wars in the Middle East. Mr. Trump has cut some foreign aid in Syria and said he wants to bring home the roughly 2,000 American troops deployed there fighting the Islamic State.Gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia, have spent billions on advanced weapons over the years but have yet to prove they can use them effectively. They are bogged down in an aerial war against Iranian-aligned rebels in Yemen, and their reliance on checkbook diplomacy has left them with little influence in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.By contrast, Iran has devised creative ways to nurture strategic relationships that do not require big military spending, which it cannot afford anyway.\u201cIt is not only the money that greases the network; it is the ideology and the willingness of the Iranians to put their own skin in the game,\u201d said Ms. Slim, the analyst. \u201cThe Saudis do not have that kind of toolbox.\u201dThat leaves Israel, which has a powerful military but little ability to build alliances with Arab countries, a legacy of its creation as a Jewish state that is still reviled in the region over the treatment of the Palestinians.Analysts said neither side wanted to escalate into a full-fledged war, which could quickly spiral into a regionwide conflagration, and by dawn, quiet had returned. But the risk of a broader war could not be ruled out.\u201cWe may be O.K. for the next month or so, but we have a big structural problem,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington. \u201cIran wants to build infrastructure in Syria. Israel is dead set against that. So it\u2019s a real witches\u2019 brew. This is a preview of a serious long-term flashpoint.\u201dHis worry was echoed by Ryan C. Crocker, a former United States ambassador to Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and other countries.\u201cThere is real potential for a much bigger fight than we have seen so far, led by Israel,\u201d Mr. Crocker said. \u201cAnd will anything good come of it? Not at all.\u201dIran would struggle to defend itself against a direct, multifront attack by Israel, the United States and the gulf countries.As a Persian, Shiite-led state, it is a sectarian and ethnic minority in a predominantly Sunni Arab region. Spurned internationally since a revolutionary Islamic government seized power in 1979, it has no access to Western weapons. And Iran\u2019s poor economy means that its regional foes have outspent it on conventional weapons.Instead, Iran has invested where it could: in relationships with substate actors that mostly share Iran\u2019s Shiite faith and sense of underdog status.\u201cIran is actually not as strong as we think,\u201d said Bassel F. Salloukh, a political-science professor at the Lebanese American University in Beirut. \u201cIts economy is quite weak, it is surrounded, so it has to project power in order to protect itself, and that strategy has worked very well, so they are duplicating it elsewhere.\u201dAnother element of Iran\u2019s power is what enemies call its aspirations and ability to build a nuclear bomb \u2014 a weapon Iran always has denied it wants despite past evidence of Iranian research on nuclear bomb-making.Iran\u2019s regional military network could not protect it from a conventional attack, but acts as a deterrent by threatening significant costs on Iran\u2019s foes.Iran can strike Israel directly through Hezbollah, which is believed to have more than 100,000 missiles and rockets, some capable of hitting major Israeli cities and sensitive infrastructure. And Iranian support for the Houthis in Yemen has bogged down Saudi Arabia in a costly war there and made Saudi cities vulnerable to ballistic missiles from Yemen.Those substate actors are difficult to defeat militarily, and wars against them could exacerbate the failed-state dynamics that Iran has proved adept at exploiting.Syria remains the most likely flashpoint, but all of the parties say they do not want a broader war and they appear to be taking steps to prevent clashes from escalating. In its airstrikes in Syria, Israel has made efforts to target weapons and not people, assuming high death tolls could put pressure on Iran and its allies to retaliate.Iran\u2019s response to Israeli strikes so far has also been limited. The rocket attack on Thursday was aimed at Israeli military installations, not cities.It remains unclear how Iran will respond to the new effort to roll back its influence. While some within the Iranian hierarchy want to preserve the nuclear agreement even without the United States, some have vowed confrontation.\u201cResistance is the only way to confront these enemies, not diplomacy,\u201d Hossein Salami, the deputy head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said last week. \u201cExiting the deal and their concerns over Iran\u2019s missile work are excuses to bring our nation to its knees.\u201dHwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fantastical Cityscapes of Cardboard and Glue at MoMA", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt ReviewThe first comprehensive Kingelez retrospective in the United States, it introduces the artist\u2019s fantasy architectural models: strong in color, eccentric in shape, loaded with enthralling details and glowing with futuristic visions for Congo\u2019s transition after its independence from Belgian rule in 1960. Beginning in the late 1970s, after arriving in the capital, Kinshasa, from his home village, Kingelez made his primarily civic structures from a lexicon of cut paper, cardboard, cigarette packaging, translucent sheets of tinted plastic, and glue. The consistency of style and rigor is impressive and, astoundingly, Kingelez made up these fascinators as he went along, without studies \u2014 or formal art training. Less astounding, he frequently worked his name or initials into their facades or signs.The ornate objects that Kingelez came up with snap the eye and mind to attention and push your personal image bank into high gear. It\u2019s hard to keep track of the multitude of references they can stir up. Chinese pagodas? Romanesque vaulted ceilings? Las Vegas casino signs? Eastern-bloc architecture? Empire mantle clocks? American megachurches? Jetsonian design? That\u2019s only the beginning, yet every suggestion is fastidiously integrated, nothing so crude as postmodernism\u2019s heavy-handed appropriation of Classical forms.The MoMA show presents 33 of Kingelez\u2019s creations, including single buildings, town squares and mad little urban centers, some drawing on Kinshasa\u2019s grand boulevards and buildings in a Belgian Art Deco style. They date from 1980 to 2007, eight years before his death from cancer. His reputation was established, almost instantaneously in 1989, when six models were included in \u201cMagiciens de la Terre,\u201d at the Pompidou Center in Paris, a landmark exhibition that attempted a global view of contemporary art. Kingelez spent six months in the French capital \u2014 his first trip out of Congo \u2014 and came to know a new world of materials, which he also began to be able to afford. He became a fixture in international biennials and surveys.The MoMA installation was designed by the German artist Carsten H\u00f6ller with distinctive white pedestals and platforms that add their own glamour. The centerpiece is Kingelez\u2019s masterwork, \u201cVille Fant\u00f4me\u201d of 1996, which took two years to create, covers an expanse of 7 feet by 18 feet and combines about 50 structures, including a bridge and an airport. An overhead mirror facilitates viewing; the town can be further explored by virtual reality, which is attracting long lines.The base of \u201cVille Fant\u00f4me\u201d epitomizes Kingelez\u2019s enthusiasm for beautifying his models and cities with painted lawns, gardens, pathways and roads; they seem to sit on richly patterned carpets.Kingelez favored setbacks, \u201cglass\u201d curtain walls (mostly plastic) and scallops that defined his buildings\u2019 shapes, as throughout \u201cEtoile Rouge Congolaise.\u201d Housing what he called the \u201cHigh Multicultural Court of Wisdom,\u201d this building centered on a turquoise medallion and the two low pink wings to either side, which together conjure a tricked-out army tank. Inverted pyramids were also frequent, most strikingly with the turquoise, red and cream \u201cStars Palme Bouygues,\u201d which resembles the expanding chest of a superhero, or a figure by the Chicago Imagist Karl Wirsum.Kingelez has a bit of the outsider artist in his boastfulness, including suggestions of communicating with God, and in his belief that his work would result in \u2018\u2018lasting peace, justice and universal freedom.\u201dVisitors study various Kingelez works at the show. On the upper pedestal, from left, \u201cA\u00e9romode (A\u00e9roport Moderne),\u201d 1991; \u201c\u00c9toile Rouge Congolaise,\u201d 1990; and \u201cReveillon F\u00e9d\u00e9ral,\u201d 1992.In addition his talent seemed to emerge fully formed. He was born in 1948 in the rural village of Kimbembele-Ihunga \u2014 later reimagined in a sculpture with high-speed trains and skyscrapers defined with gold metallic tape \u2014 and educated by Catholic priests in the final years of the Belgian Congo: a top student who excelled at calligraphy. (Many times tiny decorative elements of his pieces seem printed but are actually hand drawn, like the little black-on-white plaques beneath 40 windows of \u201cCanada Dry,\u201d a marvelous terra-cotta-colored piece from 1991.)In 1970, Kingelez traveled 370 miles to Kinshasa (formerly L\u00e9opoldville), like any kid with inchoate ambition seeking a larger life. He attended college, studying economics and industrial design, and taught in a secondary school for a few years. In 1978, he suddenly quit, dissatisfied but unfocused. After a month he said \u201cI became obsessed with getting my hands on some scissors, a Gillette razor, and some glue and paper.\u201d When he did he built a little house. \u201cAnd this,\u201d he told an interviewer with typical understatement \u201cis what stopped the fatal hemorrhaging.\u201dThe first two structures he made helped land him a job as a restorer at the country\u2019s central museum, where he worked for six years, perfecting his skills both on the job and at home, working with materials meticulously scavenged. He took inspiration from the Art Deco buildings left by the Belgian colonials and also from the more bizarre structures ordered up, if not always completed, by the reigning dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who came to power in 1965, changed the country\u2019s name to Zaire in 1971 and began destroying its economy and infrastructure for the benefit of his family and coterie, eventually resulting in civil war and finally, in 1997, his ouster.This exhibition has been organized by Sarah Suzuki, curator in the department of drawings and prints, with Hillary Reder, curatorial assistant, and is accompanied by a beautifully designed catalog.Kingelez referred to his models as \u201cextreme maquettes\u201d while others call them super hybrids for their mixing of media, or propositions \u2014 ideas not intended for building. As with most utopian designs, one can imagine that if built, especially into whole cities, they would feel tyrannical.But as objects they are among the most distinctive and ambiguous creations in the histories of sculpture, architectural model-making and the decorative arts. They celebrate, criticize and satirize. Some make political points right up front; his models include a hospital for people suffering from AIDS, of which Kinshasa was an early epicenter; another is dedicated to Palestinians.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Raises Key Rate to 40%, Bringing Economic Uncertainty", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Since his 2015 election, President Mauricio Macri has pushed to reconnect Argentina to the global financial system, after years of isolation.His approach \u2014 emphasizing lower tariffs, accurate economic data, trade pacts and the freer flow of capital \u2014 was largely aimed at coaxing foreign investment back to Argentina and ending the economic exile that followed the country\u2019s default in 2001.But over the last week, Argentina has been reminded that when capital is free to flow in, it can also flow out, creating profound economic implications.With foreign investors pulling their money en masse, Argentina\u2019s central bank was forced to take drastic action to stabilize the country\u2019s currency. On Friday, policymakers lifted the benchmark interest rate to 40 percent after days of intervening heavily in financial markets.While it helped settle the markets, the move will weigh on the prospects for the president\u2019s ambitious economic overhaul. It also has the potential to crimp growth, adding to political discontent.The rate increase, a day after the Argentine peso fell 8.5 percent against the dollar, was the third in a week. The central bank said it would use \u201call the tools at its disposal\u201d to slow inflation, which in March was up 25 percent from a year earlier, to 15 percent this year, a goal most analysts now see as unrealistic.In parallel, officials announced that they would cut government spending, and reduce the primary budget deficit to 2.7 percent, from the earlier goal of 3.2 percent. Their decision was seen as a response to criticism from investors that Mr. Macri\u2019s government had not been cutting spending quickly enough.Mr. Macri was sworn into office in December 2015. Argentina had been closed to international markets for more than a decade amid a long-running legal fight with bondholders that followed a default on its debt.Early on, Mr. Macri\u2019s policies were greeted with widespread optimism by financial markets, which gobbled up the country\u2019s newly issued bonds.In a show of market confidence, prices for the country\u2019s government bonds rose, pushing interest rates lower. Those lower rates helped to stimulate economic growth.\u201cThere was overconfidence on the part of policymakers about how much could be done given the constraints they had,\u201d said Alvaro Vivanco, a strategist covering Latin American bond and currency markets for the Spanish bank BBVA.But doubts about the government\u2019s ability to quickly push through the changes have emerged in recent months. In January, Argentina\u2019s central bank cut interest rates and increased its inflation target, a decision interpreted by some as weakening the government\u2019s commitment to getting consumer prices under control.\u201cThe central bank was cutting, with inflation expectations deteriorating,\u201d said Gabriel Gersztein, head of Latin American strategy at BNP Paribas. \u201cAnd this was a wake-up call for international investors.\u201dThe global economic backdrop has also been changing. With the United States economy on solid footing, its short-term interest rates have been rising. That has put upward pressure on the United States dollar, and has resulted in a slide for the peso. That decline in the peso has accelerated in recent days, as foreign investors began to see their returns vaporized by the falling currency.People moved to the exits, in part because of a new income tax on foreign investors. As more and more investors pulled out, Argentina was suddenly facing a currency run.Argentine officials have struggled to shore up the currency. Since March, Argentina has spent more than $7.7 billion of its international reserves, with the pace speeding up late last week.Governments have a few tools they can use to stem the outflow of capital. One of them is to sharply raise interest rates. Those higher rates translate into potentially stronger returns for investors. As such, they can attract money into an economy, which helps prop up a currency.But it\u2019s a tricky play to pull off.Brazil raised interest rates sharply to stop an outflow of capital in the late 1990s, ultimately pushing benchmark interest rates to roughly 40 percent. More recently, in 2014, Turkey suddenly ratcheted up a key central bank rate to 10 percent from 4.5 percent in order to stop a sell-off in the lira.That same year, the central bank of Russia pushed interest rates sharply higher \u2014 to 17 percent from 10.5 percent \u2014 to keep the ruble from collapsing in response to sanctions over the annexation of Crimea and a sharp drop in oil prices. Russia also has one of the biggest interest-rate jumps on record, when in 1998 its rates reached 150 percent in an effort to stem another impending collapse of the ruble.But high interest rates have economic costs. They make it particularly difficult for businesses and consumer to borrow money. The lack of spending, in turn, can slow growth and ultimately spark a recession.The key for Argentina will be to keep rates high just long enough to inspire confidence that policymakers have halted the currency run, but not so long that the increase drains the economy.\u201cThis was done in order to stop the bleeding,\u201d Mr. Gersztein of BNP Paribas said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you have someone in the E.R. You need to take very short-term, bold decisions.\u201cThen once you stabilize the patient,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need to take different decisions in order to make the patient get better and recover.\u201dPolitically, it all puts Mr. Macri in a more precarious position.The president is now balancing the concerns of a restive population and the needs of international investors \u2014 and they don\u2019t necessarily want the same thing.International investors want assurance that Mr. Macri will continue to cut spending and stick with other parts of his plan. But those same efforts are frustrating certain constituencies at home.The higher utility costs are hitting the manufacturing sector hard, particularly companies that compete against imported goods.Ancers, a tableware manufacturer in Buenos Aires, has seen its gas bill soar by 48 percent while electricity costs have doubled since the beginning of last year. During that time, the number of employees has declined by 25 percent, said Angel Vazquez, the company\u2019s founder and president.\u201cWe may very well have to close soon,\u201d Mr. Vazquez said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can hold out for another year.\u201dWhat happens next with the economy may translate into whether Mr. Macri\u2019s coalition will win the presidential election next year or whether discontent will give rise to an interventionist government that will undo many of his changes. Although the economy as a whole is growing \u2014 expanding 5.1 percent in February, on the year \u2014 the latest measures are prompting some analysts to revise their forecasts downward.\u201cThe government so far has not been able to show big victories, and it\u2019s obvious that if it is going to take unpopular measures, its popularity will suffer,\u201d said Fausto Spotorno, the chief economist at Orlando Ferreres & Asociados, a local consultancy. \u201cBut it has rushed many of the measures so that it can avoid bad news next year.\u201dDaniel Politi reported from Buenos Aires, and Matt Phillips from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREgional Australia, PArt 1 of 2Australia is a breadbasket to the world and a globalization success story. So why are its farmers killing themselves?SIMPSON, Australia \u2014 James Guy had been a dairy farmer since he was 15, and at 55, he thought he\u2019d be preparing for retirement. Instead, he struggled to make the payments on a bank loan after the price of milk fell and never recovered.One night in November 2016, his wife, Mary, who was working part-time as a nurse to help make ends meet, came home to find he had hanged himself.\u201cWhen a farmer is looking down the barrel of having to sell his farm or lose his farm or give up the profession he\u2019d done all his life, it\u2019s devastating,\u201d Ms. Guy said, her voice wavering, from her farmhouse in Simpson, a town in Australia\u2019s dairy heartland of Victoria. \u201cThey just lose their identity.\u201dFamily farms like Mr. Guy\u2019s have been the producers of Australia\u2019s agricultural bounty, and the bedrock of its self-image as a nation of proudly self-reliant types, carving a living from a vast continent. But as Australia\u2019s rural economy has boomed on the back of growing exports, small farmers have not always shared in the bounty, with many forced into borrowing money or selling their farms.Nationwide, people living in remote Australia now take their own lives at twice the rate of those in the city: Every year, there are about 20 suicide deaths per 100,000 people in isolated rural areas, compared with 10 in urban communities, according to independent studies of local health figures.\u201cThere\u2019s a mental health crisis in rural Australia,\u201d said Hugh van Cuylenburg, the founding director of the Resilience Project, an organization that promotes mental health across Australia. He added that it had reached \u201cepidemic proportions.\u201dBut in Australia, the crisis seems to be worsening at a time when, at least on paper, the rural economy is quite robust. It is also an epidemic that few Australians fully recognize, even in rural areas. Mr. Cuylenburg of the Resilience Project, who travels around Australia giving talks on ways to improve mental health, says he finds the biggest need in rural areas.On a recent trip to Clermont \u2014 a remote town of about 2,000 people that\u2019s an 11-hour drive north of the city of Brisbane \u2014 he said hundreds of people showed up to hear him speak. Many came up afterward to share their stories about suicide attempts, their own or those of friends.\u201cThere are always issues around mental health everywhere I go,\u201d Mr. Cuylenburg said. \u201cNo one talks more about suicide, no one seems to be more affected by the numbers of suicide, than in the rural parts of Australia.\u201dThe problem has become so severe that rural communities have gone on suicide watch. In some towns, residents have compiled lists of warning signs such as sudden withdrawal from society.Despite such community-based steps, many cases require professional care.\u201cIf prevention and treatment services got to them earlier we\u2019d see less deaths,\u201d said Martin Laverty, chief executive of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, one government-backed effort to improve access to health care in rural areas.The service relies on small planes to cover some three million square miles of the most rural parts of Australia, flying in doctors and other professionals who offer basic and emergency care.But Mr. Laverty said the service is spread too thin. Last year, it provided almost 25,000 people with mental health counseling.New federal funding will allow it to triple that number next year, a sign of how dire the situation has become. But Mr. Laverty said even that will barely scratch the surface of the problem.\u201cThere\u2019s no more important topic,\u201d Mr. Laverty said. \u201cWe need to make city folk aware that the food bowl of Australia \u2014 the area in which our crops are grown, and our milk and meat is provided \u2014 needs their support.\u201dBut economists and mental health experts say a common thread is the changes unleashed by a globalizing economy.There is a painful irony here, they say, since Australia has embraced free trade in farm goods, and even pressed other nations to liberalize their markets, in the belief that agriculture is one of its most competitive industries. And Australian farm exports are growing: Last year, they totaled 44.8 billion Australian dollars, or $33.5 billion, up more than a fifth from just six years earlier, according to the National Farmers Federation.But many experts say the biggest beneficiaries are larger corporate farms. Family farms are less able to ride out fluctuations in far-flung global markets that can drive down prices of their crops while raising the cost of tractor fuel.Brian Sporne, a cattle farmer in Clermont, said people in the area had been working themselves \u201cinto a frazzle.\u201d\u201cEverything is so competitive now,\u201d said Mr. Sporne, a strong man with worn hands who raises his herd on a dry landscape of low scrubs and sandy orange earth.

The old U.S. sanctions, he said, \u201ccaused a severe drop in Iran oil exports  \u2013 it was selling oil under the table at a discount.\u201dMaking good on a campaign promise to exit the nuclear agreement, Mr. Trump described it as so weak and lopsided in Iran\u2019s favor that it was \u201ca great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the United States.\u201dHe faulted it for allowing Iran to eventually resume enrichment of nuclear fuel and for what he described as its failure to limit Iran\u2019s missile development and \u201cother malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen and other places all around the world.\u201dBut the American withdrawal does not necessarily mean the Iran agreement collapses \u2014 at least not immediately.  Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia are still parties to the agreement. If they all agree to maintain it, the effect of restored American sanctions may be softened.Mr. Trump also held out the possibility of negotiating a new agreement with Iran, though its leaders have said that won\u2019t happen.If the deal collapses, Iran will presumably be free to restart thousands of centrifuges mothballed under the agreement. That would let it increase its uranium fuel supply  \u2013 without the close monitoring of the International Atomic Energy Agency.Iran has said it could restore its uranium-enriching capability quickly, which could put it  closer to a weapons path. But that might put Iran at risk of economic isolation, at least by the European countries that agreed to the accord.Iran had the technical capability to become a nuclear-weapons state, experts say.According to U.S. intelligence agency assessments, the Iranians once operated a covert nuclear weapons development program that they discontinued in 2003.While Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear activities are for peaceful use only, it had amassed a stockpile of uranium that  further refining could have turned into fuel for nuclear bombs.By some reckonings, Iran needed only a few months to make the required bomb fuel. It would have needed considerably more time to make a reliable warhead for a missile to deliver such a weapon.UPuUraniumPlutoniumCentrifuges\u2018Breakout\u2019 timeAbout 8,000 kilogramsProduction capableMore than 19,000Three months or lessThe heavy-water nuclear reactor under construction at Arak was meant to generate electricity, but its spent fuel could have also been mined for plutonium, a potent bomb fuel.Amount of time it would have taken Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a single nuclear weapon.If the 3.5 percent (low-enriched) uranium had been further enriched to weapons-grade (90 percent or more), the stockpile would have been sufficient to fuel more than seven nuclear warheads.The rapidly spinning machines were enriching uranium at two main facilities, Fordow and Natanz.UraniumUAbout 8,000 kilogramsIf the 3.5 percent (low-enriched) uranium had been further enriched to weapons-grade (90 percent or more), the stockpile would have been sufficient to fuel more than seven nuclear warheads.PlutoniumPuProduction capableThe heavy-water nuclear reactor under construction at Arak was meant to generate electricity, but its spent fuel could have also been mined for plutonium, a potent bomb fuel.CentrifugesMore than 19,000The rapidly spinning machines were enriching uranium at two main facilities, Fordow and Natanz.\u2018Breakout\u2019 timeThree months or lessAmount of time it would have taken Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a single nuclear weapon.UPuUraniumPlutoniumCentrifuges\u2018Breakout\u2019 timeAbout 8,000 kilogramsProduction capableMore than 19,000Three months or lessThe heavy-water nuclear reactor under construction at Arak was meant to generate electricity, but its spent fuel could have also been mined for plutonium, a potent bomb fuel.Amount of time it would have taken Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a single nuclear weapon.If the 3.5 percent (low-enriched) uranium had been further enriched to weapons-grade (90 percent or more), the stockpile would have been sufficient to fuel more than seven nuclear warheads.The rapidly spinning machines were enriching uranium at two main facilities, Fordow and Natanz.Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities at the time the agreement was reached reflected a longstanding effort by the country to harness nuclear power. It began well before the revolution that overthrew the American-backed shah in 1979.Despite Iran\u2019s repeated denials, questions began to intensify more than 15 years ago about whether it had worked clandestinely to develop nuclear weapon capabilities.Led by the United States, Western powers sought to pressure Iran with economic sanctions to curb its  steadily increasing capacity to enrich uranium and produce plutonium, the fuels of atomic weapons.After years of off-again-on-again negotiations, an agreement was reached in 2015 between Iran and the major world powers \u2013 Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.

{"Headline": "Halliburton and Saudi Aramco Reach Deal to Increase Gas Output", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a sign that the American shale gas revolution is spreading to the Middle East, Saudi Aramco reached a deal with Halliburton over the weekend to lift its production program in three Saudi Arabian shale fields.The companies did not reveal many details of their three-year contract, but it represented an expansion of Saudi Aramco\u2019s efforts to produce more natural gas to support its growing chemical industry. Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, also hopes to reduce the practice of burning oil for domestic power to increase its crude exports.Over the last year, Saudi Aramco has awarded $4.5 billion in contracts to international oil service companies to increase its gas production. But a number of European companies have failed in their efforts to recover gas at an economical price.Halliburton probably has more experience in drilling and completing oil and gas shale wells than any other company, having been a central player in the past decade\u2019s shale drilling frenzy across Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Louisiana.The company has since expanded its efforts to shale fields in Argentina, Canada, Mexico and Poland. Now, its executives say it can play a major role in Saudi Arabia\u2019s efforts to diversify its oil-based economy.\u201cThis is a great opportunity to provide a tailored application of Halliburton technology, logistics management and operational excellence to maximize Saudi Arabia\u2019s asset value,\u201d Jeff Miller, Halliburton\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement at Sunday\u2019s signing ceremony in Saudi Arabia.\u201cWe welcome their expertise,\u201d said Amin H. Nasser, Saudi Aramco\u2019s chief executive, speaking of Halliburton.The public offering has made slow and uncertain progress, but the company is trying to increase its value by investing heavily in refineries and chemical plants in Saudi Arabia and around the world. Greater production of shale gas neatly fits that model, because gas is a vital feedstock for refineries and chemical production.Shale drilling has roughly doubled American oil and gas production, and made the country a major hydrocarbon exporter for the first time in decades, but the shale revolution has been slow to spread beyond a handful of countries.The practice of hydraulic fracturing \u2014 blasting through hard shale rock with high pressure mixtures of water, sand and chemicals \u2014 has proved to be highly controversial in many countries, especially in Europe. Shale formations in China appear to be more complex to drill than in the United States. Western sanctions have limited shale exploration and production in Russia.But interest in shale exploration and production is growing in the Middle East and North Africa. Last month, Bahrain announced that it had found a major shale oil and gas field in waters off its coast. Halliburton is drilling appraisal wells to evaluate how much oil can be recovered.A senior executive at Algeria\u2019s state oil company Sonatrach said last week that the company was seeking cooperation with Exxon Mobil to develop the country\u2019s shale gas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A D.I.Y. Trip Through Alaska\u2019s Inside Passage", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "ExplorerFollowing in the footsteps of John Muir \u2014 and millions of modern cruise ship passengers \u2014 one marine ferry at a time.Supported byLong before his extravagantly bearded profile appeared on postage stamps and commemorative coins, John Muir was a struggling travel writer. Muir, revered today as the founder of the Sierra Club and an early advocate for national parks, was largely unknown to America\u2019s reading public in 1879 when he first departed San Francisco bound for Alaska\u2019s mysterious Inside Passage, a seafaring route through the densely islanded panhandle of America\u2019s northernmost territory.Muir, a spiritual rover who returned to Alaska again and again, would almost certainly not approve. More than a century before the first Instagram travel hashtag, he feared status-obsessed sightseers were content to check capital-N Nature\u2019s greatest hits off their to-do lists one by one, \u201cclinging to the battered highways like drowning sailors to a life-raft.\u201dAlaskans are a seafaring people. Most of the state\u2019s 740,000 residents live in towns and cities near the coast. The state\u2019s huge size and crazy topography make road construction impractical; even Juneau, the capital, can be reached only by sea or air. The marine ferries are used primarily by Alaskans as an inexpensive way to move themselves and their vehicles from place to place as they read, work or watch the miles go by. I bought a couple of waterproof notebooks and flew off to join them.Very early the next morning, after a quick shower down the hall and a chat with a friendly, if nude, halibut fisherman, I peeked out at the tent village \u2014 just three campers on this run \u2014 and walked downstairs. The cafeteria opened at 4 a.m. and was hopping by 6. The menu reminded me of my high school lunchroom \u2014 cold cereal and scrambled eggs; burgers for lunch \u2014 a sensation amplified once seats filled up and people circled holding orange plastic trays, searching for a welcoming table. I snagged a spot next to Beau Bailey, a retired hydrologist and inveterate global traveler. He knew all about Muir\u2019s visits north and had traveled up the Inside Passage multiple times. \u201cThis journey on the ferries is probably my favorite in the whole world,\u201d he told me.The trip from Bellingham to Ketchikan takes about 38 hours. Liberated briefly from cellular coverage, people completed crossword puzzles, read detective novels, played checkers, and, mostly, shot the breeze with anyone and everyone. Longtime Alaska residents, nicknamed Sourdoughs, expressed relief to be returning from Outside, as Alaskans call the world beyond their state borders. As the green shoreline of British Columbia scrolled slowly past behind a blue-gray screen of mist, I thought of Muir\u2019s last trip to Alaska, as a member of the Harriman Expedition in 1899. Muir and two-dozen other leading American naturalists had been invited as guests of the railroad magnate Edward Harriman. When the all-star team of scientists disembarked to stretch their legs amid this temperate rain forest, they encountered knee-deep mosses and nail-sized thorns, a land as impassable as the Amazon jungle.We docked in Ketchikan around noon. When Muir last sailed through in 1899, this spot held a salmon cannery and a few shacks. Today, it is a metropolis by Alaska standards: home to 8,000 residents, a Starbucks and, on most summer days, several gleaming white monoliths: the 10-story cruise ships that dwarf the downtown. As the Inside Passage\u2019s visitor numbers grow, so do its ships. This month, the first 4,000-passenger vessel entered service, to be eclipsed by a nearly 5,000-capacity one in 2019.Ketchikan\u2019s anarchic waterfront once hosted perhaps the greatest concentration of dive bars in America. It\u2019s now thick with shops pushing souvenir T-shirts and knickknacks. The forecast called for rain, as it usually does in Southeast Alaska. I returned early to the ferry terminal to wait for the midnight boarding of the northbound MV Matanuska. Inspired by Muir (and trying to save a few bucks), I attempted, unsuccessfully, to sleep on the extremely hard deck of the observation lounge, wrapped in a thin acrylic blanket with my backpack as a pillow. Each time I opened my eyes, a teenage girl sprawled out on an inflatable sleeping pad stared at me smugly from behind a row of seats.Mr. Matney told me to borrow his truck if I wanted to have a look around \u2014 he left the keys in the ignition, a common practice in Alaska. I decided to explore on foot. Much of Wrangell looked unchanged since 1899: false-front buildings and clapboard churches, including one where Muir had mooched a night sleeping on the floor his very first night on Alaska soil. The supermarkets are closed on Sunday and an Elks Lodge anchors the busiest intersection.\u201cI sometimes feel bad for kids who grow up on Wrangell Island,\u201d Mr. Matney shouted aboard his boat one afternoon. He and Lydia had invited me out to check their very full Dungeness crab pots. \u201cBut then I think about kids like that.\u201d He pointed at two boys, probably 10 and 12, out on the water unchaperoned and fishing from what looked like a motorized rowboat; they had recently hauled in a prize king salmon. Wrangell had felt familiar from the moment I arrived, and I finally realized why: It was one of those old western towns, like Aspen or Mendocino, that everyone says you should have seen before the money arrived.Haines and Skagway, both of which sit near the top of Lynn Canal, are two of Alaska\u2019s three Inside Passage towns connected to the road system. (The third road-accessible town, Hyder, population 87, uses a British Columbia area code and its bars accept Canadian dollars.) Skagway is unabashedly touristy, looks like somewhere Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam might argue about the meaning of \u201ccarats,\u201d and welcomes up to 10,000 cruise ship visitors on a summer day.Haines bills itself as the Adventure Capital of Alaska, which is a little like claiming the title Corn Capital of Iowa, though the town does boast world-class hiking trails and perhaps a third of the vehicles I saw had bikes or kayaks strapped to their roofs. To me, Haines\u2019s chief attractions were its near-laboratory conditions for idling: a pedestrian-friendly layout; an excellent coffee shop with picnic tables where dogs lounged at their owners\u2019 feet; a superb library and bookstore; and perhaps the prettiest setting in Southeast Alaska, snow-capped mountains that rise almost straight out of Lynn Canal, a topographic contrast Himalayan in scale.Gustavus, the tiny town that serves as the gateway to Glacier Bay National Park, is one of the fastest-growing municipalities in Alaska \u2014 by acreage, anyway. Over recent decades, average air temperatures near Glacier Bay have increased and billions of tons of ice have melted. This weight loss causes the land to rebound about two inches per year. One family has unexpectedly reclaimed enough solid ground from the surrounding waters to open a nine-hole golf course.Gustavus is about 20 minutes from Juneau by air \u2014 a four-to-six-hour-long ferry also runs twice weekly in summer \u2014 yet because it is hemmed in on all sides by snowy mountains, feels a million miles from anywhere. (It helps that its dock is too small to accommodate cruise ships.) There\u2019s no downtown, just an intersection called the Four Corners, where you can find an art gallery and cafe, a transplanted 1930s gas station, and the Sunnyside Market, which sells excellent sandwiches and a wide variety of natural and organic foods.We motored slowly past a chunk of rock swarming with bald eagles on top and sea lions below, and approached the spot that, in the 1890s, had marked the terminus of Muir Glacier. The inlet was now open water. The onboard ranger explained that the onetime showpiece of Glacier Bay has receded out of sight, a retreat of more than 30 miles since Muir first saw it.Continuing north, we eventually stopped in front of the Margerie Glacier and parked next to a gigantic cruise ship. Every 10 minutes or so, a thunderclap rang out and a chunk of ice plummeted from the Margerie\u2019s mile-wide blue face, creating an epic splash. The effect was spellbinding.Glaciers advance and retreat; that\u2019s their natural cycle. But the tidewater glaciers of Alaska \u2014 those that extend to the water\u2019s edge \u2014 are almost entirely in retreat these days. The causes are complicated, and Glacier Bay\u2019s ice has been receding since the mid-1700s, but human-caused climate change is accelerating the process. Even the most remote corners of the Last Frontier are hitched to everything else in the universe. It seems likely that the Alaska writings of John Muir will outlast the ice that inspired them.We lingered of the Margerie for half an hour, entranced by its beautiful violence, then turned back toward Gustavus, borne smoothly over calm blue waters.Mark Adams is the author of \u201cTip of the Iceberg: My 3,000-Mile Journey Around Wild Alaska, the Last Great American Frontier\u201d (Dutton), out this month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Plans Up to $200 Billion in Trade Concessions, but Skepticism Abounds", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, facing an economic war with China and a momentous meeting with North Korea, is considering a trade deal with Beijing that would soothe tensions and clear the way for his historic encounter with Kim Jong-un. But it would risk abandoning the president\u2019s broader goal of punishing China for years of pressuring American companies to hand over sensitive technology.Chinese negotiators are preparing to offer the administration a deal to buy up to $200 billion worth of American goods, which would allow Mr. Trump to claim victory in his campaign to reduce the trade deficit with China and rebalance America\u2019s trade relationship with its biggest economic rival, according to people briefed on the deliberations.But the Chinese promises would be largely illusory, economists cautioned, given the structural hurdles in China to buying more American exports and the sheer amount of goods the United States would have to produce to meet Beijing\u2019s demand.Under the deal being discussed, China would pledge to buy substantially more American goods, including agricultural products like soybeans, as well as semiconductors and natural gas. That could theoretically reduce its trade surplus with the United States \u2014 which hit $372.5 billion last year \u2014 by up to $200 billion, though the real number would most likely be lower.In return, China is asking the United States to set aside tariffs and investment restrictions it has threatened against Chinese companies. That includes lifting sanctions on the telecommunications giant ZTE, which faced ruin after losing access to its American suppliers, and relaxing export controls that prevent American companies from selling sensitive technology to China.For Mr. Trump, his motive may be diplomatic as much as economic: He needs China to use its influence with Mr. Kim, who has suddenly thrown a cloud over his planned meeting with Mr. Trump in Singapore next month.The president said Thursday that North Korea\u2019s threat to cancel the summit meeting came after Mr. Kim met for a second time in China with President Xi Jinping. That meeting occurred on May 8, just a few days before a high-level delegation from China arrived in Washington on Tuesday to try to break a deadlock on trade.\u201cFor various reasons, maybe including trade \u2014 because they\u2019ve never had this problem before; China has never had this problem with us \u2014 it could very well be that he\u2019s influencing Kim Jong-un,\u201d Mr. Trump said to reporters in the Cabinet Room, referring to the Chinese president. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201dMr. Trump insisted he would drive a hard bargain with China, noting that it had become \u201cvery spoiled\u201d in trade negotiations with previous American administrations. But his explicit linkage of trade and the North Korea meeting \u2014 a diplomatic coup that he sees as a signature accomplishment \u2014 deepened the fears of critics that he might sacrifice his core trade agenda.On Thursday, Mr. Trump met privately in the Oval Office with Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier and the top economic adviser to Mr. Xi, who is expected to present the trade deal to the president\u2019s advisers on Friday.Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to stay focused on his broader trade agenda could be complicated by a bitter rift on his economic team. Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser most closely identified with tough policies toward China, is being excluded from meetings with the Chinese by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is leading the negotiations with Mr. Liu.The discord between the two men boiled over this month during a trip to Beijing, when they got into a profanity-laced shouting match after Mr. Mnuchin cut Mr. Navarro out of another meeting with Mr. Liu. Treasury officials said Mr. Navarro was excluded because of protocol, not because of his hard-line views, but the two men are starkly opposed on how best to deal with China.Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, is eager to broker a deal that would defuse a trade war with China, officials said. Mr. Navarro, an academic who has written books with titles like \u201cDeath by China,\u201d helped mastermind the investigation into whether China was stealing technology that led Mr. Trump to impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods and threaten levies on another $100 billion worth.Economists say that the purchase by China of $200 billion more in American goods per year \u2014 an amount equivalent to more than half of the annual American trade deficit with China \u2014 simply is not practical. \u201cThe short answer is these are unrealistic numbers,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Even if the Chinese stopped buying other foreign products, like Airbus airplanes from the European Union or soybeans from Brazil, and purchased solely American products, it would add up to only a small fraction of the $200 billion total they are promising to purchase.\u201cIt would even be a stretch to get it to $50 billion,\u201d Mr. Bown said.That is because the United States economy is already running near its full productive capacity, meaning it would not be able to produce enough new goods to meet Chinese demands, especially in the short term.In that scenario, the United States would probably stop selling airplanes, soybeans and other exports to other countries and sell them to China instead \u2014 shrinking the United States trade deficit with China but leaving the United States trade deficit with the entire world unchanged.And several categories of military-related equipment that the Chinese want to buy are still restricted by congressional sanctions dating back to China\u2019s bloody crackdown on protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.Chinese officials are pushing for greater access to American-made military systems and advanced technologies just as the Trump administration and Congress are weighing new rules that would move in the opposite direction, by curtailing that access.As part of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade offensive, the Treasury Department has been working on new guidelines that would restrict Chinese investment in the United States, a move that officials say is needed to better police potential security threats. The Treasury is scheduled to deliver this plan to the White House by early next week, but that could be delayed or changed based on the outcome of trade talks this week.Congress, meanwhile, is moving ahead with legislation that would expand national security checks of Chinese investment in the United States and American partnerships with Chinese companies abroad.That legislation, led by Senator John Cornyn of Texas and Representative Robert Pittenger of North Carolina, both Republicans, could move toward a vote as early as this summer.Trade skeptics inside and outside the administration have cautioned against agreeing to a hasty deal with China, saying it has repeatedly reneged on promises it made to past administrations.The administration, for example, recently claimed a win in persuading China to restart imports of American beef after a nearly 14-year ban. But China actually announced it had lifted the ban in September 2016 under the Obama administration; it simply did not start accepting beef shipments until this year.Skeptics say China has made similar unfulfilled promises to other administrations on issues ranging from reducing overcapacity in steel production to opening up its financial markets.The president said he was not sure what to make of Mr. Kim\u2019s threat to cancel their meeting. But he went out of his way to address one of Mr. Kim\u2019s prime objections: that the United States viewed Libya as a template for ridding North Korea of its nuclear arsenal. Mr. Trump said the idea, floated by his new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, was a nonstarter.\u201cIn Libya, we decimated that country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no deal to keep Qaddafi. The Libyan model that was mentioned was a much different deal. This would be with Kim Jong-un \u2014 something where he\u2019d be there, he\u2019d be in his country. He\u2019d be running his country. His country would be very rich.\u201dMr. Trump appeared to have confused the 2003 deal under which Libya relinquished its nuclear program with the NATO-led intervention in 2011 that ended after the killing of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.The president has long drawn a connection between trade and security with China \u2014 suggesting that China\u2019s help in pressuring North Korea could affect how he treated China on trade. On Thursday, he acknowledged that China was now the one using North Korea as leverage.\u201cPresident Xi could be influencing Kim Jong-un,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf you remember, a few weeks ago, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, Kim Jong-un went to China to say hello again a second time to President Xi.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

Supported byThis strange story included an intriguing detour into the recent history of United States foreign policy. One of Rybka\u2019s initial posts on the Deripaska affair was a short audio clip from a conversation that took place on the oligarch\u2019s yacht in August 2016. As they sailed off the coast of Norway, Rybka and Deripaska were joined by an influential Kremlin official named Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko, and in the clip, Deripaska, who made his fortune during the violent aluminum wars of the 1990s, explains some things about geopolitics to Rybka, who was 26 at the time. \u201cOur relations with America are bad,\u201d Deripaska says. \u201cWhy? Because the person in charge of them is Sergei Eduardovich\u2019s \u2018friend\u2019 \u2014 Nuland is what she is called. When she was young \u2014 about your age \u2014 she spent a month living on a Soviet whaling vessel. Ever since then, she\u2019s hated our country.\u201dDeripaska was referring to Victoria Nuland, a longtime American government official and \u201cRussia hand,\u201d as Russia experts are sometimes known, who at the time of the video was assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia. Nuland had in fact, as Deripaska said, spent time aboard a Soviet vessel (fishing, not whaling) in the mid-1980s; whether she hated Russia ever after is a subject of some dispute. She spent three decades in various posts in the State Department and the White House. In 2013, as a newly confirmed assistant secretary of state, she became the point person for the increasingly fraught situation in Ukraine, where large protests against the president, following his decision to pull out of an economic agreement with the European Union, eventually led to his ouster. Early in the protests, Nuland was filmed handing out sandwiches, pastries and cookies to the demonstrators in what some viewed as a provocative show of solidarity. Later, as the government began to totter, she made a call that was intercepted and leaked online, most likely by Russian intelligence, in which she discarded the notion of working with the E.U. to resolve the crisis. \u201c[Expletive] the E.U.,\u201d she memorably said.What was remarkable about the episode was the utter confidence with which Nuland seemed to speak for the United States and its policy. From the start of his administration, President Barack Obama had tried to lower tensions with Russia and refocus American attention on a rising China; he had made clear he wanted no part in the problems of the post-Soviet periphery. Yet in the middle of the uprising in Kiev, there was Nuland, encouraging protesters and insulting European allies. And after the call leaked, it was Nuland, as much as Obama, who came to personify American policy for everyday Russians \u2014 to the point that a professional sex coach like Rybka knows more about her biography than all but a handful of Americans.During two decades, on and off, reporting in Russia and the post-Soviet states \u2014 in the turbulent \u201990s, the wealthy but depressing aughts and finally during the eruption of violence in Ukraine \u2014 I occasionally heard people talk about how \u201cthe Americans\u201d wanted this or that political outcome. The events in Ukraine demonstrated, or seemed to demonstrate, that behind the visible facade of changing presidents and changing policy statements and changing styles, \u201cthe Americans\u201d were actually a small core of officials who not only executed policy but also effectively determined it. The continuing wars in Ukraine and Syria, the apparent Russian campaign of targeted assassinations on foreign soil, the widening gyre of sanctions and countersanctions and the still-festering question of Russian meddling in the 2016 election have made for the worst relations between the two countries since the 1980s. Understanding how to get out of this mess will require understanding how we got into it. There may be no better place to start than with the people inside the American government who have been working on the subject since 1991 \u2014 the Russia hands.Some Russia observers argue that this pattern of failure is a result of Russian intransigence and revisionism. But others believe that the intransigent and unchanging one in the relationship is the United States \u2014 that the country has never gotten past the idea that it \u201cwon\u201d the Cold War and therefore needs to spread, at all costs, the American way of life.Last summer, a few months after the inauguration of President Trump, I began traveling to Washington to speak with Russia hands: those who had worked on Russia inside the State Department, the National Security Council or the Department of Defense. I interviewed hands who served in the government as far back as Jimmy Carter and up to the current administration; some served Republican presidents, others served Democrats, but a vast majority served both parties.The government, as a rule, discourages specialization: Military officers and diplomats are constantly transferred from one post to another, from one region to the next. Still, specialists do emerge. Many but not all Russia hands have Ph.D.\u2019s \u2014 in Russian history or political science or security studies. Others got their graduate education on the job. Nuland worked on the Soviet fishing trawler; Daniel Fried, her eventual close collaborator at the State Department, spent a semester as a live-in babysitter for an American Embassy family in Moscow. \u201cSeeing Communism up close cures you of all your left-liberal illusions that the Cold War is a misunderstanding that can be cured through arms control and d\u00e9tente,\u201d Fried says. \u201cCommunism up close is very ugly.\u201d Some Russia hands started out as civil servants or military officers, others as academics pulled into government service after working as advisers on political campaigns.The Russia hands have clear generational characteristics. Those who came of age at the height of the Cold War worked on Russia because it was America\u2019s most important foreign-policy problem. Many of those who finished graduate school or officer-training school in the late \u201980s or early \u201990s bear the scars of having studied a subject that became seemingly irrelevant overnight. In 1989, Peter Zwack, now a retired brigadier general, was a young military-intelligence officer stationed in Germany, taking Russian language and politics courses. \u201cI was waiting for them to come through the Fulda Gap,\u201d he says, referring to a section of West Germany through which NATO planners expected the Soviets to push large mechanized formations. \u201cWe were outmanned. I thought we were outgunned.\u201d But the Soviets never came, and for the next 20 years Zwack worked in the Balkans, then Afghanistan and South Korea, before finally returning to Russia in 2012 as defense attach\u00e9 to the American Embassy.With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States had to staff 14 new embassies in the post-Soviet republics. Many of the Foreign Service officers who emerged from these postings did so with a somewhat jaundiced view of Russia. \u201cWhen you start looking at the Russians by the people who have been visited by the Russians,\u201d says Fried, who spent a fair amount of time in Poland during his long career in the Foreign Service, \u201cyou tend to see it a different way.\u201dFinally, there is the younger generation, those 40 and under. These Russia hands are for the moment a rarer species. \u201cIf you were an ambitious young Foreign Service officer after 9/11, you wanted to get sent to some reconstruction team in Afghanistan or Iraq,\u201d says Andrew Weiss, who worked on Russia at the National Security Council during the Clinton administration and now runs the Russia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cYou wanted to learn Arabic. If you were ambitious, you did not want to go to the embassy in Ukraine.\u201dAs in other foreign-policy sectors, the Russia hands divide less along party lines than along foreign-policy philosophies: They are either \u201crealists\u201d or \u201cinternationalists.\u201d Realists tend to be cautious about American overseas commitments and deferential toward state sovereignty; internationalists tend to be more inclined to universalist ideals like democracy and human rights, even where these are forced to cross borders. But the two supposed categories are blurred by a thousand factors, not least of which being that realists don\u2019t like being called realists, because it suggests that they have no values, and internationalists don\u2019t like to be called internationalists, as opposed to realists, because it suggests that they have no common sense. In the end, a vast internationalist middle, consisting of neoconservative Republicans and interventionist Democrats, predominates, with tiny slices of hard realists on the right and soft realists, or \u201cneorealists,\u201d on the left. And there are many shades of difference among all these people.The longtime Russia hand Stephen Sestanovich, a veteran of the Reagan and Clinton administrations, says there are two kinds of Russia hands \u2014 those who came to Russia through political science and those who came to it through literature. The literature hands, he suggests, sometimes let their emotions get the best of them, while the political-science hands, like Sestanovich, are more cool and collected. Fried, who served in every administration from Carter to Obama, also thinks there are two kinds of Russia hands, though he draws a different dividing line: There are those, like himself, who \u201cput Russia in context, held up against the light of outside standards and consequences.\u201d These people tend to be tough on Russia. And then there are those \u201cwho take Russia on its own terms, attractive and wonderful but subject to romanticization.\u201d These people tend to give Russia what Fried would consider a pass.Then there are those, like Michael Kofman, a young Kiev-born military analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses in Arlington, Va., who say that there only appear to be two kinds of Russia hands. \u201cThere are the nice missionaries who knock on your door and say, \u2018Hey, have you heard the good news about democracy, freedom and liberalism?\u2019 And then there are the crusaders who are trying to claim the heathen Eastern European lands for democracy and freedom. But they\u2019re basically the same person; they\u2019re two sides of the same coin.\u201dThere are two kinds of Russia hands, or maybe there are six kinds of Russia hands, or maybe there is an infinite variety of Russia hands. And yet the mystery is this: After all the many different Russia hands who have served in the United States government, the country\u2019s relations with Russia are as they have always been \u2014 bad.The first high-level Russia hand of the post-Cold War era was a man named Nelson Strobridge Talbott III, or Strobe for short. The scion of a prosperous Ohio family (his grandfather, the first Nelson Strobridge Talbott, was captain of the Yale football team in 1914), Talbott followed his forefathers to Yale, where he studied Russian literature and won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford. There he found himself rooming with a wonky, gregarious Georgetown graduate named Bill Clinton. Talbott remained interested in Russia, writing his master\u2019s thesis on Mayakovsky, translating Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s memoirs and then becoming a foreign correspondent \u2014 and eventually a columnist \u2014 for Time magazine. He was the first journalist to track down and interview Joseph Brodsky upon his exile to the West in 1972. \u201cLooks like we lucked out,\u201d Brodsky wrote in his diary. \u201cHe\u2019s read me.\u201d Talbott\u2019s fundamental view of the U.S.S.R. was that it could be reasoned with; in the pages of Time, he regularly praised the virtues of arms control and d\u00e9tente, and was despised for it by more ardent Cold Warriors. When Clinton was elected president, Talbott came on to advise his old roommate on what Clinton believed to be his most pressing foreign-policy concern: the transformation of Russia into a viable, American-friendly democracy on the eastern edge of Europe.Things did not turn out that way, and most of the reasons were internal to Russia. But the United States was not without its share of blame. The economic advice dispensed by the gurus of what was known as the Washington Consensus weakened an already vulnerable Russian state. Average Russian citizens saw their living standards and life expectancies drop. It was Talbott who offered one of the pithier critiques of the doctrine known as \u201cshock therapy\u201d: What the Russian people wanted, Talbott said, \u201cwas less shock and more therapy.\u201d The remark led to one of the stormiest passages of his political career.But he weathered it. During his tenure, the United States made one of the most momentous foreign-policy choices of the post-1991 era: the decision to expand NATO eastward, first into the former countries of the Warsaw Pact, then into the former republics of the Soviet Union itself. Talbott at first was opposed, or at least, as he now puts it, \u201cdeeply riven.\u201d On one hand, the Eastern European countries, some of which were now led by heroic former dissidents, wanted very much to join the military alliance; on the other, the Russians warned Talbott \u2014 \u201cwith a mirthless smile,\u201d as he later recalled \u2014 that NATO was to them a \u201cfour-letter word.\u201d If the Cold War was really over, as the Americans kept saying it was, why expand a Cold War military alliance set up expressly to deter and contain the Soviet Union? But as much as Talbott loved Russia, there were clear advantages to securing the West\u2019s gains. \u201cIf the leadership of a country has any view but the following,\u201d Talbott told me last summer, \u201cit\u2019s not going to be the leadership of that county for very long. And that is: We do what we can in our own interest.\u201d But the NATO question, Talbott admitted, was complicated. \u201cShould we have had a higher, wiser concept of our real interests that would require us to hold back on what many people would say is our own current interest?\u201dAt the time the debate was taking place \u2014 1993 and 1994 \u2014 much of the State Department and the Pentagon took the anti-expansion view, arguing that it would needlessly antagonize Russia at a difficult moment in its post-Communist journey and that the alliance was unwieldy enough without incorporating three fledgling Eastern European democracies (not to mention, eventually, Romania). But there were some who disagreed. A small working group at RAND produced a report arguing for NATO expansion as key to the future of Eastern Europe. \u201cWe talked to the Poles, and they said: \u2018If you don\u2019t let us into NATO, we\u2019re getting nuclear weapons. We don\u2019t trust the Russians,\u2019\u2009\u201d one of the report\u2019s authors, a former Air Force officer and Pentagon strategist named Richard L. Kugler, told me. \u201cThen we talked to the Germans. They said: \u2018The line of contact with the Russians now runs through Warsaw. If you don\u2019t defend it, we will.\u2019 We had a vision of a nuclear-armed Poland being fortified by German troops facing off with the Russians \u2014 I don\u2019t think anyone wanted that!\u201d The report was laughed at and rejected in some quarters \u2014 a State Department official supposedly threw it in the trash in front of one of its authors \u2014 but Fried, then at the National Security Council, started using it to lobby inside the administration for a more robust approach to expansion. Talbott initially resisted, but he and Clinton soon came around.The decision on NATO was essentially made by early 1994, but it would take some years before the first countries joined the alliance, and in the meantime, relations between Russia and the United States steadily declined: Russia was angered by the NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb positions in 1995, by the American insistence that the Russians stop the sale of nuclear technology to Iran and especially by the 1999 NATO bombing \u2014 just a few weeks after the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland finally joined the alliance \u2014 of Belgrade. That conflict almost expanded when a small contingent of Russian troops seized the Pristina airport in Kosovo. If a British officer named James Blunt had not refused to act on an order from Gen. Wesley Clark to clear the airport, things might have turned out a lot worse. Blunt went on to fame as a rock musician with the hit song \u201cYou\u2019re Beautiful,\u201d but the Russia-United States relationship remained precarious.The damage, in any case, was done. \u201cWe were so excited about the spread of democracy and the collapse of Communism,\u201d says Olga Oliker, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThere were all these countries saying, \u2018Yes, please, take us into NATO with weapons that you\u2019ll give us to defend ourselves from the Russians, who are going to be coming like they always do.\u2019 And we said, \u2018Well, the Russians aren\u2019t coming, but yes, please, join us in democracy.\u2019\u201cBut the Russians took it as a sign that we were still against them. It was really hard to walk back from. From there on out, we were doing things that we kept saying, \u2018We\u2019re not doing this to hurt you,\u2019 and that the Russians felt hurt them. We didn\u2019t do it because we wanted to hurt them. We did it because we didn\u2019t care if it hurt them.\u201dFactors external to Russia played a role here: The Sept. 11 attacks refocused American foreign policy around counterterrorism. \u201cWe had a long period of inattention because of the war on terror,\u201d Weiss says. \u201cIt was a long period where anyone who banged his fist on the table and said: \u2018Mr. President! Mr. President! Drop everything you\u2019re doing killing bin Laden\u2019s inner circle! We need to talk to you because Vladimir Putin is mad about blah blah blah!\u2019 You can imagine how that did not rate.\u201dBut it wasn\u2019t just the fight against terrorism. The Soviet Union\u2019s collapse and Russia\u2019s subsequent weakness reconfigured the entire process of American decision-making. When I asked Graham about the decline in relations on his watch, he delivered a soliloquy about bureaucracy.\u201cThe way the N.S.C. is structured,\u201d he began, \u201cthe way the State Department is structured, is through a series of regional and functional bureaus. The question is always, Who takes the lead?\u201d In Soviet times, when the entire foreign policy of the United States was oriented around countering the Soviet threat, the Russia hands frequently took the lead. In the post-Soviet era, with an increasingly irrelevant Russia, the reverse was true. \u201cRussia was unique in that it\u2019s a country that was a factor in almost all the major things the U.S. government did, but it wasn\u2019t in any place the most important factor. So you\u2019re working on missile defense: Russia is clearly an important player in missile defense. But that process is not led by the person who\u2019s responsible for Russia policy; it\u2019s led by the person who\u2019s responsible for nonproliferation policy. If you come to energy, Russia is obviously an important player in global energy markets, but Russia is not the most important player in global energy markets. That\u2019s the Saudis and OPEC. So when you come to an energy issue, the people who are in charge of energy run that.\u201dThe same was true of the states of the former Soviet Union, which were now independent and the province of different regional desks at the State Department and the N.S.C. The most damaging episode in United States-Russia relations during Graham\u2019s time at the N.S.C. was American cheerleading for the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in late 2004 and early 2005. Graham argued that the Russians saw the \u201ccolor revolutions,\u201d as the Rose and Orange Revolutions were known, as an outgrowth of American policy and feared that regime change would be coming to Russia next. But freedom was on the march, Graham was told: \u201c\u2009\u2018All we\u2019re doing is promoting democracy.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re the Russia expert,\u201d I said.\u201cBut Ukraine is not a Russia issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a Ukrainian issue. There\u2019s a bureau for European affairs that overseas Ukrainian issues.\u201dDuring the Orange Revolution, the Europe desk at the N.S.C. was run by Fried.\u201cMy main contribution,\u201d Graham summed up, \u201cwas preventing things from being worse than they could have been.\u201dGraham left government in 2007. Fried, his sometime nemesis, had become assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia and continued to push vocal American support of Western-leaning governments in former Soviet states, Georgia in particular. Nuland was the American ambassador to NATO. In April 2008, at a NATO summit meeting in Bucharest, the alliance announced over strong Russian objections that it intended to eventually admit Georgia and Ukraine. Four months later, deteriorating security conditions in South Ossetia, Georgia, provoked an emboldened Saakashvili into an attack on the breakaway region. Russian forces intervened, crushing the Georgian Army in less than a week.The next president, Barack Obama, was the rare American politician with a sense of the fallibility of American power. He opposed the Iraq war and spoke honestly about the crimes of the American empire. Yet he was also divided in his mind. A realist in most of his foreign-policy leanings, Obama chose as his chief Russia hand a Stanford political-science professor named Michael McFaul.McFaul had spent years visiting Russia and writing about it. He was a Russophile, an advocate of more cooperative relations and a critic of the Bush administration\u2019s unilateralism: in all this, a good fit for Obama. But he was also an avid internationalist and democracy promoter, who had speculated in a widely circulated 2005 essay on the seven \u201cfactors for success\u201d required for color revolution \u2014 the implication being that more such revolutions were necessary and desirable. In 2008, McFaul proposed a \u201creset\u201d in relations between the two countries. This became the administration\u2019s policy, and for a while it worked. A new arms-control agreement was negotiated. Dmitri Medvedev, who succeeded Putin as president in early 2008, toured Silicon Valley. Russia joined the World Trade Organization. And a sprawling supply chain, called the Northern Distribution Network, was established to move supplies through Russia to NATO troops in Afghanistan. The existence of an alternate route gave the United States some leeway in its dealings with Pakistan. When Pakistan cut off the supply route in Afghanistan not long after the assassination of Osama bin Laden, NATO simply sent more through Russia.But relations with Russia soon soured. The more liberal Medvedev years created an expectation on the part of some Russians that the country would open up; when Medvedev announced in 2011 that he was stepping aside, that Putin would be returning to the presidency and that this is what they had planned all along, there was a feeling of grievous disappointment. Three months later, spurred by a number of blatant falsifications in the national Duma elections, this disappointment erupted into the largest protests of the post-Soviet period. Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, voiced approval for the protests and expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the voting irregularities. Her comments fed the Kremlin\u2019s fears that the United States was somehow behind the demonstrations. McFaul, who arrived as ambassador to Russia in the midst of the protest wave, inflamed the situation further by taking a meeting with opposition leaders. He was never forgiven by the Russian authorities, who proceeded to harass him and his family and denounce him whenever possible as a foreign spy.From there, the relationship grew increasingly strained. In the words of Paul Stronski, a Russia hand who joined the N.S.C. in 2012: \u201cI was brought in to do reset, Part 2. Instead, I got Magnitsky, Snowden and Ukraine.\u201d Magnitsky was the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on individuals engaged in human rights violations and corruption and was inspired by the death in prison of a Russian tax attorney, Sergei Magnitsky, who was arrested after uncovering a huge corruption scheme. Snowden was Edward Snowden, who turned up in Moscow after orchestrating perhaps the most significant leak of American government documents since the Pentagon Papers. And Ukraine was, of course, Ukraine.Ukraine was a catastrophe two decades in the making. Its government was as corrupt and ineffectual as any in the post-Soviet space; it produced neither oil nor gas to serve as a financial cushion, and it was divided between a Russian-leaning east and a Europe-leaning west. To make matters worse, it was also the host, at Sevastopol, of the Russian Black Sea fleet, whose long-term lease, during times of tension, tended to become a political football.In the summer of 2013, with the shock of Snowden\u2019s turning up in Moscow still fresh, Russian officials started making noise about an \u201cassociation agreement\u201d that Ukraine was about to sign with the European Union. To the Russians, the proposed agreement was a rejection of their own cherished customs\u2019 union, the Eurasian Economic Union, as well as a concrete step toward European integration for a country with which it had profound, centuries-old connections. And European integration, the Russians believed, would eventually mean NATO membership: hostile troops on the Russian border and an end to the lease for the Russian fleet.McFaul, still in Moscow, was one of the people to whom the Russians took these complaints. By his own account, he was dismissive of their concerns. First of all, he said, it wasn\u2019t Russia\u2019s business what Ukraine signed or didn\u2019t sign. And second, he didn\u2019t think the Russians should get all worked up. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about an association agreement,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s expansion of the E.U. maybe in the year 2040, 2050? Ask the Turks about their association agreement.\u201d (Turkey signed a similar agreement with the E.U. in 1963 and still has not become a member.) It was just a piece of paper. But the Russians didn\u2019t seem to think so. And neither, it would turn out, did the Ukrainians. When Viktor Yanukovych, the president of Ukraine, under intense Russian pressure, pulled out of the accord with the Europeans, people took to the streets.The daughter of Sherwin Nuland, the surgeon and Yale bioethicist, she fell in love with Russian culture after seeing a performance of Chekhov\u2019s \u201cThree Sisters\u201d when she was 12; she studied Russian history and politics at Brown, worked at a Soviet children\u2019s camp and after that for an embassy family in Moscow. Then, eager for adventure and contact with real-live Russians, she did her tour on the Soviet fishing vessel (for seven months, not one). That experience taught her something about the planned economy: After 25 days of drinking and card-playing, the crew did five days of hard work to meet their monthly targets. She also says she learned \u201chow to drink 10 shots of vodka and still get back to my cabin and put a chair under the doorknob. Things could get a little hairy when the boys were drunk.\u201dShe entered the Foreign Service in 1984. Over a long and eventful career, she witnessed the defense of the Russian White House during the attempted hard-line coup against Mikhail Gorbachev; served as Talbott\u2019s chief of staff during the chaotic \u201990s; worked as Dick Cheney\u2019s deputy national security adviser in the years after Sept. 11 but \u201cbefore Cheney became Cheney,\u201d as she put it; and served as the State Department spokeswoman under Hillary Clinton. She was known inside successive administrations as a Russia hawk, but when asked if she hated the country, she drew a distinction between \u201cRussian culture and the Russian people,\u201d which she loves, and the Soviet strain she sees in Putin\u2019s Russia, which she does not. \u201cI deplore the way successive governments in Moscow \u2014 Soviet and Russian \u2014 have abused their own people, ripped them off, constrained their choices and made us the enemy to mask their own failings,\u201d Nuland says. Hearing her speak with such conviction about governments that, in at least one case, no longer existed, you could understand how she had been over the years a very effective advocate inside several American administrations for her point of view.In December 2013, with the protests in the center of Kiev just a few weeks old, Nuland traveled to Moscow and then to Kiev to try to defuse the crisis that had engulfed the Yanukovych government. She made little progress with the Kremlin, which was of the opinion that Yanukovych should simply clear the protesters from the streets. On her first night in Kiev, she was woken by members of her staff. The riot police brought out to contain the protests had formed a ring around them and were closing in. The demonstrators were desperately singing patriotic songs to keep up their spirits, but they were in mortal danger. Nuland got on the phone with Washington and worked to release a statement in Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s name, expressing \u201cdisgust\u201d at the move on peaceful protesters. \u201cAfter that,\u201d Nuland says, \u201cthe singing grew louder\u201d; the demonstrators on the square, she told me, were holding their phones in the air, \u201cdisplaying the Kerry statement in Ukrainian and Russian.\u201d The riot troops backed off.The next morning, Nuland was to meet with Yanukovych. But first she wanted to visit the protest encampment, which, two weeks into its existence, had grown in both scope and moral authority. \u201cIn accordance with Slavic tradition, I wanted to bring something,\u201d Nuland says. She took a large plastic bag filled with treats. Alongside Pyatt, she handed them out to the protesters, and thus was born one of the iconic images of the Ukraine crisis, immediately and widely circulated by the Kremlin\u2019s media apparatuses \u2014 a powerful official, not a famous politician like Senator John McCain or Secretary of State John Kerry but a representative of the supposedly more neutral American policymaking bureaucracy, succoring revolutionaries in the center of Kiev. (Nuland points out that they also gave food to the riot police.) Two months later, as the Yanukovych government entered its terminal phase, Nuland\u2019s \u201c[Expletive] the E.U.\u201d comment leaked out. For many Russians and Europeans, the line became emblematic of American arrogance.A few weeks later, Yanukovych fled the country, and Russian troops annexed Crimea. In tandem with Fried, who had taken the newly established position of sanctions coordinator at the State Department, Nuland began drafting harsh sanctions against Putin\u2019s inner circle, individuals involved in the invasion of Ukraine and eventually large Russian companies and banks. Fried told me that one senior State Department official thought this was pretty funny. He said to Fried, \u201cDo the Russians realize that the two hardest-line people in the entire U.S. government are now in a position to go after them?\u201dThe Russians may have realized this perfectly well. According to American intelligence agencies, two years after the sanctions went into effect, the Russians started feeding emails stolen from the servers of the Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks and helping with their distribution.Kimmage nonetheless found the experience enlightening, and he came away with the feeling that a lot of what the American government did had deep and sometimes invisible ideological sources. The apparent final triumph of liberal democracy in Europe in 1989 produced two powerful strains in American internationalist foreign-policy thinking, according to Kimmage \u2014 one radical, the other moderate. The radical strain, associated with the neocons, called for a universal democratization, by force if need be. This strain was (mostly) discredited in Iraq. But the other strain, which aimed to spread American-style democracy as far east as possible into Eurasia, has never been discredited. It is close to being the conventional wisdom in Washington, and it is carried forth, Kimmage suggests, by a certain sort of young person, typically a graduate of Yale or Georgetown, \u201cwho believes \u2014 perhaps by definition \u2014 in the virtues of American power.\u201dAnd yet there is, within the Russia-hand community, a small countervailing tendency. This new generation of Russia hands is deeply skeptical of the missionary impulse that has characterized American policy toward Russia for so long. Oliker is one, Kimmage another. There is also the military analyst Michael Kofman, at the Center for Naval Analyses, and Samuel Charap, at RAND, whose recent book on the events leading to the war in Ukraine, \u201cEveryone Loses,\u201d written with the Harvard political scientist Timothy Colton, lays out week by week the way in which American, European and Russian policy in 2012 and 2013 pushed Ukraine into a zero-sum choice, leading eventually to the collapse of the government and the dismemberment of the country. And there are others, some who prefer not to be named.Despite some differences in politics, all are seeking a less chauvinistic approach to Russia policy. They are disgusted by American failures and want them to end. \u201cI find the past 17 years of continuous warfare to be abnormal and abhorrent,\u201d one of them wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s a real reflection on our policy community that they have placed their nation in this position.\u201d In the harsh climate of Washington opinion, where an errant editorial could come back in the form of an angry senator reading it aloud at your confirmation hearing, they do what they can to push back. As a group, they have opposed sending weapons to Ukraine as an unnecessary escalation of the proxy war there \u2014 \u201cWe just lost a proxy war in Syria!\u201d Kofman cried. \u201cWhy do we expect to do better in Ukraine?\u201d \u2014 and are concerned about the current hype over a potential Russian incursion into the Baltics. Kofman compared American worries about a Russian invasion of the Baltics to equally far-fetched Russian worries about an American move into Belarus. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never heard anyone in Washington say: \u2018Wow, Belarus. That\u2019s real prime real estate. We should get that.\u2019 By the same token, the Russians are amazed that we think they want to take the Baltics. They just find it incredible. They\u2019re going to go into the Baltics \u2014 which they have no use for \u2014 and take on the world\u2019s pre-eminent military alliance? It\u2019s crazy.\u201dKofman believes that some form of conventional deterrence on NATO\u2019s eastern flank is useful, but he worries that it can turn into what international relations theorists call a \u201csecurity dilemma,\u201d wherein the actions you take to increase your security cause your adversary to feel threatened, so that it takes steps to increase its security, forcing you in turn to take further steps to increase yours, and so on, until war. \u201cYou have to be very careful where you put forces,\u201d Kofman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t start stacking units 20 minutes from St. Petersburg. Keep in mind Russia is the world\u2019s pre-eminent Eurasian land power. They can put more ground forces in Russia, because that\u2019s where they happen to live, than you can put in the Baltics, because that\u2019s not where you live. That\u2019s not a tough competition.\u201dThese young Russia hands find the current political and news attention to Russia deeply frustrating, even as its sources are no mystery to them.\u201cI\u2019m a Democrat,\u201d said one Russia hand who spoke on the condition of anonymity so that he could comment openly. \u201cAnd Russia contributed to the defeat of Secretary Clinton and, frankly, to our current national tragedy. It\u2019s hard for me not to think about that.\u201cBut the Democrats see this as a political opening. And the conversation has moved into politics. They don\u2019t want to know what\u2019s actually happening or what we should actually do. They want to beat Trump with this Russia thing.\u201dOliker, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, makes a similar point: \u201cIt used to be you could explain things to people at great length and with nuance, and they would say: \u2018Oh, how interesting. You\u2019ve explained it so well, and now I understand better where the Russians are coming from.\u2019 Of course,\u201d she added, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t do any of it, because Russia was secondary or tertiary, and no one cared about Russia.\u201cNow everyone cares about Russia, and there\u2019s no nuance.\u201dCharap, at RAND, says that the postelection political climate has made it impossible to work with Russia even on issues that would benefit both sides. \u201cWhen the U.S. and Russia work together, they can accomplish things no two other countries can. The only reason we were able to kill bin Laden is that the Northern Distribution Network was set up! McFaul did that. And he had to deal with a lot of people saying: \u2018Why are we talking to these people? They\u2019re never going to stick to their agreements.\u2019\u201cEven I was told once: \u2018We don\u2019t want to be chasing Russia.\u2019 What is this, dating?\u201dThe difference between these Russia hands and most others is less their analysis of Russia than their analysis of America. According to Oliker, what the United States should be focusing on is \u201cmanaging hegemonic decline.\u201d America\u2019s vast overseas commitments need to be scaled down bit by bit, in a slow and responsible process. The amount of money spent on the United States military should be brought in line with historical norms and recalibrated to the country\u2019s actual defense needs. Diplomacy (cheap, effective), rather than military might (expensive, deadly, counterproductive), needs to become America\u2019s primary means of interacting with the world. So far, Oliker points out, the Trump administration is largely doing the opposite.As for Russia, it\u2019s a threat that needs to be handled, not exaggerated. \u201cWe have to talk to them,\u201d Oliker says. \u201cIf we don\u2019t talk to them, things are going to get a lot worse. Yes, they hacked our election. Did they invade Ukraine? Yup, they did that. But we talk to countries that do bad things all the time. We have to talk to them, and as we\u2019re talking to them, we have to understand that they don\u2019t think they\u2019re evil. I was testifying on the Hill not long ago, and I was saying, \u2018The Russians think they\u2019re acting defensively.\u2019 And the senators were like, \u2018But we\u2019ve explained to them over and over that we\u2019re not a threat.\u2019 Like, are you serious?\u201dZwack, the retired brigadier general who once waited for the Soviets to break through the Fulda Gap and now teaches at the National Defense University, agrees. \u201cShort of a shooting war, you have to find bridges,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people say, \u2018It\u2019s not business as usual with the Russians.\u2019 But it\u2019s never business as usual with the Russians! They\u2019re the one nation on the planet that, on a bad day \u2014 they\u2019ll go away, too \u2014 but they can take us off that planet.\u201cThe crisis might not happen in the Baltics or over Syria. It could happen in the Sea of Okhotsk. You\u2019ve got all kinds of Russian military stuff out there; we\u2019ve got military stuff; the Japanese have stuff. It takes one incident \u2014 an accident that, to someone threat-inclined, looks like a deliberate action. If those commanders can\u2019t get on the phone or on email to say, \u2018This is what it is,\u2019 if the crisis has to now be resolved in Washington or Moscow, it may be too late.\u201dCharap, at RAND, puts it most succinctly: \u201cThe threshold for bad stuff happening in the Russia-U.S. relationship is pretty high. Like, nuclear Armageddon. That\u2019s low probability,\u201d he says. \u201cBut high impact.\u201dFor the past year, the administration\u2019s top Russia hand has been a British-born, Harvard-educated historian and policy analyst named Fiona Hill. A longtime fellow at the Brookings Institution, of which Strobe Talbott became president after the end of the Clinton administration, Hill is the author of \u201cMr. Putin,\u201d a probing and not entirely unsympathetic biography of the Russian president. In that book, Hill and her co-author, Clifford Gaddy, advocate what another historian has called \u201cstrategic empathy,\u201d trying to see the situation from the perspective of your adversary \u2014 in this case, Putin. This is the sort of move that more hawkish Russia hands like Fried have long counseled against. But it is unclear how much influence Hill has had on current policy. One report in The Washington Post indicated that the president at one point mistook her for administrative staff and yelled at her; another report in the same paper described her as heading up the recent American expulsion of Russian diplomatic personnel in response to the nerve-agent poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England.There isn\u2019t, in any case, much room to maneuver. Fried reached retirement age and left the State Department a few weeks into the Trump administration; Nuland, not yet of retirement age, stepped down the day before Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cTo show up for work on Inauguration Day and have to do a 180 on U.S. policy toward NATO, Russia, Germany, Brexit \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said. But their legacy lives on. Over the summer, and partly in response to the investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with Russia, Congress voted overwhelmingly to strip the president of his authority to release Russia from Fried\u2019s and Nuland\u2019s sanctions. Only Congress can now end the sanctions. In the words of one Russia hand, the congressional bill makes the United States-Russia confrontation \u201cstructural.\u201d \u201cThe president is like a captain holding a wheel that isn\u2019t attached to anything,\u201d said the Russia hand.In early March, I met to talk about Russia policy with a senior official in the current administration, who was not authorized to speak to the press and thus asked not to be identified. Nastya Rybka, the Instagramming Belarusian escort, had just been arrested in Thailand, but to my chagrin the official hadn\u2019t even heard of her; instead, the official was focused on a speech Putin had just delivered in which he announced that Russia had supermissiles that could elude American defenses. \u201cHe is putting us on notice that we are not listening to him,\u201d the official said of Putin and cautioned that we were at an inflection point in American relations with Russia. \u201cWe can\u2019t just have half-cocked sanctions legislation. We can\u2019t go around sanctioning everybody without thinking through the implications.\u201cWe\u2019re in a period where the Russians\u2019 threat perception is causing them to think that they need to take pre-emptive, preventive, very aggressive action to get us to back off, or to make us incapable of having a concerted effort to be able to push back,\u201d the official went on. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t get our act together and try to tackle that, we\u2019re not going to be able to change the trajectory of our relationship.\u201d The word \u201ctrajectory\u201d had a particularly resonant ring in the wake of Putin\u2019s missile video.Our time was over, and I walked back out onto the streets of the capital. A strong nor\u2019easter had knocked out power and grounded flights all along the Eastern Seaboard. Schools, many businesses and parts of the federal government were shut down; the capital looked deserted. I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of my meeting with the administration official. That the official was deeply knowledgeable and highly competent was without any doubt. But it was hard not to feel that in terms of the United States-Russia relationship, it was too little, too late. The official stressed to me that the decision to join the administration came out of wanting to head off a crisis: \u201cWhen your house is on fire, you go put it out.\u201d But this was now a fire that was going to burn for a very long time. In the Russia-hands community, some who had once been doves had become hawks, and those who had been hawks all along felt vindicated. The small contingent of dissidents was keeping a low profile. I asked one of them if he felt lonely. \u201cI do feel lonely,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am not alone. It\u2019s just that we have to speak more quietly.\u201dOne of the first Russia hands trained by the United States government back in the 1920s was George Kennan. The government paid for his Russian lessons in Berlin, then posted him to Riga, the capital of newly independent Latvia, where he mixed with Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s and studied economic reports from the Soviet Union. When diplomatic relations were finally established between the United States and the U.S.S.R. in the 1930s, he helped set up the embassy in Moscow, and in the postwar era he was among the first to articulate clearly the nature of the Soviet threat. But he was also concerned that his home country not freak out. \u201cMuch depends,\u201d he cautioned in his famous \u201clong telegram\u201d from 1946, \u201con health and vigor of our own society.\u201dThat society now looks sick. The absence of nuance on the Russia question \u2014 the embrace of Russia as America\u2019s new-old supervillain \u2014 is probably best understood as a symptom of that sickness. And even as both parties gnash their teeth over Russia, politicians and experts alike seem to be in denial about mistakes made in the past and the lessons to be learned from them. Many foreign-policy hands are eager to return to the Obama-era status quo, as if American foreign policy since the end of the Cold War had, until the evening of Nov. 8, 2016, been doing just fine. \u201cI would give anything to have that world back,\u201d said a Russia hand who has been critical of the old interventionist paradigm. But chances are, that world will come back soon enough. Wasn\u2019t the idea, in the end, to change it?/\u2022/Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Retirement: Near the Kids", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosThirty-five years ago, Holly Bowers Ruben moved from California to New York, following an actor boyfriend to Brooklyn. The relationship didn\u2019t last, but Ms. Ruben never moved back, although her mother, Marie-Louise Bowers, stayed out west.That arrangement worked \u2014 mostly. \u201cI did talk to my mom on a daily basis. That\u2019s kind of the relationship we had, even when she was in California,\u201d Ms. Ruben said.\u201cJust in case she fell, I know that there\u2019s something here, versus \u2018how am I going to help her when she\u2019s in Walnut Creek, Calif., and I\u2019m in Brooklyn?\u2019 Peace of mind \u2014 that has been a huge gift,\u201d Ms. Ruben said. And coincidentally, soon after Ms. Bowers moved east, Ms. Ruben had to undergo a battery of tests for what turned out to be a noncancerous brain mass, and she was comforted by having her mother nearby.Ms. Ruben and her mother are an example of a phenomenon that is driving an increase in the construction of senior housing across the United States. More assisted living, independent living and continuing care retirement communities are being built \u2014 not necessarily in the warmer climates where seniors have traditionally retired, like Florida and Arizona, but wherever economies are robust and booming, in places like New York, Denver, Chicago and Atlanta.It is not uncommon for today\u2019s seniors to live well into their 80s, 90s, even past 100. And when they can no longer be entirely independent, many are moving to be near their adult children for help in the last stage of their lives.Senior living communities, where people of similar ages and abilities live together, can help combat that isolation, as can moving closer to adult children, who can then more easily help take care of their parent\u2019s needs.As Ms. Ryerson pointed out, \u201cWe need meaningful connections.\u201d When senior parents move closer to their adult children, those connections are often more frequent, and more personal.But when their daughter, who lives in New Jersey, was widowed five years ago, they found that driving back and forth to help her with her three children was not ideal. In an uncannily prescient move, Mr. Smith, now 85, had put down a refundable deposit at Cedar Crest more than a decade ago, just in case they ever wanted to move there.Living in one of these communities, of course, is not cheap. The Smiths paid an entrance fee of about $500,000, and their monthly rent is $4,500, which is not unusual, according to the AARP. The organization estimates that entrance fees typically range from $100,000 to $1 million, and monthly rents can be anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000.For the Smiths, however, it was worth it. Ms. Smith, 75, was resistant at first about giving up their home, but did a \u201ctotal 180,\u201d she said, soon after moving in, not just because they were closer to their daughter and grandchildren, but because it had improved their quality of life.She has returned to painting watercolors and is on the resident advisory council, and her husband sings in the chorale.\u201cSo many people told us come earlier than waiting and it\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have a little more energy\u201d to take advantage of what such a community offers.There seems to be plenty of money behind the construction of these centers, in part because the recession did not have the same effect on senior housing that it did on the rest of the housing market.Watermark, which is based in Tucson, has 52 locations and is currently building or renovating an additional 10 senior housing centers, including one in a former Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses dorm in Brooklyn Heights.\u201cDuring the recession, because it performed so well, a lot of the bigger more institutional investors took notice and said, \u2018Let\u2019s invest some capital into the market,\u2019\u201d Mr. Freshwater said.Investors don\u2019t expect senior housing to react to the future whims of the housing market either, although occupancy rates dipped slightly, to 88.3 percent, in the first quarter of this year, from 89.2 percent in the first quarter of 2016.Investment in senior living is seen as a \u201cportfolio diversifier,\u201d Ms. Mace said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily respond to the same business cycles as other types of real estate. It tends to be more of a need-based property type.\u201d\u201cHome prices are up. A lot of people didn\u2019t want to sell during the recession, so they stayed in their homes a lot longer than they may have wanted to. But now that home prices are higher again, they can sell them,\u201d said John Chang, first vice president of research services for Marcus & Millichap. \u201cThey have equity built up that they can use for their next stage of life.\u201dThe new tax law, which doubled the standard deduction for most taxpayers, but reduced the amount of mortgage interest that homeowners can deduct, may add another incentive for older homeowners to sell.\u201cThe tax advantages of owning a home are maybe going away for some people,\u201d Mr. Chang said. \u201cAnd at the same time, the values are elevated. So seniors who had been aging in place now have more incentive to make a lifestyle change.\u201dThe company looks to two types of areas when deciding where to build new facilities, he said. The first is \u201cinfill markets\u201d \u2014 places that are already densely populated, like Northern New Jersey \u2014 for seniors who either want to stay in the area where they have lived or move closer to adult children.The second is what Mr. Kane calls \u201cgrowth corridor markets,\u201d where the company sees population moving even if \u201cthere\u2019s really not a plethora of aging demographics in the local area, but it\u2019s a growth market where you have a lot of adult children moving to and living there.\u201dThe facility was successful in attracting seniors from the inner Washington suburbs, he said, \u201ceither because they have family there or are looking for newer product and more value.\u201d Erickson is currently going through the zoning process to build a similar facility in Fairfax, Va., for the same reason.No matter what the economy does, Ms. Mace said, senior housing is going to be needed in the future, especially as the baby boomer generation ages. According to the Census Bureau, the percentage of the American population 65 and older will increase by 6 percent \u2014 up to 75.5 million people \u2014 by 2030.Ms. Mace predicted that the kinds of facilities that currently exist will continue to be in demand. But there may be other kinds of housing as well, including cogenerational and even \u201cGolden Girls\u201d-type setups, where single older adults can choose to live together.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the values of living in senior housing: socialization, hospitality, better nutrition, better exercise,\u201d Ms. Mace said. And when it is the baby boomers\u2019 turn, she added, they will already be familiar with the model \u2014 and ready to move in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Teacher Walkout Movement Won\u2019t Reach Every State", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 The nationwide teacher protest movement spread to a sixth state on Wednesday as thousands in North Carolina rallied at the Capitol for higher pay and more money for schools. It was the first mass walkout for teachers in the state.In the months since the movement began, teachers have walked out in deep-red states and purple states; in states with booming economies and ones that are struggling; in states where school funding scrapes the bottom, and others where the numbers are closer to the national average.Despite the diversity and seemingly endless energy, the movement has limits. Most states have schools that are funded more or less equally from state and local coffers, with voters making many financial decisions close to home. But North Carolina shares something with other walkout states: Its state government plays an unusually strong role in funding education and setting its priorities, often superseding the influence of school districts.This strong-state model can include a larger-than-typical role for state governments in funding schools, a state-mandated salary schedule for teachers or efforts to equalize funding between poor and rich school districts.Because of such policies, the states are, in a way, ripe for large-scale labor actions, despite having weak public sector unions. Unlike some Northeast states where teachers in one town can earn $20,000 more than those in a nearby city, low-income and middle-class districts in the states that have had walkouts have similar teacher salary and school funding challenges, building solidarity \u2014 and political leverage \u2014 across hundreds of miles.Teacher salaries across the United States have failed to keep pace with inflation since 2009, falling by an average of 4 percent, according to data from the National Education Association, the national teachers\u2019 union. The drop is steeper in the six walkout states \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia.After Republicans took control of state government in 2013, North Carolina ended the estate tax and lowered corporate taxes as well as some personal income taxes.The actions, plus the recession, meant schools took a hit. Since 2009, the budgets for supplies, textbooks and school technology have been slashed by about half, according to the Public School Forum of North Carolina, a nonpartisan research group. And a greater share of teacher compensation has been dedicated toward pensions and health care costs.Symone Kiddoo, 27, is a school social worker in Durham. On Tuesday, she packed and distributed hundreds of donated meals to students at Southwest Elementary School and Forest View Elementary School. Ms. Kiddoo is the sole social worker for both schools, where over half of the 1,400 students come from low-income families. The food was for students to eat when school was closed for the walkout.Ms. Kiddoo spends her days responding to behavioral incidents, like a student overturning a table, and counseling children through crises, like the death of a parent. She makes sure students who can\u2019t see the chalkboard get glasses, and she maintains a food pantry and a clothing closet for children in need.She earns about $42,000 a year and works a second job as a pool attendant at the Y.M.C.A. She said she was participating in the walkout not primarily because of low pay, but for more mental health funding to hire social workers, school psychologists and counselors.\u201cWe are scrappers,\u201d she said, able to get a lot done with few resources. Still, she said it would be easier if social workers were assigned to one school at a time.As in Arizona, the last state to mount a widespread walkout, traditional public schools here have been challenged by the expansion of charter schools and private school vouchers.When students leave a traditional public school, they take their per-pupil funding with them. While the traditional school no longer has to provide them with instruction, other costs remain, like the repair of a roof or a heating system.\u201cIt\u2019s my biggest concern, that we\u2019ve become more segregated,\u201d said Mark Jewell, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union.Rhonda Dillingham, executive director of the North Carolina Association for Public Charter Schools, said she agreed that teachers should be paid more but would not be participating in the protest because of the negative rhetoric about school choice.\u201cI can\u2019t get behind the rally,\u201d Ms. Dillingham said. \u201cAs far as segregation, charter schools are open to all North Carolina students. I can\u2019t think of anything more segregating than a child\u2019s ZIP code and what a parent is able to pay for a house.\u201dConservatives see the walkout movement as partisan, with Democratic Party-aligned groups trying to fire up their base ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections. They acknowledge that teacher salaries could be higher and that more money is needed for items like textbooks, but point to the difficulty of balancing state budgets that must also pay for Medicaid and pension systems.\u201cThe only discernible crisis for the organizers of the event is that Republicans still control the General Assembly,\u201d said Terry Stoops, director of education studies at the John Locke Foundation, a conservative research group in Raleigh.Mr. Jewell, the union president, has been candid about wanting to change the makeup of the legislature. The walkout, which he calls a \u201cday of advocacy,\u201d is \u201cjust the beginning of a long stretch that we\u2019re calling the six-month haul\u201d toward the ballot box.The Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, has proposed an average pay raise for teachers of 8 percent and wants to halt planned tax cuts for businesses and high-earners in order to dedicate more money to schools.Republicans, who hold a veto-proof majority, say they can offer a 6 percent raise and smaller class sizes while maintaining tax cuts, and say additional raises should be tied to performance. Over the last several years, they phased out a program that paid teachers more for earning a master\u2019s degree and did away with most tenure protections.In North Carolina, as in the other five walkout states, union membership is optional for teachers.Mr. Jewell came to North Carolina from West Virginia, where he participated in a 1990 statewide walkout. This winter, when he saw rank-and-file teachers in his home state organizing on Facebook, he said he knew he wanted his own association to lead the way toward a mass labor action. \u201cYou have to get in front of the movement,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gig Economy Business Model Dealt a Blow in California Ruling", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a ruling with potentially sweeping consequences for the so-called gig economy, the California Supreme Court on Monday made it much more difficult for companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees.\u201cIt\u2019s a massive thing \u2014 definitely a game-changer that will force everyone to take a fresh look at the whole issue,\u201d said Richard Meneghello, a co-chairman of the gig-economy practice group at the management-side law firm Fisher Phillips.The court essentially scrapped the existing test for determining employee status, which was used to assess the degree of control over the worker. That test hinged on roughly 10 factors, like the amount of supervision and whether the worker could be fired without cause.In its place, the court erected a much simpler \u201cABC\u201d test that is applied in Massachusetts and New Jersey. Under that test, the worker is considered an employee if he or she performs a job that is part of the \u201cusual course\u201d of the company\u2019s business.By way of an example, the court said a plumber hired by a store to fix a bathroom leak would not reasonably be considered an employee of that store. But seamstresses sewing at home using materials provided by a clothing manufacturer would probably be considered employees.In addition, a company must show that it does not control and direct the worker, and that the worker is truly an independent business operator, not just classified that way unilaterally.While companies like Uber have had some success arguing that they don\u2019t exert sufficient control over drivers to be considered employers, it would be hard to assert that drivers are performing a task that isn\u2019t a standard feature of their business.Shannon Liss-Riordan, the attorney for the plaintiff in that case, said she would seek reconsideration in light of the new ruling.GrubHub said in a statement that it was aware of Monday\u2019s ruling but could not comment because of the appeals process in the case, other than to say it \u201cwill continue to ensure delivery partners can take advantage of the flexibility they value from working with our company.\u201dUber declined to comment.The case on which the court ruled Monday was brought by delivery drivers at a company called Dynamex, who had been considered employees before 2004, when the company changed the relationship to a contracting arrangement.Were the courts to find that workers at companies like GrubHub and Uber, as now constituted, were employees rather than contractors, the companies could respond in several ways. They could simply make their workers employees rather than contactors.Alternatively, ride-hailing companies like Uber might choose to rein in their operations, providing a more limited platform in which drivers and passengers can negotiate prices and the terms of the service.Even if Uber and the like are eventually forced to change their business model, however, that moment could be far off. Uber drivers typically sign an arbitration agreement stating that any disputes must be brought individually and outside the court system. While the United States Supreme Court recently heard a challenge to such agreements, it is widely expected to uphold them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Prices Reverse Their Rise, and Drivers May See Relief", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Oil prices are suddenly slumping again, just as American motorists were increasingly feeling the bite.The price of crude has dropped by 7 percent since a recent high on Tuesday, a result of seemingly coordinated signals from Russian and Saudi officials that they are ready to increase production.The abrupt reversal interrupted a surge in the American benchmark from less than $50 a barrel last fall to over $70, largely because of the collapse of Venezuelan oil production, the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and stronger global demand for energy.But now Russian and OPEC officials appear concerned that the potential for a price spike similar to one a decade ago could spur another drilling frenzy in the United States as well as robust sales of electric cars and other fuel-efficient vehicles.The Russian energy minister, Alexander Novak, fanned speculation about a pivot on supplies when he suggested on Thursday that Russia and producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would talk next month about easing their two-year-old agreement to reduce production.On Friday, speaking at a conference in Russia, the Saudi oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, said producers had already begun consultations. \u201cThe anxiety level that has escalated over the last few weeks is a concern to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in the near future there will be a time to release supply.\u201dRussia and Saudi Arabia have more than three million barrels of spare daily production capacity, so they are capable of more than compensating for production losses from Iran and Venezuela.Energy experts had predicted for weeks that American motorists might head into the summer driving season facing an average gasoline price of $3 a gallon for the first time since 2014. Now, with oil falling below $70 a barrel in the United States, a lower gas price is possible.\u201cThe chatter will arrest what was a long, painful ascent toward higher prices for motorists,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. He added that it was \u201cpretty much guaranteed\u201d that regular gasoline would fall just short of a $3 per gallon national average over the Memorial Day weekend.Democrats lately have been blaming the Trump administration for the rise in gasoline prices. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s reckless decision to pull out of the Iran deal has led to higher oil prices,\u201d the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, told reporters at a gasoline station near the Capitol this week. He added that the result was \u201csoaring gas prices, something we know hurts middle- and lower-income people.\u201d\u201cLooks like OPEC is at it again,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cOil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!\u201dThe unusual swipe appeared to put pressure on OPEC to respond. Mohammad Barkindo, OPEC\u2019s secretary general, said on Friday, \u201cIn OPEC we always pride ourselves on being friends of the United States.\u201dAmericans consume roughly 400 million gallons of gasoline a day, so the 60-cent increase over the last year means roughly $240 million less every day in consumer pockets. It is particularly burdensome for working-class Americans or those in rural areas who drive older, less fuel-efficient cars and spend a higher percentage of their income on fuel.Gasoline prices vary greatly by state, in part because of differences in taxes and fuel regulations. Californians paid an average of $3.73 a gallon on Friday, for instance, while Texans paid an average of $2.76.Prices are still well below what they were a decade ago, when the national average topped $4 a gallon and oil prices topped $100 a barrel. The American benchmark price is now about $68 a barrel.There is a lag of at least a few days between the direction of oil prices and gasoline prices, with the acceleration in gas prices letting up in recent days.Oil prices are inherently volatile, and they could go back up any time. But for the moment, it appears that Russia and Saudi Arabia, which leads OPEC, want to work out a strategy to increase supplies later this year while averting a scramble for market share that could send prices down again.Clifford Krauss reported from Houston, and Stanley Reed from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Student Loan Rates Are Rising. Here\u2019s What You Need to Know.", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserInterest rates in general are rising, and so are the rates on student loans for the coming school year.Interest rates on federal student loans for undergraduates will increase to 5.05 percent from 4.45 percent for the 2018-19 academic year, the federal Department of Education said on Friday.Rates on loans for graduate students will go up to 6.6 percent from 6 percent; and rates on PLUS loans, for parents and graduate students, to 7.6 percent from 7 percent.The federal government sets rates for new student loans each year, under a formula adopted by Congress several years ago. The new rates take effect annually on July 1, and apply to loans taken out for the following academic year. Rates can fall or remain flat; this will be the second consecutive year they have risen.Mark Kantrowitz, an author and expert on student financial aid, said the new rates would increase monthly payments by about 2.8 percent, or \u201ca few dollars a month\u201d for most borrowers, assuming a standard 10-year repayment term.Still, with student debt an increasing concern, higher rates mean families should weigh carefully how much they want to rely on borrowing to pay for college. A stronger economy makes it more likely that graduates will be able to find jobs and meet their loan obligations, but it is still best to be cautious, said Diane Cheng, associate research director at the nonprofit Institute for College Access & Success.\u201cOne way to help manage the debt burden,\u201d she said, was to be conservative with loans in the first place.For instance, parents predicted on average that 13 percent of college costs would be paid with student loans. But the Sallie Mae study, which was published this week, found that the actual share of costs covered by loans in the 2016-17 school year was 19 percentParents also predicted that their savings would cover 29 percent of college costs, compared with an actual share of 10 percent, the study found.A guide to student loans at various universities, and what it takes after graduation to repay that debt.Here are some questions and answers about student loans:Do the higher rates apply to existing student loans?No. The rates apply to federal loans taken out after June 30; they do not affect loans that students have already received, Mr. Kantrowitz said.Do I have to take out all of the loans I am authorized to borrow?No, Ms. Cheng said. You can always borrow less than the full amount authorized in your financial aid package. If your circumstances change during the school year, you can contact your college\u2019s financial aid office about borrowing more, she said, up to the limits set by the government.Do the higher rates apply to private student loans, too?No, the rates apply only to loans made by the federal government, and are fixed for the life of the loan. Rates on private loans, such as those from banks or other lenders, are set by the lender and may vary over the life of the loan. But even if rates on a private loan are lower at the start, Ms. Cheng said, federal loans are a better bet because they come with guaranteed consumer protections, like an option to have monthly payments based on your income.\u201cFederal loans should be your first choice,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reform in Reverse in Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Much of his focus has been on economic change, but the prince, a 32-year-old son of the Saudi king, has also promised more enlightened social policies, including for women, and drawn praise for this in the West.In just a few weeks, on June 24, Saudi Arabia is set to lift the longstanding ban on women drivers, putting into effect the most visible social reform that Prince Mohammed has championed.The government rounded up an initial group of activists and then after an international uproar, redoubled its efforts. At least 11 people, mostly women but also a few men, have now been arrested and interrogated without access to lawyers. One woman was said to have been held incommunicado.Saudi analysts say the reversal is a reflection of Saudi politics and the prince\u2019s desire to portray the lifting of the driving ban as a gift of the monarchy to Saudi women rather than a concession to international or domestic pressure.But the crackdown also raises doubts about the prince\u2019s commitment to women\u2019s equality and freedom of movement. Pro-government media outlets publicized photos of the detained activists and accused them of being traitors, a shocking attack on a group whose only apparent offense was peaceful protest. They should be released immediately.The episode also calls into question Prince Mohammed\u2019s ability to deliver on his promises to bring fundamental change to a patriarchal society where men exert legal control over women.If Prince Mohammed cannot take the heat for lifting the driving ban, one can only imagine how much harder it will be for him to deliver on tougher promises. Chief among them is getting rid of the guardianship law, which says that every woman must have a male guardian \u2014 husband, father, brother, even a son \u2014 who can make critical decisions on her behalf, including applying for a passport, traveling outside the country, studying abroad on a government scholarship and marrying.This is not the first time Prince Mohammed has undermined the reformist credentials on which he is trying to build a new image of his country. Last year, he oversaw the arrest of dozens of writers, intellectuals and moderate clerics who were seen as critics of his foreign policies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clashing With Trump, E.U. Tries to Blunt U.S. Sanctions on Iran", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOFIA, Bulgaria \u2014 Venting anger at President Trump, European leaders said Thursday they would take steps aimed at blunting the effects of the American sanctions he restored on Iran, which could penalize European companies doing business there.At a European Union summit meeting in Sofia, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, said it would begin a legal process to prohibit companies based in the 28-member union from complying with the American sanctions.\u201cWe should know that the effects of the announced American sanctions will not remain without consequences,\u201d Mr. Juncker said. \u201cWe have a duty to protect our European companies.\u201dThe meeting, with leaders of western Balkan countries, came barely a week after Mr. Trump quit the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and leading world powers, which has eased sanctions in exchange for verifiable curbs on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.Leaders of Britain, France and Germany had implored Mr. Trump in vain to honor the accord, which he has long described as a disastrous giveaway.The other parties to the agreement, including Iran, China and Russia, have said they want the agreement to survive. At the same time, Iran has hinted that it may no longer honor the agreement if the promised economic benefits do not begin flowing to the nation of 80 million.The withdrawal of the United States is a potentially fatal blow to the agreement because it restores all of the American sanctions, which not only restrict commerce with Iranian energy, banking and other sectors, but could penalize foreign businesses that trade with or invest in Iran.The American sanctions are a powerful deterrent to many non-American companies, particularly large multinational businesses that are intertwined in the United States economy and dependent on its financial system. The restored sanctions mean they must essentially choose between doing business with Iran or the United States.Mr. Trump\u2019s Iran decision is part of a broader pattern of actions that have deeply frustrated America\u2019s European allies. He also has threatened new tariffs, quit the Paris climate accord and, in their view, expressed disdain for multilateral diplomacy.Their anti-Trump mood was reflected in a speech on Wednesday by Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, who denounced what he called the \u201ccapricious assertiveness of the American administration.\u201dMr. Juncker amplified the criticism on Thursday.\u201cWe will not negotiate with the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads,\u201d Mr. Juncker said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of dignity, and it\u2019s a matter of principle.\u201dDalia Grybauskaite, the president of Lithuania, noted that Europe does not want a trade war with the United States over the Iran deal. \u201cWe are looking for technical solutions to protect our companies,\u201d Ms. Grybauskaite said.Despite their defiant response to Mr. Trump, it is unclear how effective any European Union measures would be in countering the restored American sanctions on Iran. Even as the summit meeting was underway, more big European-based companies signaled they would have to quit doing business with Iran to avoid running afoul of the American sanctions.The world\u2019s leading container shipping company, A.P. Moller-Maersk, said it would no longer do business in Iran, Reuters reported, while the Italian steel maker Danieli began scaling back on Iranian orders. On Wednesday, the French oil giant Total said it would have to divest from Iran unless it received an exemption from the American sanctions.President Emmanuel Macron of France appeared to acknowledge this reality at a news conference in Sofia, conceding that France does not want to get into a trade war with the United States over Iran.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to choose one camp over another,\u201d Mr. Macron said. While he said he wants to protect the ability of European businesses to remain in Iran if they wish, Mr. Macron also said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to impose on French businesses to stay in Iran.\u201dReporting was contributed by Milan Schreuer from Brussels; Boryana Dzhambazova from Sofia, Bulgaria; and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eric Schneiderman Set Himself Up as Trump\u2019s Foil. What Happens Now?", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the last 17 months, Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, had held himself up as the anti-Trump: a one-man legal wrecking ball, taking on the president and his agenda in both the courts and the court of public opinion.Some have even held up Mr. Schneiderman as a potential backstop to prosecute crimes should President Trump choose to pardon his associates in the continuing special counsel investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III. The president\u2019s vast federal pardoning powers do not apply to violation of state laws.\u201cIf you imagine a next attorney general in New York who is not as interested in being the big anti-Trump figure, that\u2019s a potentially significant difference,\u201d said Benjamin Wittes, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and the editor in chief of LawFare.G. Oliver Koppell, who served as New York attorney general for one year in the 1990s, said much of the office\u2019s direction \u201cdepends on the personality\u201d of its leader.\u201cEric was very aggressive in challenging the Trump agenda in all sorts of ways, and it\u2019s very difficult to predict what the next attorney general will pursue,\u201d Mr. Koppell said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the next attorney general will be equally aggressive.\u201dThe end result of many of Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s legal challenges still must be decided by the courts, but he certainly succeeded in at least temporarily slowing some key Trump administration policies.Mr. Trump sparred with Mr. Schneiderman long before he became president, including about a civil investigation into Trump University that resulted in a $25 million settlement. Mr. Schneiderman had also opened an investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 2016 and then the Eric Trump Foundation in 2017. After Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s resignation, allies of Mr. Trump cheered his demise.\u201cGotcha,\u201d tweeted Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, digging up an old tweet from Mr. Schneiderman in which he had reminded the president that \u201cno one is above the law.\u201dDonald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s oldest son, tweeted about Mr. Schneiderman no fewer than 10 times late Monday and early Tuesday.Mr. Schneiderman had focused intensely on Mr. Trump since the day after the 2016 election, when he said he gathered staff members in Manhattan to discuss reorienting their whole operation. Since then, Mr. Schneiderman had engaged in dozens of lawsuits and administrative actions to challenge Mr. Trump from the earliest days of the administration.So will Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s abrupt exit leave a vacuum for Democrats, either politically or legally?\u201cThe short answer is the work goes on,\u201d said Sean Rankin, the executive director of the Democratic Attorneys General Association. \u201cIt does not slow down.\u201dEven though Mr. Schneiderman has often served as the public face of the sprawling legal battles against Mr. Trump, Mr. Rankin said that his organization had already devised a strategy to share responsibility for the various lawsuits against the president\u2019s policies. Doug Chin, the attorney general of Hawaii, for instance, took the lead against Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, Mr. Rankin said, and Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general, stepped to the front in fighting back against the president\u2019s attempts to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\u201cStates are protecting their people, values and economy, and that will continue as leaders throughout the country continue to emerge to resist and persist,\u201d Mr. Becerra said in a statement.\u201cNothing is going to change,\u201d predicted James E. Tierney, a former attorney general of Maine who is now a lecturer at Harvard Law School. \u201cNo change \u2014 zero.\u201dMr. Tierney added that while the legal actions taken by Mr. Schneiderman and his colleagues were filed in good faith, their ultimate success could reside in the eye of the beholder, and they might eventually be little more than speed bumps on the White House\u2019s agenda.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s federal suit in Brooklyn, for example, challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s repeal of DACA, an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants, has already helped to keep the initiative in place, though it could eventually fail in the United States Supreme Court. And his litigation against the president\u2019s first travel ban caused Mr. Trump to twice revise the policy, though it, too, might be unsuccessful in the end.\u201cSchneiderman and the other A.G.s are saying: \u2018Look, we have a job to do. We can make real arguments in real cases,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tierney sad. \u201cAnd whether they ultimately win or lose, these are real cases.\u201dStill, the attorney general of New York, the home to Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses, his family and his campaign, is uniquely well suited to an outsize role in legal matters involving the president.In particular, Mr. Schneiderman had positioned his office as a fail-safe in the special counsel\u2019s inquiry. In recent weeks, Mr. Schneiderman had sought to exempt New York\u2019s double-jeopardy law from cases that involved presidential pardons.For the time being, the office of attorney general will be taken over by Barbara Underwood, who has served as New York\u2019s solicitor general for a decade, and who is respected in the legal community, though not seen as particularly political.\u201cShe is not someone who has had experience rushing up to a political podium to inveigh against the so-called forces of evil,\u201d said Seth W. Waxman, who worked with Ms. Underwood when he served as solicitor general under President Bill Clinton.With Mr. Schneiderman out and Ms. Underwood in, some Democratic attorneys general from across the country discussed the new legal landscape on their regular weekly call on Tuesday.\u201cThe A.G.s and I spoke about her today,\u201d Mr. Rankin said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a tremendous reputation. They\u2019re looking forward to working with her.\u201dShe could also be not long in the job: State legislators gathered in Albany on Tuesday, less than 12 hours after Mr. Schneiderman announced he would step down, to discuss whom they want to appoint to fill out his term.A long list of Democrats have already begun jockeying behind the scenes to either win appointment or run for one of the plum jobs in New York politics. The primaries will be held in September.Mr. Wittes, the Brookings Institution fellow, said playing the role of anti-Trump would most likely appeal to any Democrat who became attorney general. \u201cUsing that position as a launching pad for higher political ambition by opposing Trump is going to be an irresistible opportunity for some Democratic lawyer,\u201d he said.For Mr. Trump, the resignation represented a welcome end to an elected official he donated to in 2010 but turned against as Mr. Schneiderman began to investigate his business practices, calling him \u201cincompetent,\u201d a \u201chack\u201d and a \u201cshakedown artist.\u201dIn 2013, he compared Mr. Schneiderman unfavorably to two other Democratic politicians felled by scandal: former Representative Anthony D. Weiner and former Gov. Eliot Spitzer. \u201cWeiner is gone, Spitzer is gone \u2014 next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote then. \u201cIs he a crook? Wait and see, worse than Spitzer or Weiner.\u201dAs a result of the insults, investigations and lawsuits, Mr. Schneiderman emerged as the most visible attorney general taking on Mr. Trump \u2014 much to the delight of Democrats.\u201cYou are a superhero,\u201d the late-night comedian Samantha Bee told him on her show last fall. During the segment, she featured Mr. Schneiderman on a series of faux comic book covers battling Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201cWith great power,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman quoted the famous Spider-Man line back to her, \u201ccomes great responsibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}

McAdam of Verizon, according to people familiar with the discussions but not authorized to speak publicly.The lawsuit was pre-emptive, given that Ms. Redstone has considered replacing CBS\u2019s board if it continued to resist a merger with Viacom. CBS has wanted Les Moonves to become the combined company\u2019s C.E.O. and his C.O.O., Joe Ianniello, to take the No. 2 position. Viacom has pressed for its C.E.O., Bob Bakish, to hold that spot, and Ms. Redstone had largely sided with Viacom.CBS added that its board believes it is acting out of a fiduciary duty to all of its shareholders, and not just Ms. Redstone.\u2014 Michael de la MercedAfter CBS essentially declared war against its controlling shareholder and her desire to combine the company with Viacom, Ms. Redstone dropped a bombshell of her own.From a statement by National Amusements, the vehicle through which the Redstones control CBS and Viacom:NAI believes CBS\u2019s action today was precipitated following NAI raising specific concerns about incidents of bullying and intimidation in relation to one CBS director, dating back to 2016. NAI has made every effort to deal with this matter privately and confidentially. Unfortunately, CBS\u2019s action today continues to enable and empower such conduct.In meetings and informal discussions during the week of May 7, 2018 and continuing over the weekend of May 11\u201313, 2018, the CBS Special Committee finally determined that a CBS/Viacom merger is not in the best interests of CBS stockholders (other than NAI).CBS asserted that it filed suit because it was worried about Ms. Redstone blocking a meeting of the special committee taking place on Thursday. At the meeting, the committee is set to consider issuing a special dividend to all shareholders that could effectively neuter Ms. Redstone\u2019s 79 percent voting stake in the media company.National Amusement also said that CBS and Viacom had even reached a provisional agreement on valuation. Viacom\u2019s investors would receive 0.6135 CBS shares for each Viacom share they own, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations. The valuation marked a compromise for both sides and is a sign that CBS had previously supported exploring a merger of the two companies.Symantec, a cybersecurity software company, on Monday released details about an internal investigation that arose from concerns of a former employee.Symantec announced the investigation late on Thursday but provided scant details. On Monday, the company said the employee had drawn attention to certain financial measures and the company\u2019s public disclosures, including commentary on its historical financial results. The measures included those that might affect executive compensation, the company said in a statement released after the close of regular trading on Monday. Retaliation was another issue the former employee raised, the statement said, without going into detail.Symantec said it \u201cdid not anticipate a material adverse impact on its historical financial statements.\u201dShares of Symantec lost a third of their value in Friday but recovered somewhat on Monday.

Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, is the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.We had to go back nearly a century to the 1912 trial and conviction of Judge Robert Archibald to find a precedent. After much consideration, we decided to charge him not only for actions while he was on the federal bench, but also for a corrupt scheme he entered into with a bail bond company while a state court judge, and for the false statements he made during his Senate confirmation process.We determined that because Judge Porteous was accused of taking cash and gifts from lawyers whose cases he presided over in state court, there was little question that such actions were incompatible with his responsibility as a federal judge. How could someone in his courtroom be confident of a fair trial, knowing he had solicited and accepted bribes while a judge?In voting overwhelmingly to convict Judge Porteous on every count, the Senate established the precedent that a federal official can be removed for conduct committed before assuming office.Because of the Porteous case, it is clear that if President Trump participated in a conspiracy to defraud the United States during the campaign by colluding with the Russians, there is a historical basis for the Senate to remove him from office. It is even more clear that if he committed the offense of obstruction of justice while in office, that would provide a legal basis for removal.Yet, one of the most important lessons I learned during the Porteous case was that the legal standard for what constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor is less important than the practical and political standard that must be met in any impeachment case. And while that political standard cannot be easily or uniformly defined, I think in the present context it means the following: Was the president\u2019s conduct so incompatible with the office he holds that Democratic and Republican members of Congress can make the case to their constituents that they were obligated to remove him?If they cannot, if impeachment is seen by a substantial part of the country as merely an effort to nullify an election by other means, there will be no impeachment, no matter how high the crime or serious the misdemeanor.This is a very high bar, and it should be. Impeachment is an extraordinary remedy, not to be entertained lightly, and in the case of a president, would mean putting the country through a deeply wrenching process. It is instead a remedy that must be considered soberly, mindful of the fact that removing a president from office should be the recourse for only the most serious transgressions.Should the facts warrant impeachment, that case will be made more difficult politically if part of the country feels that removing Mr. Trump is the result that some of their fellow Americans were wishing for all along.During the course of our investigation in the House Intelligence Committee, we have found troubling evidence of both collusion and obstruction of justice. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, has no doubt seen even more than we have, but his investigation is not complete, and our efforts continue as well. There is much more work to do before any of us can say whether the evidence rises to the level that we should consider a remedy beyond the one that voters will render at the ballot box.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Indian Tribes Dig In to Gain Their Share of Sports Betting", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState officials from California to Connecticut spent last week maneuvering for control of the tens of billions of dollars in projected revenue from sports betting, and joining them was another group of powerful, and familiar, gambling operators aiming to claim their piece of the action: American Indian tribes.In Connecticut, for example, where two federally recognized tribes, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe and the Mohegan Tribe, operate the hugely successful Foxwoods Resort Casino and the Mohegan Sun, leaders of the organizations have insisted they alone have the legal authority to offer sports betting, according to their compacts with the state. They say the state may incur a steep penalty if it violates those agreements.Under the compacts the tribes and state officials signed in the 1990s, as long as the state does not authorize any other slot machines or commercial casinos, the tribes must give 25 percent of their slot machine revenue to the state. In the 2017 fiscal year, this resulted in a $270 million payment to Connecticut.Helga Woods, the attorney general of the Mohegan Tribe, has already written to legislators to point out that if the state authorizes another group to offer what she referred to as \u201cvideo facsimile gaming,\u201d that would violate the exclusivity provisions of the compact. If that happens, \u201cour obligations to make the slot contributions cease,\u201d Ms. Woods wrote.State officials disagree. Proposed legislation would allow the two tribes, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation, and Sportech, which operates off-track betting parlors in the state, to offer sports betting.Rodney Butler, chairman of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council, said he had met with state legislators and representatives of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy to begin negotiations.\u201cWe have said, \u2018We want to work with you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Butler said. \u201cLet\u2019s work out an arrangement.\u201dIn the 2016 fiscal year, those operations generated more than $31 billion in revenue. Over roughly the same period, taxable gambling revenue in Nevada, home to the gambling destinations Las Vegas and Reno, where private companies rather than Indian tribes control most of the business, accounted for $10.6 billion.Betting on sports represents a small fraction of that amount, though industry experts say the court ruling will most likely allow that to increase significantly. In Britain, where the sports market is far less diverse and where the population is about one-fifth as large as that of the United States, gamblers wagered some $20 billion for the year ending in March 2017.Analysts estimate that gamblers in the United States wager as much as $150 billion each year illegally through bookies and offshore accounts, as well as through less formal wagers, such as office pools around the men\u2019s N.C.A.A. basketball tournament. With so much on the table for the Indian tribes, the days since last week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling have been filled with jockeying and strategic planning, especially in the states where Indian casinos have exerted powerful influence over local economies, such as California and Mississippi, in addition to Connecticut.In California, dozens of Indian-owned casinos generate close to $8 billion in annual revenue, the most of any state, giving the tribes enormous influence over the gambling industry. Ahead of the Supreme Court decision, Assemblyman Adam Gray introduced a bill to amend the California Constitution, which gives Indian tribes exclusive rights to operate slot machines and other casino-style games. The tribes say those rights include sports betting.Since legalizing sports betting in California will require amending the state\u2019s Constitution, lawmakers, lobbyists and tribal leaders are now girding for a drawn-out, perhaps yearslong fight before anyone in the state makes a legal bet on a sporting event.The tribal leaders base their claims to exclusivity on language in the state Constitution that gives them the rights to games that involve \u201cbanking\u201d \u2014 meaning the house creates the market for the bet.In a statement this week, Steve Stallings, chairman of the California Nations Indian Gaming Association, formally requested a role in all negotiations over the future of sports betting.\u201cCalifornia voters have, on numerous occasions, confirmed the exclusive right of California tribal governments to operate casino-style games,\u201d Mr. Stallings said. \u201cLegalization of sports betting should not become a backdoor way to infringe upon exclusivity.\u201dCalifornia also allows forms of gambling in two other areas that are interwoven with the state\u2019s history: horse racing, which was legalized in 1933, and card rooms, of which there are close to 90 across the state and which trace their heritage to poker-playing miners during the Gold Rush.If those parties can agree on the language of sports betting legislation, the Legislature will have to pass the bill with a two-thirds majority, the governor will have to sign the legislation and then voters will have to approve it in a statewide referendum. The deadline to get a bill on the ballot in November is late June. Mr. Gray, the state legislator, said that timeline is probably too short for a vote this year.If the fight over internet poker in the state is any guide, legal sports betting in California may be years away. Several efforts in recent years to legalize betting on online poker failed, largely because none of the players in California\u2019s gambling industry could agree on a deal, and the tribes themselves were divided.\u201cIf you can\u2019t solve internet poker, I don\u2019t know how you solve something like sports betting,\u201d Mr. Stallings said in an interview.Mr. Gray said the language in the current Constitution providing exclusivity to the tribes was left intentionally vague, \u201cprobably by a smart attorney.\u201dWhile litigation, if it comes to that, could drag on for years, Doug Elmets, a public relations adviser to several Native American tribes in California, said that if other states push ahead with sports betting, then California may have to act.\u201cAs the fifth-largest economy in the world, California is not likely to sit by and watch potentially substantial amounts of revenue go to other states,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re moving forward at a rapid rate,\u201d said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.The proposal\u2019s rules are particularly advantageous to Mississippi\u2019s brick-and-mortar casinos: The regulations would forbid sports betting on mobile devices \u2014 except on a casino\u2019s property \u2014 and would require gamblers to walk into one of the many casinos from Tunica Resorts to Biloxi to place bets.That is not what the major betting companies would hope for, since so much of their business now takes place on mobile phones. Most leagues would also likely be opposed, because forcing fans who want to bet to go to a specific location also limits the number of people who can participate and, in turn, watch more live sports.So far, the state\u2019s tribal casinos have been silent publicly about their intentions. A spokeswoman for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians referred a request for comment to the tribe-controlled Pearl River Resort, whose chief executive declined to be interviewed.But Mississippi\u2019s commercial casinos have long dominated public discussion about gambling in the state, and the greatest tensions appear to rest on whether it intended to allow sports betting at all.The provision that Mr. Godfrey and other sports betting proponents believe supports their approach was part of a measure last year that permitted wagers on fantasy sports games. State leaders signed off on the measure but have insisted that they did not recognize they were creating an opening for sports betting.Clay Chandler, a spokesman for Gov. Phil Bryant, said the governor \u201crecognizes the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision as the law of the land.\u201d He did not, however, respond to questions about whether Governor Bryant remained personally opposed to sports betting or whether he would seek a rollback of the measure that the gambling industry argues laid the groundwork for a legalization in Mississippi.Mr. Godfrey said that continuing to prohibit sports betting was shortsighted and that Mississippi should provide the chance for gamblers to place their bets with licensed casinos instead of with a bookie.\u201cThis is going on illegally all across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that option is going to be there.\u201dIf that comes to fruition, Indian tribes that have invested billions of dollars over the past 30 years to build their businesses say they will do everything in their power to make sure they are a part of it.Kevin Brown \u201cRed Eagle,\u201d chairman of the Mohegan Tribe in Connecticut, said that in the interest of expedience, he and his organization were at least willing to include the Connecticut Lottery Corporation and Sportech, the other two entities included in proposed sports betting legislation in the state, in negotiations.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to make it such a high hurdle,\u201d he said, \u201cthat our exclusivity prevents us from being a first mover here.\u201dKevin Draper reported from New York, Tim Arango reported from California, and Alan Blinder reported from Georgia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Nuclear Disarmament Could Take 15 Years, Expert Warns", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Trump administration races to start talks with North Korea on what it calls \u201crapid denuclearization,\u201d a top federal government adviser who has repeatedly visited the North\u2019s sprawling atomic complex is warning that the disarmament process could take far longer, up to 15 years.The adviser, Siegfried S. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico, and now a Stanford professor, argues that the best the United States can hope for is a phased denuclearization that goes after the most dangerous parts of the North\u2019s program first.Dr. Hecker\u2019s time frame stands in stark contrast with what the United States initially demanded, on what could be a key sticking point in any summit meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.Two American delegations, one in Singapore and one in North Korea, are attempting to work out a meeting between the two leaders. Mr. Trump canceled the meeting in a letter to Mr. Kim on Thursday but has been working to reconstitute it ever since, posting Twitter messages that say he is confident the North Korean economy will prosper if an accord is reached.The delegation in Singapore is discussing the logistics of a meeting, to be held June 12 or afterward. The other, led by Sung Kim, an American diplomat with long North Korea experience, is meeting senior officials of the North Korean Foreign Ministry at the Demilitarized Zone to work on the wording of what kind of communiqu\u00e9 might be issued by the two leaders. But the White House and State Department have said nothing about the details of those discussions.In an interview, Dr. Hecker said he was making the Stanford study public to advance discussion of a complicated topic that will be at the heart of Mr. Trump\u2019s encounter with Mr. Kim in Singapore, if that meeting happens. So far, the denuclearization agenda has been a mix of bold claims by the administration about what it will demand, and vague generalities from the North.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about dozens of sites, hundreds of buildings, and thousands of people,\u201d Dr. Hecker said Friday. The key to dismantling the sprawling atomic complex, begun six decades ago, Dr. Hecker added, \u201cis to establish a different relationship with North Korea where its security rests on something other than nuclear weapons.\u201dDr. Hecker cautioned that his team\u2019s road map left room for many knotty points of negotiation \u2014 such as where to draw the line between civilian and military nuclear activities. At first, the Trump administration said the North must give up all enrichment of uranium, which can fuel not only bombs but reactors that illuminate cities. Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said for the first time that he needed some \u201cnegotiating space\u201d on that question.Dr. Hecker said a similar open question was whether to let the North\u2019s rocket engineers, now making long-range missiles, redirect their skills into a peaceful space program.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to eliminate everything, and there\u2019re some things that aren\u2019t a problem,\u201d Dr. Hecker said. \u201cSome of the risks are manageable.\u201dIn its report, the Stanford team sees three overlapping phases of denuclearization activity that, in total, would take 10 years. The initial phase, taking up to a year, is the halt of military, industrial and personnel operations. The second, taking up to five years, is the winding down of sites, facilities and weapons. The final and hardest phase, taking up to 10 years, is the elimination or limiting of factories and programs.Dr. Hecker noted that the decontamination and decommissioning of a single plant that handles radioactive materials could take a decade or more.In an interview on Sunday, Dr. Hecker said his personal denuclearization estimate ran to 15 years given the tangle of political and technical uncertainties that the United States and North Korea would face if they went ahead and sought a historic accord.The Trump administration has made public no details of what particular steps it sees for the North\u2019s denuclearization, or what it intends to demand if Mr. Trump meets with Mr. Kim. Its bottom line is that denuclearization must be complete, verifiable and irreversible.Mr. Trump\u2019s hawkish national security adviser, John R. Bolton, argued before joining the administration in April that the president should use a summit meeting exclusively to tell North Korea to dismantle and deliver up all its nuclear arms and equipment, saying only then should the United States discuss easing sanctions and participating in the North\u2019s economic development.In recent television and radio interviews, Mr. Bolton has advocated quick denuclearization in which the North would send its weapons and equipment to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, where nuclear inspectors in 2004 shipped some of Libya\u2019s gear for enriching uranium. Mr. Bolton has repeatedly cited Libya as a role model for the North\u2019s atomic disarmament.In the interview, Dr. Hecker argued that the only safe way to disassemble the North\u2019s nuclear warheads was to have the job done by the same North Korean engineers who built them.Mr. Trump, in contrast to Mr. Bolton\u2019s public stance, twice last week opened the door to phased denuclearization, saying the North might find it impossible to dismantle its entire nuclear program in one step.Dr. Hecker comes to the issue with decades of experience in learning about foreign nuclear programs and managing their phased reductions.After the Cold War, as the Los Alamos director, he fostered wide cooperation between American and Russian nuclear laboratories to secure and safeguard vast stockpiles of ex-Soviet nuclear materials. His 2016 book, \u201cDoomed to Cooperate,\u201d details the long collaboration.Dr. Hecker made his first visit to the North\u2019s sprawling Yongbyon nuclear site in 2004, with follow-up visits in 2007, 2008 and 2010, learning more than any other Western expert about the North\u2019s secretive atomic doings. Since then, he has emerged publicly as one of the world\u2019s most knowledgeable experts on its nuclear program.His co-author Robert L. Carlin, a former C.I.A. analyst and State Department intelligence official who has traveled to North Korea more than 30 times, is frequently cited as an expert on the North Korean leadership. The third author is Elliot A. Serbin, a research assistant to Dr. Hecker.The team divides up the North\u2019s nuclear program into eight general categories and 22 subgroups. The range is wide. It includes not just plants and facilities but related issues such as ending the North\u2019s missile and nuclear exports and redirecting its technical experts from military to civilian work.Plutonium fuel for atom bombs is especially frequently mentioned. The radioactive metal is considered the founding step for aggressive programs set on making a variety of nuclear arms.Producing it is easier than purifying uranium, and it takes far less plutonium to make a blast of equal size. Atop a missile, all else being equal, the reduced weight means warheads fueled by plutonium can fly longer distances, making them more threatening. Plutonium is also ideal for igniting the thermonuclear fuel of hydrogen bombs.The Stanford team recommends six ways to curb the North\u2019s plutonium complex, targeting Yongbyon, the secretive site that Dr. Hecker has repeatedly visited.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have some people argue with us,\u201d Dr. Hecker said of how technical experts were likely to react to the team\u2019s recommendations. \u201cThat\u2019s O.K.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mummy Turned Up in Iran. Could It Be the Former Shah?", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHad this been Cairo, it would hardly have merited a mention in the local news media. But while Egypt is known for its mummies, Iran certainly is not. Here, the dead are buried in loose white cloth, and the bodies quickly decompose.The excavator driver was brought in for questioning, family members told foreign-based satellite channels. Some people even said he had been arrested, but this could not be independently verified.\u201cThis is Reza Shah, no doubt,\u201d said Akbar, who was selling Islamic jewelry in the bazaar near the shrine and who refused to give his family name to an inquisitive foreigner whose intentions were unclear. \u201cWe Iranians are superstitious, and I personally believe his return is a message. That message is: \u2018Correct the mess.\u2019 \u201dInstead, Iranians are caught in a seemingly perpetual limbo. There is nostalgia for the days before the Islamic Revolution, when President Jimmy Carter came to Iran to meet with Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi \u2014 the son of Reza Shah \u2014 instead of weapons experts haggling over nuclear centrifuges. Of course, there is also a bit of amnesia about the shah\u2019s despotic tendencies, and the abuses by his secret police, the Savak, which fueled the uprising that overthrew him in 1979.While the authorities refused to say whether the recent discovery was, in fact, the mummified remains of Reza Shah, many Iranians took the official reluctance, the location of the find and the virtual absence of mummies in the country as proof positive.\u201cIt has to be him,\u201d my Iranian mother-in-law cried out during a debate at the kitchen table. \u201cWe Iranians don\u2019t do mummies.\u201dTheir reasoning went like this: When Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and his family hurriedly left Iran on a sunny January day in 1979 as the Islamic Revolution was gathering force, they left behind two long-deceased relatives. One, his brother, Prince Alireza Pahlavi, died in 1954 in a plane crash in the snowy Alborz Mountains of Iran and was buried at an unknown location.But the grave site of his father, Reza Shah, who died in 1944, would have been hard to miss: an imposing mausoleum adjacent to the parrot garden where the excavator was digging last month.Reza Shah ruled for nearly two decades. Many here call him the father of modern Iran, for single-handedly carrying a backward, mosquito-infested country into the 20th century. He went into exile in South Africa after being forced by the British and Soviets to abdicate in 1941 in favor of his son.After his death in Johannesburg in 1944, his body was taken to Egypt, where it was mummified and where it stayed until 1950, when his remains were brought back to Iran.\u201cI remember when the revolutionaries started demolishing the mausoleum,\u201d said Ali Zakeri, 72, who spends most of his days in the bazaar surrounding the Shah Abdol Azim shrine. \u201cIt was built so strong that after a whole day of hammering, they only managed to take three centimeters off,\u201d he added, referring to a bit more than an inch.It was a sunny spring day, and Mr. Zakeri and his friend were discussing the enhanced police presence that had accompanied the crowds swarming the normally peaceful area around the shrine, hoping to catch a glimpse of the mummy.\u201cWhen I saw the mummy, I knew this was Reza Shah,\u201d said the friend, Farman Hemati, of the photograph that had circulated on social media. He was sitting next to a scale like those in old-fashioned arcades, where people could weigh themselves for the equivalent of 5 cents, although very few did.He then proffered a theory as to why the mummy had generated such excitement.\u201cI lost most of my money after the revolution,\u201d he said, adding that things in Iran had since gone downhill. \u201cWe need a strong leader, to set things straight here, someone like Reza Shah. The discovery of his body is a sign that change is coming.\u201dFor Iran\u2019s authorities, one thing was clear: The mummy, regardless of who was wrapped inside, couldn\u2019t be in the public eye.Measures were taken. Plainclothes officers started roaming the shrine, seeking out Reza Shah aficionados and sending them home. One recent evening, after a large group gathered, several people were arrested. The construction site where the mummy was found has been cordoned off and the excavator driver who took the selfie was questioned, family members have said.Early on, Hassan Khalilabadi, the chairman of the cultural heritage committee of the Tehran City Council, floated in an interview with the semiofficial news agency ISNA the idea that the mummy could be Reza Shah\u2019s. But such remarks from officialdom quickly disappeared from local news sites. The mummy was reburied or taken away. Or perhaps, as one official said, the whole thing was Photoshopped. From an official perspective, it never happened.In a nearby teahouse, two men, Ali and Arash, were sucking on a water pipe, as state television droned on behind them. Ali said he was a representative for a condom brand, while Arash sold baby clothes. It was 11 a.m., but they were both already tired.\u201cMany things in the country are wrong,\u201d said Ali, 32.\u201cOur moods are constantly shifting,\u201d said Arash, 32.They fell silent.\u201cReza Shah will be the example of the strong man to come,\u201d Ali concluded.\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Arash said. \u201cWe will again forget him, as we forget everything else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But some face steep battles, and politics these days offers few guarantees.\u201cSeveral of them face a huge challenge because of the nature of the district,\u201d said Terry Madonna, the director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster. \u201cThe Democratic wave would have to be beyond huge.\u201dOn the Republican side, one woman, Pearl Kim, will be running for a House seat in the general election.Here are the seven Democratic women who won House primaries in Pennsylvania this week:Ms. Scanlon won in the Fifth District, which is largely in Delaware County, home to the educated suburban women whom presidential candidates have traditionally seen as crucial swing voters. She will run against Ms. Kim, who was uncontested in the Republican primary.\u201cI think voters really did show that they want to see women go to Congress. We saw that throughout the Philadelphia region,\u201d said Ms. Scanlon, who runs the pro bono practice at a large Philadelphia law firm and has been particularly involved in defending the rights of immigrants against complaints of overaggressive policing in the state. \u201cThey want to see change in D.C., and it seems pretty clear they want to see people check back against the excesses of the Trump administration.\u201dThe newly redrawn district favors Democrats \u2014 Hillary Clinton beat Mr. Trump there with 63 percent of the vote \u2014 but even they acknowledge that Republicans were smart to nominate a woman. They say Ms. Kim has a powerful story, as the daughter of immigrants who has worked as a prosecutor and deputy attorney general to fight human trafficking.\u201cThe Republican strategy will be to run against Trump, to talk about the president and his agenda and why it\u2019s bad,\u201d Mr. Madonna said.Ms. Wild won a competitive primary, beating candidates to her left and right in the Seventh District. She had the support of Emily\u2019s List, a national organization that backs female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights, as well as party officials, many of whom viewed her as the best shot at flipping the seat formerly held by Representative Charlie Dent, a Republican.In an interview on Wednesday, she celebrated the enthusiasm that helped propel so many women in the state to victory. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously been a long time coming,\u201d she said. \u201cI was at the polls most of the day, and I did note a steady stream of female voters \u2014 there were plenty of male voters, too \u2014 but just a steady stream,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it really was important across the state and certainly in this district.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s going to be much more of a competitive seat,\u201d Mr. Madonna said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to occupy a major amount of attention.\u201dMs. Boser won the primary in the 15th District, in the western part of the state. She said she was teaching a night class on Tuesday as votes were being counted, and then woke up early on Wednesday to finish grading papers.A professor of sociology at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Ms. Boser spent years studying public policy, but she said her dismay over the election of President Trump drove her to get more involved in politics.\u201cI\u2019ve not done anything like this before,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, well, I\u2019ve been telling my students for years about getting involved and always saying to them, \u2018If not you, then who?\u2019\u201dSo Ms. Boser faces long odds: Even a huge Democratic wave in November may not be enough to beat a Republican incumbent in this district.Ms. King ran unopposed in the 11th District but will face long odds heading into the general election: Her district, a largely working-class region in the southern part of the state, is solidly Republican.\u201cIt is a tough battle,\u201d she said in an interview. A nonprofit leader and a Mennonite \u2014 her husband is a Mennonite pastor \u2014 Ms. King supports progressive ideas including Medicare for all and debt-free public college. She was endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont.Ms. Houlahan ran unopposed in the Sixth District and looks to have a relatively direct path to winning a House seat. Her district is one of several around Philadelphia that voted for a woman. And she is one of the few candidates to be endorsed by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.But Ms. Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, is not declaring victory yet. \u201cWe\u2019re fundamentally a very purple people here in the sixth congressional,\u201d she said. \u201cI take exactly nothing for granted on how the results will unfold.\u201dMs. Houlahan said she is more of a moderate on issues relating to the economy and business. But she shies away from using traditional labels to describe herself.\u201cI think that there is this false narrative of what it is to be a Democrat and what it is to be a Republican,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you can have both thoughts in your brain at the same time.\u201dGreg McCauley, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary, says on his campaign website that he \u201cwill be an outspoken advocate of the conservative Republican ideology \u2014 a balanced budget and smaller government.\u201dBibiana Boerio won the primary in the 14th District, which is tricky terrain for the Democrats: Parts of it are currently represented by Conor Lamb, a Democrat who won a special election in March, but the new district boundaries have moved him to another district.That means the area, which President Trump won by 29 points, is up for grabs in November. Ms. Boerio will compete against Guy Reschenthaler, a state senator and a Navy veteran.Ms. Boerio, a former auto industry executive, was careful not to mention Mr. Trump in an interview, focusing on her working-class roots and \u201cthe importance of civility in getting things done.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to scream and shout,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, screaming and shouting and whatever is counterproductive.\u201dState Representative Madeleine Dean ran away with the Democratic nomination in the Fourth District, winning more than 70 percent of the vote in a primary that was expected to be closer. She defeated another woman, the gun control activist Shira Goodman, as well as former Representative Joe Hoeffel.Ms. Dean said she was excited at the prospect of representing Montgomery County, which the redrawn map united for the first time in decades. It is Pennsylvania\u2019s third-most populous county, but until this year, pieces of it were in five districts, none represented by a resident of the county.A fellow state representative, Mary Jo Daley, dropped out of the primary a few weeks ago and began campaigning for Ms. Dean. And Allyson Schwartz, the last woman to represent the area in Congress, also pitched in. \u201cIt just felt like women working with other women,\u201d Ms. Dean said in an interview.\u201cI don\u2019t think any way you look at that you can reach any conclusion but that that\u2019s likely to be a Democratic seat,\u201d Mr. Madonna said.Maggie Astor, Liam Stack and Kate Zernike contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Holds Rates Steady and Stays on Track for June Increase", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and acknowledged rising inflation, but it gave little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.The Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s unanimous decision not to raise rates so quickly after a March increase had been widely expected. The official statement from the committee gave no indication that Fed officials plan to raise rates faster than previously telegraphed.Officials made only a few changes to the language they had used after their March meeting to describe inflation and growth. Most notably, they acknowledged that \u201con a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent,\u201d which is the central bank\u2019s stated target for inflation.Officials acknowledged that increase on Wednesday, but the statement suggested that the Fed was not overwhelmingly concerned. The statement noted that annual inflation \u201cis expected to run near the committee\u2019s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.\u201d The inclusion of \u201csymmetric\u201d is a sign that the Fed could tolerate inflation running slightly above 2 percent for a period of time.The language is a change from the March meeting statement, which said that inflation and core inflation rates \u201chave continued to run below 2 percent\u201d and that annual inflation is \u201cexpected to move up in coming months\u201d and stabilize around 2 percent.The statement on Wednesday also eliminated a line from the March statement that said \u201cthe committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.\u201d\u201cThe Fed is telling markets that it won\u2019t overreact to a run of higher numbers\u201d in inflation readings, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a research note after the meeting, \u201cjust as it didn\u2019t overreact to the run of five straight downside surprises last year.\u201dIf such a situation arises, \u201cit\u2019s very hard to navigate that without having an economic downturn,\u201d Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview last month. \u201cMy concern is that\u2019s much worse than just having slightly slower growth\u201d from a slightly faster pace of rate increases.There were few hints of those concerns in this meeting\u2019s statement.The statement declared that \u201cbusiness fixed investment continued to grow strongly\u201d since the last Fed meeting, which was more bullish language than the March statement. It noted, as it did in March, that household spending growth had moderated since the end of last year. It eliminated a line from the March statement that declared \u201cthe economic outlook has strengthened in recent months,\u201d but did not add any new language about risks to growth.Officials said that \u201crisks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced,\u201d a slight change from March, when they declared that \u201cnear-term risks\u201d appeared roughly balanced.Analysts read that as an endorsement of the economy\u2019s staying power. \u201cBy not referring to the slower G.D.P. growth in the first quarter or potential risks from trade policy, the committee is emphasizing that there are more signs of strength than weakness in the economy,\u201d Ben Ayers, senior economist at the insurance firm Nationwide, wrote after the meeting.The language in the statement, and the decision on rates, validated Fed watchers who had predicted few changes this month. In part, that\u2019s because there haven\u2019t been significant surprises in economic data since the last meeting.\u201cThe F.O.M.C. notes boil down to \u2018steady as she goes,\u2019\u201d said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \u201cSo, without the Fed trying to slow down the economy to head off a hot economy or rising inflation, we can expect the unemployment rate to continue dropping, and just as importantly, wages will be free to rise.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Italy\u2019s Political Turmoil Is Causing Financial Angst Elsewhere", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s political convulsions have raised new fears about the future of the euro, the single currency of the European Union that was introduced 16 years ago.The possibility, however remote, that a populist Italian government would renounce the euro and revive the lira currency has unnerved many bankers and investors. Stocks tumbled on Tuesday on the fears, and the euro fell against the dollar to its weakest level in six months.Here is a look at why the fears could escalate into a major crisis, and what it could mean for Italy, the euro, Europe and the world.Italians have actually been talking about the euro since they began using it in 2002. For years, they have complained that their spending power has diminished under the euro. But the populists who did well in the election also say euro membership has subverted Italy\u2019s sovereignty \u2014 an increasingly resonant theme in the country.Before Italy adopted the euro, it had the power to raise or lower interest rates to affect the value of its currency \u2014 and Italy\u2019s economic competitiveness. A cheaper lira made Italian exports more affordable in other countries, strengthening the economy at home. But under the euro system, Italy \u2014 like all members of the eurozone \u2014 has no control over interest rates, which are set by the European Central Bank.The two parties that won the March 4 elections, the Five Star Movement and the League, have expressed hostility toward rules that govern the 28-nation European Union and the 19 members that have adopted the euro.Italy was one of the euro\u2019s founding members, and its economy is one of the largest in Europe, dwarfing that of Greece. An Italian exit could cause severe economic disruptions internationally and subvert investor confidence far beyond Italy and Europe. Interest rates could spike all over the world, reflecting a rising atmosphere of risk.The euro, on the other hand, has fared better in Italian public opinion, partly because of the financial convenience it has created. \u201cThe euro is a tight fit. Italians aren\u2019t happy, but that doesn\u2019t mean they want to go,\u201d said Maurizio Pessato, president of the polling firm SWG.The country\u2019s Democratic Party, the biggest loser in the last elections, has never questioned belonging to the eurozone.Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister and center-right politician who still wields major political influence, has delivered a mixed message.But his off-again-on-again partner in the center-right bloc, Matteo Salvini, has campaigned for years against a single currency and is known to wear shirts printed with \u201cBasta Euro\u201d \u2014 \u201cEnough with the Euro.\u201d His party, the League, has called for a vast overhaul of the treaties that regulate eurozone membership.For years, the Five Star Movement promulgated euro-skepticism, and initially promised a nonbinding referendum on the euro. That stance softened when it became clear that many investors feared a euro exit. On Monday, the party\u2019s leader, Luigi Di Maio, said his party had never supported leaving the euro. Still, the party wants Italy to have more sovereignty in economic choices.Experts are debating how that would be possible. Italy would have to change some articles of its Constitution, which is deeply intertwined with European principles, and draft a constitutional law. A referendum could be called.Even if Italians voted to exit the euro, the procedure could be lengthy and messy. Experts say that Italy would need to stop economic and banking activities for months to avoid speculation. Financial analysts say it is probable that many investors would avoid Italy.Just the possibility of an Italian government skeptical of the euro has created financial market volatility that could indirectly lead to problems in Italy, one of Europe\u2019s most indebted countries. If volatility continues, Italy may have difficulty selling government bonds that are used to pay its debts and finance salaries and pensions. The only solution would be a rescue from European Union financial authorities, with the acceptance of the same kind of austerity requirements imposed on Greece.Many experts agree that Italy would be poorer, with uncertain economic prospects for years. Italy would likely default on its debts, and its replacement currency would be greatly devalued. A default could lead to retaliation from other countries, asset freezes abroad and economic isolation. Italy sells more than half its goods within the European Union.Financial markets and speculators might see the euro as an untrustworthy currency, throwing into doubt the premise of stability and strength its founders envisioned. The effects could corrode confidence in the European Union itself.\u201cThe contagion would be enormous,\u201d said Massimo Bordignon, professor of economics at Milan\u2019s Catholic University. \u201cAnd the cost for Italy and for the other European countries would also be enormous.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Instead of the $75 million a year the tax was originally expected to raise, it will bring in less than $50 million. The council also included a sunset provision that would require the tax to be reauthorized in five years.The compromise failed to defuse tensions between Amazon and the city it has called home for the last 24 years.Even though the company decided to resume one of its building projects, Drew Herdener, an Amazon vice president, said in a statement, \u201cWe remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council\u2019s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.\u201dTwenty finalist locations across North America have been aggressively wooing Amazon to win up to 50,000 high-paying jobs that its second headquarters would bring. In some of those places, there is opposition growing over the tax incentives that some city and state governments have agreed to give Amazon in return for being selected. And Amazon\u2019s hardball politics in Seattle has further soured some local leaders.\u201cI absolutely find it unacceptable to see politically threatening behavior as is occurring there,\u201d said Robin Kniech, a member of the City Council in Denver, one of the finalists for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t send a message that you expect to be a part of the community.\u201d\u201cBy threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules,\u201d the letter said.Mr. Hederner, the Amazon vice president, said sharp increases in the city of Seattle\u2019s revenues have outpaced the population growth of the city during the same period. \u201cThe city does not have a revenue problem \u2014 it has a spending efficiency problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are highly uncertain whether the City Council\u2019s anti-business positions or its spending inefficiency will change for the better.\u201dThe lower tax was the result of feverish negotiations over the weekend between members of the City Council and Seattle\u2019s mayor, Jenny Durkan, who had opposed the council\u2019s earlier tax proposal. The mayor had publicly hinted that she would veto the original tax proposal because of the risks she said it posed to the local economy.Several members of the nine-person City Council said they were reluctantly voting in favor of the smaller tax because there were not enough votes to override a mayoral veto of the larger tax plan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Fiscal Restraint Is Jerry Brown\u2019s Thing. Will It Follow Him Into Retirement?", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.It\u2019s a problem most governments can only dream of: too much money. But California \u2014 riding the wave of a booming economy \u2014 is swimming in a surplus: $8.98 billion as of last week.Suddenly, the days of multibillion-dollar deficits and anguished debates about what to cut have given way to a quandary over what to do with all this money. In the process, interesting questions have emerged about what happens after Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, leaves office.Mr. Brown, unlike many Democrats in Sacramento, has been a fiscal moderate. Aware of the historical gyrations in revenue collections, he regularly insists on building up a rainy-day fund so the state has a financial buffer to get it through the next inevitable recession.In this case, $2.6 billion went to the fund, bringing it to $15 billion. \u201cThis is a time to save for our future,\u201d Mr. Brown told reporters in unveiling his latest plans, \u201cnot to make pricey promises we can\u2019t keep.\u201dThere has been grumbling among Democrats, who watched as the state slashed social programs over the years and now want to restore some of them. Mr. Brown proposed spending $359 million to help cities here deal with the homeless crisis, but that sum stands in stark contrast to the $1.5 billion that the cities had asked for.Republicans view the surplus as evidence that California is overtaxing citizens: They want the money returned.When Mr. Brown leaves, the big question is whether the fiscal prudence will follow him to his retirement ranch once one of the two likely Democrats seeking to replace him \u2014 Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor, and Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles \u2014 takes office. (There is little chance a Republican will win.)Here\u2019s one interesting take: Raphael J. Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles, said that Mr. Brown had managed to float above these political pressures because his Democratic base gave him leeway and Republicans considered him friendlier than most Democrats.\u201cThe change after Jerry leaves won\u2019t be that individual candidates might or might not hold the line against either spending or tax cuts,\u201d Mr. Sonenshein said, \u201cit\u2019s whether they would be able to rise above the pressures within their parties.\u201cAnd they might argue that Jerry overdid it.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)You\u2019ve probably heard by now that Meghan Markle, a native Angeleno, and Prince Harry are set to tie the knot on Saturday.Joanne Weidman of Los Angeles advised keeping an open mind to couples therapy: \u201cEven if the other thinks everything is fine, if one partner thinks you need help, then you need help.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "College May Not Be Worth It Anymore", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Ruppel Shell writes about science, social justice and the economy.Recent decades have brought agreement that higher education is, if not a cure, then at least a protection against underemployment and the inequality it engenders. In 2012, President Barack Obama called a college degree an \u201ceconomic imperative that every family in America has to be able to afford.\u201dYoung people and their families go into debt because they believe that college will help them in the job market. And on average it does. But this raises a question: Does higher education itself offer that benefit, or are the people who earn bachelor\u2019s degrees already positioned to get higher-paying jobs?If future income was determined mainly by how much education people received, then you would assume that some higher education would be better than none. But this is often not the case.People who have dropped out of college \u2014 about 40 percent of all who attend \u2014 earn only a bit more than do people with only a high school education: $38,376 a year versus $35,256. For many, that advantage is barely enough to cover their student loan debt.And not all have even that advantage: African-American college dropouts on average earn less than do white Americans with only a high school degree. Meanwhile, low-income students of all races are far more likely to drop out of college than are wealthier students. Even with scholarships or free tuition, these students struggle with hefty fees and living costs, and they pay the opportunity cost of taking courses rather than getting a job.The value of a college degree also varies depending on the institution bestowing it. The tiny minority of students who attend elite colleges do far better on average than those who attend nonselective ones. Disturbingly, black and Hispanic students are significantly less likely than are white and Asian students to attend elite colleges, even when family income is controlled for. That is, students from wealthy black and Hispanic families have a lower chance of attending an elite college than do students from middle-class white families.It\u2019s a cruel irony that a college degree is worth less to people who most need a boost: those born poor. This revelation was made by the economists Tim Bartik and Brad Hershbein. Using a body of data, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which includes 50 years of interviews with 18,000 Americans, they were able to follow the lives of children born into poor, middle-class and wealthy families.But for those born into poverty, the results were far less impressive. College graduates born poor earned on average only slightly more than did high school graduates born middle class. And over time, even this small \u201cdegree bonus\u201d ebbed away, at least for men: By middle age, male college graduates raised in poverty were earning less than nondegree holders born into the middle class. The scholars conclude, \u201cIndividuals from poorer backgrounds may be encountering a glass ceiling that even a bachelor\u2019s degree does not break.\u201dThe authors don\u2019t speculate as to why this is the case, but it seems that students from poor backgrounds have less access to very high-income jobs in technology, finance and other fields. Class and race surely play a role.Part of the reason is oversupply. Technology increased the demand for educated workers, but that demand has been consistently outpaced by the number of people \u2014 urged on by everyone from teachers to presidents \u2014 prepared to meet it.No other nation punishes the \u201cuneducated\u201d as harshly as the United States. Nearly 30 percent of Americans without a high school diploma live in poverty, compared to 5 percent with a college degree, and we infer that this comes from a lack of education. But in 28 other wealthy developed countries, a lack of a high school diploma increases the probability of poverty by less than 5 percent. In these nations, a dearth of education does not predestine citizens for poverty.It shouldn\u2019t here, either: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer than 20 percent of American jobs actually require a bachelor\u2019s degree. By 2026, the bureau estimates that this proportion will rise, but only to 25 percent.Why do employers demand a degree for jobs that don\u2019t require them? Because they can.What all this suggests is that the college-degree premium may really be a no-college-degree penalty. It\u2019s not necessarily college that gives people the leverage to build a better working life, it\u2019s that not having a degree decreases whatever leverage they might otherwise have.This distinction is more than semantic. It is key to understanding the growing chasm between educational attainment and life prospects. For most of us, it\u2019s not our education that determines our employment trajectory but rather where that education positions us in relation to others.None of this is to suggest that higher education is not desirable: I\u2019ve encouraged my own children to take that path.

{"Headline": "Trump Trade Officials Will Present a Hard Line in China, but Internally They Are Divided", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Top Trump administration officials are arriving in China this week armed with tough talk about Beijing\u2019s need to change its trade practices. But within the United States delegation there is little consensus about what concessions America should try to extract \u2014 or the best approach to getting the Chinese to agree.Instead of a single point person with a clear set of demands, the White House is sending six trade and economic officials with differing ideas on how to approach China and who are deeply divided over the desirability of a trade war. Some advocate goals that do not align with what the American business community wants or what China is prepared to offer, raising questions about how productive a dialogue will be, and whether talks can prevent the world\u2019s two largest economies from tipping into a deeper conflict.What unites the group is a view that China\u2019s trade practices are unacceptable and that Washington will now call the shots.\u201cThe discussions will take place in Beijing, the decisions will take place in Washington,\u201d said Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser and longtime China critic who is among those traveling to Beijing.China experts have said the trip is very likely to be more of a listening session, in which administration officials will wait to hear what the Chinese will offer. But without agreement or a clear list of goals from the American side, the Chinese may try to mollify officials by meeting only the most modest of their trade demands. That could include agreeing to buy additional American products to lower the trade surplus with the United States, reviving old economic dialogues between the countries, or cracking open some domestic markets to foreign competition \u2014 but only those where Chinese companies are already securely dominant.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.Other members of the delegation, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, who heads the National Economic Council, appear more inclined to strike deals that would accomplish the president\u2019s goal of reducing the gap between what America imports from China and what it sells to the country, and thus head off the risk of an escalating trade war. Also going on the trip are Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who has previously seemed receptive to striking deals; Everett Eissenstat, an experienced trade adviser; and Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador to China.Yukon Huang, a China scholar at the Carnegie Institute, called the group an \u201cideologically hybrid team\u201d with competing views about what is really plaguing the U.S.-China relationship.\u201cIt\u2019s a mixture between two camps: one focused on trade issues, one focused on technology wars,\u201d Mr. Huang said. \u201cThe reason it is such, and we don\u2019t have a game plan, is the issues aren\u2019t well understood.\u201dAmong the concerns are a range of practices, including barriers to entry, subsidies and regulations that pressure American companies to hand over sensitive trade secrets, which China uses to make national champions of its homegrown firms. These tactics have enabled the Chinese to dominate global industries like steel, aluminum and solar panels, and American trade advisers say they are currently tipping the playing field for industries of the future, including semiconductors, robotics, cloud computing, electric vehicles and biotechnology.Speaking at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington on Tuesday, Mr. Lighthizer said that the United States had nearly a third of the world\u2019s high-tech business, followed by China, and that China\u2019s trade practices were imperiling the economic future of the United States.\u201cI\u2019m always hoping but not always hopeful,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said about the prospect of success from the talks.Many American industry leaders support Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s efforts to expand access to Chinese sectors that are restricted to American companies and protect American intellectual property from theft and coercion \u2014 longstanding complaints of American business leaders about China\u2019s tactics. But they are wary of the administration\u2019s approach to resolving longstanding problems.Some business leaders fear that the Trump administration may simply accept Chinese offers to lower the trade surplus by buying more American goods and open up segments of the economy that are already mature, like financial services, electronic payments or the auto sector. On the other hand, they worry about the economic damage from a trade war if the anti-China wing of the delegation wins the internal debate and follows through with its threats.Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Tuesday that there were \u201cserious, growing and legitimate challenges\u201d about Chinese practices, but he also cautioned against the effect of a tit-for-tat tariff war.\u201cWe are deeply concerned that the proposed tariffs list and escalating tariff threats from the administration will not effectively advance our shared goal of changing these harmful Chinese practices,\u201d he said.Analysts continue to warn of potential risks to economic growth in the United States if administration officials cannot negotiate a quick resolution with the Chinese, and the tariffs go into effect. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note this week that new investment restrictions on China, which the administration plans to outline soon, could also rattle investors.\u201cSome additional market-disruptive policy moves regarding U.S.-China trade seem likely,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Alec Phillips wrote in the research note, which played down the odds of success in this week\u2019s talks. \u201cWe believe a substantial breakthrough at this meeting is unlikely as the issues the U.S. has raised \u2014 intellectual property policies, technology transfer, and the \u2018Made in China 2025\u2019 strategy, in particular \u2014 are not the type of technical trade issues that can be resolved quickly.\u201dThe National Association of Manufacturers, one of the most influential business lobbying groups in Washington, has been pressing Mr. Trump and his economic team to open negotiations with the Chinese on a free-trade agreement, an ambitious move that many trade experts doubt would bear fruit, given the past struggles of American negotiators who have tried to secure far more limited agreements with China.Jay Timmons, the president of the manufacturers\u2019 group, urged Mr. Trump in a letter this year to \u201cconsider pursuing a truly modern, innovative and comprehensive bilateral trade agreement with China that wholly restructures our economic relationship.\u201d The group\u2019s vice president for international economic affairs, Linda Menghetti Dempsey, told a congressional subcommittee in April that such an effort would be \u201cat once both a radical idea and, in our estimation, the most pragmatic and effective way forward\u201d on trade with China.Manufacturers have discussed the plan directly with Mr. Kudlow and with Vice President Mike Pence. Proponents say they believe the idea could appeal to Mr. Trump\u2019s preference for bilateral trade agreements and his confidence in his negotiation skills.However, White House officials have given no public indication that they are considering such a negotiation. Mr. Lighthizer, Mr. Navarro and other proponents of a harder line against China have argued that the Chinese tend to use such dialogues as a delaying tactic, and that past trade negotiations with them have not been productive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lessons From Rust-Belt Cities That Kept Their Sheen", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneSt. Cloud, Minn., might look at first blush like one of America\u2019s all-too-familiar ailing industrial cities, struggling to hang on to jobs as its companies skip town.And yet despite the loss of its fifth-largest employer, the sleepy city straddling the Mississippi 65 miles northwest of Minneapolis doesn\u2019t at all fit the tale of woe that spread across the Midwest over the last 50 years.If anything, St. Cloud and nearby communities in Stearns County provide the setting for a counternarrative to the story of industrial America\u2019s protracted decline. Walloped by the forces that hit every old manufacturing enclave \u2014 from globalization and automation to a rising demand for skills \u2014 the area sustained its prosperity through a mix of the right investments, favorable geography and sheer serendipity.Since 1970, manufacturers in the county have added 5,000 jobs, for a total of 11,600. Total employment has tripled, to 90,000. The population has grown by more than half. And the median income of the county\u2019s households rose 20 percent from 1980 to 2016, after inflation, to $57,728 \u2014 a smidgen above the national median.\u201cWhen Electrolux announced it was leaving, other employers were saying, \u2018When can we get at that labor?\u2019\u201d said King Banaian, dean of the School of Public Affairs at St. Cloud State University. \u201cThere\u2019s a tug of war going on, and workers are getting higher wages and performance incentives and bonuses and so on.\u201dThe problem is that there are too few places like St. Cloud: Grand Rapids in Michigan\u2019s Kent County, where employment more than doubled since 1970; Green Bay in Brown County, Wis., where it almost tripled.Formerly vibrant industrial cities across the Midwest and Northeast today present a landscape of high unemployment and opioid addiction \u2014 stagnant communities of old-timers in the shadow of rusting industrial hulks, angry at a political system that has ignored them and at an economy that has left them behind.Can they learn anything from places like Stearns County? Its experience may offer some tips for its struggling peers: Smart industrial zoning can give an edge to local companies; higher-education institutions can serve as anchors for economic development. But its most salient advantages come from its location and industrial mix, more to do with serendipity than policy. A lot of it, Mr. Banaian told me, may have been \u201cplain darn good luck.\u201dUsing the mix of industries in each county, they projected how many jobs it would have today if employment in each industry had grown at the same pace as in the nation as a whole. Seventy of the original 185 had significantly fewer jobs in 2016 than they would have had if they had followed the national trend. The other 115 almost matched or outpaced the national trend.This is an imperfect measure of success. In many successful counties that experienced employment growth, workers nonetheless suffered lower wages and declining living standards. Still, on the whole these places did much better in terms of productivity and household income growth, too.Unfortunately for the laggards, their edge may be difficult to replicate.The picture in the South and the West is brighter. Fifty-five of the 63 urban industrial counties that Mr. Berube and Ms. Murray counted in the South in 1970, as well as all 24 of those in the West, saw jobs growth that was at least about on par with the national trend over the next 46 years. But their experience is of limited use to the North and the East. In 1970, these counties were smaller and younger. They were building an industrial base as the nation\u2019s economic footprint was shifting from manufacturing to service, embracing technology and globalization.Desegregation in the South and immigration in the West added a pool of productive workers, while investment flowed in to take advantage of their cheaper labor force and the virtual absence of unions. \u201cJobs were leaving Michigan, Indiana and Ohio and going to Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee,\u201d Mr. Berube observed. In the more successful industrial counties, construction employment doubled, on average, from 1970 to 2016, as they absorbed new populations.The old industrial cities that developed around the Great Lakes in the first half of the 20th century have a different story. Population shrank on average. Construction employment did not grow. Only six of the 35 urban industrial counties scattered across the Northeast in 1970 held their own or gained employment compared with the national trend over the next 46 years. Of 63 urban industrial cities in the Midwest in 1970, only 30 managed the feat.Macon County, Ill. \u2014 home of Decatur, \u201cthe pride of the prairie\u201d\u2014 was an agribusiness hub and steel town that also housed mammoth production facilities for the likes of Caterpillar and Firestone Tire and Rubber. But it lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs from 1970 to 2016. Total jobs grew by less than half a percent over 46 years.Employment in Racine, Wis., increased by 40 percent in that period. But had job growth followed national patterns it would have grown at twice that pace. Median household incomes fell a whopping 14 percent.These older industrial cities that had helped build the American middle class were by 1970 riven by conflicts between management and labor, between cities and suburbs, and between blacks and whites. \u201cThe tension from segregation in the Midwest and North was a bigger deal,\u201d Mr. Berube told me.On top of all that, their old, heavy industries were particularly vulnerable. For instance, 17 of the 22 counties in the Northeast and Midwest where steel accounted for a disproportionate share of jobs in 1970 stumbled on their way to the present.Can Decatur or Racine learn from Green Bay, Grand Rapids or St. Cloud? Perhaps the best example to follow would be to invest in education. Places with better-educated workers were generally the ones that managed the economic transformation of the last 50 years more successfully. In 1980, 18.5 percent of adults over 25 in these counties had at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, compared with only 15.1 percent in the counties that stumbled. For Midwestern states like Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri, which are starving many of their public universities of funds, the takeaway would be: Stop.In the end, a lot comes down to luck. St. Cloud isn\u2019t just on the Mississippi. It is on Interstate 94, U.S. 10 and the BNSF Railway \u2014 putting it within reach of many markets. What\u2019s more, it produces things like trailers, buses and snowmobile engines, which for some reason are not China\u2019s or Mexico\u2019s forte. Its service industries \u2014 a growing part of its economic base \u2014 thrive off the underserved rural towns in the western half of the state. Its medical center alone employs 10,000 people.If the successful industrial counties of the Midwest have a lesson for their less successful peers, it must be that they can\u2019t stop evolving. \u201cIt is hard for communities to become something else,\u201d Mr. Berube said. That is precisely what declining industrial cities are being repeatedly called to do. And there is nothing to say that communities that successfully transformed themselves over the past 50 years will succeed again.Right now, St. Cloud\u2019s main problem may be a labor shortage. But already Mr. Banaian is worried about the internet. St. Cloud has a large retail and hospitality industry. People in the western part of the state will come into town to shop and eat and perhaps stay for the weekend. The internet, however, is putting many retailers out of business. \u201cThat part is going away,\u201d Mr. Banaian said.An earlier version of this column misstated the value of a tax incentive that attracted Electrolux to South Carolina. According to a state estimate cited by the company, it is worth $73 million over 32 years; it is not worth $250 million.Advertisement"}

In Humboldt County, opioid-related overdose rates are five times higher than in the rest of the state. Like rural areas around the country, the North Coast lacks sufficient treatment options to deal with opioid addiction.Today, it is increasingly difficult to find community members in Eureka who have not been touched by a surge of heroin use in the region. People have either lost loved ones, watched neighbors shrink into their addictions or come across the wave of needle litter left behind on sidewalks and in parks.Drug use in Humboldt County has many layers. Meth has been a scourge in rural California for many years, and because it is often shot intravenously, the transition to heroin has been too easy for many.

{"Headline": "City Ballet\u2019s \u2018Robbins 100\u2019: Making Music Theatrical", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookAll too soon, New York City Ballet\u2019s \u201cRobbins 100\u201d season is over. Its 20 ballets proved hurdles that the dancers and musicians were happy to leap over in glowing form \u2014 a glow shared by the ballets themselves. Jerome Robbins, even in his most cartoon-fun or most small-scale creations, has largeness of spirit.He also has astonishing economy. Few people speak of his choreographic musicality, partly because he shared this company and this house with George Balanchine, whose acute response to music is so celebrated. Yet there are many ways to stage a score; Balanchine himself did not employ one method alone when responding to music.Balanchine specialized in rhythmically watertight constructions that exist in brilliantly close counterpoint with their scores. But Robbins often makes us notice which parts of the score he leaves undanced, letting them create atmosphere. \u201cDances at a Gathering,\u201d his most endlessly ambiguous and rewarding work, has more than one passage in which Chopin\u2019s piano music is like the weather in the distance or the memories surrounding the empty space onstage.The whole Balanchine motto of \u201cSee the music, hear the dance\u201d is nonsense anyway. Even in the first movement of \u201cConcerto Barocco,\u201d you\u2019re not really \u201cseeing\u201d Bach\u2019s double violin concerto: The difference between the solo violins and the ballerinas following them is rhythmically large. In these City Ballet performances, the freedom of Robbins\u2019s departures from the details of his music felt like the paintings in which C\u00e9zanne leaves parts of the canvas magisterially unpainted, or like Matisse cutouts.As Frederick Ashton used to say, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you put into a ballet; it\u2019s what you leave out.\u201d Few choreographers were more audacious than Robbins in these good deeds of omission. You can pull off such master strokes effectively only if what you\u2019re doing has imagination and vision. Almost invariably, Robbins does.I\u2019m glad that City Ballet continues to program its vivid \u201cSee the Music\u201d lecture-demonstrations, in which a conductor talks us through parts of a score, with examples played by the orchestra. This is invariably illuminating about the music, though it rarely addresses how the ballet answers it. But at the matinee on Saturday, when Andrew Litton, the company\u2019s musical director, spoke about Ravel\u2019s Piano Concerto in G itself, he also drew Robbins\u2019s ballet \u201cIn G Major\u201d (1975) into his discussion.Mr. Litton recalled how, as a Juilliard student pianist around 1982, he had gone to City Ballet because he was dating a girl in its orchestra. \u201cIn G Major\u201d amazed him: How had he never encountered this marvelous piano concerto before? And he was astounded by the way the forward-and-backward steps for the ballerina in the second movement answered both Ravel\u2019s rhythm and melody. (\u201cSeveral steps forward, a few backward, like most of our relationships,\u201d Mr. Litton said.)When Robbins was alive, his ballets were important stages of the journey for most dancers in City Ballet; he was a famously inspiring coach, and he was quick to single out newcomers for attention. Without him, that process continues in his ballets. Lauren Lovette \u2014 who for years danced with an ingratiating quality that verged on sentimentality \u2014 has come, with just a touch more strength to underpin her delivery, into full bloom: She\u2019s the most hilariously blithe heroine \u201cThe Concert\u201d has had in years, and she\u2019s all breeze and fragrance as Spring in \u201cThe Four Seasons.\u201dIn \u201cDances at a Gathering,\u201d Ms. Lovette, Tiler Peck and Abi Stafford are all like youth remembered, while Ashley Bouder, so often too knowing in Balanchine, is admirably evocative as the woman in green, who dances one of the ballets two memory solos. The soloist Erica Pereira is another who, after years of looking merely facile, has started to come into her own (in her case, since the fall): A heightening of stylistic rigor has helped her to display an engaging sweetness. I loved her brio in \u201cInterplay\u201d and as Winter in \u201cFour Seasons.\u201dAnd a corps dancer, Sebastian Villarini-Velez, has suddenly become an important player. In the last nine months, he has blazed in two roles by Peter Martins (the Jester in \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d Tybalt in \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d). This May he was part of a new cast of sailors on shore leave that made \u201cFancy Free\u201d young again. The other two members of his crew were Harrison Coll and Roman Mejia, already winning dancers who keep broadening their range.Dozens of other dancers this spring renewed or deepened my affection for Robbins. You couldn\u2019t miss the release he gave the company. Who wants \u201cAntique Epigraphs\u201d to wait another 10 years till its next return? The mysterious poetry of this all-female ballet to Debussy \u2014 conjuring essences of bygone eastern Mediterranean cultures \u2014 is another example of Robbins\u2019s mastery of making music theatrical.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Tax Cuts Leave States in a Bind", "Date": "2018-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe federal tax overhaul cut taxes for millions of American families and businesses. But the law also had an unintended effect: raising the state-tax bite in nearly every state that has an income tax.Now, governors and state legislators are contending with how to adjust their own tax codes to shield their residents from paying more or, in some cases, whether to apply any of the unexpected revenue windfall to other priorities instead.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which President Trump signed into law in December, did not directly affect state budgets. It cut federal tax rates, but also made other changes that mean more income will be subject to taxation. Because most states use federal definitions of income and have not adjusted their own rates, the federal changes will have big consequences for both state budgets and taxpayers.\u201cResidents of the majority of states would experience an unlegislated tax increase,\u201d said Jared Walczak, an analyst with the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank.In Minnesota, the state estimates that residents could pay more than $400 million in additional state taxes in the next fiscal year because of the new federal law. That has set off a fight over how to respond. The state\u2019s Democratic governor wants to give most of that money back to Minnesotans through tax cuts aimed at low- and moderate-income families; the Republican-controlled legislature wants broader-based tax cuts. Both sides say they must resolve the issue before the legislative session ends May 21.Apart from the nine states with no broad-based income tax, nearly every state will face a similar decision. Almost all of the states base their tax codes in some way on federal definitions of income, before applying their own adjustments and deductions and setting their own tax rates.The federal tax overhaul, which eliminated or capped several deductions and exemptions, effectively broadened what counts as income for some families. Previously, for example, a married couple with three children earning $70,000 might have been taxed on only about $36,000 of that income, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group. The tax law, however, eliminated the so-called personal exemption and made other changes, which could increase this family\u2019s taxable income to about $46,000.At the federal level, those changes were more than offset for most families by lower tax rates and an increased child tax credit. In the example of a married couple with three children, the family\u2019s federal tax bill would be lowered by more than $2,000 under the law. At the state level, however, the changes leave families owing tax on a larger share of their income, without the reduced rates or new credits to soften the blow.A handful of states have already taken action, in some cases using the extra revenue from the federal law as lubrication for deal-making. Colorado, for example, took advantage of its estimated $200 million in extra revenue to pass a budget that included extra funding for roads, public education and school security. Idaho, on the other hand, moved quickly to return the revenue windfall to residents through tax cuts.The challenge is especially acute in Minnesota because its tax code is closely tied to the federal definitions.The Minnesota Department of Revenue estimates that if the state tax code incorporates the federal change in calculating taxable income, 870,000 Minnesota families will pay more for the 2018 tax year, by an average of $489 per person.In theory, Minnesota could try to maintain its status quo by simply leaving its taxes linked to the previous federal definitions. But that would force taxpayers to calculate their income under two different systems.\u201cIf we do nothing, then it becomes very difficult for our citizens to file taxes,\u201d said Roger Chamberlain, a Republican state senator who heads the body\u2019s tax committee.Business groups have criticized the governor\u2019s proposal, which they argue would make Minnesota less competitive. Some progressive groups say the state should go further, using the extra revenue generated by the federal law to fund a paid family-leave program or childhood savings accounts.\u201cThis is exactly the kind of thing you could use to start the core investment of a program like that,\u201d said Chris Conry, strategic campaigns director for TakeAction Minnesota, a liberal advocacy group. \u201cYou could give every kid born in Minnesota $500 at birth.\u201dSimilar debates are playing out in statehouses across the country, in a few different ways. In some states, the state tax code automatically incorporates changes to federal law; for those states, doing nothing probably means an automatic tax increase on residents unless their legislatures take action.In other states, including Minnesota, such updates are not automatic. So legislatures must pass so-called conformity bills that adopt some or all of the federal changes, or else leave residents to contend with possibly conflicting tax systems.But a handful of states, including Minnesota, base their tax codes on federal taxable income, Line 43 on the 1040 form. And what goes on between those two lines is where most of the changes passed by Congress will be felt, resulting in a higher taxable income for many families. (A few states apply a hybrid of the two methods.)Even in states that are less affected, failing to adapt their tax codes to the federal law could make it hard for residents to figure out what they owe \u2014 and, in some cases, force them to pay more. The longer states wait, the less time residents, businesses and state tax officials have to adapt to the new rules before next year\u2019s filing season.\u201cInaction becomes action this time,\u201d said Richard C. Auxier, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center. \u201cPeople\u2019s taxes will change, states\u2019 revenues will change.\u201dSeveral factors are complicating the issue for states. Congress passed its tax overhaul late in the year and with minimal debate, giving states relatively little time to assess the effects and plan a response. Even now, the full impact on state budgets is not clear, meaning legislatures are deciding how to take advantage of a revenue stream that could fall short of estimates. In addition, most of the changes to the individual tax code expire after several years, further muddling states\u2019 plans.Moreover, the tax debate is hitting as state budgets are strained by rising health care and pension costs, among other factors. Those strains could worsen in coming years if the federal government cuts back funding \u2014 perhaps because of deficits caused, in part, by the tax law itself.And states, unlike the federal government, generally cannot plug budget holes by running deficits. That makes the unexpected revenue from the tax law a fiscal temptation.\u201cFor states, this is about as good as it\u2019s going to get,\u201d said Nicholas Johnson of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. \u201cWe\u2019re overdue for a recession, which always hit state budgets hard.\u201dState officials, however, have mostly avoided calling for using the extra tax revenue to increase spending. Much of the base-broadening in the federal law comes from the elimination of the personal exemption, which primarily benefited families with multiple children. Few politicians want to advocate raising taxes on parents.\u201cThat\u2019s your windfall, a tax increase on large families,\u201d Mr. Auxier said.An earlier version of a chart with this article misstated how Idaho, Oregon and Vermont define income when calculating state taxes. Idaho and Oregon use the federal government\u2019s definition of \u201ctaxable income, not adjusted gross income. Vermont uses adjusted gross income, not taxable income.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ivanka Trump Wins China Trademarks, Then Her Father Vows to Save ZTE", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China this month awarded Ivanka Trump seven new trademarks across a broad collection of businesses, including books, housewares and cushions.Coincidence? Well, probably.The most recent slew of trademarks appear to have been granted along the same timeline as Ms. Trump\u2019s previous requests, experts said. But more broadly, they said, Ms. Trump\u2019s growing portfolio of trademarks in China and the family\u2019s business interests there raises questions about whether Chinese officials are giving the Trump family extra consideration that they otherwise might not get.These critics say the foreign governments that do business with Ms. Trump know they are dealing with the president\u2019s daughter \u2014 a person who also works in the White House.\u201cOther countries may see the business requests made by his daughter\u2019s company as requests they cannot refuse.\u201dMs. Trump\u2019s representatives have said that there is nothing improper about Ms. Trump\u2019s trademarks and that they prevent individuals from profiting off her name.Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement on Monday that the brand\u2019s protection of trademarks was \u201cin the normal course of business,\u201d especially in countries where trademark infringement was rampant.\u201cWe have recently seen a surge in trademark filings by unrelated third parties trying to capitalize on the name,\u201d Ms. Klem said, \u201cand it is our responsibility to diligently protect our trademark.\u201dChinese trademark officials didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Monday.Just before and after that announcement, Ms. Trump won some long-sought trademarks covering her name in China.Six days before the ZTE announcement, China said it approved five of Ms. Trump\u2019s trademarks, according to data from China\u2019s trademark office. Then, on May 21, China awarded Ms. Trump two more trademarks in snacks, spices and bleaching preparations. In total, Ms. Trump now has 34 trademarks in China that would allow her to capitalize on her brand in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.Experts said the timing appeared to be a coincidence, given how quickly Ms. Trump won her previous trademark requests from the Chinese authorities, though they differed on whether she appeared to receive special treatment.Ms. Trump applied for six of the trademarks in March 2017. She applied for the seventh even earlier, in May 2016. China\u2019s trademark office usually takes up to 18 months to approve trademarks, said Charles Feng, head of the intellectual property division at the law firm East & Concord Partners.\u201cFrom application to registration, this is very fast,\u201d he said.Laura Young, a trademark lawyer at Wang & Wang, said she did not see anything unusual about the timing. She pointed out that under Chinese law, the trademark office should complete its examination of a filing within nine months, and that some of her clients get decisions within a year.\u201cWhen a person is famous, and the examiners say: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve heard of this person,\u2019 it can be decided more quickly than if the examiner is not sure and has to consult others or go to a committee,\u201d Ms. Young said.Mr. Trump himself has more than 100 trademarks in China. Several United States senators have criticized these trademarks, warning it could be a breach of the United States Constitution and that foreign governments could use Mr. Trump\u2019s trademarks to influence foreign policy decisions. Mr. Trump has said he has handed over control of his business to his two adult sons. The Trump Organization has said it has been actively enforcing its intellectual property rights in China for more than a decade to protect its brand from infringers.China\u2019s infamous \u201ctrademark squatters\u201d \u2014 people who register the names of famous brands and people and \u201csquat\u201d on them in the hopes that they can cash in on it \u2014 have flocked to the Trump brand. According to Mr. Feng, there are more than 10 Ivanka trademarks registered by parties not related to Ms. Trump.Some of these include a company in the southern city of Foshan, which has registered \u201cYiwanka,\u201d the Chinese translation of Ivanka, for sanitary pads and tampons. The Nanjing Good Daughter Wine Company, an alcohol maker, has registered Ivanka Trump in English and Chinese.The trademarks are not the only Trump-related deal that took place around the time of Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to save ZTE.Elsie Chen contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Urgent Debate for California Republicans: How to Get Back in the Game", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWHITTIER, Calif. \u2014 For anyone wondering about the state of the Republican Party in California these days, consider this: There may be no Republican candidate for governor or United States senator on the state\u2019s ballot this November.That dispiriting possibility is beginning to sink in for California Republicans, against the backdrop of a divisive debate among its candidates and leaders on how the embattled party can become competitive again in a state where Ronald Reagan was elected twice as governor and that Richard M. Nixon called home.It\u2019s no secret the state\u2019s Republican Party has been in a decline for 20 years. Its challenges have been aggravated by the election of President Trump, as he has pushed tougher policies on such issues as immigration and the environment, running up against strong and often bipartisan sentiment in California.A field of Republican candidates for the United States Senate and governor is struggling against these headwinds as they seek to end a more than 10-year drought and elect a party member to statewide office. Under the California election system, candidates compete in an open, nonpartisan primary on June 5. The two candidates who get the most votes \u2014 regardless of party \u2014 advance to the November general election.If Republicans fall short in capturing one of those two November slots next month, which members of both parties say is a strong possibility, it would apparently be the first election since 1914 where a major party had no candidate in either the race for senator or for governor.Republican hopes of getting a spot on the November ballot suffered another setback on Sunday when party leaders, meeting in San Diego, failed to agree on anyone to endorse in the June primary.\u201cMaybe hitting rock bottom is getting shut out of both state races this year,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former senior adviser to Pete Wilson, a Republican governor. \u201cYou would think that if Republicans are shut out, it will be time for some serious soul-searching.\u201dThe party, if far from the dominant power it was once in California, is still a force. Two of the most powerful Republican members of the congressional leadership represent central California: Kevin McCarthy, a close ally of Mr. Trump, who is in line to become the next speaker should Republicans hold the House this November, and Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House intelligence committee. Both are popular in their districts and wield plenty of influence in Washington.There are pockets of Republican strength across the state \u2014 in Northern California, the Central Valley and some suburbs \u2014 a remnant of when it was dominant statewide.There have been hard-line strains in the California Republican Party for years, centered around law and order, taxes and immigration issues. But this is also a state with a moderate wing.A group of Republicans led by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor, and Chad Mayes, the former Republican Assembly leader, have begun a campaign to move the party to the center, arguing that would make it more competitive by increasing its appeal to independent voters and disaffected Democrats.But that effort has run up against Republican candidates and elected officials who have tied their success to Mr. Trump and his administration\u2019s policies.\u201cArnold Schwarzenegger and Republicans like Mayes are completely wrong,\u201d Travis Allen, a Republican candidate for governor and member of the Assembly, said in an interview. \u201cCalifornian Republicans need to stand up for common sense and the rule of law and the fiscal conservatism that has been sorely lacking in our state for decades. Mayes and Schwarzenegger have done a disservice to every Californian who believes in limited government, respect for the rule of law and fiscal sanity.\u201d\u201cThis is why Republicans have been losing for decades in California,\u201d he said. \u201cThese so-called Republican-lites that are pandering to Democrat policies and politicians are why Californians are now registering as decline-to-state in ever-increasing numbers.\u201dIndeed, the moderate political line being advocated by Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. Mayes is not reflected by any of the limited number of viable Republican candidates for statewide office.The division over the future of the party was on full display the other night at a forum sponsored by the North Orange County Republican Women\u2019s Federated Dinner for Mr. Allen and another Republican candidate for governor, John Cox, a businessman \u2014 the only two Republicans in a very crowded field who appear to have a chance to capture one of the top two spots in the primary.\u201cRaise your hand if you voted for Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Allen said from the stage as most of the hands went up. \u201cIn 2016 we took back our country. In 2018 we are taking back California.\u201dA few moments later, both candidates told the moderator that they firmly supported Mr. Trump\u2019s call to build a wall along the Mexican border. \u201cA border wall should not be controversial at all,\u201d Mr. Cox said. \u201cThat should be the No. 1 thing we do. We have a country to the south of us that is relatively ungoverned now.\u201d\u201cI support the president, by the way, 100 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s president.\u201dMr. Mayes, who was ousted as the Republican leader of the State Assembly after he negotiated a Republican vote-delivering compromise with Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, on legislation to curb greenhouse emissions, said that sentiment threatened to further distance the party from voters.\u201cWe went from having an approach under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush where we loved and cared about people and we went out of our way to make people\u2019s lives were better to this \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality,\u201d he said.\u201cWe have to stop making excuses for not winning in California,\u201d Mr. Mayes added. \u201cWe need to come to grips with reality and understand the electorate in California has changed. We have to go to them. We are not going to win elections until we figure that out.\u201dBut many Republicans echo the concerns being expressed by candidates this campaign season about immigration, as well as their support for Mr. Trump. Jim de Martini, a farmer and local Republican county leader in Stanislaus County, said he thought the president and his policies \u2014 on the economy, immigration and foreign policy \u2014 would resonate for voters here. \u201cHe\u2019s done a great job on the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cTax cuts. Promoting business.\u201dMr. de Martini, reflecting what has historically been a source of Republican strength in the state, said the party should be focusing as well on what he described as overspending and overregulation by Democrats who control the state government.\u201cThe economy is always the big issue because the state of California has been irresponsible in its budget, bankrupting the state, and overregulating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is destroying the state.\u201dThe prospect that there may be no Republican candidate for Senate or governor this November casts both short-term and long-term threats for the party.For this election, it could complicate efforts to draw Republicans to the polls in a year when Democrats are looking to oust as many as seven endangered Republican members of Congress. To try to counter that, Republicans, including Mr. McCarthy, are pushing an initiative for the November ballot to repeal a gasoline tax instituted by Democrats in the Legislature last year. For the long term, it is a reminder of just how little influence the party has statewide. Republicans failed to win a spot on the 2016 ballot for Senate as well.\u201cIt\u2019s important that we start talking about different issues,\u201d said Rocky Chavez, a Republican member of the Assembly who is running for a congressional seat left open by the retirement of Representative Darrell Issa of San Diego County. \u201cThe environment is an important thing in California. That\u2019s not something Republicans always talk about.\u201dBut Mr. Chavez\u2019s argument failed to win him the support of the San Diego County Republican Party and Mr. Issa; it instead backed Diane Harkey, a former member of the Assembly who has, like Mr. Issa, struck a more hardened conservative line.One of the key points of contention with the Republican Party in the state is immigration. It has been a complication for Republicans since California voters passed an initiative pushed by the Republican governor, Pete Wilson, in 1994 to prohibit illegal immigrants from getting state social services. That initiative, which was thrown out in court, was seen as one of the critical reasons for the party\u2019s decline, as the Latino population in this state has continued to grow, and as California became more Democratic.Given the changing political and demographic tides, many Republicans have, since 1994, sought to move away from the tougher immigration positions in an effort to expand the party\u2019s appeal. But Mr. Trump pushed immigration back to the front burner \u2014 and Democrats responded by passing so-called sanctuary state laws intended to hamper efforts by federal immigration officers.\u201cThe biggest issue is the sanctuary state thing,\u201d said Mr. Cox, the businessman running for governor. \u201cThe politicians seem to be favoring criminals more than law-abiding citizens.\u201dFinally, Mr. Trump himself has emerged as a critical issue as Republicans try to chart a path forward. Mr. Trump lost California by nearly four million votes, and he remains consistently unpopular overall. But he is popular with Republican primary voters, and candidates have lined up behind him.\u201cI\u2019m at a forum a few weeks ago and I\u2019m listening to these Democrats ripping him up,\u201d Mr. Cox said. \u201cI said, \u2018Donald Trump didn\u2019t create the housing crisis. Donald Trump didn\u2019t create a drought. Donald Trump didn\u2019t raise your taxes to ridiculous heights. You are sitting here making Donald Trump the issue.\u2019 The issue on the ballot in 2018 is not going to be Donald Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Corner of Senegal, a Victory Over Malaria", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesMs. Yee, an occasional contributor to Fixes, is\u00a0a former correspondent for The Financial Times.RICHARD TOLL, Senegal \u2014 Thousands of seasonal migrant workers flock to Richard Toll, a dusty city in northern Senegal near the Mauritania border. They come for work at the Senegalese Sugar Company, the country\u2019s second-largest employer after the government. In addition to their skills, they may also bring malaria.This flow of migrant workers once made Richard Toll a malaria hot spot in Senegal. But a partnership between government and a private company has had remarkable results fighting the disease.Migrant workers make up about half of the Senegalese Sugar Company\u2019s 7,000 workers. They work in factories and lush, irrigated fields in an area that is otherwise arid. They come from nearby countries like Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Mali, as well as a tropical part of Senegal called Casamance, all areas where mosquito-borne malaria is more common.April 25 was World Malaria Day. Worldwide deaths from the disease have dropped by nearly half since 2000, but progress has now stalled.\u201cImpossible,\u201d Dr. Gassama remembered thinking. \u201cYou can leave.\u201dAfter many attempts at agreement, the program eventually took shape. It worked immediately. Over the next six months the company reported a total of 24 malaria cases \u2014 about what it used to experience in one day. And in 2016 there were only 29 cases for the entire year \u2014 all of them brought by migrant workers.Now Dr. Gassama, who has worked for the company for more than 30 years, gladly admits that he was wrong. The cost of treating malaria has plummeted. The company used to spend $23,000 on anti-malaria medicine over six months. Now it spends $300 over the same period.Yoro Diagne is a factory supervisor who has worked at the sugar company for some 20 years. He has had malaria twice and missed at least a week of work both times. \u201cBefore, I knew many people with malaria,\u201d he observed. \u201cNow there aren\u2019t many.\u201dAnd in the town of Richard Toll, there were fewer than 200 malaria cases in 2015, down from more than 1,300 in 2012, according to Dr. Coumba Diouf, the district\u2019s chief government medical officer.How was this result achieved? Partnership between government and the company was critical, as well as focusing on prevention. The new program showed the sugar company how to start screening seasonal workers for malaria as soon as they registered to work.\u201cTesting of all new workers in the sugar company allows us to prevent malaria transmission in Richard Toll,\u201d said Dr. Yakou Dieye, the scientific coordinator of PATH\u2019s malaria programs in Senegal. New health surveys also recorded workers\u2019 travel histories in the previous two months and contact information like their phone numbers and where they lived.New database software was introduced, as well as systematic checks for doctors and nurses to enforce data collection. Previously, Dr. Gassama acknowledged, \u201cdata and supervision was not as strict. We didn\u2019t respect protocols.\u201dIn addition, the company was using only older malaria tests that required lab work to analyze blood samples. Results took hours, sometimes days. When they switched to new rapid-testing kits supplied by the national program, results became available in about 15 minutes. The tests \u201cdemocratized the health system,\u201d said Souleymane Niang, head of the company clinic\u2019s laboratory. \u201cIt was a revolution.\u201dRapid malaria testing also let doctors treat other ailments more effectively. Before, it was common for doctors to diagnose any kind of fever as malaria. Now \u201cif we know it\u2019s not malaria, we can manage other diseases,\u201d said Dr. Armand Nbaye, a malaria specialist who has worked at the sugar company for more than 18 years.Before 2011, a worker with malaria simply got free treatment from the company clinic. But under the new program, more steps are taken. The company notifies the local government health office about positive malaria cases. Then health workers test everyone in a sick worker\u2019s village. Anyone with malaria gets free treatment from health workers, and severe or questionable cases are referred to clinics. In recent years, health workers have begun using smartphones to record data.The government, health workers and the company hold weekly and monthly meetings to discuss their findings. Centralizing and coordinating information has made it easier to see patterns and locate malaria trouble spots.The company also began spraying insecticide inside factories at night and selling inexpensive insecticide-treated bed nets, to supplement free government bed nets for pregnant women and young children.At first, Dr. Gassama resisted the program because its objectives seemed at odds with those of the company. For example, he was reluctant to give sick workers five days to recover from malaria and wanted them back at work sooner. But the program staff persuaded him that letting workers fully recover would boost the company\u2019s productivity.The company unexpectedly benefited too. At first, its management was unaware of the new malaria program because it fell completely under Dr. Gassama\u2019s direction. When it was surprised to see the sharp fall in absenteeism, the company asked what sparked it \u2014 and eventually gave Dr. Gassama and the clinic an award.One important factor in the success was that volunteer community health workers, trained by both the government and PATH, also were checking for malaria symptoms in villages. They brought health advice to villagers, teaching them the importance of preventing stagnation of water, which allows mosquitoes to breed, and demonstrating how to hang bed nets. PATH also aired messages about malaria over local radio and staged plays to convey messages to people with low literacy.Neue Oulimata Sene is a mother of five and a community health worker trained by PATH. She visits families at their homes to look for malaria symptoms and risk factors. Senegal is a Muslim country where women often take only traditional domestic roles. But Ms. Sene said people were open to her visits because she was known in the community and trusted.Raising awareness about malaria with influential local leaders and village chiefs was also of critical importance. One such chief, Djiby Demba Diery Sow, acts as his village\u2019s registrar and de facto mayor. Seated on the floor of his thatch-roofed home one day, Mr. Sow said all new residents to his area must visit him before moving in. Sure enough, within moments, two new workers at the sugar company entered Mr. Sow\u2019s hut to get his signature for their residence cards.Decades ago, there were many deaths from malaria and people were too ill to work, Mr. Sow remembered. People knew little about health and hygiene. They thought malaria was spread through direct contact with infected patients. \u201cWe had no clear idea about the disease. I was surprised to learn that such a little animal was so harmful,\u201d Mr. Sow said about mosquitoes. \u201cBecause of the district\u2019s involvement, we have more information about malaria. We know the measures they need to take when they have it.\u201dThe new program also trained local pharmacists to use rapid malaria tests. One such pharmacist, Mamadou Konate, remembered the days when it was common for pharmacists to give malaria medication without confirming that a patient was positive. Now, he said, if a test is positive, he refers patients to a clinic for treatment.Because of these efforts, people in the region are healthier \u2014 and more prosperous. Dr. Diaw, the health economist, remembered feeling resigned as a child to the inevitability of malaria\u2019s toll on health and life itself. When he entered college in Dakar, Senegal\u2019s capital, he learned also about the disease\u2019s devastating economic and social impact.\u201cMore than once, my entire community could not harvest its crops because of illness, which resulted in people sinking further into poverty, consequently devastating the area\u2019s economy,\u201d he recalled. \u201cNow I hardly ever receive a malaria patient. My own children don\u2019t even know what it feels like to be sick from malaria.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the scientific coordinator of PATH\u2019s malaria programs in Senegal. The coordinator is Yakou Dieye, not Richard Dieye.Amy Yee (@amyyeewrites) is a journalist who has written for The New York Times, The Economist, The Wall Street Journal and NPR.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bond Market Indicates Doubt About Trump\u2019s Economic Targets", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs a candidate, President Trump said he would increase United States economic growth to 4 percent annually \u2014 and in one debate even added, \u201cI think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.\u201dOnce he was in the White House, his administration revised those projections lower, saying its approach \u201cmeans sustained 3 percent economic growth.\u201dAfter the economy grew by 2.3 percent in 2017, investors in some of the world\u2019s largest markets are betting that the United States will continue to fall short of the White House goal.The Federal Reserve has started raising short-term interest rates to reflect the economy\u2019s recovery, but longer-term rates \u2014 over which the Fed traditionally has far less influence \u2014 have not moved nearly as much. To many in the bond markets, that suggests investors think little has changed about long-term growth prospects.\u201cThey\u2019re not expecting growth to move up to 3 percent on a sustained basis,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of Macropolicy Perspectives, an economic consulting firm. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking for inflation to break out in any meaningful way on a sustained basis. It\u2019s not ominous. But it does sort of confirm that investors are still seeing the world in that way.\u201dThat does not mean the United States is about to enter a recession. By most measures, the economy is in fairly good shape as the current expansion \u2014 the second-longest on record \u2014 stretches into its ninth year. At 3.9 percent, unemployment hasn\u2019t been this low since 2000. Corporate profits are strong. Manufacturing activity has picked up.But with rates in Fed-sensitive short-term government bond markets rising while longer-term rates are relatively flat, the gap between them has narrowed. And the plotting of those data points, known as the yield curve, occupies an outsize space in the minds of those who consider the markets a crucial barometer of economic health.The gap between short-term and long-term rates tends to shrink \u2014 a phenomenon known as flattening \u2014 whenever the Federal Reserve begins lifting interest rates, which the Fed started doing in December 2015. Over the last year, the gap between interest rates on 10-year and two-year Treasuries flattened from more than 1 percentage point to less than half a percentage point, its lowest point in more than a decade.But as the yield curve flattens, long-term interest rates run the risk of falling below short-term rates, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve. And when the yield curve inverts, as it did most recently in 2006-7, it amounts to an economic warning from the financial markets to watch out: Recession is on the way.\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but we\u2019re getting progressively closer,\u201d said Steven Abrahams, head of investment strategy at the broker dealer Amherst Pierpont. \u201cAnd I think we will get closer, faster than the market currently anticipates.\u201dIn a speech last month, the San Francisco Federal Reserve president, John Williams, described an inverted yield curve as \u201ca powerful signal of recessions.\u201dIn part, that\u2019s because the yield curve is more than just an economic indicator. It actually helps determine decisions that are crucial to the health of the American economy. That\u2019s because a flattening yield curve makes banking \u2014 basically the business of borrowing money at low short-term rates, and lending it at higher long-term rates \u2014 less profitable. If the yield curve inverts, it effectively slams the doors on lending. And because debt is the fuel that drives the economy\u2019s engine, a recession often follows.Mr. Williams emphasizes that he does not see an inverted yield curve, or recession, coming any time soon. And most economists agree. Over the next few years, private forecasters see United States economic growth peaking at 2.8 percent in 2018 before slowing to 2.5 percent in 2019 and 1.9 percent in 2020, according to Bloomberg data. That\u2019s a bit faster than the 2.2 percent growth rate of the United States economy since 2012.But it\u2019s basically the same as the 2.6 percent average growth rate since 1980, suggesting that the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul signed into law by Mr. Trump in December is expected to have a negligible effect on long-term economic growth. Doing better would depend on increasing the supply of workers and raising productivity, a poorly understood process generally thought to depend on making large-scale investments in things like education, infrastructure and expensive equipment for companies.Not everyone agrees that the bond market is sending a warning sign. For much of the last decade, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been buying government bonds with the aim of pushing interest rates lower to support economic growth.So the relatively low long-term rates partly reflect the large bond holdings of central banks, said Matthew Luzzetti, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank. That means those low rates contain \u201cmuch less of a signal about negative growth in the future,\u201d Mr. Luzzetti said.But some view the flattening of the yield as a sign that the economy is weaker than it might appear.Hoisington Investment Management, a bond investment firm based in Austin, Tex., has long held the view that long-term interest rates will go lower. Its chief economist, Lacy Hunt, ticked off a list of current trouble spots: slowing auto sales, skimpy inflation-adjusted wage growth, low savings rates and sluggish construction.\u201cThere are signs out there, they don\u2019t receive much attention,\u201d said Mr. Hunt, whose firm manages more than $4 billion for insurance companies, nonprofit organizations and pension plans. \u201cBut the flattening of the yield curve is an indication that there is a body of people that do think the future outlook is not nearly as good as the current conditions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Votes to Dismantle Bias Rule in Auto Lending", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican regulatory rollback took a step forward on Tuesday as the House voted to scrap an Obama-era rule intended to prevent discrimination by auto lenders and as lawmakers inched closer to a bipartisan agreement to alter portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.Both the Senate and House voided the consumer rule using the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law that gives Congress the power to expunge rules that were created by government agencies.The auto-lending guidance has divided lawmakers along party lines, with Democrats arguing that the policy protected consumers from unfair discrimination and Republicans making the case that it was an example of overreach by the consumer bureau that was squeezing the lending industry. Eleven House Democrats supported the measure on Tuesday.Consumer advocates warned that doing away with antidiscrimination protections would drive up fees for those seeking auto loans and said that other consumer protections could soon be targeted.\u201cCompanies will put millions of people into more expensive car loans simply because of the color of their skin,\u201d said Rion Dennis, an advocate of financial overhaul at Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cBy using the Congressional Review Act to wipe out straightforward regulatory guidance, the congressional majority has also opened the door to challenging longstanding efforts to protect workers, consumers, civil rights, the environment and the economy.\u201dOn Tuesday, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said that the consumer bureau used faulty methodology when producing an analysis to justify its auto-lending rule.\u201cThey claimed that somehow there was unconscious discrimination,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said. \u201cThey made it up. They had no data.\u201dLast year, the Government Accountability Office determined that the bureau\u2019s guidance was technically a rule, a decision that gave Congress authority to use the Congressional Review Act to kill it. While several rules developed toward the end of the Obama administration have been nullified by this Congress, rescinding the auto financing rule was considered unusual since it is an older provision that has been in place for years.Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, warned on Tuesday that Republicans were opening a Pandora\u2019s box that could herald the repeal of rules that have been in place for years, potentially harming consumers in a variety of ways. She pushed back against the suggestion that the consumer bureau rule relied upon bad data and said killing it would hurt minorities.\u201cThis is about discrimination,\u201d Ms. Waters said.Republicans and Democrats have long been at odds over the mandate of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Republicans have long derided the agency for overstepping its bounds and last year, Mr. Trump installed Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, to run the bureau on an interim basis. Since then, Mr. Mulvaney has worked hard to scale back its ambitions and freeze much of its enforcement activities.While lawmakers continue to disagree over portions of the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory agenda, Republicans and Democrats are nearing agreement on the first significant bipartisan bill to alter the Dodd-Frank Act.House Republicans, who had been pushing for a more expansive financial overhaul bill that would eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and make other sweeping changes, appear ready to accept the more limited Senate bill that passed this year. That bill would largely ease regulations that largely apply to community banks.Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the House speaker, said on Tuesday that he had reached an agreement with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to move forward with a vote on the Dodd-Frank bill in the House. He said that the House would also send to the Senate a package of other pieces of financial overhaul legislation that the House has been working on that they believe would add to that bill.Additional pieces of legislation that stray too far from what the Senate passed on a bipartisan basis are unlikely to pass in the Senate, where Republicans have a very slim majority.Mr. Ryan did not indicate when he planned to hold a vote, but lawmakers and administration officials have signaled that it could be in the coming weeks.Thomas Kaplan contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Talking to Senators, Trump Stays on (His Own) Message", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When presidents make the trip to Capitol Hill from the White House to address lawmakers, they usually have a request to make, a policy proposal to sell or an overarching message to deliver.That did not appear to be the case on Tuesday, when President Trump held forth for close to an hour during a closed-door lunch with Republican senators in a monologue that was part political update, part celebration and part comedy routine, according to several people present and others briefed on the meeting.Instead, Mr. Trump talked about his accomplishments \u2014 including the surging economy; the decisions to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and to pursue nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea; and the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem, which he said had saved American taxpayers a substantial amount of money \u2014 and about his optimism over Republicans\u2019 chances in the fall midterm elections.\u201cThe president and Republican members of the Senate had a positive and productive lunch to discuss top issues like North Korea, Iran, trade and the midterms,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, without responding to several specific questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.Over a lunch of chicken and salad, Mr. Trump gave a speech interspersed with jokes and interrupted by only applause and a couple of friendly questions from senators, according to several people present and others briefed on the session who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private discussion.Mr. Trump mused about his popularity in West Virginia, saying he might take up residence in the state. He singled out the sitting Democratic senator running for re-election, Joe Manchin III \u2014 one of several Democrats facing voters in states that Mr. Trump won handily \u2014 saying he was always trying to hug him. But, Mr. Trump added, \u201cHe has a problem.\u201dSenators left the meeting privately comparing Mr. Trump\u2019s freewheeling performance to a comedy club routine, according to one person briefed on the lunch.\u201cThe president was in a very good mood,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told reporters later, \u201cand really quite funny.\u201dMr. Trump offered an update on negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement, calling it a \u201cbad deal,\u201d but said that the talks on revising it were going well and that it would soon become clear if a new version could be struck.He also spoke about his priorities, including funding his long-promised wall on the southern border with Mexico, an item he has so far failed to get Congress to deliver. And he said he would become a fixture on the campaign trail to help Republicans defend their majority.\u201cMostly, we didn\u2019t interrupt the president; we let him talk,\u201d said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. \u201cIt was a very honest, unvarnished, \u2018here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking\u2019 speech. He said he feels very confident about the midterms.\u201d\u201cHe was very optimistic and upbeat about it, and talked about the importance of us working hard and not screwing up,\u201d Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, said of Mr. Trump\u2019s assessment of the party\u2019s chances in the midterms. \u201cHe\u2019s getting better at this,\u201d Mr. Isakson added.Mike Braun, who won a Republican Senate primary in Indiana last week, was a guest at the lunch, where the president said he would keep returning to the state to campaign against \u201cSleepin\u2019 Joe Donnelly,\u201d his derisive name for the Democratic senator up for re-election there.Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he saved hundreds of millions of dollars on the new outpost in Israel, comparing its cost of $200,000 to $300,000 with the estimated $1 billion proposed for a new embassy. But the building dedicated Monday is a converted consular office that will serve as a temporary space until a new embassy, which will ultimately be more costly, can be constructed in Jerusalem.Then, as an aside and in an apparent reference to the three college basketball players freed from China, Mr. Trump suggested during the lunch that no one in the room knew the harsh Chinese penalties for shoplifting better than Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.It was not immediately clear what the president meant, but several senators laughed.Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Tesla Seems Worried It\u2019s Consuming Too Much Cash: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s plan to cut back on capital expenditures.\u2022 Why Apple\u2019s share repurchases have been good for investors.\u2022 Will the Fed offer clues about future rate increases?\u2022 How activist investors shook Xerox.Tesla in recent weeks has faced concerns that it is consuming too much cash as it tries to produce a new model of electric car.Now, Tesla itself seems to share those worries.While reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to \u201csignificantly cut back\u201d the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash.Cash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it\u2019s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers.In its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in.But the company is running out of room for maneuver. Cash on Tesla\u2019s balance sheet at the end of the first quarter fell to $2.7 billion from $3.4 billion in the previous quarter. And the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on a conference call on Wednesday said the company did not want to raise fresh capital.Analysts on the conference call asked what capital expenditures Tesla may reduce in order to meet its lower target. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company might be able to spend less as it attempts to rationalize its production. But when an analyst then asked Mr. Musk about Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, the chief executive did not answer the question and told the operator to move to another questioner. Around this time, Tesla\u2019s stock slid sharply in the after-market trading.-- Peter EavisTesla lost nearly $800 million in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarter in a row it has lost money.But Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn and could make money in the second half of the year. That, of course, came with a major caveat: Tesla achieving its latest goals for Model 3 production, which is well behind schedule.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s net loss increased to $784.6 million from a loss of $397.2 million a year ago.\u2022 Tesla\u2019s adjusted loss per share came in at $3.35. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a loss per share of $3.58.\u2022 Revenue climbed to $3.41 billion, topping analyst expectations of $3.28 billion.Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, and analysts said investor expectations may have been overblown and voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company\u2019s average revenue per user.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Spotify reported a first-quarter loss of \u20ac169 million ($202 million), or \u20ac1.01 a share, from \u20ac173 million, or \u20ac1.15, in the same period a year earlier.\u2022 Spotify posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago\u2022 Revenue rose 26 percent to 1.139 billion euros. Analysts had expected 1.143 billion euros.\u2022 Monthly active users increased 30 percent from a year ago to 170 million.\u2022 Paid subscribers rose 45 percent from a year ago to 75 million.\u2022 Average revenue per user fell to 4.72 euros from 5.32 euros in 2017.\u2022 Gross margins were 24.9 percent.What is in the executive order, which could be released within days:\u2022 It is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China\u2019s most prominent technology firms.\u2022 Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption.The order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology.\u2022 On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said it was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns.As expected, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.The central bank acknowledged rising inflation but provided little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.Perhaps the biggest change to the Fed policy statement was the use of the word \u201csymmetric\u201d to describe its inflation target.\u201cThe Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.\u201d\u201cTo the extent there is a surprise in the policy statement, it is that the addition of the description of the 2% inflation objective as being \u2018symmetric.\u2019 This intended to reinforce some of the inflation rhetoric that has indicated that deviation of inflation to the upside will not necessarily elicit a policy response, especially in light of the prolonged period of below-target inflation.\u201dApple\u2019s stock buyback program isn\u2019t just bigger than those of other companies, it\u2019s also better at doing what investors want share repurchases to do.Apple on Tuesday said it was going to buy back another $100 billion of its own stock. The company announced the plan as it is about to complete a $210 billion stock repurchase program. As large as those numbers seem, they don\u2019t reveal the degree to which the repurchases have benefited shareholders. What matters to them is whether Apple has significantly fewer shares outstanding at the end of the program. If that is achieved, Apple\u2019s earnings per share will be higher, which could lead investors to view the stock more positively.Apple\u2019s diluted shares outstanding have fallen nearly 24 percent over the past five years. Here\u2019s how that compares with some companies that are known for their large stock buybacks. Over the past five years, IBM\u2019s shares outstanding have declined by some 18 percent, Cisco\u2019s have decreased just over 8 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s have fallen by 7.5 percent.Apple\u2019s cash flow statements show it has spent nearly $200 billion on stock repurchases over the past five years, which works out at 57 percent of its cash flow from operations for the period. That percentage is also above that of other companies. The cash Cisco spent on stock repurchases over the past five years amounted to 46 percent of its cash flow from operations. At IBM, that number was 44 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisMost everyone expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.But investors and policymakers will comb over the Fed\u2019s policy statement for clues about whether the central bank plans to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed.Here\u2019s what to watch:\u2022 Any new signs of officials expressing concern about an acceleration in prices. Investors would likely interpret any new worries about inflation to mean the pace of rate hikes could quicken.\u201cA change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,\u201d said Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive.Critics\u2019 cornerRoss Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes that there was little positive to point to in Snap\u2019s first-quarter results.\u201cSNAP remains a volatile story and execution since the I.P.O. has been less than desirable (outside of 4Q17), but we think a lot of the problems around pricing and Android may start to resolve in 2H.\u201d\u201c1Q:18 miss and forward ad commentary speak to continued challenges SNAP faces in turning its business model around.\u201dSam Kemp, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said:\u201cSnap is a poorly structured company that is demonstrating a clear pattern of mismanagement.\u201dXerox chose to settle with the activists after a judge last week temporarily blocked the Fujifilm transaction, siding with Mr. Deason in a lawsuit and saying the talks were conflicted by Mr. Jacobson\u2019s tenuous position. Seeking a settlement would avoid a distracting fight over its board and uncertainty about the future of the deal, Xerox\u2019s existing board said Tuesday.The fight may not be over: Fujifilm said today that it\u2019s appealing the injunction.\u2022 The Justice Department, which has been harder than expected on M.&A., will assess whether consumers face higher prices.\u2022 The F.C.C. will consider whether it\u2019s in the national interest to let the national wireless market shrink from four providers to three.\u2022 Cfius will rule on how the deal might affect national security.The F.C.C. chairman has sounded warm about consolidation, and controlling shareholders of both companies have passed Cfius reviews before. But regulatory approval is still an open question, and Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s share prices reflect that.Next stop: The judge in The Weinstein Company\u2019s will decide whether to approve Lantern\u2019s deal.Advertisement"}

Amenities include kitchens with walk-in freezers, a dining hall and a backup diesel generator.There\u2019s no guarantee there will be a buyer for the prison, which opened in 1990. A previous effort by a warehouse distributor to buy the property fell through more than a year ago. While state officials hailed the closed prison as the product of efforts to reduce mass incarceration, local officials raised concerns about the effect on employment.\u201cWe lost 101 good jobs when it closed,\u201d said Don Bilow, the supervisor of the town of Chateaugay, which is about 200 miles north of Albany. \u201cWe hope a viable entity will buy it and create some economic activity.\u201dThe medium-security prison is one of 13 that the state has closed since Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo took office in 2011. Since 1999, the state\u2019s prison population has declined by 30 percent, to approximately 45,500 inmates.The decrease of 5,500 prison beds has saved the state $162 million per year, the governor\u2019s chief counsel, Alphonso David, said on Saturday. The changes mean people are getting the help they need to deal with drug problems or find work instead of being sent back to prison, he said.\u201cIt can\u2019t be that the prison-industrial complex serves as the economic engines for our communities,\u201d Mr. David said. \u201cThat can\u2019t be the answer.\u201dChateaugay is a rural town in the North Country with about 2,000 residents. The median income is approximately $40,000 a year. Nearly 28 percent of the residents are below the federal poverty level \u2014 almost double the percentage for the state over all, according to the census.The prison, which had 234 inmates, helped the economy, said Assemblyman Billy Jones, a Democrat, who is a former corrections officer and a past mayor of Chateaugay.\u201cWe were a large agriculture area at one time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen dairy farming decreased in the late 1980s or early 1990s, a lot of people found jobs in these prisons. To see them closing, it\u2019s hard on our economy.\u201dMr. Jones said that, while he understood the changes to the drug laws, he believed the prison should have remained open because it was among the newer medium-security facilities, and it also provided a place for parole violators to get counseling.\u201cThere has been no real, good plan when these facilities shutter,\u201d he said.Mr. David and others disagree. The prison is being put up for auction to avoid the lengthy process of requesting proposals, Mr. David said.The State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision kept the buildings heated during harsh winters to keep them in good shape. Workers were offered jobs at other prisons, and the state is working with communities to develop economic proposals in places where prisons closed.Ms. Greene said research showed that the stigma of being a prison community might actually hurt economic growth.\u201cThe label \u2018prison town\u2019 is a disincentive to any other kind of industrial development,\u201d she said. \u201cThe prison boom in the long run hurt them more than it helped.\u201dWith the coming auction, Mr. Bilow said, there has been a sense of hope. The town, which is close to the Canadian border, could prove attractive to a Canadian distributor.\u201cIt\u2019s country and it\u2019s a good place to live right on the end of the Adirondack Mountains,\u201d Mr. Bilow said. \u201cPeople are hopeful that someone will buy it and take care of it and turn it into a growing business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hawaii\u2019s Volcano Country, Where Land Is Cheap and the Living Is Risky", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPAHOA, Hawaii \u2014 Jaris Dreaming built his spacious solar-powered home in a clearing of Polynesian jungle. He drinks rainwater caught from the sky and eats avocados from trees in his backyard. Mainlanders express envy when they hear how he bought nearly 100 acres of Hawaii\u2019s Big Island for just over $100,000.But there\u2019s a catch to this off-grid paradise: Mr. Dreaming lives a short stroll from a lava-spewing rift of Kilauea, one of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes.\u201cWe have a reputation for being something of a pirate\u2019s lair,\u201d said Mr. Dreaming, 64, a musician and contractor who was raised in New Jersey with the name John Fattorosi. \u201cBut we really just want to live freely in a place of stunning beauty without anyone telling us what to do.\u201dFor many of those who continued to buy homes, the lure continued to be cheap housing in a tropical wonderland.Hawaii has what may be the highest statewide home prices in the United States, with the median home value in the state at about $605,000, according to the housing website Zillow. And while the unemployment rate is low at around 2 percent, that figure obscures other problems. Hawaii had the highest cost of living of any state in 2017, according to the Center for Regional Economic Competitiveness, driven largely by housing prices. Zoning restrictions in parts of the archipelago and the use of private residences as vacation rentals constrict available affordable housing even further.The result: Even though Hawaii\u2019s economy seems to be strong, wage increases have trailed the climb in home prices, fueling an exodus of people from the state. For some who don\u2019t want to leave, or for mainlanders seeking to move to Hawaii, the far-flung areas of the Big Island hold allure.\u201cWe\u2019re 40,000 housing units from anywhere near adequate to easing the need for places for people to live in Hawaii,\u201d said Carl Bonham, an economist at the University of Hawaii. \u201cThat\u2019s why Puna is an option no matter its remoteness or risks.\u201dMany homes in Puna are not built to code, or are built in zones where lava flows have already wiped out previous developments, which some residents attribute to the frontier mind-set here. Others, however, contend that public officials have not enforced existing regulations as strictly as they could have.Many of the subdivisions in Puna were created in the 1960s before the first lava hazard maps, drawn in the mid-1970s, said Daryn Arai, deputy planning director for the County of Hawaii.\u201cIf we knew back then what we know now, things would probably be different,\u201d Mr. Arai said. But he added that the county currently has no regulations that apply directly to lava flow hazard zones, aside from building codes that establish wind and seismic safety standards. Those generally apply, however, to how a house is constructed, not where it is built.Meanwhile, many homeowners are scrambling as the lava flows advance.Now, Ms. Sengir said, she is desperately trying to save some possessions in case the lava flows overrun her home, which is uninsured for such an event. Still, Ms. Sengir took a more conventional route to living in Leilani than some of her neighbors.Howie \u201cSunray\u201d Rosin, a Brooklyn-born plumber, moved to the Big Island in 1997, but only recently was able to afford to move to Leilani when the owner of a home nearing foreclosure allowed him to live on the property in exchange for paying property taxes of about $2,000 a year.\u201cI got incredibly lucky,\u201d said Mr. Rosin, 48, while guiding visitors around the dilapidated villa where he now lives. \u201cThis place is wilder than you can imagine,\u201d Mr. Rosin, also a musician and Navy veteran, added. \u201cMany people are willing to risk living next to a volcano because the living is cheap.\u201dAt the time, basic infrastructure \u2014 things like paved roads, sewage systems, running water and electricity \u2014 was lacking. Subdivisions such as Leilani now have some of those services, but many residents still rely on rain catchment tanks for water. Just a few miles away, many homeowners live entirely off the grid, on even cheaper land parcels.In some parts of Puna, newcomers are building nearly directly on fields of hardened lava from eruptions that destroyed other communities. For instance, an eruption of Kilauea in 1990 destroyed about 100 homes in the community of Kalapana. Less than 30 years later, dozens of homes now stand atop the flow field that swallowed Kalapana. The homes, some built without heed to code, lack ties to the electricity grid and sewage systems. Residents collect water in catchment tanks.Often, banks won\u2019t issue a traditional mortgage on such properties, but those determined to come here have found other ways to finance their ventures.\u201cOn some days we can hear the roaring of the eruptions in Puna, like a jet engine taking off,\u201d said Rainbow Foster, 33, who bought a home and a patch of land on the lava field with her husband three years ago for $55,000 in an owner-financed deal.\u201cOur credit rating wasn\u2019t good and we had very little money,\u201d said Ms. Foster, who is self-employed, as is her husband, Tony, 44. They get by doing odd jobs and selling tie-dyed T-shirts, but cherish the sense of freedom they have in Puna to raise their two children. Some of their neighbors have evacuated, but Ms. Foster said that isn\u2019t an option for their family.\u201cThis is the life we chose,\u201d said Ms. Foster, who grew up in Puna. \u201cWe\u2019re hanging tight.\u201dTamir Kalifa contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

And I think there are many reasons to believe that both cultural and economic anxiety are important political forces in the United States. After all, the very voters who swung the election for Trump are the ones experiencing some of the deepest economic troubles. Are we supposed to believe those troubles aren\u2019t influencing their political beliefs?\u201cTo be sure, racism is a corrosive part of American culture and politics,\u201d Cherlin writes. \u201cNevertheless, those who try to distinguish between the explanatory power of stagnant wages and a declining industrial base on the one hand, and anxieties about the ascent of minority groups on the other, miss the point: These are not two different factors but two sides of the same coin.\u201dHe continues: \u201cCollege-educated Americans speak about the economic problems of the working class in terms of trends that can be seen in tables and graphs. Those on the left criticize the federal minimum wage as being too low, while those on the right bemoan the erosion of work incentives. But the people who are experiencing these adverse economic trends express themselves differently, using a moral language that is often rooted in attitudes about work and race.\u201dNone of this should be surprising.

During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised that, if elected, he would bring wholesale change to what he called a \u201ctotally unfair\u201d trading relationship.With the tariffs removed, what did the Chinese side offer? The purchase of more American agriculture and energy products, which they would have done anyway, and lower tariffs on auto imports, a concession they had already agreed to weeks ago.By May 20, the Chinese state media had announced that the trade war was off, and Secretary Mnuchin confirmed it on a Sunday morning talk show. The president then retired to Twitter to defend these results as a great win for American agriculture exports, as if that was the point all along.If a trade war has been averted, what kind of peace is this? Chinese officials didn\u2019t concede to anything of substance. Mr. Trump has often said China is \u201claughing at us.\u201d After this round of negotiations, China must be laughing directly at him.Where does that leave the United States, and all those still hoping for actual reform?The United States should start by shedding its old pretensions. To begin with, the country can no longer claim to have leverage over China on intellectual property theft.Even if the president was fixated on the size of the American trade deficit in goods, intellectual property was supposed to be the key point for his negotiators to address. The issue has been brewing for decades, and neither the Bush nor the Obama administrations did enough to force China to stop it. So far, neither has Trump\u2019s. Instead, it surrendered their best leverage quickly by shelving its tariff threat.America can also no longer pretend more trade with China will promote a political or economic opening. Xi Jinping is now China\u2019s president for life, and his country\u2019s markets are nearly as opaque as they were in 2001, when Beijing joined the World Trade Organization.What we do know about China\u2019s economy is that it remains heavily dependent on government subsidies, dominated by state-owned enterprises, and its manufacturing sector operates at extraordinary levels of overcapacity. Huge swaths of China\u2019s economy, like its financial and construction sectors, remain closed to foreign investment despite promises to open. And while the Chinese economy grows, largely because of its own propulsion, it has been helped along significantly by rampant intellectual property theft encouraged by the state.With those hard truths in mind, the United States should finally acknowledge the true task before its negotiators. It isn\u2019t how to bend China to America\u2019s advantage; it\u2019s how to manage the relationship with China so the American economy will not be left at a permanent disadvantage.The Chinese government has a cleareyed view of what it wants: to dominate the industries of the future, including artificial intelligence, robotics and advanced vehicles. Its leaders are clearly willing to use exclusionary policies to get there. What is Mr. Trump prepared to do to stop them, much less responsibly plan to do for our industrial future?The president, an erstwhile boxing promoter who has made much of his ability to negotiate, should know not to leave his jaw hanging out there in the early rounds of a fight. But he did. If his ego has been damaged enough to see these talks for the disappointment they are, perhaps that will move him to show more resolve as the fight goes on.But if Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t act now, it could be many years before the United States is again in position to challenge China. By then, it may be too late. Any potential gains to the American economy will already have been conceded to Chinese pre-eminence. Let\u2019s hope he can pull himself off the ropes in time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Companies Rushed to Invest in Iran. What Now?", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 European companies moved quickly to invest in Iran after it agreed in 2015 to mothball its nuclear weapons program in return for an end to economic sanctions.Officials in Europe want to protect its companies by finding ways to shield them from American sanctions while they continue doing business in Iran.The United States, however, has not struck an optimistic tone. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has already said licenses that allow Boeing and Airbus, the American and European aircraft giants, to sell to Iran \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d\u201cThe objective is to put and maintain maximum sanctions on Iran,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.With a population of about 82 million and substantial oil reserves, Iran represented a largely untouched market with the potential for fast growth, a rare opportunity for Western companies with global ambitions.While players like General Electric and Boeing lined up orders, many American companies, including oil giants like Chevron and Exxon Mobil, had to watch from a distance; even with the deal in place, they were still effectively blocked by sanctions imposed by the United States from working in Iran. European businesses did not have the same restrictions.For Europe, Iran was a particularly promising example of the kind of fast-growing emerging country that helped lift the region out of a severe debt crisis in recent years. German companies, for instance, have thrived by selling factory machinery, power grid infrastructure and construction equipment that growing nations need to build modern economies.Despite its potential, however, Iran has largely been a disappointment for European investors. In a dysfunctional economy, many failed to gain traction in a huge bureaucracy rife with political power struggles.Companies have also been stifled by a reluctance of foreign banks to provide financing, and fears \u2014 fully justified, as it turned out \u2014 that the nuclear d\u00e9tente would not last.Although exports from the European Union to Iran increased by about one-third last year to 10.8 billion euros, or about $12.8 billion, the country still ranked only 33rd among the bloc\u2019s trading partners, behind the likes of Kazakhstan and Serbia.\u201cGerman-Iranian economic relations are lagging their potential,\u201d Volker Treier, head of the exports department at the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said in an email.After Mr. Trump\u2019s decision not to extend a moratorium on sanctions, Mr. Treier said, \u201cthe moderately positive development in business with Iran comes with a big question mark.\u201dIn the end, expectations may simply have been too high.So far, Airbus has delivered just three jets, none of them super jumbos, a company spokesman said on Tuesday. Two of the three have been leased.In 2016, Daimler signed an agreement with Iran Khodro, a vehicle maker based in Tehran, to distribute Fuso brand trucks. Demand has been limited, however, because of Iran\u2019s weak economy, Daimler spokesman Florian Martens said Tuesday.Whether Total can stay in the deal is open to question. Although Europe may yet carve out protections for companies from the region, the company fears the imposition of so-called secondary sanctions by the United States against non-American businesses and individuals as part of the decision to pull out of the nuclear accord.Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Total\u2019s chief executive, recently said that the company would argue that because it had signed its Iran deal before Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, Total should benefit from a \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d and would ask for a waiver from the United States to continue. Total also might turn its share over to its minority partner CNPC, a Chinese state-owned oil company.European Union officials said on Tuesday that they were making plans to blunt the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal \u2014 presumably helping insulate companies like Total.\u201cWe are working on plans to protect the interests of European companies,\u201d Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, told reporters on Tuesday.It was unclear, however, what those measures might be.France, for example, hopes to engage in more detailed dialogue with the Trump administration to press for waivers for its companies. But it was too soon to say whether Mr. Trump would be swayed, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. It was also not immediately clear whether Mr. Trump would recognize the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d arguments favored by Total, the people said.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the deal with Iran may not automatically prompt governments to choke off trade.Having ripped up an international deal, the president may have trouble recruiting allies and cutting off exports of Iranian oil, the country\u2019s most valuable product.Iran\u2019s crude exports have risen to about 2.4 million barrels a day in recent months, after being around 1 million barrels a day in the months before sanctions were lifted.\u201cIt is going to be hard to get people on board,\u201d said Richard Nephew, a former State Department official who was the lead sanctions expert in the Iran negotiations under President Barack Obama and who successfully persuaded other customers of Iran to stop buying its oil in the years leading up to the eventual nuclear deal.Mr. Nephew, now a senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, forecast that of Iran\u2019s major customers, Japan and South Korea would most likely cooperate on sanctions because they are worried about Washington\u2019s negotiations with North Korea.He said European customers, however, would probably be slower to come around. And China and India, which in some months have been buying more than 1 million barrels a day from Iran, may continue to buy Iranian crude in the same quantities.All told, the impact of renewed sanctions would be an estimated loss of 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian exports, Mr. Nephew said. That would be a significant amount, but much less than the 1.4 million barrels a day or so that Mr. Obama\u2019s sanctions achieved.In the meantime, Iran is running its oil industry at full tilt, analysts say. \u201cIt is obvious that they are anticipating potential new sanctions and running full speed before it happens,\u201d said Antoine Rostand, president of Kayrros, a Paris-based market research firm.But the sanctions would nonetheless create major complications. Iran has quickly pumped up oil production in existing fields, but these will eventually become tapped out. It won\u2019t be able to bring new fields online without partners and capital.Still, giant oil corporations have not given up on Iran.\u201cWe continue to be interested in exploring the role Shell can play in developing Iran\u2019s energy potential within the boundaries of applicable laws,\u201d Royal Dutch Shell said in an email on Tuesday.The same principle applies to other investors, provided they are big enough \u2014 and wealthy enough \u2014 to handle the risk, said Andreas Schweitzer, managing director of Arjan Capital, a firm in London that advises companies on investing in Iran.\u201cThose who want this 80-million-person market and have a long-term strategy,\u201d he said, \u201cwill go there with or without Mr. Trump.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the chief executive of Total.

In the not-too-distant future, astronauts on the moon may be holding fuel pumps.The future for American commercial space activity is bright. Space entrepreneurs are already planning travel to Mars, and they are looking to the moon as the perfect location for a way station to refuel and restock Mars-bound rockets. As much as this sounds like the plot of \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d it is coming closer to reality sooner than you may have ever thought possible.Space tourism may only be a year away. Tickets for human flights into lower earth orbit have already sold for $250,000 each. Earth-based mining companies may soon face stiff competition from the mining of gold, silver, platinum and rare earths on asteroids and even other planets. A race is already developing to create the technology that will bring those crucial resources back to earth.Competition is already fierce, with Russia and China challenging the United States for leadership, and about 70 other countries working their way into space. But today\u2019s space race is different. It is driven by innovative companies that are finding new solutions to get to space faster, cheaper and more effectively.As these companies advance new ideas for space commerce and nontraditional approaches to space travel, they seek the legitimacy and stability that comes with government support and approval. They yearn for a government that acts as a facilitator, not just a regulator. Government must create frameworks that enable, rather than stifle, industry.This will be a major change. At my department alone, there are six bureaus involved in the space industry. A unified departmental office for business needs will enable better coordination of space-related activities. To this end, I have directed all Commerce Department bureaus with space responsibilities to assign a liaison to the new Space Administration team, including the International Trade Administration, Bureau of Industry and Security, National Telecommunications and Information Administration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.When companies seek guidance on launching satellites, the Space Administration will be able to address an array of space activities, including remote sensing, economic development, data-purchase policies, GPS, spectrum policy, trade promotion, standards and technology and space-traffic management. The new office will also enable the department to manage its growing responsibilities in space.The department will take on a greater role when it comes to regulation and promotion of space activity. But as the agency charged with promoting job creation and economic growth, we will not engage only in oversight, but will support American companies so they can compete and lead on a level playing field.Collectively, these efforts will unshackle American industry and ensure American leadership in space. This is essential to technological innovation, economic growth, jobs and national security. But, perhaps more important, it is rejuvenating the American passion for space exploration.I can still remember when President John F. Kennedy declared that America would put a man on the moon and when Neil Armstrong took that first step on the lunar landscape. Glued to televisions, Americans were filled with excitement and national pride during the Apollo missions.Last month I felt that same passion as I visited the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs with Vice President Mike Pence. \u201cAs we push human exploration deeper into space, we will unleash the boundless potential of America\u2019s pioneering commercial space companies,\u201d the vice president told the crowd.This is a very special time in space history \u2014 there is a convergence of technology, capital, and political will. The United States must seize this moment. \u2610Wilbur Ross is secretary of commerce.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italian President\u2019s Loyalty to the Euro Creates Chaos", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 He\u2019s been called \u201cgray,\u201d \u201cinvisible\u201d and \u201cgentle to the point of seeming fragile.\u201d Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister, once compared him to \u201ca monk.\u201dMr. Mattarella\u2019s defenders hailed him as the courageous protector of Italy\u2019s democracy, institutions and financial health, while fuming populists sought to make the usually revered figure of the Italian head of state the country\u2019s public enemy No. 1. They called for his impeachment, saying he had overstepped his constitutional bounds with delusions of grandeur, blocked the will of the people and destroyed Italian democracy.In response, Mr. Mattarella privately plugged along.On Monday morning, as markets rose and fell with the whiplashing events in Italy, Mr. Mattarella gave a new mandate to form a government to Carlo Cottarelli, a respected economist, former International Monetary Fund official and Italian government appointee, who told reporters that he would form a caretaker government only with the goal of passing a budget and guiding Italy to new elections.If Parliament votes in support of his caretaker government, elections would take place in early 2019. If it does not, which seems much more likely, he would quit \u201cimmediately\u201d and elections would take place sometime after August.Mr. Cottarelli\u2019s main goal in speaking on Monday seemed to be to assure nervous investors in Italy and abroad that the country was in good hands. He guaranteed, \u201cin the most absolute way, that a government led by me would assure a cautious management of our national accounts,\u201d and that Italy\u2019s \u201ccontinuous participation in the eurozone\u201d was essential.It was Mr. Mattarella\u2019s loyalty to the euro that prompted the 11th-hour collapse of the nascent government of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the anti-immigrant League.He determined that the alliance\u2019s proposed economy minister, Paolo Savona, the co-author of a guide to leaving the eurozone, could lead Italy to abandon the euro without sufficient public debate, being that the parties maintained vague and shifting positions on the issue during the campaign leading up to the March 4 elections.But in deliberately forcing a new election over the euro, which a majority of Italians say they support, the usually careful and measured Mr. Mattarella expressly put an explosive issue with the potential of transforming Europe front and center. And by using his constitutional powers to block the new government in order to protect Italian savings accounts from increasingly wary markets, he also handed the gifted and gleefully hostile populist parties the talking point of a lifetime before the elections.The coming vote \u201cwill be a referendum on Europe, on the euro and on the Italian constitutional model,\u201d Francesco Verderami, a political analyst, wrote in Corriere della Sera on Monday. \u201cBecause it is equally clear that the presidency of the republic \u2014 which has been threatened with impeachment \u2014 during the electoral campaign is sure to be one of the targets of the populist and nationalist forces.\u201dIt did not take long for that to come to pass.Luigi Di Maio, Five Star\u2019s political leader, called on party members to demonstrate their opposition to Mr. Mattarella and \u201cthe darkest night of Italian democracy\u201d by hanging Italian flags out their windows, marching in the streets and flooding the social networks where the party developed its support.In a Facebook post, Mr. Di Maio said that Mr. Mattarella had prompted problems in the markets by creating uncertainty. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave the euro,\u201d he insisted, calling the party\u2019s well-documented ambivalence to the common currency \u201ca lie created by the counselors of Mattarella.\u201dOn Monday, several analysts and politicians accused Mr. Salvini, who rebuffed Mr. Mattarella\u2019s appeal to substitute the proposed economy minister with a top League official, of purposely blowing up the government in order to bank increased electoral support in new elections. He wants to be prime minister.Leading members of the Five Star Movement proclaimed the new technical government dead on arrival and said they would introduce impeachment proceedings against Mr. Mattarella in Parliament.But their efforts to intimidate Mr. Mattarella last week, saying he should not get in the way of Italian voters, failed. Some supporters argued that the potential blowback and risk in coming elections was worth keeping the populists, who have shown disregard for Italian institutions, away from power.Mario Calabrese, the editor of the left-leaning daily La Repubblica, wrote in a front-page editorial, \u201cIf the president had given in, folding before the ultimatums and threats, and if he went back on his only objection, the state\u2019s checks and balances would have broken into pieces.\u201dMr. Berlusconi, the former prime minister and coalition partner of Mr. Salvini, also gave his support to Mr. Mattarella, saying the Five Star Movement was \u201cirresponsible as always, talking about impeachment.\u201d\u201cForza Italia waits for the determination of the head of state, but when necessary will be ready for the vote,\u201d he added, referring to his party.Both he and the Five Star Movement unveiled campaign language in which they accused Italy of being held hostage by Germany, international markets, bankers and the overreaching president who did their bidding.Constitutional scholars debated on Monday whether Mr. Mattarella was within his rights. In Corriere della Sera, Italy\u2019s leading paper, Massimo Luciani, a professor of constitutional law at La Sapienza University in Rome, said Mr. Mattarella \u201cexercised his constitutional rights\u201d because he \u201cbelieved that the choice of a certain minister for a key government position put the interests of our country at risk.\u201dHe added, \u201cThis is an institutional evaluation.\u201dBut Paolo Flores D\u2019Arcais wrote in the political magazine MicroMega that while the president can object to the appointment of a minister if \u201che finds in the candidate\u2019s past behavior something that conflicts with honorability,\u201d Mr. Mattarella\u2019s problem with the economy minister was his position on the euro.\u201cIt falls beyond the powers of the president of the republic to judge the candidates\u2019 political opinions in the single ministries,\u201d he wrote.At first, markets seemed more appreciative of Mr. Mattarella\u2019s rejection of the populist government, but they then fell sharply, with stocks and bonds falling as investors digested the increased uncertainty.\u201cDevelopments in Italy are likely to keep the financial markets on tenterhooks,\u201d analysts at the German lender Commerzbank said in a note to clients Monday morning. Referring to polls that indicate that Italy\u2019s populist parties are likely to win any snap election called this year, they continued, \u201cThe entry into office of an Italian government that is on a confrontational course with the E.U. and disregards its rules is only postponed.\u201dItaly\u2019s benchmark stock index, the FTSE MIB, was down more than 2 percent in afternoon trading in Europe, and the country\u2019s bonds took a beating. The yield on the main 10-year Italian government bond, which moves inversely to its price, rose to as much as 2.69 percent, its highest level since August 2014.The \u201cspread\u201d between Italian government bonds and their German counterparts, in particular, has widened considerably since the start of the year, indicating investors see Italian debt as a riskier investment.That \u201cspread,\u201d a word often uttered with venom by Italian populists, was also the focus of Mr. Mattarella\u2019s remarks Sunday night, and Mr. Cottarelli\u2019s on Monday morning.But it is the coming election, and the promised centrality of the euro in it, that makes many in Europe nervous. Mr. Mattarella, a 76-year-old Sicilian, has shown he is not easily shaken.The son of a government minister, he decided to go into politics after his older brother, Piersanti, then the governor of Sicily, was shot and killed by the Mafia. Mr. Mattarella pulled his bloodied brother out of the car.The first time he ran for office was in the 1970s, when he ran for a position in his university. He regretted it right away, his friend Vito Riggio once told La Repubblica, recalling that the quiet Sicilian had found himself surrounded by screaming, rabid student protesters.\u201cThe more they screamed, the more he lowered his voice,\u201d Mr. Riggio was quoted as saying. \u201cAt a certain point, he said to the most enraged one, \u2018Excuse me, but why are you screaming? We are here to discuss. No?\u2019 \u201dPrashant S. Rao contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xiaomi, Chinese Gadget Maker, Opens Floodgates for Hong Kong I.P.O.s", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A gadget maker. An online delivery service. And the electronic payment company tied to the tech giant Alibaba.These are among a spate of Chinese companies expected to open their doors to ordinary investors in Hong Kong over the next year through public listings, after a loosening of rules by the city\u2019s stock exchange. If many of them end up listing in Hong Kong, then China will have accomplished a major goal: keeping its hugely successful tech boom at home.The flurry of big-name Chinese companies potentially choosing to stay home, rather than go abroad, in search of funding is part of a broader push by China, which has sought to develop homegrown champions in an array of sectors. But the new regulations, which allow companies to retain more control, have also been criticized as an encroachment by Beijing on Hong Kong\u2019s legal system and corporate governance standards.Xiaomi, the gadget maker, announced on Thursday that it would list in Hong Kong, the first company to do so after the rule changes.\u201cThere has been somewhat of a campaign to bring companies home and remove them from foreign jurisdictions,\u201d Mr. Webb said.While Hong Kong is officially a special administrative region within the People\u2019s Republic of China, and has a separate legal and financial system, Beijing sees it as a part of the mainland. Some of China\u2019s biggest and most exciting technology start-ups, like Didi Chuxing, the ride-sharing rival to Uber, and Ant Financial, the financial arm of Alibaba, are making plans to go public over the next year.In the past, Chinese entrepreneurs like Jack Ma of Alibaba chose to list their shares in markets, like New York, where they could operate as if their companies were still private. They were able to offer so-called dual-class shares, which give shareholders little say in the operations of the business.Until last week, Hong Kong, which has stricter rules than New York, had not allowed such listings. In its filing on Thursday with Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange, Xiaomi appeared to be taking advantage of the new rules.The company, whose low-cost smartphones have won a loyal following not just in China but in other emerging markets like India as well, said it would raise an unspecified amount from the public in order to fund the development of new smartphones and other devices like household gadgets. The money will also help Xiaomi pursue expansion overseas.It could raise as much as $10 billion, according to two people with direct knowledge of the company but not authorized to speak on the record. That would make it the second-largest listing by a Chinese technology company since Alibaba in 2014.As part of the listing, which could come as soon as June, Xiaomi will offer dual-class shares, which allow for weighted voting rights. This will mean that Lei Jun, Xiaomi\u2019s founder, chairman and chief executive, will have the ultimate say over the company\u2019s operations, rather than investors who buy its shares, even if they end up owning more stock than he decides to hold on to.This share structure will allow the company to benefit from Mr. Lei\u2019s \u201cvision and leadership\u201d while allowing him to maintain its \u201clong-term prospects and strategy,\u201d Xiaomi said in its filing.The decision by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong to allow dual-class shares just one week ago has sparked fierce debate here. For the exchange, not allowing companies to list with such a structure meant it missed out on lucrative listings like Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion initial public offering. Alibaba opted to list in New York, where several large technology companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, operate with dual-class shares.But some in the city\u2019s investor community had pushed hard to prevent Hong Kong from changing its rules, arguing that it will mean less rigorous corporate governance.\u201cThere should not be unequal voting rights as they could allow management or minority share owners to override the wishes or best interests of majority shareholders for personal benefit and compromise accountability, leading to potential entrenchment issues,\u201d Mary Leung, head of advocacy for Asia at CFA Institute, an association of investment professionals, said in a statement.Some big institutional investors have criticized Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange for throwing out tighter regulations in a bid to compete with rivals.There are also longer-term concerns that companies will not be as closely scrutinized in the future in Hong Kong, which was once a British colony. As part of the British handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the territory was promised 50 years of self-administration. But in recent years, the city has experienced encroachment on its independence, and investors have raised concerns that its strong regulatory and legal institutions are slowly being eroded by Beijing.To these critics, Hong Kong\u2019s decision to allow dual-class shares is further evidence of that erosion.\u201cBeijing is much happier raising capital in a city that they can partially control rather than handing over all the listings to U.S. markets,\u201d said Andrew Collier, the founder of research firm Orient Capital Research. \u201cAt the end of the day, the Hong Kong stock market is going to be creeping slowly toward Chinese-style regulation.\u201dMr. Li did not respond to a request for comment. But in his blog post he said the exchange was \u201cintroducing additional safeguards to protect investors against the potential misuse of power,\u201d including more corporate governance requirements and certain limits on founding shareholders in these structures.The exchange\u2019s move to loosen its requirements is expected to trigger a spurt of initial public offerings this year and next amid growing appetite across global public markets for new technology companies.Meituan-Dianping, an online delivery service for food and consumer products, is making preparations for an initial public offering in Hong Kong this year, according to two people with direct knowledge of the company but not authorized to speak on the record.Ant Financial, the electronic financial services firm tied to Alibaba, is going through one final fund-raising round before it also decides whether to list its shares publicly late this year or early next year, according to these people.And the Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing is in talks for its own listing, according to one of these people. It is not clear where it would choose to list.Despite the criticism about corporate governance in Hong Kong, its rules remain stricter than New York\u2019s \u2014 for now.Tencent Music, the streaming service owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent, is in talks with various banks to help it go public. It is expected to choose New York, where companies can use the dual-class share structure even if the founding shareholder is a company and not an individual. This would allow Tencent, the parent of Tencent Music, to maintain control.In Hong Kong, the dual-class share structure is available only for individuals. But the city\u2019s stock exchange has already begun seeking feedback from the investor community about loosening this rule, too.An earlier version of this article misstated the relationship between Alibaba and Ant Financial. They are both controlled by Jack Ma; Alibaba does not own Ant Financial. The article also misstated the given name of the chief executive of Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange. He is Charles Li, not Richard Li.Advertisement"}

The shift of a core member of the European Union, one whose allegiance to the \u201cEuropean project\u201d had not been in doubt, toward the new Central European members hostile to Brussels is a serious blow to the deeper European integration championed by President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Imposing stern rules on Greece, and scolding Poland and Hungary for their illiberal policies, were actions taken by established Western nations secure in their roles in Europe. But if Italy, the fourth-largest economy in the European Union, starts defying union rules and demanding a renegotiation of the terms of its membership, it will be far more difficult to hold other members in check.Still, it is too early for Mr. Bannon and his allies to celebrate, or for the champions of the union to panic. The allure of populists can fade rapidly if they fail to come up with concrete solutions to the resentments that brought them to power. The task for Mr. Macron and Ms. Merkel and their allies is to stay the course on the bloc\u2019s values, coherence and rules, but also to recognize and address the anger that has fed the rebellion.Advertisement"}

They are the debris of a growing heroin scourge that is gripping the remote community in Northern California.While the state as a whole has one of the lowest overall opioid-related death rates in the country, a sharp rise in heroin use across the rural north in recent years has raised alarms. In Humboldt County, the opioid death rate is five times higher than the state average, rivaling the rates of states like Maine and Vermont that have received far more national attention.The problem is exacerbated here in Eureka, the county seat, by a sizable homeless population that is growing amid an extreme lack of affordable housing and a changing, weakened economy that relies heavily on tourism. The combined ills have devastated a particularly vulnerable community that is often overlooked in the state.

An astonishingly high rate of opioid prescription in Humboldt County has bred addiction, officials said, and the craving is increasingly sated by a growing market for heroin.While meth \u201cis still king\u201d in Humboldt after decades of entrenched use, Ernie Stewart, the Chief Deputy Coroner at the County Sheriff\u2019s Department, said he is certain that the county\u2019s heroin-related overdoses are \u201cway underreported.\u201d He said meth and heroin abuse has touched every type of person locally, not just the homeless.With the sharp increases in use and overdoses, syringe litter has become a significant flash point for the town\u2019s middle-class residents, particularly because tourism is so important for Eureka and the surrounding region. The town\u2019s homeless have borne the brunt of the blame and frustration. Many Eurekans described various shocking experiences, including witnessing injections on public streets. They worry that discarded syringes could threaten children and tourists playing in the area\u2019s parks.The Humboldt Area Center for Harm Reduction, which distributes clean needles through a syringe exchange program, has also drawn the ire of many in the community who blame the organization for the proliferation of needles. Brandie Wilson founded the organization in 2014 in part to combat the spread of hepatitis C, which is widespread in Humboldt County. The exchange, Ms. Wilson said, has distributed close to one million clean syringes since 2017. Data provided by Ms. Wilson showed that it gets about 94 percent of them back again.\u201cOur Hep C and mental health and drug use and homeless and opioid use issues, all of those are so intertwined with being rural, and with a culture of silence,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter where I looked, there was no help. There was no help.\u201dMs. Wilson said the organization has also distributed thousands of kits of naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses.The needle litter problem intensified two years ago when the town removed a homeless encampment along the Palco Marsh where somewhere between 250 and 400 homeless people had been sleeping.City officials and health service workers had encouraged the town\u2019s large homeless population for years to go there. The tent city, which was colloquially called Devil\u2019s Playground, provided a place to sleep and to linger during the day, but it also saw severely unsanitary health conditions and, at times, violence. In 2016, the town decided to clear the camp to install a bike path along the water, and did not allow a new camp anywhere else.Now \u201ceverybody wants to focus on syringes instead of lives,\u201d said Ms. Wilson.Ms. Cobine said that the town\u2019s decision to clear the homeless encampment \u201ctore us down emotionally and psychologically.\u201d Ms. Cobine said she stopped taking her medications for bipolar disorder because she was afraid that a side effect, drowsiness, could leave her vulnerable to sexual assault when she did not have somewhere safe to sleep; she carries a hatchet around in her bag for protection.\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have closed the playground down if they didn\u2019t want homeless people all over town,\u201d Ms. Cobine said. \u201cThey should have let them stay back there where they were, if they didn\u2019t want drug paraphernalia all over town, or give us somewhere else to go.\u201d She noted that just a fraction of the town\u2019s homeless who were living in the tent city found accommodations through support programs.Steve Shockley said he and other homeless people in the area do not just use meth recreationally: they often use it to stay awake at night. The homeless in town have fewer and fewer places where they can sleep without risking a ticket for loitering, or having their few possessions seized by the police. So they take meth to keep moving at night, and take heroin during the day to feed their cravings.Another homeless man, Michael Myers, said that heroin was easier to acquire than meth or on some days, even marijuana, which is surprising in a region known as the Emerald Triangle where marijuana is widely grown.If there has been a saving grace in Northern California, it is that a much more powerful illicit opioid, fentanyl, is far less common on the West Coast than in other parts of the country. Fentanyl, which is 50 times as strong as heroin, is increasingly being mixed into batches of heroin and is largely responsible for the devastating rise in opioid-related deaths nationally.Unlike the supply of heroin primarily found on the East Coast, the so-called Black Tar heroin seen in the West is harder to mix with fentanyl, according to public health experts.But even without fentanyl, Humboldt County is ill equipped to handle rising heroin abuse and addiction. Access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid abuse disorder is severely limited in these remote parts of California \u2014 a problem shared by rural counties across the country.\u201cThe state is failing miserably, and you can quote me on that,\u201d said Mr. Stewart, the deputy coroner. \u201cThe state is failing miserably across the board. They are not putting enough funding and resources toward rehabilitation.\u201dMike McGuire, who represents several Northern California counties including Humboldt in the State Senate, said that government leaders needed to be more proactive about expanding resources in rural parts of the state. He said rural Californians are \u201cdesperate\u201d for more assistance.\u201cHumboldt County is just a few hours up Highway 101,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as an individual travels further north on the highway, it\u2019s like you take a step back in time. We need to step up to the plate and provide rural counties with the tools they need to combat this crisis.\u201dMr. McGuire said that between 500 and 700 residents of Humboldt and nearby Trinity and Del Norte counties are on a waiting list for opioid treatment services.Marlies Perez, the chief of the California Department of Health Care Services\u2019 Substance Use Disorder Compliance Division, said the state is working on increasing the number of treatment options available in rural areas.\u201cOne of the problems is stigma,\u201d Ms. Perez said. \u201cWe have county supervisors who don\u2019t want a treatment program located in their area.\u201dSome options are on the way. The treatment provider Aegis is scheduled to assist in opening a center just outside Eureka by early 2019. The hub is meant to treat up to 200 patients and to serve as a center for smaller \u201cspoke\u201d centers in the region, including Del Norte and Trinity counties.Once there are more treatment options in place, the challenge will be getting the people who need them most to buy in, and to offer them mental health services as well.\u201cEvery time I\u2019m almost off this\u201d stuff, said Mr. Shockley, \u201csomebody dies \u2014 which is kind of a cop out. But it is what it is.\u201dMs. Cobine, for her part, believes that housing needs to be the priority in a comprehensive program to deal with drug use in the area.\u201cI don\u2019t know why treatment and rehab and these services always have to come into play first,\u201d said Ms. Cobine. \u201cIf there was just affordable housing, people wouldn\u2019t be using as much.\u201dFinding stable housing situations for those who are most vulnerable, to encourage recovery, is another challenge. Sally Hewitt of the Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services said the county\u2019s inability to expand public housing options will make that far more difficult, particularly because of local resistance.As a result of restrictions on public housing development in California, Ms. Hewitt said, county officials must largely deal with private landlords when seeking to house the homeless. Many of the landlords require potential tenants to have references, good credit and an income at least three times the cost of rent. Those are each obstacles for the homeless, particularly those with drug addictions.\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to figure out how to keep people alive while we wait for more treatment up here,\u201d Ms. Wilson said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Spain, Mariano Rajoy\u2019s Government Veers Toward Collapse", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe choice for Mr. Rajoy was increasingly stark: jump first and resign his post, or wait to be pushed out on Friday when the Parliament was scheduled for a vote he seemed nearly certain to lose. Either outcome would mean a change of leadership for Spain and would send the country sooner or later to new elections.But unlike Italy, where the country\u2019s economic stagnation under the euro has become a central issue, the issue in Spain is Mr. Rajoy himself and a long-building corruption scandal that has tainted his conservative Popular Party.Afterward, Spain\u2019s main opposition Socialist Party put forward a motion asking lawmakers to vote Mr. Rajoy from office and install a Socialist administration, ahead of another national election.If that measure succeeds Friday, it would complete a remarkable comeback for the Socialist leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and make him Spain\u2019s new prime minister. If Mr. Rajoy resigns, it would allow his deputy prime minister to take over on an interim basis.By midafternoon, the Basque nationalist party said that its lawmakers would support Mr. S\u00e1nchez, ensuring that a vote of no-confidence would be approved by a slim majority of the 350 lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament. The two main Catalan separatist parties were also set to vote against Mr. Rajoy.At the start of debate on Thursday, Mr. S\u00e1nchez urged Mr. Rajoy to resign rather than getting voted out of office.\u201cWhat more needs to happen for you to understand that remaining is damaging and a burden not only for the country but also for your own party?\u201d Mr. S\u00e1nchez said in Parliament, addressing Mr. Rajoy.Mr. S\u00e1nchez also confirmed that a Socialist administration would maintain the budgetary plan recently approved by Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, which includes a generous financing deal for the Basque region, and promised to open a dialogue and \u201crebuild the broken bridges\u201d with the Catalan separatist politicians with whom Mr. Rajoy has been at loggerheads for years.Mr. Rajoy insisted Thursday morning that he had no intention of allowing Mr. S\u00e1nchez to run Spain.\u201cHow do you plan to govern?\u201d Mr. Rajoy asked Mr. S\u00e1nchez. \u201cThere\u2019s no point coming here to say only that Rajoy is the biggest of all evils.\u201dBut as it became clearer that Mr. S\u00e1nchez could sway lawmakers from smaller parties, Mr. Rajoy did not attend the afternoon session of Parliament.Two years ago, Spain spent 10 months in political limbo after two inconclusive elections, a period that ended with Mr. Rajoy at the helm of a vulnerable minority government.New elections could mean a replay and extend the uncertainty that has destabilized markets and the politics of southern Europe, starting with Italy.What the two countries share are political systems that have been badly fractured by the emergence of upstart parties, by the lingering effects of the financial crisis and by waning faith in the traditional parties that have dominated politics for decades.The only bright spot for Europe, analysts say, is that none of the main parties in Spain are challenging the European single currency, as is happening in Italy.\u201cUnlike the situation in Italy, the crisis of the Rajoy government and the vote of no confidence are not about the European Union or the euro,\u201d said Bonnie N. Field, a professor of global studies at Bentley University in Massachusetts. \u201cIn this way, Spain is less of a threat to the European project than Italy.\u201dThe reason for that has everything to do with the divergent paths the two countries took to try to get out of the euro and debt crisis from which much of Europe is only now emerging.Italy blinked again and again at painful economic and political reforms, and its economy remains a laggard, saddled with high public debt and low growth. Mr. Rajoy on the other hand pushed through contentious austerity measures that have widened income inequality and made jobs more precarious, but have restored economic growth.Spaniards surpassed Italians as a richer people in term of gross domestic product per capita this year for the first time in the countries\u2019 shared history in the European Union.Until Thursday, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s main survival hope came from the divisions among opposition parties. His current government depends on support from a smaller, pro-business party, Ciudadanos, which was founded in Catalonia and has seen its stock rise for its strong opposition to the region\u2019s independence drive.Ciudadanos wanted to force Mr. Rajoy to either call a snap election or get Parliament to approve an interim administration of technocrats \u2014 rather than a Socialist government \u2014 before an election later this year.As it became clear that the Socialists could circumvent Ciudadanos and rely instead on the support of Catalan and Basque nationalist politicians, Albert Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, warned that the Socialists could allow separatists to destroy Spain\u2019s unity.\u201cToday is a terrible day for Spain,\u201d Mr. Rivera said.A no-confidence vote needs approval not only by an absolute majority of lawmakers, but also agreement on a substitute prime minister.No party has anything close to a parliamentary majority, and recent polls suggest only that Ciudadanos has an incentive to hold an election now.A snap election would come at a fragile time for the two left-wing parties of Spain, the Socialists and Podemos, which failed to form an alternative coalition government to replace Mr. Rajoy in 2016 and then suffered from internal feuding.Last week\u2019s verdicts in the corruption case made Mr. Rajoy\u2019s party the first Spanish political force to be convicted of operating a slush fund and ordered to pay a fine, 245,000 euros, or about $285,000.The party\u2019s former treasurer, Luis B\u00e1rcenas, was sentenced to 33 years in prison and fined \u20ac44 million, alongside 28 other businessmen and politicians who received over 300 years in combined prison sentences for benefiting from a kickbacks-for-contracts scheme.Mr. Rajoy and others from his party have acknowledged the damage since then, but they have also insisted that it did not imply that fraud was committed by Spain\u2019s current administration or the party as a whole.But Aitor Esteban, a Basque nationalist lawmaker, insisted on Thursday that the court ruling marked a \u201cbefore and after\u201d for Mr. Rajoy and his party.He said that his own party was \u201cnot looking to destabilize Spain\u201d but wanted to put an end to \u201cmonths of political tsunamis,\u201d caused by repeated corruption scandals and the \u201cincapacity to reach agreements\u201d of the bigger national parties, led by Mr. Rajoy\u2019s conservatives.Mr. Esteban congratulated Mr. S\u00e1nchez on making \u201ca good move,\u201d but also warned him to stay true to his pledge to resolve the crisis in Catalonia.\u201cI trust that the dialogue that you have promised will be real,\u201d Mr. Esteban told Mr. S\u00e1nchez.\u201cYou will face hostilities from day one,\u201d Mr. Esteban added. \u201cYour government will be very complicated, weak and difficult.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But they just might be the future of Japan.\u201cThe technology used in making these products is very difficult,\u201d said Norihiro Irie, Irie Koken\u2019s president. \u201cNot many companies are able to do it.\u201dJapan is moving toward \u201can entirely different strategy, where other countries cannot compete,\u201d said Ryoji Musha, president of the economic analysis outfit Musha Research in Tokyo. \u201cGoing forward, Japan will show a remarkable emergence as one of the locomotives of the global economy.\u201dMany of Japan\u2019s biggest players have to look beyond the country\u2019s borders in their quest for growth. The declining population helped drive Takeda Pharmaceutical\u2019s deal on Tuesday for Shire \u2014 the largest overseas acquisition ever by a Japanese company.\u201cThe undertow pulling at the dynamics of growth is the main limit to what Japan can do on a sustained basis,\u201d said Kenneth Courtis, chairman of the finance firm Starfort Investment Holdings. Though Japan has some competitive companies that will continue to excel, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that changes the overall equation.\u201dJapan also had several false starts over the past quarter-century, only to stumble back into the doldrums. If this time is different, one big reason will be companies like Irie Koken.Mr. Irie said business had not been this good since he took over as the company\u2019s president 19 years ago. Sales more than doubled in its last fiscal year.\u201cWe can\u2019t catch up with all our orders,\u201d Mr. Irie said.With I.T. becoming more critical to just about every sector and factories looking to improve efficiency, greater demand is expected for robots, chips and other high-tech products \u2014 and the made-in-Japan parts and machines needed to manufacture them.\u201cEven if there is a recession, I don\u2019t see it changing speed right now,\u201d said Rosen Diankov, chief technology officer at the robotics company Mujin Inc.Mr. Diankov, an American robotics specialist, founded Mujin in 2011 with Issei Takino of Japan, a former cutting-tool sales manager, to produce devices that control industrial robots. Its headquarters in a refurbished warehouse in east Tokyo have the hipster vibe of a garage start-up, with offices and workshops cluttered with equipment.Such entrepreneurial companies are all too rare in Japan, where venture capital and risk-taking are scarce compared with the United States or China. But Mujin\u2019s founders believe that Japan is leading the way in automation, and they wanted to be part of the action.\u201cWe could have opened our company in Silicon Valley,\u201d said Mr. Takino, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOne of the good things about being in Japan is that it is very easy to find a customer.\u201dMujin\u2019s technology can appear retro at first glance. One hand-held remote looks as if it belongs with a 1990s video game console. But Mujin says its advanced components make robots more efficient and easier to use, and are hard for competitors to recreate.The sheer complexity of these Japanese specialties may help the economy maintain a competitive edge. Unlike the TVs, CD players and other consumer electronics that drove Japan\u2019s past boom, Mujin\u2019s controllers and Irie Koken\u2019s bellows are much harder for manufacturers in China and elsewhere to replicate. When the Beijing-based online retailer JD.com wanted to automate an unmanned warehouse in China, it turned to Mujin.Some of Japan\u2019s big corporations are heading in the same direction. The electronics giant Panasonic was once synonymous with televisions and videorecorders. But over the past six years, it has drastically downsized its consumer businesses \u2014 it no longer sells televisions in the United States \u2014 and shifted into industrial electronics, including the batteries for Tesla roadsters and sensors and cameras for automobiles.\u201cIt is very important to position ourselves wisely,\u201d said Yasuyuki Higuchi, chief executive of Panasonic\u2019s connected solutions unit. \u201cOtherwise, we cannot be competitive.\u201dHowever, even the most competitive sectors aren\u2019t immune from Japan\u2019s problems. Severe labor shortages are already plaguing businesses, said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at the research firm Capital Economics, who added that the country was not welcoming nearly enough foreigners to offset the impact.\u201cThe demographic headwinds will continue to resist,\u201d said Mr. Thieliant, who estimates that Japan\u2019s current spate of growth has already ended. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get more immigrants in, you eventually hit a wall.\u201dMr. Irie has struggled to find the workers he needs to fill the deluge of new orders. His customers now have to wait twice as long as usual for their bellows \u2014 up to five months. \u201cThe economy is very good, so good workers are being taken by other companies,\u201d he complained.The shortage has prodded management to invent new ways to attract talent. Mujin employs a chef to cook lunch for the staff every day. Mr. Irie in recent years has taken all of his employees on a Hawaii vacation and renovated the company\u2019s offices.\u201cThe older employees asked, \u2018Why do you have to spend money to make things stylish?\u2019\u201d Mr. Irie said. \u201cThe image of manufacturing may not be very nice. We want to change it.\u201dHe remains optimistic, too. He plans to expand the capacity of his factory in Japan over the next few years, possibly making the company\u2019s largest investment ever.\u201cWe are riding a wave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can be on this wave because we have something special.\u201dChie Kobayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Banks Adopt Military-Style Tactics to Fight Cybercrime", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byO\u2019FALLON, Mo. \u2014 In a windowless bunker here, a wall of monitors tracked incoming attacks \u2014 267,322 in the last 24 hours, according to one hovering dial, or about three every second \u2014 as a dozen analysts stared at screens filled with snippets of computer code.Pacing around, overseeing the stream of warnings, was a former Delta Force soldier who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan before shifting to a new enemy: cyberthieves.\u201cThis is not that different from terrorists and drug cartels,\u201d Matt Nyman, the command center\u2019s creator, said as he surveyed his squadron of Mastercard employees. \u201cFundamentally, threat networks operate in similar ways.\u201dThen banks grabbed the playbook. At least a dozen of them, from giants like Citigroup and Wells Fargo to regional players such as Bank of the West, have opened fusion centers in recent years, and more are in the works. Fifth Third Bank is building one in its Cincinnati headquarters, and Visa, which created its first two years ago in Virginia, is developing two more, in Britain and Singapore. Having their own intelligence hives, the banks hope, will help them better detect patterns in all the data they amass.The centers also have a symbolic purpose. Having a literal war room reinforces the new reality. Fending off thieves has always been a priority \u2014 it\u2019s why banks build vaults \u2014 but the arms race has escalated rapidly.Cybersecurity has, for many financial company chiefs, become their biggest fear, eclipsing issues like regulation and the economy.Alfred F. Kelly Jr., Visa\u2019s chief executive, is \u201ccompletely paranoid\u201d about the subject, he told investors at a conference in March. Bank of America\u2019s Brian T. Moynihan said his cybersecurity team is \u201cthe only place in the company that doesn\u2019t have a budget constraint.\u201d (The bank\u2019s chief operations and technology officer said it is spending about $600 million this year.)In the latest exercise last November, 900 participants from 50 banks, regulators and law enforcement agencies role-played their response to an industrywide infestation of malicious malware that first corrupted, and then entirely blocked, all outgoing payments from the banks. Throughout the two-day test, the organizers lobbed in new threats every few hours, like denial-of-service attacks that knocked the banks\u2019 websites offline.The first Quantum Dawn, back in 2011, was a lower-key gathering. Participants huddled in a conference room to talk through a mock attack that shut down stock trading. Now, it\u2019s a live-fire drill. Each bank spends months in advance re-creating its internal technology on an isolated test network, a so-called cyber range, so that its employees can fight with their actual tools and software. The company that runs their virtual battlefield, SimSpace, is a Defense Department contractor.Sometimes, the tests expose important gaps.If something similar happened at a bank, especially a smaller one, regulators asked, would it be able to recover? Those in the room for the drill came away uneasy.\u201cThere was a recognition that we needed to add an additional layer of resilience,\u201d said John Carlson, the chief of staff for the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the industry\u2019s main cybersecurity coordination group.The largest banks run dozens of their own, internal attack simulations each year, to smoke out their vulnerabilities and keep their first responders sharp.\u201cIt\u2019s the idea of muscle memory,\u201d said Thomas J. Harrington, Citigroup\u2019s chief information security officer, who spent 28 years with the F.B.I.Growing interest among its corporate customers in cybersecurity war games inspired IBM to build a digital range in Cambridge, Mass., where it stages data breaches for customers and prospects to practice on.One recent morning, a fictional bank called Bane & Ox was under attack on IBM\u2019s range, and two dozen real-life executives from a variety of financial companies gathered to defend it. In the training scenario, an unidentified attacker had dumped six million customer records on Pastebin, a site often used by hackers to publish stolen data caches.As the hours ticked by, the assault grew worse. The lost data included financial records and personally identifying details. One of the customers was Colin Powell, the former secretary of state. Phones in the room kept ringing with calls from reporters, irate executives and, eventually, regulators, wanting details about what had occurred.When the group figured out what computer system had been used in the leak, a heated argument broke out: Should they cut off its network access immediately? Or set up surveillance and monitor any further transmissions?At the urging of a Navy veteran who runs the cyberattack response group at a large New York bank, the group left the system connected.\u201cThose are the decisions you don\u2019t want to be making for the first time during a real attack,\u201d said Bob Stasio, IBM\u2019s cyber range operations manager and a former operations chief for the National Security Agency\u2019s cyber center. One financial company\u2019s executive team did such a poor job of talking to its technical team during a past IBM training drill, Mr. Stasio said, that he went home and canceled his credit card with them.Like many cybersecurity bunkers, IBM\u2019s foxhole has deliberately theatrical touches. Whiteboards and giant monitors fill nearly every wall, with graphics that can be manipulated by touch.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a fusion center unless you have really cool TVs,\u201d quipped Lawrence Zelvin, a former Homeland Security official who is now Citigroup\u2019s global cybersecurity head, at a recent cybercrime conference. \u201cIt\u2019s even better if they do something when you touch them. It doesn\u2019t matter what they do. Just something.\u201dJason Witty, the chief information security officer at U.S. Bank, admits that the blinking map he breaks out for customer briefings is mostly for show. But it serves a serious purpose, he said: making the command center\u2019s high-stakes work more tangible.\u201cIf you show customers the scripts you\u2019re actually running, it\u2019s just digits on a screen,\u201d Mr. Witty said. A big, colorful map is easier to grasp.Hackers stole personal information, including Social Security numbers, of more than 146 million people. The attack cost the company\u2019s chief executive and four other top managers their jobs. Who stole the data, and what they did with it, is still not publicly known. The credit bureau has spent $243 million so far cleaning up the mess.It is Mr. Nyman\u2019s job to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen at Mastercard. Walking around the company\u2019s fusion center, he describes the team\u2019s work using military slang. Its focus is \u201cleft of boom,\u201d he said \u2014 referring to the moments before a bomb explodes. By detecting vulnerabilities and attempted hacks, the analysts aim to head off an Equifax-like explosion.But the attacks keep coming. As he spoke, the dial displayed over his shoulder registered another few assaults on Mastercard\u2019s systems. The total so far this year exceeds 20 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Jail Sentences and Corporate Flameouts, China Is Tackling Its Debt", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFaced with the looming consequences of a decade-long borrowing binge, the Chinese government is intensifying its efforts stamp out risky lending and speculative froth from the world\u2019s second-largest economy. To do it, Beijing is putting the brakes on shadowy forms of underground lending and making public spectacles of the worst offenders, even as it takes steps to ensure that small investors and the broader economy are not shaken.But other signs are emerging, including loan defaults from a growing number of companies and rising interest rates for many borrowers.\u201cLike any deleveraging campaign, it is not painless,\u201d said Christopher Lee, a China credit specialist at S&P Global, said. \u201cThere will be losers.\u201d\u201cThe message there is: You guys need to clean up your own mess and sell whatever you can to fix it,\u201d Mr. Lee said.China has also clamped down on its unruly shadow banking sector, a murky area where non-bank lenders connect borrowers with those willing to lend in exchange for big returns \u2014 in many cases, small investors are unaware of potential risks. As a result of new government rules, that money is either drying up or also getting more expensive. For example, the cost of raising money through trust loans \u2014 a popular form of shadow banking in China \u2014 has risen sharply, from 7 percent to as much as 10 percent over the last 12 months, according to Mr. Lee.The impact is beginning to show.Over the last four days alone, three private Chinese companies have defaulted on debt, telling their bondholders that they cannot make repayments, according to data compiled by S&P Global. So far this year, 13 companies have defaulted on bonds, with the pace quickening in recent weeks. Defaults were rare or nonexistent in earlier years, in part because local authorities pressured lenders to forgive or extend missed payment dates to preserve jobs and keep the economy stable.\u201cThe intensified regulatory control on shadow banking activities have largely shut down this alternative financing channel,\u201d said Ivan Chung, associate managing director of Greater China credit research at the ratings agency Moody\u2019s. \u201cWeak issuers are more vulnerable to default pressure,\u201d he added.Bankruptcies have shot up, too, with new cases growing by more than half in 2017 compared with the previous year, according to a study by Orient Capital Research. In its report, the research firm said it expected to see a significant increase in defaults by Chinese companies again this year.Overall borrowing has become more expensive for many companies. Bond rates are rising, too, making it more costly for companies to tap that source of money.The Chinese government is playing a careful game. Even as it allows more defaults, last month it poured more money into the financial system to contain the potential damage.It is also sparing larger companies like Anbang. With about 35 million policyholders, Anbang could shake China\u2019s financial system if it collapsed.\u201cWith smaller companies, they are not necessarily going to step in,\u201d said Fraser Howie, a former banker in Asia and a co-writer of three books on the Chinese financial system. He added, \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is that the government is allowing some of them to fail. There are lots of private companies that are defaulting on a daily basis.\u201dAnbang said on Thursday that it had sufficient cash to meet its commitments to customers. Mr. Wu, it reiterated, is no longer its chairman. Mr. Wu\u2019s lawyer, Zhai Jian, declined to comment.The court found that Mr. Wu had illegally sold insurance products to bolster the company\u2019s financial situation. According to the prosecutors, Mr. Wu instructed employees to falsify financial statements and marketing information in an attempt to skirt regulations and raise money from the public.The sentence was a strong one given the charges, said Yan Yiming, a criminal lawyer in Shanghai. The court on Thursday also said that it had seized Mr. Wu\u2019s bank accounts, real estate and equity.Mr. Wu had initially struck a defiant tone, contesting the charges in March during his only appearance in the court. But facing a potential life sentence, Mr. Wu had pleaded guilty to the charges and asked the court to consider a lighter sentence.\u201cI repent deeply,\u201d Mr. Wu said in March in a televised statement from the court. \u201cI know and regret my crimes.\u201dCao Li contributed to reporting from Hong KongAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Rally in Nashville, Trump Links Democrats to MS-13", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNASHVILLE \u2014 President Trump accused Democrats on Tuesday of siding with brutal immigrant gang members over American citizens and implored Republican voters to turn out in November\u2019s midterm elections or risk the safety of their country.During a raucous rally in Nashville, Mr. Trump invoked fears of crimes committed by illegal immigrants, particularly by the transnational gang MS-13, to argue for stricter border policies, including his long-promised wall, and charged that Democrats were standing in the way.\u201cThey don\u2019t want the wall, they want open borders,\u201d Mr. Trump told the crowd. \u201cThey\u2019re more interested in taking care of criminals than they are in taking care of you.\u201d\u201cWhat was the name?\u201d Mr. Trump asked. \u201cAnimals!\u201d his cheering supporters screamed back.\u201cIf you want your communities to be safe, if you want your schools to be safe, if you want your country to be safe, then you must go out and get the Democrats the hell out of office,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cDemocrats have opposed every common-sense measure necessary to stop this horrendous scourge of crime, to dismantle MS-13 and to stop illegal immigration.\u201dMr. Trump was in Nashville to boost Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, who is running to succeed Senator Bob Corker, who is retiring. He savaged Phil Bredesen, the state\u2019s former Democratic governor whom Ms. Blackburn is expected to face in November, calling him \u201can absolute, total tool of Chuck Schumer,\u201d the Senate Democratic leader, and \u201cof course, the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi,\u201d he said, referring to the House Democratic leader.Both criticized Mr. Trump after he made the \u201canimals\u201d comment, and Ms. Pelosi said, \u201cYou have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person?\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s appearance in Nashville was a new phase of heightened campaign activity for the president as he looks toward the midterm elections, keeping an early focus on the deeply conservative states he won handily in 2016 and steering clear of politically competitive areas where his presence could be riskier. Ms. Blackburn has tethered herself tightly to Mr. Trump in her bid, a vital race for Republicans working to hold off Democratic attempts to seize the majority.During an hourlong performance before a huge American flag, Mr. Trump plainly relished his time in front of the cheering crowd, regaling them with stories of what he argued were unmatched successes as president, and drifting off script for brash asides.\u201cHow do you like the fact they had people infiltrating our campaign,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to a conspiracy theory he has branded \u201cSpygate,\u201d in which he argues that Democratic operatives doing the bidding of President Barack Obama spied on him to block his election. \u201cCan you imagine? People infiltrating our campaign.\u201dAn F.B.I. informant did contact members of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign team after a counterintelligence investigation into possible efforts by Moscow to interfere in the election uncovered that the aides had been communicating with Russians.He boasted of the booming economy and the large tax cuts he signed into law, arguing that he had succeeded because he had rejected the politician-speak of \u201ctax reform\u201d in favor of calling the reductions \u201ccuts.\u201dAnd he took aim at Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has brain cancer, for voting against a Republican proposal last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cSomebody turned their hand in the wrong direction,\u201d Mr. Trump said without naming Mr. McCain, referring to the senator\u2019s thumbs-down gesture indicating his \u201cno\u201d vote. \u201cThat cost our country a lot. That was a very terrible thing that happened that night.\u201dAt one point, making the case that his policies had benefited black Americans, Mr. Trump claimed incorrectly that African-Americans had supported Democrats \u201cfor over 100 years.\u201d It was not until the 1965 Voting Rights Act that the majority of African-Americans could vote, and those who could before then mostly supported Republicans until the 1930s.And at another point, Mr. Trump hinted that he would force Mexico to pay for his border wall \u2014 which officials there have flatly refused to do \u2014 using the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement as leverage.\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause a problem \u2014 I don\u2019t want to cause it \u2014 but in the end, in the end, Mexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pay for the wall, and they\u2019re going to enjoy it. O.K.?\u201dStill, Mr. Trump managed to stick to one element of his script that his aides and Republican strategists pray privately he will not forget to emphasize: a direct plea to core supporters to turn out and buck the well-established pattern whereby the president\u2019s party loses seats in midterm contests.\u201cWhen you win the presidency, for some reason, you always end up losing the House,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that it \u201cmakes absolutely no sense, but I think what happens is you get complacent.\u201d\u201cThis election is a very important one,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you have to get out. We need Marsha Blackburn to win.\u201dAn earlier version of this article cited an incorrect figure for the number of people attending President Trump\u2019s rally. While no exact figure is available, the fire marshal\u2019s office estimated that approximately 5,500 people attended the rally, not about 1,000 people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Aides Are Urging President Trump to Fire Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. Chief", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senior White House staff members are encouraging President Trump to fire Scott Pruitt, his embattled Environmental Protection Agency chief, according to two top administration officials. While Mr. Trump has until now championed Mr. Pruitt, the officials say the president\u2019s enthusiasm may be cooling because of the ongoing cascade of alleged ethical and legal missteps.But that is likely to change in the coming weeks, the two officials said.Some Republicans have said that Mr. Wheeler, a former Capitol Hill and E.P.A. staff member \u2014 known as a low-key but highly experienced Washington insider \u2014 would quite likely be as effective, and possibly more so, than Mr. Pruitt at undoing regulations, without drawing the embarrassing headlines of his boss.At the White House on Monday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, expressed confidence in Mr. Wheeler but declined to say whether Mr. Trump intended to fire Mr. Pruitt in the near future.\u201cI don\u2019t have any personnel announcements on that front,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cCertainly we have confidence in the No. 2, otherwise the president wouldn\u2019t have asked him to serve at such a senior level position within the E.P.A.\u201dMeanwhile, as the negative media reports about Mr. Pruitt continue, Mr. Trump is now likely to pay more attention, the officials said.One official said there was recognition now that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s problems were \u201ca bottomless pit.\u201d But the White House doesn\u2019t know how much more there is or what direction it could take.Privately, even many in Mr. Pruitt\u2019s inner circle at the E.P.A. have expressed frustration with their boss\u2019s actions.Mr. Pruitt\u2019s actions have tried the patience of even his staunch supporters, including some Republicans.\u201cRepublicans like what he\u2019s done, but they don\u2019t like how he\u2019s done it,\u201d said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who worked for the former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and the former majority leader Tom DeLay. \u201cHe has made some major mistakes and doesn\u2019t seem to care that much about them. They have a lot of tolerance, but it has its limits.\u201dOther administration officials have resigned over similar ethics and spending controversies.Tom Price, the former secretary of health and human services, was forced to resign last year after racking up nearly $400,000 in travel bills for chartered flights. Mr. Trump fired David J. Shulkin, the veterans affairs secretary, after an inspector general\u2019s report concluded that he had spent too much time sightseeing on official trips and had improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets as a gift.The head of the Environmental Protection Agency faces nearly a dozen federal inquiries into his practices. We break down the accusations by category.Some of the 11 federal investigations into Mr. Pruitt\u2019s behavior span a far wider range of ethics questions. The House Oversight Committee, led by Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, has opened an inquiry into Mr. Pruitt\u2019s actions at the E.P.A., the first Republican-led investigation of a Trump administration cabinet member. On May 2, Mr. Gowdy\u2019s staff began conducting transcribed, closed-door interviews with Mr. Pruitt\u2019s closest aides.Still, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s supporters, including some of Mr. Trump\u2019s most prominent friends in the coal and oil industries, note that the E.P.A. administrator, perhaps more than any cabinet member, has pushed through a policy agenda that allows Mr. Trump to claim that he is fulfilling a core campaign promise: stripping away regulations that he says stymie the growth of the American economy.\u201cAdministrator Pruitt has been the star of the Trump Administration,\u201d Mr. Murray said in a statement. \u201cHe is taking the actions necessary to reverse the illegal and destructive regulations of the Obama Administration.\u201dHarold Hamm, the chief executive of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma-based oil and gas company, who has advised Mr. Trump and championed Mr. Pruitt, has told people close to the White House that he continues to support the E.P.A. leader.Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who advised the Trump campaign and is running for Senate, told Mr. Pruitt, \u201cI think the greatest sin that you\u2019ve committed, if any, is that you have actually done what President Trump ran on, what he won on, and what he has commissioned you to do in finding some balance in both carrying out the mission of environmental protection, while at the same time looking over economy and jobs creation.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave the wrong home state for Representative Kevin Cramer, who advised the Trump campaign and is running for Senate.

{"Headline": "Malaysia Finds an Unlikely Champion of Democracy: Its Ex-Strongman", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe story line is a familiar one these days: A populist strongman with a long record of racially divisive commentary prevails in the polls.Instead, Mr. Mahathir was at the head of a multiethnic opposition that ousted a government long dependent on stoking the fears of Malaysia\u2019s Malay Muslim majority to prolong its grip on power. That Mr. Mahathir, 92, had for decades toughened the network of race and patronage that contributed to Malaysia\u2019s political sclerosis is just one of the many surprises of the national elections on Wednesday.\u201cIt has produced a multiracial \u2014 not Malay or Chinese \u2014 tsunami of protest against the corruption, economic mismanagement and abuse of political power,\u201d said Lim Teck Ghee, a public policy analyst and author of the book \u201cChallenging the Status Quo in Malaysia.\u201d \u201cIt has avoided racial and religious rancor and acrimony, which would have left a contentious and dangerous aftermath.\u201dFew people expected Mr. Mahathir\u2019s opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan \u2014 an unwieldy collection of reformists, nationalists, Islamists, ethnic minorities and former enemies of Mr. Mahathir \u2014 to hold together, much less shatter an entrenched political system that has held sway in Malaysia since independence from Britain in 1957.\u201cAfter independence, this is probably the most important occasion in our political history,\u201d said Wan Saiful Wan Jan, a longtime political analyst who ran unsuccessfully for Parliament in this election. \u201cIt paves the way for political competition.\u201dAlthough people-power revolutions late in the last century resulted in the overthrow of dictators like Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Suharto of Indonesia, strongman rule has returned in force to Southeast Asia.President Rodrigo Duterte has kick-started a drug war in the Philippines that has killed thousands, while Prime Minister Hun Sen has systematically destroyed even the semblance of a political opposition in Cambodia. Thailand has reverted to military rule, with elections repeatedly postponed. Generals in Myanmar continue to call the shots as they have unleashed a campaign of ethnic cleansing. Brunei remains an isolated sultanate.At one time, Mr. Mahathir might have been more suited to the hall of infamy that included Asia\u2019s despots and junta chiefs. During his years as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, Mr. Mahathir muzzled the media, jailed his opponents on what were seen as trumped-up charges and turned a blind eye as leaders of the governing National Front coalition personally profited from their political positions. His virulent Malay nationalism alienated Malaysia\u2019s sizable Chinese and Indian minorities.In this week\u2019s elections, Mr. Mahathir delivered Malaysia\u2019s first post-ethnic vote, attracting Malaysians of all backgrounds to the opposition.\u201cWe\u2019ve talked so long about different categories of Malaysians, all these boxes of people,\u201d said Fahmi Fadzil, who won a parliamentary seat for the opposition People\u2019s Justice Party despite extensive government gerrymandering in his district. \u201cThis election is about uniting us, not dividing us.\u201dEven some of his fiercest enemies have come to see Mr. Mahathir in a different light.\u201cI trust him today because at this time and age, he is more interested in leaving the right legacy for Malaysians and to set his record right in the history books,\u201d said Tony Pua, an opposition member of Parliament who was re-elected Wednesday with a record number of votes. \u201cIf wealth and power were his ambitions, there are much easier routes he could have taken.\u201dStill, Mr. Mahathir is an unlikely avatar of democracy, particularly one in which diversity is championed.More than anything, what bound Pakatan Harapan, Mr. Mahathir\u2019s coalition, was revulsion for his predecessor, Najib Razak, who has been tainted by accusations of immense greed and graft during his nine years as prime minister.Mr. Najib, once Mr. Mahathir\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, stands accused of diverting $731 million from a state investment fund he controlled into his own bank accounts. His own government had cleared him of any wrongdoing. But Mr. Mahathir said after the vote that Mr. Najib would have to face the consequences.\u201cOur intention is to go for people who have shown a tendency to be corrupt,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said Friday.During his earlier stint as prime minister, Mr. Mahathir perpetuated an affirmative action scheme for Malays that was designed to erase the long years of discrimination under British colonial rule. The policy gave \u201csons of the soil,\u201d as Malays and indigenous people are known, preferential treatment in education and employment. Most civil service jobs went to Malays.But as Malaysia developed into a middle-income country, members of the Chinese and Indian communities wondered why so much of the economy was reserved for Malays. Others worried that affirmative action was making Malays complacent and unable to compete in a free market. A brain drain of talented Chinese and Indians robbed the country of some of its best talent.Mr. Mahathir\u2019s enduring charisma and rapier speech energized the opposition, all the more so given his advanced age. During the campaign, he avoided the language of Malay superiority. At news conferences, he joked with reporters and teased opposition figures who had been political prisoners under his tenure.Yet his decades of intolerant sentiments have left some wary.\u201cWhere some see sharp wit, I see red flags that the old Mahathir is still recognizable under it all,\u201d said Lainie Yeoh, a marketing director in Kuala Lumpur, the capital.\u201cMalaysians have gone through such a painful time,\u201d said Mr. Anwar\u2019s daughter Nurul Izzah Anwar, who was re-elected to Parliament. \u201cAnwar Ibrahim has gone through so much. Now we need to show that we will reject the divisiveness of the past and embrace inclusiveness for all Malaysians.\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be a democracy. Let\u2019s act that way.\u201dAustin Ramzy and Sharon Tan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Then the studio audience applauds as an effervescent host opens an episode of China\u2019s latest prime-time entertainment.\u201cMarx Got It Right\u201d is among the party\u2019s attempts to impart that lesson to younger people who grew up absorbed in their smartphones rather than \u201cThe Communist Manifesto\u201d or Mao Zedong\u2019s \u201cLittle Red Book.\u201d\u201cFor some, Marx is just an image of someone who always has a big beard, and Marxism is just a bunch of concepts or a few exam questions,\u201d Wu Xuelan, the show\u2019s host, told the audience of clean-cut students. \u201cToday, I want to ask everyone: Do you really understand Marx and Marxism?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very happy that so many young friends from everywhere across the country are here with us to relive in stories the arduous times when Marx composed \u2018Das Kapital,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Wu. \u201cIn modern human history, Marxism will come to the fore during every great crisis or turning point, and a classic indicator of this is Marx\u2019s \u2018Das Kapital.\u2019\u201dWhen Ms. Wu asked who had read the book, one or two hands poked up. But Ms. Wu had an answer for any students who took capitalists like Jack Ma or Steve Jobs as their heroes and needed convincing to dive in.\u201cMedia reports have said that if Marx was still alive today, he would be a wealthy man from the royalties\u201d from sales of \u201cDas Kapital,\u201d she said.Laughter and banter are rare in each earnest, 33-minute episode. But the show uses cartoons and folksy examples to argue that Marx discovered fundamental truths about how societies evolve, and that China remains shaped by Marx\u2019s egalitarian ideals.While Mr. Xi has tried to woo foreign investors, he has also tried carve a distinctive ideology \u2014 part old-school Communist values, part earthy appeals to ancient Chinese tradition \u2014 that inoculates China from the tumult of free markets and liberal democracy. The Chinese Communist Party these days rarely mentions class struggle, and has embraced markets since Deng Xiaoping\u2019s era in the 1980s.Even so, leaders insist that China stays above the ruthless rules of capitalism. Above all, they emphasize that Marxism means keeping their one-party rule.\u201cMarx Got It Right\u201d makes that point by showing the global financial crisis of 2008, the bitter divisions of American politics and the tumult of Brexit, while saying that China has remained stable and growing thanks to one-party socialism held together by the ideals of Marx.\u201cI feel that China now is very safe, full of vitality and very prosperous,\u201d one student said, followed by other students praising China\u2019s growth, innovation and stability.By contrast, the show blames the collapse of the Soviet bloc on reformist politicians like Mikhail S. Gorbachev who abandoned Marxist-Leninist orthodoxies.\u201cThe failure of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was not the failure of scientific socialism,\u201d Jiang Hui, a Marxist scholar in Beijing, said on the show. \u201cOn the contrary, it was their deviation from Marxism and scientific socialism that led to their failure.\u201dOutside the tightly scripted television studio, Chinese people have voiced more skepticism about \u201cMarx Got It Right.\u201d On Zhihu, a popular Chinese website for posting questions and comments, users mocked the show\u2019s canned applause and the stilted back and forth between students and professors.No such doubts creep into \"Marx Got It Right.\u201d\u201cThe influence of Marxism hasn\u2019t shrunk,\u201d Ms. Wu says. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s growing ever stronger.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}

I believe the answer is both cultural and economic. It may ultimately be an unsolvable debate, but it\u2019s still an important one, because it speaks to how other politicians should try to defeat Trump.\u201cIn the world\u2019s largest cities, where populations are densely concentrated and growing, economies are generally thriving and cosmopolitanism is embraced.

{"Headline": "U.S. Pullout From Iran Nuclear Deal May Unsettle Oil Markets", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal has so far had no more than a muted effect on oil and gasoline prices. But that could easily change.The full impact on global oil markets may not be seen for weeks or months. It will depend on how tightly the administration enforces new sanctions on Iran, and whether the entire deal collapses or can somehow be salvaged. That may well depend on the responses of a diverse cast of geopolitical actors from Moscow to Beijing to New Delhi since the United States imports no oil directly from Iran.A cascade of unpredictable events may follow the administration\u2019s action, one that could ultimately lead to compromise. If not, there could be even greater instability across the Middle East and possibly an oil-price spike.The biggest wild card is how Iran will respond.For additional leverage, Iran could unleash allied militias based in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen against Israel and Saudi Arabia. A blockade or mining of the Strait of Hormuz, a choke point for global oil trade on the Persian Gulf, would be the ultimate retaliation that could send global oil prices soaring if tensions in the region rise.\u201cOil could go up $10 a barrel, but it\u2019s all unpredictable,\u201d said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, a Houston-based oil service company that operates in Egypt and Iraq. \u201cThe Iranians could do anything and go berserk, or they could have cool heads and work with the Europeans and the Russians.\u201dOil prices rose more than 3 percent on Wednesday, pushing West Texas intermediate crude, the United States benchmark, above $71 a barrel. They had already risen by more than 14 percent since the beginning of the year, in part because traders anticipated the Trump administration would withdraw from the deal.What happens in Iran, a leading producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is critical to global energy markets.Iran currently contributes roughly 3.8 million of the 98 million barrels of oil produced daily worldwide. Most energy experts say that a revival of American sanctions on banks and other companies that do business with Iran could reduce Iranian production and exports by at least 10 to 15 percent, and that drop could take six months or more to be felt.The restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program under the deal could survive.That would be far less than the decline engineered by multinational sanctions from 2012 to 2015, and less than the decline in Venezuelan production in recent years.Roughly 40 percent of Iranian oil exports go to China and India, two countries thirsty for more energy that are unlikely to follow Mr. Trump\u2019s lead on this issue. The two countries could even increase their imports, absorbing as much as 150,000 more barrels a day, according to a recent report by Barclays.Europe is another major importer of Iranian oil, and France, Germany and Britain strongly urged Mr. Trump to reconsider his decision.Some European refiners might slash their Iranian imports, especially those with large interests in the United States. European banks might refuse to finance trade with Iran, which could also reduce oil exports.After the nuclear deal was signed in 2015, the United States waived a law that imposed sanctions on foreign banks of countries that do not reduce Iranian oil imports. That waiver will expire on Saturday, although how far Washington will push to enforce the sanctions remains to be seen.European governments are not expected to reimpose some of their strongest sanctions, like barring insurance on Iranian oil shipments, which essentially blacklisted the transportation of Iranian oil.Those sanctions were some of the most effective in reducing Iranian oil exports from 2.5 million barrels a day in 2011 to one million barrels a day in January 2013. Iranian exports have now recovered to 2011 levels.\u201cCompliance with unilateral U.S. sanctions would be much more difficult to enforce than the multilateral measures implemented in 2012,\u201d said Paul Sheldon, an S&P Platts Global Analytics associate director.Iran had hoped that the nuclear deal would increase foreign investment, especially in its aging oil fields, but the impact has been limited so far. European oil executives say American withdrawal from the deal will slow investment further. That in turn will limit global supplies.\u201cThere are enormous resources in Iran,\u201d said Eldar Saetre, chief executive of Statoil, the Norwegian oil giant. \u201cThe global oil and gas demand is growing every year and that demand has to be supplied from somewhere.\u2019\u2019Results of the administration\u2019s move are hard to predict, and some may hurt American interests. Higher oil prices could help Iran compensate for its loss of export volumes. If European imports of Iranian oil drop, that could help Russia earn more cash from exports.Higher energy prices could hurt summer drivers and depress American tourism or even slow the global economy.The administration seems sanguine about the outlook. \u201cWe\u2019ve had various conversations with various parties about different parties that would be willing to increase oil supply to offset this,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters on Tuesday in Washington. \u201cMy expectation is not that oil prices go higher, to a certain extent some of this was already in the market on oil prices.\u201dSaudi Arabia has spare production capacity and may well want to take markets away from Iran, especially in Asia. But the country has worked hard to limit supplies to drive prices up, in part to make the proposed initial public offering of Saudi Aramco more attractive.Predicting where oil prices may go is often likened to a fool\u2019s game.In a note published on Tuesday, Steve Wood, Moody\u2019s managing director for oil and gas, even predicted that oil prices would eventually decline from current levels.\u201cNotwithstanding heightened geopolitical risks,\u201d Mr. Wood said, \u201cwe expect oil prices will likely stay in the $45-to-$65 per barrel range over the medium term as non-OPEC production grows.\u201dGoldman Sachs recently estimated that a six-month loss of 250,000 Iranian barrels a day could raise oil prices by $3.50 a barrel over its summer forecast of $82.50 for Brent crude, the international benchmark. (Its price on Wednesday was slightly above $77.)That is a relatively small increase, but Iran is only one of several flash points where political tensions may reduce crude supplies.Oil production is collapsing in Venezuela, battles between warlords puts output at risk in Libya, while disruptions during elections in Nigeria later this year could interrupt petroleum flows. Altogether, a major disruption and spike in prices is possible even if American shale drillers push up their production and Western countries release significant amounts of oil from their strategic reserves.A rising oil price naturally follows rising tensions in the region.\u201cIf Iran threatens to resume nuclear testing and the U.S. is concerned,\u201d said Gerald Bailey, president of Petroteq Energy, a Canadian company, with long experience in the Middle East oil patch, \u201cany type of confrontation will drive the prices up, even more especially if words or confrontation turn to action.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Is Poised to Impose Steel and Aluminum Tariffs on European Union", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe White House has tried to leverage the tariffs to get Canada and Mexico to agree to its demands on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and it has pressured Europe to make trade concessions on other fronts, including cutting the amount of metals the bloc exports to the United States.So far, the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive approach appears to have only hardened the resolve among the United States\u2019 closest allies to fight back against Mr. Trump\u2019s demands.Discussions between the countries are continuing and Mr. Trump could ultimately decide not to impose tariffs on any of the trading partners. But with the exemption deadline quickly approaching and the countries still far apart on many issues, a resolution could be tough to pull off by Friday.The European Union, Canada and Mexico \u2014 all of which were granted temporary exemptions from the metal tariffs \u2014 said they were unsure whether the tariffs would go into effect on Friday, but were readying retaliatory measures that would impose equal harm on American consumers and businesses in case they are triggered.Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, said she had met Wednesday with the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, to discuss the tariffs, as well as Nafta. \u201cI would like to absolutely assure Canadians, particularly those who work in steel and aluminum industries, that the government is absolutely prepared to and will defend Canadian interests and Canadian jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will respond appropriately.\u201dThe mood from Europe, where officials have refused to agree to a quota that would reduce their exports, appeared even darker. \u201cHopefully, we will be able to have a positive agenda with the U.S. side, with no tariffs or quotas,\u201d Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, told the European Parliament on Tuesday. \u201cRealistically, however, we do not think we can hope for that.\u201dThe Trump administration has insisted that trading partners either accept the tariffs or commit to voluntarily restraining their own metal exports with quotas.The administration warned that this round of exemptions would be the final one, raising the prospect that the penalties would go into effect.Eswar Prasad, a trade expert at Cornell University, said the June 1 deadline highlighted \u201cthe Trump administration\u2019s view that bullying and overt threats, including imposition of tariffs and repudiation of longstanding agreements, are the best approach to gaining leverage in trade negotiations.\u201dMr. Prasad said that any success would be short-lived.\u201cAny short-term wins gained through such threats are likely to be more than negated by the rising perception, even among longstanding allies, that the U.S. has become an unreliable and untrustworthy trading partner,\u201d he said.The United States now faces tough trade fights on nearly every possible front. The Trump administration is locked in a contentious trade spat with China, and last week, the White House announced that it would start an investigation that could lead to sweeping tariffs on imported automobiles, a major driver of the American economy.Like the steel and aluminum tariffs, the auto tariffs would hinge on the idea that imports are threatening American national security. Trump administration officials have said that similar investigations could be started on a suite of other products \u2014 making trading partners wary that any concessions they offer today to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs would not be the last ones Mr. Trump asks for.It is also sowing uncertainty among supporters of the tariffs, who say temporary exemptions make it hard for domestic companies to plan.\u201cI don\u2019t think that these temporary exemptions can continue much longer,\u201d said Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which supported the tariffs. \u201cThe conversations I have with people out in places like Ohio, they can manage a lot of scenarios, they just need to know what they\u2019re dealing with in the long term.\u201dOn Wednesday, hours before the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, was scheduled to meet with Ms. Malmstrom about the tariffs, he told an audience at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that he believed that discussions could continue if the penalties were imposed.\u201cThere can be negotiations with or without tariffs in place. There are plenty of tariffs the E.U. has on us. It\u2019s not that we can\u2019t talk just because there\u2019s tariffs,\u201d Mr. Ross said, adding that China had not used that as an excuse not to negotiate. \u201cIt\u2019s only the E.U. that is insisting we can\u2019t negotiate if there are tariffs.\u201dThe European Union has proposed a limited trade deal focused mainly on industrial goods and government procurement, which would allow both parties to cut their tariffs on automobiles \u2014 a frequent focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 to zero.The European bloc is also prepared to agree to buy large volumes of liquefied natural gas from the United States while joining with the Trump administration to press to alter the rules of the dispute settlement system at the World Trade Organization \u2014 a longstanding American goal.But the European Commission has held firm on refusing to deliver that without a permanent exemption from the metals tariffs. And the European Union has already outlined a list of American products it is prepared to retaliate against with its own tariffs if it does not win an exemption.Mexican officials were also planning to retaliate with their own limits on American imports should tariffs on steel and aluminum be imposed. The country has readied a file of products from politically important parts of the United States, though, unlike Europe, it has not announced the list of products publicly. Among those would most likely be agricultural products exported from the Midwest, where a part of Mr. Trump\u2019s political base lives.Peter Goodman, Elisabeth Malkin and Ian Austen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Pauses Huge Development Plans in Seattle Over Tax Plan", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon abruptly escalated a fight with its hometown on Wednesday, halting major expansion plans in Seattle because of a tax being considered by the City Council.The new tax would charge large employers in the city about $500 per employee, with the money going to help alleviate a housing crisis. The tax is squarely aimed at Amazon, which is Seattle\u2019s largest employer and frequently blamed by many residents for the city\u2019s soaring housing costs.The company said it would halt construction of a new building it was planning to erect downtown and reconsider occupying another that is already under construction, putting 7,000 or more jobs in jeopardy.Late Wednesday morning, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said that \u201cpending the outcome of the head tax vote by City Council, Amazon has paused all construction planning\u201d on a large building in downtown Seattle that was scheduled to begin construction later this year. Mr. Herdener also said Amazon was \u201cevaluating options\u201d to lease out space it had planned to use in another building that is already going up elsewhere downtown.\u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about the impact this decision will have on a large range of jobs \u2014 from our building trades, to restaurant workers, to nurses, manufacturing jobs and tech workers,\u201d said Mayor Jenny Durkan. \u201cAt the same time, our city must urgently address our homelessness and affordability crisis and lift up those who have been left behind.\u201dAmazon\u2019s decision comes as officials in other communities across the country are jockeying to bring Amazon\u2019s business to town. The company is shopping for a second headquarters elsewhere in North America, saying it has outgrown Seattle. And just this week it announced plans to hire thousands more employees in Vancouver and Boston.Amazon, Seattle\u2019s largest employer with more than 45,000 local employees, would owe $20 million to $30 million annually from the head tax and perhaps significantly more when the payroll tax kicks in.For months, Amazon has been quietly lobbying behind the scenes against the tax proposal. Its unexpected announcement could be nothing more than a negotiating tactic to help extract concessions from the council.Mike O\u2019Brien, a member of the Seattle City Council, said Amazon representatives told him on Wednesday morning that they were pausing their expansion projects in the city, without leaving room for discussion.\u201cThey\u2019re not really asking for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just telling us what they\u2019re going to do.\u201dMr. O\u2019Brien said Amazon should not be solely blamed for the homeless problem in Seattle, but that the company bears some responsibility. \u201cFrom my point of view, we have a crisis in our town around housing affordability and homelessness,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re closely related and it\u2019s related to the booming tech industry in Seattle.\u201dHe added, \u201cI need to run a city that has room for prosperous businesses, but doesn\u2019t do it at the expense of people getting pushed into poverty.\u201dGreg Johnson, the president of Wright Runstad & Co., a development firm that is constructing the building that Amazon said it may lease out, said an Amazon executive told him of the plans on Tuesday night. Amazon has a lease for about 720,000 square feet in the 58-story tower.\u201cWhat\u2019s troubling is the 4,500 people Amazon was going to put in the building, they\u2019re now considering elsewhere, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s elsewhere in Seattle,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.After years of criticism for being disengaged from the civic life of its hometown, Amazon has in recent years attempted to show a more compassionate side in Seattle. It has agreed to allow a homeless shelter for families, Mary\u2019s Place, to occupy space rent-free in another building that it is putting up. That is one of several buildings that Amazon still intends to complete.Amazon\u2019s search for a second headquarters has also fanned criticism of the company, in large part because of the hefty tax incentives many of the 20 finalist locations have offered in an attempt to lure the company.Mr. O\u2019Brien, the Seattle city council member, described Amazon\u2019s search as shopping around to see which city will give it the best deal. \u201cWe need companies that want to locate in a city and are willing to work together,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Insists Making Poor People Work Lifts Them Up. Where\u2019s the Proof?", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThere\u2019s something almost eerie about the unwavering nature of the Republican system of belief.The nationalists who propelled President Trump into office may appear locked in an existential battle with the party\u2019s pro-trade globalists. In truth, the Republican Party is still driven by the two propositions that have guided it for decades: cutting government aid will free poor Americans to shake dependency and get ahead, and cutting taxes on the well-to-do will bring prosperity to all.History, however, has proved that this doctrine, too, is mostly wrong. We have been here before, more than 20 years ago, when the embattled President Bill Clinton embraced the Republicans\u2019 \u201cwelfare to work\u201d strategy and replaced the federal program to aid poor families with children with a rash of state-managed programs that imposed stringent work requirements on beneficiaries.Work requirements did, of course, encourage the mostly poor single mothers of able body and mind who did not already hold a job to get one. Their earnings from work increased. As they left the welfare rolls, government spending on welfare payments declined.Young children did no worse when their mothers got jobs in terms of either cognitive abilities or socialization skills. But unless the mothers\u2019 incomes rose, they did no better either. Mothers who for some reason could not get a job \u2014 or go on disability \u2014 got a raw deal.\u201cOn welfare, Angie was a low-income single mother, raising her children in a dangerous neighborhood in a household roiled by chaos,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t pay the bills. She drank lots of beer. And her kids needed a father. Off welfare, she was a low-income single mother, raising her children in a dangerous neighborhood in a household roiled by chaos. She couldn\u2019t pay the bills. She drank lots of beer. And her kids needed a father.\u201d\u201cWhat is crucial to understand is what we mean by success,\u201d said Gordon Berlin, who runs the policy analysis firm MDRC. \u201cIs the goal of welfare about reducing poverty or about reducing dependency?\u201dMaybe this shouldn\u2019t be surprising. For all the lofty pronouncements surrounding the 1996 welfare reform, Mr. Clinton\u2019s goals were political: \u201cto remove welfare from national political attention so that it would no longer cost the Democrats votes,\u201d as Christopher Jencks of Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government noted.Research into the potential effects of ending welfare as America then knew it seems to have played only a bit role.What motivates Republicans today? Raw dogma? They cannot be hoping to pay for their tax cuts by cutting nutrition benefits. Other than Medicare and Social Security, there is no program in the meager social safety net with enough money to pay for those.Let\u2019s assume, for the sake of argument, that the president and congressional Republicans honestly want to tweak welfare to improve the lot of poor Americans; to build a safety net that revolves around work but also provides help when work can\u2019t be had.There is, in fact, a lot of research on what works and what doesn\u2019t. Much of it was carried out by MDRC, which starting in the late 1980s conducted more than a dozen experiments in cities around the country to explore the consequences of different paths from welfare to work.Advertisement"}

Focus groups detected the same underlying theme that had motivated the Reagan Democrats more than 30 years before: a view of America as divided between \u201cus\u201d \u2014 white, struggling and aggrieved \u2014 and a nonwhite \u201cthem.\u201dIn a place that is more than 80 percent white, Mr. Trump\u2019s Democrats share \u201cpretty powerful feelings about race, foreignness and Islam that lead them to see white people as victims in a country feeling increasingly foreign to many of them,\u201d the study noted.Whether Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed barriers against imports and immigrants found support because of a sense of racial threat or out of distress over the loss of manufacturing jobs to China and other countries, ethnic unease is clearly shaping American politics and policy.As the American demographic profile continues to shift, pitting a shrinking population of older, non-Hispanic whites against growing cohorts of younger and poorer minorities, will many whites continue to support a liberal America \u2014 comfortable with globalization, open to trade and immigration? Or will they deploy their considerable political power to stop it?Even those most opposed to liberal trade, he said, were hardly more likely to vote for Mr. Trump than they were four years earlier to vote for the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, a free-trade advocate. Voters with the most negative feelings about blacks, Muslims and immigrants, by contrast, shifted their vote toward the Republican candidate.President Trump\u2019s tariffs against steel and aluminum imports, designed to protect blue-collar workers, could instead undermine their livelihood.Shahrzad Sabet, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, notes that people who are reminded of the demographic shift tend to support more conservative positions even on race-neutral issues such as oil drilling and funding for the military.Over the long term, diversity may increase the political support for globalization. Demographic change does not threaten minorities as it does white Americans. They never held whites\u2019 position of power. For Hispanics and Asian-Americans, specifically, demographic change translates as more clout. Research by Ms. Mutz finds that minorities view trade and international outsourcing much more favorably than white Americans do.Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University, suggests that demographic change will most likely relax racial and ethnic divisions. Not only is intermarriage rising, but current racial definitions are also unlikely to hold. The question is what is going to happen between now and then.\u201cThere might be a period coming up where some whites resist the expansion of the concept of majority,\u201d Mr. Cherlin acknowledged.Ms. Mutz detects an increase in white Americans\u2019 sense of threat between 2012 and 2016, probably linked to the presence of a black president. Benjamin Enke, an economist at Harvard University who studies the evolution of cultural biases, also suggests that feelings of \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d may be on the rise.To what extent could policy break down the barriers of ethnic hostility and mistrust? A good economy would help. Racial differences rise to the top of voters\u2019 minds when the economy falters, heating up both the competition for jobs and the debate over the use of tax dollars. By contrast, economists suggest, racial attitudes take a back seat in better economic times.Mr. Greenberg\u2019s pollsters visited Macomb County in 2008, too. Race and immigration didn\u2019t come up nearly as stridently then. Voters\u2019 anger was directed primarily at corporations, so willing to send jobs offshore, rather than at minorities.\u201cHad I administered a test on racism, they would have scored badly,\u201d Mr. Greenberg told me. \u201cI\u2019m sure their racial identity was just as strong in 2008 and 2012, but despite those attitudes they voted for Obama twice.\u201dBut though Macomb\u2019s voters may prove that race does not necessarily beat every other card, their evolution suggests that voting based on racial fears is not going to disappear soon.One lesson of the 2016 election is that it is easy to exploit racial mistrust, xenophobia and ethnic hostility for political gain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When All Else Fails, Tax Incentives Probably Will, Too", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneTimothy J. Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., estimates that eight of every 10 new jobs will be filled by outsiders. While the new workers will pay taxes, most of the revenue will be spent on public services for a growing population. And the incentives themselves will blow a hole in state and local budgets, draining resources that would be better invested in, say, public education.So why does everybody do it? State and local government spending on tax incentives like those offered by Wisconsin and New Jersey has increased sharply since 1990, to about $45 billion in 2015, by Mr. Bartik\u2019s count. It amounts to roughly all the money that state governments collect from corporate income taxes.Is this just about opportunistic politicians dipping into state coffers so they can be photographed cutting the ribbon at a spanking new factory? I wouldn\u2019t doubt it. But I would also suggest another, more troublesome motivation: desperation. Fiscal incentives are one of few tools for cities like Racine and Newark to create jobs.Whether Racine or Newark, Indianapolis or Detroit, Decatur, Ohio, or Bethlehem, Pa., too many of the cities that built the United States into an industrial power through the first two-thirds of the 20th century still haven\u2019t figured out how to recover from the blow that knocked them over in the third.Racine County, once a healthy manufacturing hub churning out household cleaners, radiators for Caterpillar rigs and the like, has spent a good part of the last 35 years in a funk. Since 1970 it has lost nearly a fourth of its factory jobs, while jobs over all have grown at less than half the national pace. Household incomes in the middle of the distribution have shrunk 14 percent, adjusted for inflation.Of the 45 metropolitan areas in the Northeast, 27 have experienced what they call \u201cchronic distress\u201d since the late 1970s, with much slower job growth than in the country as a whole for an extended period. In the Midwest, 33 of 90 metropolitan areas have suffered the same fate. And fewer than half of these distressed areas have managed to snap out of their stagnation.This is a new problem for the American economy. Through the 1970s, the income gap between rich and poor regions narrowed significantly. It was rare to find areas of persistently high unemployment. Workers moved to high-wage areas. Investment flowed to poor places where wages were lower.In the face of persistent stagnation across a broad swath of the country, economists are reconsidering their longstanding objection to place-based policies, directed at improving the conditions of a local economy.Job growth has lagged, as has overall economic growth. \u201cAmerica appears to be evolving into durable islands of wealth and poverty,\u201d the authors conclude. And that raises a sort of intractable question: What is the appropriate policy tool to bring a decaying industrial island back to life?Mr. Bartik argues that government initiatives can help to clean up environmentally damaged industrial sites, improve transportation infrastructure and train workers in the skills that local employers seek. So can offering technical assistance to help small businesses develop.\u201cYou need to invest in services that increase local businesses\u2019 productivity,\u201d he told me.Count me with the pessimists. I agree with Mr. Bartik\u2019s ultimate proposition. But I doubt that a new airport or a few new roads or some technical assistance for small businesses can achieve the productivity jolt that the Rust Belt needs. And no amount of training will work if there are no local jobs to be had.\u201cA variety of things can make things somewhat better,\u201d Professor Wolman told me, but \u201cexplicit policies don\u2019t have much to do with whether you are going to be able to claw your way out of chronic distress.\u201dThe grand solution \u2014 of course \u2014 is investing in human capital. Study after study finds that areas with more educated work forces perform better. They earn higher wages and are more nimble in adapting to economic change.But \u201cinvest in education\u201d is hardly a prescription that Racine can simply pick up and run with. Indeed, solutions are easier to state than to carry out.\u201cChronically distressed regions need to regenerate through diversification, entrepreneurship and innovation,\u201d Professor Wolman and his co-authors argue. \u201cBut these are more aspirations than strategies or policies.\u201dThe old expectations of the industrial heartland \u2014 about wages and benefits, about career ladders and job stability \u2014 are no longer valid. The region\u2019s social contract, which promised a decent job to anybody who wanted one, has been ripped up. But nothing has yet been put in its place.As decrepit industrial enclaves wait for some new deal to replace the yanked promises of their glory days, one might forgive the billion-dollar incentives with which they try to recapture their lost prosperity. As Professor Wolman put it, incentives might be a bad idea from the standpoint of overall welfare. But \u201cif I were a state government,\u201d he said, \u201cI would be trying like mad to attract Amazon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Burrows, a Brooklyn College professor who shared the Pulitzer Prize for the magisterial narrative \u201cGotham: A History of New York City to 1898,\u201d died on Friday at his home in Huntington, N.Y., on Long Island. He was 74.The cause was Parkinson\u2019s disease, his daughter, Kate Burrows, said.Professor Burrows\u2019s passion for history was piqued when he was in college. (At least he found it more penetrable than his original major, physics).While he was not a New York native, at Columbia he developed a fervor for \u201cGotham\u201d \u2014 the name for New York adopted in the early 19th century by Washington Irving, after the English village whose inhabitants had feigned madness to fool the king\u2019s tax collectors.During graduate school, Professor Burrows explored Upper Manhattan, including the 18th-century Dyckman Farmhouse Museum, whose board he later joined. He also collaborated with Professor Wallace, a classmate, on \u201cThe American Revolution: The Ideology and Psychology of National Liberation,\u201d an article published in the 1972 volume of the annual \u201cPerspectives in American History,\u201d edited by Donald Fleming and Bernard Bailyn.He added: \u201cCareerwise, New York City has given me so many fascinating subjects for historical research as well as an unequaled array of libraries and archives. The only downside is that colleagues in other fields get to travel to exotic places like Paris or Cairo.\u201cMe,\u201d he said, \u201cI get to ride the subway.\u201dEdwin Gwynne Burrows, who was known as Ted, was born on May 15, 1943, in Detroit to Edwin Gladding Burrows, a radio broadcaster and poet, and Gwenyth (Lemon) Burrows, a social worker.He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Michigan in 1964 and a doctorate from Columbia University, where he studied under the historians Eric McKitrick, who chronicled the evolution of the American republic, and Richard Hofstadter, who won the Pulitzer Prize twice.He began teaching at Brooklyn College in 1972. In 1978 he married Patricia Adamski, who is now the senior vice president for planning and administration at Hofstra University on Long Island and a law-school professor there. In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by their son, Matthew, and two brothers, David and Daniel.Professor Burrows\u2019s first book, drawn from his doctoral dissertation on Albert Gallatin, the treasury secretary under Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, was titled \u201cGallatin and the Political Economy of Republicanism\u201d (1986).Well before that, he and Professor Wallace, who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the City University Graduate Center, began writing a history of American capitalism.Even the more manageable version, with Professor Burrows focusing primarily on the 16th and 17th centuries, took them nearly two decades to complete.\u201c \u2018Gotham\u2019 ended in 1898 if for no other reason than because we had surpassed the limits of bindery technology,\u201d Professor Wallace said. (The year also provided a natural endpoint; 1898 was when a consolidated five-borough New York City, including Brooklyn, was born.) \u201cTed delivered his part, and I just kept going garrulously,\u201d he added.In an email on Monday, Professor Wallace wrote, \u201cTed fashioned a masterful synthesis of New York\u2019s colonial and revolutionary history, webbing together a generation\u2019s worth of economic, political, social and cultural studies, into an engaging and mellifluous narrative, hailed by scholars and citizens alike.\u201dProfessor Burrows never viewed history as a dead discipline to be dredged up episodically for anniversary commemorations. Rather, he considered it living, relevant and contextual.\u201cI have refrained from drawing parallels to contemporary events, but I will not be sorry if readers find themselves thinking about Abu Ghraib and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, about the evasion of habeas corpus, about official denials and cover-ups, about the arrogance and stupidity that can come with the exercise of great power.\u201dHe added, \u201cI hope they will also see that once upon a time, when the country was young, our own experience with prisoner abuse led us to believe that we are supposed to do better.\u201dIn 2000, Professor Burrows was elected a fellow of the Society of American Historians.After he retired from Brooklyn College in 2013, he was asked what he had enjoyed most about teaching there.\u201cThat\u2019s easy,\u201d he replied. \u201cMy students. Most of them are the first in their families to attend college, many are first- or second-generation immigrants from all over the world, and they all approach college with well-placed, street-savvy skepticism.\u201cFrom them,\u201d he added, \u201cI learned everything I know about teaching.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Won\u2019t Play in This World Cup. It Still Hopes to Profit.", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyWhen the World Cup opens in Moscow on June 14, soccer fans may notice something out of the ordinary. Alongside the slick ad campaigns for famous global brands \u2014 Visa, Adidas, Coca-Cola \u2014 there will be a proliferation of pitches from obscure companies with names like Mengniu, Vivo and Wanda. These newly minted World Cup sponsors aren\u2019t selling much that is related to soccer; these three, for example, trade in dairy products, electric scooters and movie theaters. They all come from a country, moreover, whose national team has never scored a single World Cup goal and is not among the 32 qualifying teams this year, but which still sees itself as the future of soccer: China.Beijing has made no secret of its soccer ambitions. Over the past few years, President Xi Jinping has vowed to turn China into a \u201csoccer superpower\u201d that will host, qualify for and, by 2050, hopefully win the World Cup. The last goal seems almost ludicrously unattainable: China\u2019s men\u2019s team languishes at No. 73 in the world rankings, behind juggernauts like Cura\u00e7ao and Cape Verde. Yet the sudden appearance of Chinese companies as top corporate sponsors at this year\u2019s World Cup hints at the country\u2019s opportunistic rise in the world of soccer. Its incursion was precipitated by a crisis. Actually, two crises. The tournament host, Russia, and the sport\u2019s governing body, FIFA, are beset by scandals and controversies that have cast a shadow over the event \u2014 and made it a struggle to attract corporate sponsors.FIFA is still reeling from a hydra-headed corruption case that forced the resignation of its longtime president Sepp Blatter in 2015 and led to the indictment of more than 30 soccer figures around the world. Russia, meanwhile, has been excoriated in the West for everything from poisoning a former spy and his daughter on foreign soil to stoking wars in Syria and Ukraine and meddling in Western elections. When a member of Parliament in Britain compared this year\u2019s World Cup to the Nazi Olympics in 1936, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, agreed, lamenting the \u201cemetic prospect of Putin glorying in this sporting event.\u201d The friendly veneer of the world\u2019s most popular sporting event has been stripped away. \u201cThe Russians\u2019 earlier rhetoric about the World Cup \u2014 \u2018We want to welcome the world\u2019 \u2014 is largely gone,\u201d says Sven Daniel Wolfe, an expert on Russian sporting politics at the University of Lausanne. \u201cRussian elites are done trying to integrate with the West. They are very content now to tout their \u2018eastward pivot.\u2019\u2009\u201dAfter television broadcasting rights, corporate sponsorships account for the largest portion of FIFA\u2019s revenue \u2014 some $1.58 billion (out of $4.8 billion in total revenue) at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Companies have vied for sponsorship slots, eager to promote their brands before an audience that can number more than three billion over the course of the monthlong tournament. (The final game in Brazil alone attracted more than one billion viewers; the 2018 Super Bowl drew a little more than 100 million.) But scandals have changed the calculus. The fear of being associated with FIFA or Russia may have pushed away a few big partners (Sony, Johnson & Johnson, Castrol) and scared off other potential sponsors. \u201cWe used to have top companies queuing up,\u201d says Patrick Nally, a sports-marketing specialist who helped develop FIFA\u2019s tiered sponsorship system. \u201cNow they can\u2019t attract any big names.\u201dEven as the World Cup audience has grown, the last time FIFA signed a Western sponsor was in 2011, when the corruption investigation began coming to light. The struggle to find sponsors, combined with huge legal bills, led to a $369 million loss for the organization in 2016, and the worst seemed still to come. In Brazil, FIFA said the sponsorship roster was \u201csold out\u201d more than six months before the tournament began. This year, it has been unable to fill more than a dozen sponsorship positions, with the most glaring absences in the lower tier of \u201cregional supporters,\u201d whose rights are limited to the Russian market. Russia and the next World Cup host, Qatar, each offered up a top sponsor. But FIFA\u2019s real lifeline came from a cluster of Chinese companies willing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars and save the day.Leaping into the void left by the West gives Chinese companies a way to promote their brands globally \u2014 and to flaunt their patriotism. Wanda, one of China\u2019s largest entertainment and movie-theater companies, signed a $150 million global partnership with FIFA at the height of the corruption scandal two years ago \u2014 a deal that Wanda\u2019s chief executive, Wang Jianlin, said hinged on FIFA\u2019s woes. \u201cBecause some Western companies dropped out, we got the opportunity,\u201d Wang told reporters at the time. \u201cIf more Chinese brother companies become FIFA sponsors like Wanda, we will join forces to advance the interests of China soccer.\u201d Over the past 18 months, brothers like Hisense (electronics), Vivo (smartphones), Mengniu (dairy products) and Yadea (electric scooters) have answered the call.It\u2019s hard to say whether these Chinese companies will become household names outside their home country. Sponsorship, for them, is a clear bid to acquire what many corporations covet: a global audience and the legitimacy that comes from sharing airtime with Western giants like McDonald\u2019s. Yet the most salient effect may lie in the realm of soft power, helping to solidify China\u2019s growing bond with Russia and signal a global economic shift from West to East. \u201cThere is a big geopolitical context to all of this,\u201d says Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford, Manchester, in Britain. \u201cChina is not trying to rescue FIFA but to influence its decisions over the next 10 years. And the top priority, arguably, is to help China win a bid to host the World Cup.\u201dChina\u2019s soccer spending spree slowed last year, when Beijing cracked down on what it called \u201cirrational investments\u201d (including soccer clubs) and imposed an onerous 100-percent tax on international transfer fees. The restrictions are part of a broader campaign against corruption and capital flight, in which big-ticket foreign purchases like soccer clubs have come under scrutiny as possible money-laundering ventures. This slowdown may look like a retreat, but Chadwick believes the Chinese soccer dream is still alive; it has simply been reoriented toward investment in China\u2019s own soccer development and its ambitions to host the World Cup.With China\u2019s economic clout \u2014 and its corporate incursion into FIFA\u2019s highest ranks \u2014 most experts believe the World Cup will inevitably come to China, perhaps as early as 2030. The other long-term goal, to win the thing, requires more than money. Of FIFA\u2019s 211 member countries (18 more than the United Nations), only eight have ever won the World Cup. And just three of those \u2014 Brazil, Germany and Italy \u2014 have claimed 13 out of the 20 champions\u2019 trophies. As Tom Byer, an American soccer coach based in Japan who has helped build a youth-development program in China, puts it, \u201cThe big myth in football development is that you just have to throw millions of dollars at the top end, and a vast pool of talent will suddenly emerge.\u201dStill, Beijing seems determined to try. Its 50-point road map to soccer supremacy contains some eye-popping goals: 20,000 training centers, 60,000 new fields and 50 million Chinese playing soccer regularly by 2020. Yet even if those targets are reached, the social impediments in China are formidable: the legacy of the one-child policy, the single-minded focus on education, the lack of a soccer or even a sports culture. And then there\u2019s the history of soccer failure. A common joke in China is about a soccer fan who dies and goes to heaven. God grants him one wish. When the man asks for something impossible, even for God, a second wish is granted. The fan says, \u201cI wish China would win the World Cup.\u201d Hesitating for a moment, God replies: \u201cTell me your other wish again?\u201dBrook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

The rooms lining the perimeter often had a small window just above street level. As Communism unraveled in the late 1980s, many residents lacked money to open independent shops, so entrepreneurs started illicitly selling extra appliances and household goods while craftsmen offered shoe repair, tailoring, and other services to pedestrians from their dimly lit bunkers. By the 1990s, there were underground squat shops on most every street in Sofia.Yet, as more chains and supermarkets have opened downtown in recent years, these reminders of Sofia\u2019s early can-do capitalist spirit are vanishing. According to Mr. Bondov, more than half of the city\u2019s kleks have disappeared since 2012, with only 27 remaining today.In their place, a wave of artists and entrepreneurs are transforming these spaces into studios or speakeasies, while some surviving kleks are evolving from hole-in-the-wall convenience stores selling cigarettes and lotto tickets to incorporate a modern, locavore twist with local, natural food and drink.Wander through central Sofia today and you\u2019ll see elderly shoppers in flappy Russian ushanka caps and post-Cold War cool kids crouching to buy Bulgarian chocolates, bold-red wines from the Thracian Valley, and hand-painted cooking pots from Troyan. Merchants often display their inventory in glass-covered shelves where the sidewalk meets the building, while others bump upbeat Bulgarian pop folk chalgra songs from their spaces to draw the attention of those above.\u201cHere, my monthly rent is 200 lev\u201d (or $125), Mr. Alexandrov told me as I squatted on the sidewalk looking in. \u201cAbove ground, it might be 2,000.\u201d He generously slid a stool up through the window as my knees started to buckle.After selecting the right key to open a hidden door, patrons lower two floors into a cavernous vault enforced with two-foot-wide stone walls and a concrete ceiling.

{"Headline": "On U.S.-North Korea Talks, China May Hold the Cards", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDANDONG, China \u2014 Along the Chinese border with North Korea, the evidence of Beijing\u2019s leverage in the coming talks between President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is everywhere.Footage of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, hosting Mr. Kim this week plays in a loop on a big outdoor screen here in the city of Dandong, and residents are eager for cross-border trade to resume as sanctions on North Korea are eased. Traders say they are putting in advance orders for coal from North Korean suppliers. Some exporters are already smuggling goods across the border.\u201cIf you bribe the customs officials twice as much as before,\u201d said one businessman who sells machinery for mining, \u201csome of the smaller equipment goes through.\u201dAt a new apartment complex where four 15-story towers are going up, sales have taken off and prices have doubled as buyers \u2014 including North Koreans carrying stacks of Chinese currency \u2014 snap up studios overlooking the Yalu River, a saleswoman said.The Trump administration insists it will maintain its campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on the North until Mr. Kim has shown \u201csubstantial dismantlement\u201d of his nuclear arsenal. But the buoyant mood in Dandong is a reminder that China, as North Korea\u2019s main trade partner, can decide how strictly to enforce the international sanctions against it.Beijing has already positioned itself as a critical player that can shape the outcome of the talks, which Mr. Trump said will take place June 12 in Singapore. The reclusive Mr. Kim has traveled twice in the past two months to China to consult with Mr. Xi, notably in each case just before hosting a visit by Mike Pompeo, the new American secretary of state.The message both times was clear: Mr. Kim wants China\u2019s support for his approach to nuclear disarmament \u2014 a gradual, action-for-action process in which the North is rewarded for each move it takes toward denuclearization.Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team has urged a faster approach, with a timetable as quick as six months to a year, and economic benefits coming only at the end. In his meeting with Mr. Kim this week, though, Mr. Xi endorsed \u201cphased and synchronous measures\u201d that would \u201ceventually achieve denuclearization and lasting peace on the peninsula.\u201dEven as Mr. Trump is celebrating North Korea\u2019s release of three American prisoners, China has many reasons to believe it will come out ahead in the coming talks.For one thing, its leverage over sanctions enforcement means its view on the main issues \u2014 the method and pace of denuclearization \u2014 will carry weight with both North Korea and the United States. Beyond that, it sees the prospect of progress toward a longstanding security goal: the withdrawal of United States troops from the Korean Peninsula.While he has emphasized the importance of moving quickly, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has also endorsed an \u201caction for action\u201d approach to denuclearization, putting his position closer to that of China and North Korea than of the United States. The joint declaration issued after his summit meeting with Mr. Kim last month set no deadline for denuclearization, suggesting the diplomatic momentum is already shifting toward a phased approach.This could make it easier for the North to reject demands to discard its weapons quickly, forcing Mr. Trump to choose between accepting a more gradual process or going home empty-handed despite the expectations he has built ahead of the meeting.\u201cThe obvious risk that America faces in the summit is that Trump makes a big concession to Kim, without getting anything close to full denuclearization in return,\u201d said Hugh White, a professor of international strategic studies at the Australian National University.If Mr. Trump cannot get the big breakthrough he wants in denuclearization, he may try instead to negotiate a treaty to establish diplomatic relations with the North and formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted by an armistice.Mr. Trump has shown great enthusiasm for signing an official peace treaty with North Korea, a gesture that he has said would be good for everyone.However, such an outcome might also play into China\u2019s hands by calling into question the need for the nearly 30,000 American troops now stationed in South Korea, and the annual joint military exercises that involve even more American forces, which are intended to serve as a deterrent against the heavily armed North.\u201cAn agreement with North Korea which reduced tension, while clearly welcome in itself, could well mark the beginning of the end for America\u2019s longstanding preponderance in Asia,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cAnd that would be a big win for China.\u201dAlready China, which has long propped up the North Korean economy, has shown interest in reviving trading ties with the North.Chinese experts said Beijing did not plan to flout the sanctions openly at this point. However, China only reluctantly signed onto the sanctions last year, and largely at the behest of Mr. Trump, who frequently praised it for punishing the North.Under the sanctions, China has cut exports to the North of refined energy products and stopped importing seafood, coal and also North Korean laborers, all important sources of foreign exchange for the Kim regime.Now that North Korea is in play in a larger strategic contest of wills between Beijing and Washington, China is no longer so interested in squeezing the North.\u201cChina has no incentive to punish North Korea anymore,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cIts relations with South Korea have soured. A few months ago, China had a good relationship with President Trump, but now there is a trade war with the United States.\u201dFor its part, South Korea is also keen to prevent the North from slipping too far under Chinese control, even while its current support of a gradualist approach to denuclearization is in line with China\u2019s view. In the joint communiqu\u00e9 released after Mr. Kim\u2019s meeting with Mr. Moon last month, the South pledged to help the North modernize its railroads and highways.The recent diplomatic developments have given both China and South Korea \u201cevery reason to oppose and disregard new sanctions if the U.S. tries to impose them,\u201d said Bilahari Kausikan, the former head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Singapore.Mr. Cheng, the professor, said that once sanctions were eased, China could even help rebuild North Korea\u2019s roads and ports as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing\u2019s signature effort to extend its influence by helping other countries finance large-scale infrastructure projects.During the Dalian meeting this week between Mr. Xi and Mr. Kim, the Chinese heaped praise on Mr. Kim for declaring that North Korea would now concentrate on developing its economy, where an income of $200 a month is considered upper middle class, and a Japanese bicycle is regarded as a luxury item.Increasing numbers of North Korean businessmen have begun returning to Dandong in the last few weeks, since Mr. Kim\u2019s first visit to China at the end of March.A saleswoman for CNC, a Chinese real estate developer, said that North Koreans were lifting the local property market. She said desirable studios with a view of the Yalu River, fitted with imported kitchen equipment, were selling for about $100,000, twice what they fetched when they went on the market two weeks ago.Iris Zhao contributed reporting from Dandong and Beijing.Advertisement"}

It has been lightly edited for clarity. The first section is at the White House.REPORTER: Mr. President, how\u2019s Rudy doing?REPORTER: When did you find out?TRUMP: I tell you what \u2014 Rudy is a great guy, but he just started a day ago. But he really has his heart into it. He\u2019s working hard. He\u2019s learning the subject matter. And he\u2019s going to be issuing a statement too. But he is a great guy. He knows it\u2019s a witch hunt. That\u2019s what he knows. He\u2019s seen a lot of them. And he said he\u2019s never seen anything so horrible.As an example, 33,000 emails requested by Congress with a subpoena, and they get burned, they get deleted. And nobody says anything. Give me a break.So Rudy knows it\u2019s a witch hunt. He started yesterday. He\u2019ll get his facts straight. He\u2019s a great guy. But what he does is he feels it\u2019s a very bad thing for our country, and he happens to be right.REPORTER: When did you find out what the retainer was being spent on?TRUMP: Well, you\u2019re going to find out, because we\u2019re going to give a full list. And people know. And virtually everything said has been said incorrectly, and it\u2019s been said wrong, or it\u2019s been covered wrong by the press \u2014 just like NBC and ABC yesterday covered the story wrong.But you\u2019ll be finding out. It\u2019s very \u2014 it\u2019s actually \u2014REPORTER: Mr. President, are you \u2014TRUMP: Wait a minute. It\u2019s actually very simple. It\u2019s actually very simple. But there has been a lot of misinformation, really. People wanting to say \u2014 and I say, you know what, learn before you speak. It\u2019s a lot easier.REPORTER: Mr. President, when are these Americans going to be released from North Korea?TRUMP: We\u2019re having very substantive talks with North Korea. And a lot of things have already happened with respect to the hostages. And I think you\u2019re going to see very good things. As I said yesterday, stayed tuned. I think you\u2019re going to be seeing very, very good things.And also, the trip is being scheduled. We now have a date and we have a location. We\u2019ll be announcing it soon.REPORTER: Mr. President, have you changed your mind at all about being willing to sit with Robert Mueller?TRUMP: Well, the problem with sitting is this: You have a group of investigators, and they say that I am not a target. And I\u2019m not a target. But you have a group of investigators that are all Democrats. In some cases, they went to the Hillary Clinton celebration that turned out to be a funeral. So you have all these investigators; they\u2019re Democrats. In all fairness, Bob Mueller worked for Obama for eight years.If you look at the statements that were made, if you take a look, as an example, at the Rod Rosenstein letter to me, prior to the firing of James Comey, just read it; put it in the air. Your viewers don\u2019t know about it. Put that letter on the air. It very much speaks very loudly, and that\u2019s just one thing.So I would say this: If I could be \u2014 I would love to speak. I would love to. Nobody wants to speak more than me \u2014 in fact, against my lawyers, because most lawyers, they never speak on anything. I would love to speak, because we\u2019ve done nothing wrong. There was no collusion with the Russians. There was nothing. There was no obstruction.You know, very funny \u2014 if you fight back, because you people say something wrong, or they say something wrong, or they leak, which they\u2019ve been doing; if you fight back, they say, oh, that\u2019s obstruction of justice. If somebody says something wrong, and you fight back, they say that\u2019s obstruction of justice. It\u2019s nonsense.So let me just \u2014REPORTER: Are you \u2014TRUMP: Wait, wait. Let me just tell you. So I would love to speak. I would love to go. Nothing I want to do more, because we did nothing wrong. We ran a great campaign. We won easily. We won that easily: 306 to \u2014 I think, it was 223. We won it easily. That was a great victory. That was a great day for this country.We just had new jobs numbers out. You saw we broke 4 \u2014 3.9 percent. I would love to go. I would love to speak. But I have to find that we\u2019re going to be fairly.REPORTER: Are you sure \u2014TRUMP: Wait, wait. I have to find that we\u2019re going to be treated fairly, because everybody sees it now, and it is a pure witch hunt. Right now, it\u2019s a pure witch hunt. Why don\u2019t we have Republicans looking also? Why aren\u2019t we having Republican people doing what all these Democrats are doing? It is a very unfair thing. If I thought it was fair, I would override my lawyer.REPORTER: (Inaudible) the jobs report today?TRUMP: I thought the jobs report was very good. The big thing to me was cracking four. That hasn\u2019t been done in a long time; you\u2019ll tell me how long. But it hasn\u2019t been done in a long time. We\u2019ll full employment. We\u2019re doing great. The stock market is doing \u2014 I guess it\u2019s up 35 percent since the election.And now I think, really, they\u2019re waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen on trade, because we\u2019re going to have some incredible trade deals announced. My people are coming back right now from China, and we will be doing something, one way or the other, with respect to what\u2019s happening in China.And let me say this: I have great respect for President Xi. That\u2019s why we\u2019re being so nice. And we have a great relationship. But we have to bring fairness into trade between the U.S. and China. And we\u2019ll do it.Later, Mr. Trump spoke again to reporters at Joint Base Andrews before boarding Air Force One, along with John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general who is the president\u2019s chief of staff.TRUMP: I want to just tell you something. General Kelly is doing a fantastic job. There has been such false reporting about our relationship. We have a great relationship. He\u2019s doing a great job as chief of staff. I could not be more happy. So I just want to tell you that.The New York Times has falsely reported. They\u2019ve said things that are absolutely false. So I just want to tell you that. And, general, you may have something \u2014JOHN F. KELLY: Well, I would just say it\u2019s an absolute privilege to work for a president that has gotten the economy going. We\u2019re about to have a breakthrough, I believe, on North Korea. The jobs report today. I mean, everything is going phenomenally well. Attacking the opioid crisis. It\u2019s nothing less than brilliant what\u2019s been accomplished in 15 months, I believe.REPORTER: Mr. President, why did you change your story on Stormy Daniels?TRUMP: I\u2019m not changing any stories. All I\u2019m telling you is that this country is right now running so smooth. And to be bringing up that kind of crap, and to be bringing up witch hunts all the time \u2014 that\u2019s all you want to talk about. You\u2019re going to see \u2014REPORTER: But you said \u2014THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me \u2014REPORTER: \u2014 on Air Force One that you did not know (inaudible).TRUMP: No, but you have to \u2014 excuse me. You take a look at what I said. You go back and take a look. You\u2019ll see what I said.REPORTER: You said, \u201cNo,\u201d when I asked you, \u201cDid you know about the payment?\u201dTRUMP: Excuse me, you go take a look at what we said. But this is a witch hunt like nobody has ever seen before. And what they should do is look at the other side, where terribly bad things have happened, where terribly bad things have been done.But what I do want you to do is look at our economy. Today, we broke 4 percent; 3.9 percent we hit today for the first time in many, many years. We\u2019re really proud of it, and we\u2019ll talk to you folks later. But I will tell you \u2014 I will tell you this, I will tell you this: When Rudy made the statement \u2014 Rudy is great \u2014 but Rudy had just started, and he wasn\u2019t totally familiar with every \u2014 you know, with everything. And Rudy \u2014 we love Rudy, he\u2019s a special guy. What he really understands is that this is a witch hunt. He understands that probably better than anybody.REPORTER: When did you know \u2014TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. But Rudy \u2014 Rudy understands this better than anybody. But when he made a certain statement \u2014 he just started yesterday. So that\u2019s it.So bottom line is \u2014 bottom line is: I want to talk to the people in charge, if they can prove that it\u2019s a fair situation. The problem we have is that you have 13 people \u2014 they\u2019re are all Democrats, and they\u2019re real Democrats; they\u2019re angry Democrats. And that\u2019s not a fair situation.Thank you very much.REPORTER: (Inaudible.)TRUMP: We have a chance of bringing \u2014 we have a chance \u2014 we\u2019re doing very well with the hostages. We\u2019re in constant contact with the leadership. We are in constant contact with North Korea. We\u2019ve actually worked out a time and a place which will be announced shortly and very soon.REPORTER: Where?TRUMP: I figured you would ask that question.REPORTER: (Inaudible.)TRUMP: But \u2014 wait a minute \u2014REPORTER: (Inaudible) or South Korea, are they on the table?TRUMP: Not really. Not at this moment, certainly not.REPORTER: You\u2019re not planning to withdraw (inaudible)?TRUMP: No. No. And we haven\u2019t been asked to. Now, I have to tell you, at some point into the future, I would like to save the money. You know, we have 32,000 troops there. But I think a lot of great things will happen. But troops are not on the table. Absolutely.Thank you very much.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Last Cave Dwellers Fight to Keep Their Underground Homes", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGebeng JournalGEBENG, China \u2014 When armed bandits prowled this remote, mountainous stretch of the southwestern province of Guizhou in the chaotic years before the founding of modern China, the ethnic Miao villagers hid in the region\u2019s enormous caves.And there they have remained, even after China was united under Communist rule, grinding out an existence of profound rural poverty and isolation.The area is in one of the poorest provinces in China. The only link to the rest of the country, and the outside world, is over a mountain footpath \u2014 a brisk one-hour hike through a steep valley \u2014 that leads to a nearby road.Over the past 20 years, though, the caves have become less secluded because of a steadily increasing trickle of tourists, who come to experience what local media have described as the last continuously inhabited cave in China.A cottage industry has popped up in which the cave dwellers earn extra money by renting out rooms in their homes, which over time have clustered within Zhong cave, a limestone cavern big enough to hold four American football fields. The hangar-like cave is so large that their wooden or bamboo-made residences form a small, subterranean village built along its undulating walls.During the day, the cave is filled with the sound of cows and roosters. On Friday afternoons, the laughter of children echoes and the smell of cooking fires permeates the cave\u2019s cool, damp air, which offers relief from the heat of the valley below.The county government wants the residents of Zhong cave to move to a nearby block of housing: low-slung, white-walled farmhouses with wooden window frames that were completed nearly 10 years ago.Officials say that residents have not taken care of the cave, leaving it unsuitable for inhabitation, and that the government should oversee the village as it is listed as a protected community by the Getu River Tourism Administration, a local agency. They have offered each resident 60,000 renminbi, or approximately $9,500, to leave.Only five families have agreed to move.The remaining 18 families have held on stubbornly to their homes inside the cave. They say that the new homes are too small, that they fear losing access to their land, and that they alone, because of their historical connection to the cave, should have the right to independently control its small tourism economy.\u201cThe residents of this cave should be the administrators of tourism here, regardless of whether or not we are paid,\u201d said Wang Qiguo, the head of the local village, who established the first hostel there.As he spoke, his wife prepared a steaming array of dishes made from home-smoked pork and local vegetables grown in the valley.After all, Mr. Wang noted, \u201cThe best thing about this cave is its inhabitants.\u201dEven residents who are considering moving out seem to agree that $9,500 per person is too little money, especially because many are elderly and speak little or no Mandarin, meaning they could feel isolated if they leave the cave community. They still rely on their nearby land to grow the millet and vegetables on which they subsist.Villagers have also complained about the quality of the new housing, saying it\u2019s too small and poorly made.During the 1980s, the outsiders who most often visited the Zhong cave were local government officials conducting checks to enforce China\u2019s \u201cone-child\u201d policy. The measure was deeply unpopular among the villagers whose children work alongside their parents in the fields, tending to livestock.Mr. Wang said that during those years, violators of the policy would sometimes be taken away for forced abortions and sterilization.The single greatest change in the history of the cave was the introduction of electricity, only in 2002.Surprisingly, the Chinese government did not bring electricity to the area. Instead, a wealthy American businessman from Minnesota, Frank Beddor Jr., was responsible.Mr. Beddor first visited the Zhong cave in 2002, and would ultimately return several more times \u2014 donating tens of thousands of dollars to connect the cave to the region\u2019s electrical grid.His continuing financial support also built a schoolhouse and a communal bathroom, and delivered livestock and other assistance to the villagers, dramatically improving their quality of life.But in 2011, the school was closed by the local government, forcing residents to send their children, some as young as 5, to the region\u2019s boarding school nearly two hours away.Mr. Beddor died at age 83 in 2007. His emotional connection to the village is still a mystery to the villagers, some of whom remember the few times he visited the cave.Wang Qicai, 39, a farmer who also runs a small general store out of his home in the cave, said young people may move out to become migrant workers, but many end up returning to have their families.The cave, he said, \u201cfeels like home.\u201d\u201cThe weather inside the cave is amazing,\u201d he added. \u201cIt feels like heaven.\u201dZoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Ice Core Reveals the Economic Health of the Roman Empire", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA year by year economic history of the Roman Empire might seem as impossible to reconstruct as the lost 107 books of Livy\u2019s history of Rome. Yet something close to such a record has now been retrieved from the unlikeliest of places \u2014 a glacier in central Greenland.The record is written not in Latin but in lead. Lead emissions generated by mining operations in Northern Europe reached Greenland and were washed down in snowfall. The snow accumulated, turned into ice, and preserved a record that stretches back thousands of years.Ice cores from Greenland have long been used to track global climate change, which is recorded in the frozen water\u2019s oxygen isotopes. The project to measure ancient lead emissions in ice cores was initiated by Andrew I. Wilson, an archaeologist at the University of Oxford who studies the Roman economy. A French team tried this in the 1990s but Dr. Wilson believed new technology might allow a more comprehensive approach and reached out to Joseph R. McConnell, a leading expert in ice core analysis at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nev.Deep Greenland ice cores are hard to obtain because it can take three or four years to drill to bedrock. But Dr. McConnell knew of a core that had to be abandoned when the drill got stuck at the 6,500-foot level. Still, the core recorded 40,000 years of annual snowfalls, and the Danish custodians of the core let Dr. McConnell\u2019s lab use a section of some 1,400 feet from its upper portions, corresponding to the years 1235 B.C. to 1257 A.D.In the lab the ice core was cut into rods just over three feet long that were stood on a heating pad and melted from the bottom. Grooves in the pad directed water from the central and purest part of the core to instruments known as mass spectrometers that continuously measured the quantity of lead down to one hundredth of a picogram, which is one trillionth of a gram. When the ice core was set to melt at the rate of two inches per minute, Dr. McConnell\u2019s team found they could take 12 measurements per year throughout the Roman era.The dates of these ice years were verified by synchronizing them with other chronologies, such as those derived from tree rings and volcanic eruptions.The continuous record of lead pollution is not as good as having figures for Roman gross domestic product, which no one knows, but it does seem to reflect the general economic health of the Roman state.Lead was widely used in the Roman economy for making water pipes and sheathing the hulls of boats. Its production was also a proxy for a central economic activity, the use of silver in the Romans\u2019 standard silver coin, the denarius. Silver occurs in lead ores, and the process of separating the silver from lead at high temperatures was a major source of airborne lead. In the early Roman Empire the denarius was 100 percent silver. But under the emperor Nero, starting in 64 A.D., the proportion of silver was reduced to 80 percent and the state made a tidy profit by recycling the all-silver denarii into debased ones.These changes coincided with, and perhaps were caused by, a drop in silver production, and just such a fall in lead emissions is recorded in the Greenland ice core shortly after 60 A.D. Under the emperor Trajan there was a brief return from 103 to 107 A.D. to making coins from newly mined silver and this historical event too is reflected in a brief spike of lead pollution that ends in 107 A.D.Lead emissions, as reflected in the ice core, dropped to an absolute low during the Imperial Crisis of 235 to 284 A.D., when the empire nearly collapsed under the stresses of internal discord, barbarian invasions and the Cyprian plague. Thereafter the economy, to judge by lead levels, recovered a little but entered a final period of decline marked by the withdrawal of Roman legions from Britain in the early 5th century A.D. and the collapse of the western Roman Empire in 476 A.D.Economic historians have tried to reconstruct the Roman Empire\u2019s gross domestic product but have to make too many assumptions, Dr. Wilson said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the lead pollution graph is a close reflection of GDP but it\u2019s probably the best overall proxy for economic health we\u2019ve got,\u201d he said.He and Dr. McConnell are now working to see if the lead isotopes (lead atoms of different weight) in the ice core will help identify the geographic sources of lead production and thus make allowance for the fact that nearby sources of lead, such as in Britain, would have contributed more heavily to the Greenland pollution than distant ones such as the Rio Tinto mines in Spain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Jobless Rate Is Finally Below 4 Percent. Our Economic Goals Still Don\u2019t Reflect That.", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe lowest rate since 2000 suggests that officials may want to focus not on job creation but on the quality of those jobs, and on pulling more people into the labor force.The unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent in April \u2014 the first time it has come in below 4 percent since December 2000. Before those few months at the turn of the century, you have to go back to January 1970 to find a jobless rate in the United States that started with a \u201c3.\u201dThis is, to use a technical economic term, fantastic. And it is a fact that should shape how people think about the broader economic moment.Most people \u2014 even people who were trained economists and reasonably optimistic over all \u2014 didn\u2019t see it coming. In March 2013, for example, Federal Reserve officials projected the rate would fall to somewhere between 5.2 percent and 6 percent in the longer run (now being that aforementioned longer run).It is certainly true that the unemployment rate alone doesn\u2019t tell you all you need to know about the labor market. In particular, it can fall because of bad news, namely people leaving the labor force, rather than the good news of people finding jobs. And that, as it happens, is what happened with the latest drop in April, as the labor force actually shrank by 236,000 Americans.But even though the latest tick down came for not-so-good reasons, the simple fact remains that most Americans who say they want a job can, in 2018, find one. That means some modest shifts in the nation\u2019s economic debates are in order.To talk about needing more jobs increasingly misses the point. If only out of muscle memory, Wall Street still pays the most attention to the job creation number that is included in the monthly report \u2014 164,000 net positions added in April, if you\u2019re curious.And so the focus of policy seems as if it should be less on creating more jobs and more on trying to make the jobs that exist as good as possible, on all dimensions.For workers, that means higher wages, and the April numbers were actually a bit disappointing on that front. Average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose only 0.1 percent, and they have been up 2.6 percent over the last year. While there has been some fragmentary evidence that employers are starting to raise wages because of the tight labor market, it isn\u2019t yet clear that there is some overwhelming trend toward workers fully sharing the benefits of an improving economy.The low unemployment rate means that the still-depressed levels of participation in the work force are hard to chalk up to a shortage of jobs.Only 79.2 percent of Americans 25 to 54 were working in April, unchanged from March. That number was 81.4 percent the last time the unemployment rate was at its current levels in December 2000.That means that there are still around 2.3 million people in the United States of prime working age who might come back into the labor market if we were to match the standard from 18 years ago. Higher wages would most likely help, but it would also help to understand better the noneconomic reasons those people aren\u2019t working and how these might be overcome.Finally, for Federal Reserve officials and others who shape policy to try to guide the economy, the sub-4 percent jobless rate can serve as a reminder of how little we know with certainty about what the United States economy is capable of.For example, could joblessness fall below 3 percent, without leading to a huge outbreak of inflation? Conventional wisdom in economic forecasting circles is that the answer is a decisive no. But it wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented; the jobless rate fell to 2.5 percent in 1953.Nobody was predicting five years ago that we would have a sub-4 percent jobless rate in 2018. So there are benefits, for economic policymakers and everyone else, to staying open-minded about what is possible.Advertisement"}

And there is a trade imbalance today because we\u2019ve been investing in our future and you Americans have been eating yours.A Chinese economist who worked in the West summarized it this way: \u201cYou brought China into the world and changed China,\u201d but now China is in the world and it is becoming \u201cself-propelled.\u201dHere\u2019s how we got here: In Act I, U.S.-China relations were all geopolitics, with the U.S. and China against the Soviet Union. That lasted until the late 1970s, when Act II began: China shifted toward capitalism, becoming a huge factory and new market \u2014 and 30 years later turned into the world\u2019s second-largest economy.In large part this was due to the work ethic of the Chinese people, the long-term thinking of China\u2019s leaders and the government\u2019s massive investments in infrastructure and education. But in part it was also due to China\u2019s willingness and ability to bend or ignore rules of the World Trade Organization and, at times, outright cheat.In some cases China used industrial espionage to just steal innovations from the West. Other moves were more subtle: When China joined the W.T.O. in 2001, it was allowed in as a \u201cdeveloping nation,\u201d subject to very low tariffs on its exports to our country but permitted to impose high tariffs to protect its own rising industries from U.S. and European competition.The assumption was that as China grew, and the W.T.O. moved to a new regime, China would quickly cut its tariffs \u2014 like its 25 percent tax on car imports, compared with the 2.5 percent tariff imposed by the U.S. But the W.T.O. still has not completed a new trade round and China has refused to voluntarily lower its tariffs.Moreover, China developed an industrial policy that often bent W.T.O. rules. The government gave away cheap land, and state-guided banks granted cheap loans for new industries, but foreign companies that wanted access to China\u2019s market were forced to pay to play \u2014 to have a Chinese partner and be willing to transfer their advanced technology to them.As a result, over time, Beijing was able to force multinationals to shift more and more of their supply chains to China, and grow Chinese competitors to Western companies in its protected market, and then, once they were big enough, unleash them on the world as giants.Even when the U.S. protested to the W.T.O. \u2014 as in the case of how China unfairly kept U.S. credit card companies out, then lost the arbitration case at the W.T.O. \u2014 China still dragged its feet before following through on promises made 17 years earlier to open up. By then, Chinese companies, like UnionPay, so dominated China\u2019s credit card market that U.S. companies, like Visa, were left with the crumbs.Meanwhile, Chinese government-guided companies and investment funds went abroad and began to buy up strategic industries to bring their technology back to China \u2014 like Germany\u2019s biggest and best robotics company, Kuka.U.S. and European businesses tolerated all of this because they were still making money in China or were afraid to be frozen out of its massive, growing market \u2014 until a couple years ago, when more and more told their governments: This is not working anymore. That ushered in Act III.ACT III opened in October 2015, when China announced its new long-term vision: \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d a plan to dominate 10 next-generation industries, including robotics, self-driving cars, electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, biotech and aerospace.When the U.S. and Europe saw this, they basically said: Wow. We were ready to turn the other cheek when your combination of hard work, cheating and industrial policy was focused on low-end industries. But if you use the same strategies to dominate these high-end industries, we\u2019re toast. We need some new rules.And I heard this as much from E.U. officials as U.S. ones. That is why many E.U. countries are now scrambling to pass new laws to prevent China from buying up their most advanced industries. And that is why China is telling E.U. countries, as one E.U. official put it, \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t join the U.S. camp\u201d on trade. The last thing Beijing wants is a U.S.-E.U. united front demanding it play fair.Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am a free trader and genuinely not afraid of some state-directed 2025 plan beating Western free-market innovators. I welcome China focusing more on 21st-century industries. It could be better for everyone.Economics is not like war \u2014 they can win and we can win. On one condition \u2014 we all play by the same rules: hard work and innovation, not hard work and stealing intellectual property, massive government interventions, ignoring W.T.O. rules, lack of reciprocity and forcing Western companies to pay to play inside China.Have no doubt, though: Both Presidents Trump and Xi are approaching this moment with enormously high-risk strategies.As one E.U. official warned me: \u201cIf your concern is U.S. jobs, China is the big challenge and you should not be starting a steel war with Europe. Nobody is going to go with you on China if you\u2019re hitting us on steel.\u201d Added one longtime U.S. observer in Beijing: \u201cIf we make this the U.S. versus China alone, we lose.\u201dWorse, Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have brought together the most powerful economies on the Pacific Rim around a set of trade rules perfectly aligned with U.S. interests and focused on all those things, like intellectual property, that we want China to embrace as it moves to 2025.In short, with a lot of allies in Europe and on the Pacific, we might be able to move China in the right direction. But Trump is alienating them all. How foolish is that?Trump also has nothing to say about investing in the real source of long-term U.S. strength \u2014 infrastructure and education.But Xi\u2019s bet is also no slam dunk. China is a much more open country today than it was 25 years ago \u2014 but it\u2019s also much less open than it was five years ago. Xi\u2019s allies argue that his crackdown on corruption; his repeal of term limits, which position him to rule for what could be decades; and his tightening of the control that the Communist Party wields over every institution was urgent because collective rule did not work. China\u2019s society, government and military were being eaten away by corruption from within, those allies say.That may have been true. But creating a regime of one-man rule; controlling the internet, free speech and universities more tightly than ever; and resurrecting the teaching of Marxist thought cannot be the best way to stimulate and attract the most creative and innovative minds that China needs to propel a start-up economy and deliver on \u201cMade in China 2025.\u201dWill China\u2019s best and brightest want to work in such a system? I don\u2019t know. China\u2019s autocracy has managed to produce a tremendous number of patents and start-ups so far, so maybe Xi can pull this off. But it\u2019s a big bet.As I said, this is not just a front-page business news story. What\u2019s being written is the first page of a whole new chapter in the history of U.S.-China relations. And how it gets written and how it ends will shape the Trump and Xi legacies \u2014 and touch every major economy in the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teachers Find Public Support as Campaign for Higher Pay Goes to Voters", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter shutting down schools and shaking up politics in six states, teachers are looking to the ballot box in their campaign for better pay and increased school funding. And their demands are meeting with widespread public support.A survey conducted in early May for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey found that nearly three in four adults \u2014 71 percent \u2014 considered teacher pay too low, while just 6 percent felt it was too high. And two-thirds said they supported increasing the salaries of public-school teachers even if it meant raising taxes.The teacher walkouts began in deep-red states such as West Virginia and Oklahoma, where teacher pay has tended to be lower than in other states, and spread quickly to Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina, racking up a list of concessions from conservative lawmakers. The movement has the potential to influence congressional, gubernatorial and state legislative races, and could catch fire in additional states when the new school year begins.Idaho has some of the lowest teacher pay and per-student education funding in the country, according to federal data, and Mr. Nebeker, 61, said he worried that the state was losing educators as a result.\u201cWe never waste our money when we put it there for good teachers,\u201d Mr. Nebeker said.Such broad-based support is unusual. In the Times survey, for example, 84 percent of Republicans approved of the tax law that Congress passed late last year, compared with 19 percent of Democrats. Similarly, 78 percent of Republicans said they favored Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, but just 27 percent of Democrats did. Partisanship even affects voters\u2019 assessment of the economy: 58 percent of Republicans said they were better off financially than a year ago, versus 17 percent of Democrats.National Democrats are hoping to capitalize on the education funding consensus during this fall\u2019s midterm elections, especially in states with key House and Senate races, like Arizona and West Virginia. Though most school funding comes from state and local sources, not the federal government, congressional Democrats have released a plan to repeal the Trump tax cuts for the top 1 percent of earners in order to spend $50 billion on teacher pay and recruitment and another $50 billion on school infrastructure needs.\u201cTeachers have huge impact in their communities, and they are mobilized and they realize the Democrats are on their side and Republicans have not been,\u201d said the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York. \u201cThe No. 1 way you can get better teachers is teacher pay. Even some Republicans realize that. It\u2019s sort of a free-market concept.\u201d\u201cFirefighters around the station that I talked to looked at it negatively,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe that the teachers used it as a last-ditch effort.\u201dMr. Brown, a conservative who voted for Mr. Trump, said he believed the local teachers\u2019 union was too far to the left. But even as he opposed the walkout, Mr. Brown said he approved of efforts to impose a sales tax in Phoenix to fund city services, including schools.\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe city\u2019s grown to a certain size, and they don\u2019t have the taxes.\u201dThe leaders of Arizona\u2019s walkout movement are collecting signatures for a ballot initiative that would raise income taxes on individuals with income over $250,000 and couples with income over $500,000. Noah Karvelis, an Arizona music teacher and an organizer of the protests, said that such a measure would raise more funds than a sales tax, and that the need for school funding \u201ccuts across a lot of anti-union propaganda that has been steeped into people for decades.\u201dArizona, like Oklahoma, is a traditionally conservative, anti-tax state that spends relatively little on education. But new arrivals could change that equation.Regina Blecher left New York after Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and now lives in Maricopa, outside Phoenix \u2014 where, she said, the grocery store\u2019s parking lot is full of license plates from California and other states. Many of the teachers come from out of state, too, and have different expectations for pay.Ms. Blecher, 48, who has a son in fifth grade, said that after class sizes ballooned, her community approved a property-tax increase last year to hire more teachers.\u201cI was very much for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s enough realization that teachers are underfunded, the classrooms are underfunded.\u201dArizonans, Ms. Blecher said, might never be willing to pay the $12,000 a year in property taxes that her brother pays in Rockland County, N.Y. But she said she saw attitudes shifting.\u201cYou get what you pay for \u2014 that\u2019s the way I think about it,\u201d she said.About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 10,167 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from May 7 to May 13. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.Advertisement"}

House Primary in Indiana", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Greg Pence, the oldest brother of Vice President Mike Pence, won the Republican primary on Tuesday for the Indiana House seat once held by his more famous sibling, successfully leveraging his family name into prodigious fund-raising and ample votes that make him a heavy favorite to win the seat in November.In his first run for public office, Mr. Pence, 61, ran a largely hermetic race, declining to debate his opponents and refusing most requests for interviews. Instead he made the rounds of Lincoln Day dinners and met quietly with voters in a district that stretches from Muncie to the north to the Ohio River to the south.\u201cI\u2019m ready to serve again,\u201d Mr. Pence, who enlisted in the Marines after college, said to a cheering crowd in his hometown, Columbus.His closest challenger was Jonathan Lamb, who owns several small businesses and was the only candidate close to being financially competitive with Mr. Pence. The victor ultimately used connections to his brother and President Trump to raise more than $1 million for his race, an unmatchable figure.Mr. Lamb tried to make an issue of Mr. Pence\u2019s record in business \u2014 a convenience store company he ran was forced into bankruptcy and was sued by a local bank for $3.8 million in unpaid loans \u2014 but he could not overcome his opponent\u2019s structural advantages. Mr. Pence has lived most of his life in Columbus, Ind., one of the larger cities in the district, and his family has deep roots there.Mr. Pence now owns two antique malls in southern Indiana.He is trying to succeed Representative Luke Messer, who ran for the Senate. Mr. Messer won in 2016 with almost 70 percent of the vote, and Democrats do not have a well-known challenger. Mike Pence was elected to the seat in 2000 and served until he was elected governor of Indiana in 2012.During his campaign, Greg Pence said there was \u201cno daylight\u201d between him and his brother or President Trump on major issues, and he will be hoping that strong support for the president in the state will benefit him as well.But that proposition will be tested because Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies could have a starkly negative impact on the economy of Columbus, which relies on exports for more than 50 percent of its gross domestic product, according to a Brookings Institution analysis.Mr. Trump and the vice president are scheduled to campaign in Indiana on Thursday.Advertisement"}

And this all happened before Trump and Cohen elevated their moral associations even higher by entangling with Russian oligarchs.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]And yet I can\u2019t help but wonder if that kind of background has provided a decent education for dealing with the sort of hopped-up mobsters running parts of the world today. There is growing reason to believe that Donald Trump understands the thug mind a whole lot better than the people who attended our prestigious Foreign Service academies.The first piece of evidence is North Korea. When Trump was trading crude, back-alley swipes with \u201cLittle Rocket Man,\u201d Kim Jong-un, about whose nuclear button was bigger, it sounded as if we were heading for a nuclear holocaust led by a pair of overgrown prepubescents.In fact, Trump\u2019s bellicosity seems to have worked. It\u2019s impossible to know how things will pan out, but the situation with North Korea today is a lot better than it was six months ago. Hostages are being released, talks are being held. There seems to be a chance for progress unfelt in years.Maybe Trump intuited something about the sorts of people who run the North Korean regime that others missed.The second piece of evidence is our trade talks with China. Over the past few decades, the Western diplomatic community made a big bet: If we all behaved decently toward Chinese leaders, then they\u2019d naturally come to embrace liberal economic and cultural values and we could all eventually share a pinot at the University Club.The bet went wrong. Today\u2019s Chinese elites are polite and coolheaded, but their economic, political and military behavior remains pure thug. Beijing throws its economic weight around with abandon, punishing foreign firms like Mercedes-Benz that don\u2019t toe its line, cutting off Philippine trade over dubious geographic disputes, closing off its own economy to foreign investment and stealing hundreds of billions of dollars in American intellectual property each year.The president has pushed back harder on the Chinese and has netted some results. After some Trump swagger, Xi Jinping promised to \u201csignificantly lower\u201d Chinese tariffs on imported vehicles.The third piece of evidence is Iran. I have doubts about the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw from the nuke agreement. But I do know that the argument that many of the Obama people relied on as predicate for the deal is wrong. They argued that, deep down, the Iranian leaders are worldly sophisticates who, if we just gave them the welcome mat, would want to join our community of nations.This is the vanity of the educated class going back for centuries. Since we\u2019re obviously so superior, everybody else secretly wants to be like us. It\u2019s wrong. Thugs gotta thug. Religious fanatics gotta fanaticize.The Iranian regime has continued on its merry way, pouring troops into Syria, lobbing missiles at Israel, propping up extremist armies across the Middle East. Maybe Trump is right to intuit that the only right response to a monster is to enclose it. Maybe he\u2019s right that when you sense economic weakness in a potential threat, you hit it again.Please don\u2019t take this as an endorsement of the Trump foreign policy. I\u2019d feel a lot better if Trump showed some awareness of the complexity of the systems he\u2019s disrupting, and the possibly cataclysmic unintended consequences. But there is some lizard wisdom here. The world is a lot more like the Atlantic City real estate market than the G.R.E.s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkish Banker in Iran Sanctions-Busting Case Sentenced to 32 Months", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Atilla, 47, was the deputy general manager for international banking at Halkbank, a Turkish state bank that American prosecutors alleged was at the center of the broad sanctions-evasion scheme.The prosecutors sought a sentence of about 20 years, arguing that Mr. Atilla was a sanctions expert who had helped design and carry out the scheme and conceal it from American officials.But the judge, Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court, said that although Mr. Atilla had \u201cunquestionably furthered\u201d the scheme, he was \u201csomewhat of a cog in the wheel\u201d and not \u201ca mastermind.\u201d\u201cMr. Atilla,\u201d Judge Berman said, \u201cwas a reluctant participant and one who was following orders, albeit improper orders in my judgment.\u201dMr. Atilla\u2019s lawyers, seeking leniency for their client, argued that his role had been relatively minor, especially compared with that of Reza Zarrab, a well-connected Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was indicted along with Mr. Atilla and seven other Turkish and Iranian defendants. Mr. Zarrab, 34, pleaded guilty and cooperated with the authorities.The government had alleged in court papers that Mr. Atilla, Mr. Zarrab and the others had used Halkbank to \u201claunder billions of dollars-worth of Iranian oil proceeds, ultimately creating a slush fund for Iran to use however it wished \u2014 the very harm that U.S. sanctions were put in place to avoid.\u201dIn court on Wednesday, a prosecutor, Michael D. Lockard, disputed descriptions of Mr. Atilla as a minor or reluctant player in the conspiracy, which he called \u201cthe biggest sanctions evasion case prosecuted in the United States that we are aware of.\u201d\u201cWhen the rubber hit the road,\u201d Mr. Lockard said, \u201cMr. Atilla chose lies and deceptions, not honesty and integrity.\u201d\u201cThis is not a case about drugs,\u201d Mr. Lockard said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case about shipments of weapons. But it is, in a very real sense, a case about nuclear capability. Nuclear capability by the world\u2019s foremost state sponsor of terrorism.\"Judge Berman did not contest the gravity of the sanctions evasion plot. And he noted that Mr. Zarrab had given \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201clargely unrefuted\u201d testimony at Mr. Atilla\u2019s trial about how the conspirators had been able to \u201ctransfer or free up millions upon millions of dollars of Iranian proceeds, primarily from the sale of Iranian oil,\u201d in violation of the sanctions.But Judge Berman indicated that Mr. Atilla\u2019s role did not warrant the longer sentence the government was seeking. The judge also noted that Halkbank had not been charged in the case.Mr. Atilla will be credited with the time he has spent in jail since his March 2017 arrest.One of Mr. Atilla\u2019s lawyers, Victor J. Rocco, called the sentence fair but said his client would appeal the conviction. \u201cOur objective is to get him home as quick as possible,\u201d Mr. Rocco said.Mr. Erdogan, now Turkey\u2019s president, and other Turkish officials have repeatedly denounced the American government\u2019s prosecution of the sanctions case. The Turkish Foreign Ministry, in a statement on Wednesday, sharply criticized the sentence, saying it had come \u201cafter an entirely feigned process which is inconsistent with the principle of fair trial.\u201dThe statement accused the court of relying on \u201cforged evidence and false statements,\u201d which it said had been fabricated by followers of an Islamic cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Mr. Erdogan accuses Mr. Gulen, his former ally, of fomenting a failed coup in 2016.\u201cIf Hakan Atilla is going to be declared a criminal, that would be almost equivalent to declaring the Turkish Republic a criminal,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said.\u201cThe idea is so that everyone will know exactly what was said here,\u201d he explained in court, \u201cand so that everybody can evaluate the outcome for themselves.\u201dNate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump Should Actually Do About the High Cost of Drugs", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bollyky, Mr. Kesselheim and Mr. Sharfstein have worked separately on many aspects\u00a0of the drug pricing problem.A Big Mac costs $4.40 in Britain, a ticket to see the latest superhero movie is $10 in Spain, and an iPad Pro sells for about $800 in Switzerland \u2014 prices that do not differ that much from those in New York City. But if you\u2019re suffering from ovarian cancer or rheumatoid arthritis, the prices in the United States for leading medicines are at least twice what those same drugs cost in those other nations.The fact that Americans pay more for their drugs has long spurred anger and questions about why we spend so much. Seniors crossing the border in buses to fill their drug prescriptions in Canada or Mexico is a perennial news story.It may surprise some, then, that President Trump devoted so much of his long-awaited address last week on the high cost of prescription drugs to reversing the narrative about drug costs in the United States. The problem, he said, is that Americans pay too much because others pay too little. \u201cIn some cases medicines that cost a few dollars in a foreign country,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201ccost hundreds of dollars in America for the same pill with the same ingredients in the same package made in the same plant \u2014 and that is unacceptable.\u201d In his mind, foreign powers are taking advantage of Americans yet again. Other nations are free riders, forcing patients and taxpayers in the United States to subsidize the cost of global medical innovation.Amid a long list of proposals, the president\u2019s big idea for cutting drug costs at home is raising them abroad. This idea, however, is based on a diagnosis that largely misses the mark and suggests a set of policy prescriptions that would be likely to have little effect on the drug prices that most Americans pay.\u201cIn a free market,\u201d a recent report of Mr. Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers maintains, \u201cprices of products reflect their value as opposed to prices in government-controlled markets, which reflect political trade-offs.\u201d Yet the notion that drug costs in the United States are determined by open competition is fiction. Patents and grants of market exclusivity exist to enable manufacturers to exclude competitors and charge high prices for drugs for a limited period of time to recoup their investment in research and development. Laws and regulations require private insurers and government programs to cover drugs like many cancer medications at any cost. There is no consistent price of a drug across the American health care system. Virtually every payer in the system must negotiate its own terms with drug companies, from small insurers and health plans with little market leverage to the Department of Veterans Affairs, which achieves lower drug prices for its programs through soliciting bids and negotiating bulk discounts on multiyear acquisition contracts.There is little evidence that prices in the United States are fairer than those in nations that consider the value of each new drug before deciding how much to pay. Indeed, the average prices charged for some leading drugs, like Humira (for rheumatoid arthritis), in Britain, Spain and Switzerland are closer to the threshold that the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an independent evaluator of drug pricing, has determined would make buying such drugs cost-effective for Americans.Then there is the question of how the United States could even begin to make other countries pay more for prescription drugs. The answer, again according to the Council of Economic Advisers, will be using trade deals to \u201cchange the incentives that other countries face in making drug-pricing decisions.\u201dThis is not a new idea. Since 2001, the United States has entered into trade deals with 17 countries. All include strong patent protections for pharmaceuticals. The trade deals that the United States has with Australia and South Korea require due process and transparency in drug pricing and formulary decisions. While most of these trade deals are more than a decade old, they do not appear to have yet raised other countries\u2019 drug prices closer to those in the United States, and they certainly have not resulted in Americans paying less for their medicines.Even if the United States successfully took a tougher stance on drug pricing in renegotiating Nafta or in future trade talks, it would be years before any effect manifested. United States trade deals require, on average, three and a half years to conclude and implement. These agreements would not apply retroactively to medicines already on the market. The number of new medicines subject to Trump-era trade policies would build slowly. This is especially true since Mr. Trump has made it clear that he intends to negotiate only bilateral trade deals, with one country at a time.The drug industry, no doubt, knows this, which why it is hard to believe that the dim and distant promise of revenues abroad will persuade industry executives to voluntarily make steep price cuts in the United States, which represents a third of the global pharmaceutical market.The Trump administration is missing an opportunity to confront the real reasons American drug prices are high and differ from other nations\u2019. We do not pay more for their medicines because our patent laws are generous; European nations have similar laws. The United States is not the only country lacking a central payer that negotiates bulk discounts. But the United States is distinct in that it offers strong drug patent protections and limits the ability of public and private payers to appraise new drugs and bargain effectively for lower prices.This combination means companies price their drugs at whatever that segment of the United States market will bear, rather than as a benchmark of the drug\u2019s therapeutic and economic value, underlying research and development costs, or expected global revenues. And in recent years, the United States market has borne a lot, with high drug prices leading to rising insurance premiums and fewer patients able to afford their prescriptions. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predicts that Americans\u2019 drug spending will increase to more than $1,700 per person by 2026.Mr. Trump must decide whether he has the conviction of his campaign claims. If his goal remains to lower the prices of medicines for Americans, he will succeed only by identifying and learning from the best practices abroad rather than finding new ways to undermine them. Following those examples, Mr. Trump should support establishing a transparent mechanism to determine reasonable prices for innovative medicines that are based on the lives and health care costs they save, and then work with government programs and insurance companies to achieve them. Until that happens, Mr. Trump will remain a soothing presence to the pharmaceutical industry and its investors.Thomas J.

Over all, the peso is down nearly 19 percent since the start of the year.Mr. Macri, president since December 2015, portrayed the request as the product of changing international conditions and the legacy of high government spending.\u201cThe problem we have is that we are among the countries in the world that most depend on external financing, the product of the huge public spending that we inherited,\u201d he said in a recorded video message.Treasury Minister Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne emphasized that the financing the country could obtain through the I.M.F. would be cheaper than what was available in the markets. Yet he also gave a thinly veiled nod to the widespread skepticism \u2014 if not outright anger \u2014 that many in Argentina have toward the I.M.F.\u201cWhat we do have to keep in mind is that we are talking about an International Monetary Fund that is very different from what we knew 20 years ago,\u201d Mr. Dujovne said. \u201cThe fund has learned its lessons from the past, just like we all did.\u201d\u201cThe I.M.F. is a bad word in Argentina because of the memories it brings to mind of economic programs that almost never turned out well,\u201d said Matias Carugati, chief economist at Management & Fit, a consultancy.When President N\u00e9stor Kirchner paid off an I.M.F. debt of almost $10 billion in 2006, he celebrated it as a way for the country to regain its sovereignty.Mr. Macri took office with an ambitious plan to end a decade of isolation from the international markets by issuing billions in debt. Now, the decision to turn to the I.M.F. could erode Argentines\u2019 confidence in him, said Luis Tonelli, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Buenos Aires.Merely seeking the help of the I.M.F. could lead the public to feel that \u201cthe government is weak and has to call the bad guy in the movie,\u201d Mr. Tonelli said.Members of the political opposition were quick to criticize Mr. Macri.Front for Victory, the largest opposition bloc in the lower house of the National Congress of Argentina, called the decision \u201ca severe step backward.\u201d\u201cAgreements with the I.M.F. have always been prejudicial to our people,\u201d the group said. \u201cThey have meant cuts in salaries, pensions, privatizations and firings in the public sector and increases in poverty.\u201dEconomists cautioned that more information was needed in order to properly analyze the type of credit the government could obtain from the I.M.F. and the conditions that would be imposed as a result.\u201cIt is news that should bring a bit of relief to the market,\u201d said Luis Secco, the director of Perspectivas Econ\u00f3micas, a consultancy. \u201cBut it\u2019s undeniable that the words \u2018agreement with the fund\u2019 will also cause a lot of political problems for the government.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Jersey Town and University Bridge Their Divide, and Both Reap a Reward", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetGLASSBORO, N.J. \u2014 Joseph A. Brigandi Jr. remembers when his father ran a sub shop in the heart of this southern New Jersey town in the 1960s, when there were only four or five restaurants downtown and no out-of-town shopping malls threatened the survival of local businesses.What seemed an idyllic period for Mr. Brigandi\u2019s hometown, where he is now the borough administrator, did not last. By the mid-1980s, many businesses had closed because they could not compete with the malls. Jobs disappeared, and some residents left for the suburbs. Downtown Glassboro became a crime-ridden area where most of the housing was subsidized or rented by students from Glassboro State College, which is now Rowan University.\u201cIt was not a pleasant time or a safe time to be in Glassboro,\u201d Mr. Brigandi, 61, said. \u201cBecause of what was going on, it affected the whole town. There was only a handful of businesses left that were still doing O.K.\u201dWhen he became borough administrator in 1999, Mr. Brigandi began to search for ways to turn the town around, and he focused on Rowan, a public college whose campus a few blocks from downtown seemed to have the potential to revive the local economy. But it would work only if city and university officials overcame years of distrust.\u201cTraditionally, Rowan didn\u2019t have a warm relationship with the town,\u201d Mr. Brigandi said. \u201cThe town had little say over what went on at the university. The college took the attitude: \u2018What happens on campus is our problem. What happens in town is your problem.\u2019\u201dElsewhere, universities are cooperating with government officials and private developers to add and improve facilities for their growing student populations while strengthening local economies. Examples include Providence, R.I., where Brown University worked with two colleges and CV Properties, a Boston developer, to repurpose a disused power station as a nursing school and an administration building. In Tallahassee, Fla., Florida A&M University is working with an Orlando developer, CTG, and local officials to build a 700-unit student residence that is expected to open in 2020.For the Rowan expansion, the borough issued $30 million in redevelopment bonds to buy and demolish 90 residential properties, aided by about $70 million in state tax credits. Some owners moved out of town, while others chose to move elsewhere in Glassboro. All purchases were completed without the use of eminent domain, and all of the residents in those properties were relocated, Mr. Brigandi said.\u201cIn the beginning, there was a little reluctance \u2014 people were emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cThey eventually realized we were going to treat them fairly and help them get into a situation that was at least as good if not better than where they were. In the end, everybody walked away happy.\u201dThe result is Rowan Boulevard, a $426 million development that joins \u201ctown and gown.\u201d By the time the project is complete in August, its developer, Nexus Properties, will have created housing for about 1,600 students; 134,000 square feet of retail, medical and fitness space plus parking garages; 81,000 square feet of office and classroom space; and 114 apartments.Nexus\u2019 chief operating officer, Dante Germano, said the company became the third partner in the Glassboro revitalization project in 2011, and had invested some $300 million.Mr. Germano was drawn to the Glassboro project, he said, because the presence of Rowan students ensured demand for the new housing, and because he grew up in the town. His father owned a pool hall, and his uncle owned a bakery in Glassboro.He was also interested in helping to create a new town center that could be sustained by the millennials who increasingly want to live in walkable, urban communities, and by retiring baby boomers who are showing an interest in downtown living.Those trends are contributing to growth in many cities, including nearby Philadelphia, but the remaking of Glassboro, with a permanent population of around 20,000, is distinguished because it is underpinned by the university, Mr. Germano said.\u201cThe difference here is that we have an economic driver called Rowan University that is really fueling the fire, so we can use their need for expansion to really make this happen,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of this happens without the expansion of Rowan University.\u201dIt has also allowed the college to outsource the provision of new student housing to Nexus, which is better qualified to provide that service than the university would be. And by choosing to cooperate with the developer and the borough rather than expanding independently, the school has helped break down geographic and cultural barriers between itself and the town, he said.\u201cHow could we as an economic engine help revitalize the city and benefit ourselves?\u201d Dr. Houshmand said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we do it ourselves? We have plenty of land. But in doing so, we would have perpetuated the problem that we have a fictitious wall around us.\u201dThe strong growth in Rowan\u2019s enrollment plus the increasing number of baby boomers moving to Glassboro showed that the three-way partnership to revive the town was working, said Michael Silverman, senior vice president of valuation and advisory in the Philadelphia office of Newmark Knight Frank, a commercial real estate firm.\u201cTo drive through Glassboro, you can feel the transformation from what it once was to a market that\u2019s really beginning to thrive,\u201d Mr. Silverman said.The new outlook can be seen at Mexican Mariachi Grill, a new 90-seat restaurant on Rowan Boulevard that will soon offer full service for sit-down customers as well as takeout service.Ricardo Ramos, a co-owner of the restaurant, said he and his family partners offered both kinds of service \u2014 at an investment of $1.2 million \u2014 because they believed the restaurant would attract two kinds of customers in the remade town center.\u201cThere is a combination of business from the students and from the neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cWe decided to come here because we have seen that this town is really expanding.\u201dThe revitalization project is drawing new residents, too. Bill and Joan Murphy moved into one of the new Nexus apartments in December after about a quarter-century in a suburban home in Mount Laurel, N.J.Mr. Murphy, 72, who teaches part time at St. Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia, said he and his wife were enjoying their proximity to the Rowan campus and to shops and restaurants within walking distance of their apartment, which overlooks the new town square.\u201cIt\u2019s meeting our expectations that we were going to have a lot of things at our fingertips,\u201d he said.The combination of people like the Murphys and restaurants like Mariachi Grill is a sign that Glassboro is making a turnaround, Mr. Germano of Nexus said.\u201cThose businesses that come and invest here, they believe that they are going to have demand for their product,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the market telling us that this is the right location.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mafia Reporter With a Police Escort (and the 200 Journalists Like Him)", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 For many of his days over the past four years, Paolo Borrometi has lived in isolation, though he is barely ever alone. He has not walked through a park or by the beach in his native Sicily for years. He cannot go to a restaurant freely, or to a concert or the movies. He can\u2019t drive a car alone, go shopping alone, or go out for dinner by himself.Before heading to work as a reporter covering the mafia, he starts each morning with an espresso, a cigarette \u2014 and his police escort.Angering the mafia as a journalist in Italy makes for a lonely life. And yet Mr. Borrometi, 35, is in good company. Almost 200 reporters in Italy live under police protection, making it unique among industrialized Western countries, advocacy groups say.\u201cNone of us wants to be a hero or a model,\u201d Mr. Borrometi told an assembly of high school students on a recent morning in Rome, where he now lives. \u201cWe just want to do our job and our duty, to tell stories.\u201dYet murders connected to organized crime are rising in Italy, the authorities say, and international observers consider criminal networks the principal threat to journalists in Europe.\u201cDon\u2019t stop writing, Paolo,\u201d read an email Mr. Borrometi received two days after he was assaulted in 2014 outside his family\u2019s country home in Sicily by two men wearing balaclavas. \u201cOur countries need free and investigative journalism. You have my respect.\u201d\u201cItaly is historically the country that has felt the mafia the most, and has a dozen of journalists under 24-hour police protection,\u201d Ms. Ad\u00e8s-M\u00e9vel said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen in other countries.\u201dAmong those journalists is Lirio Abbate, a mafia expert with the magazine L\u2019Espresso, who has been under protection for 11 years, since the police thwarted a bomb attack in front of his house in Palermo. Federica Angeli, a reporter with La Repubblica, and her family have been under police escort for five years. And Roberto Saviano, the author of \u201cGomorrah,\u201d a best-selling book, movie and TV series about the Neapolitan crime syndicate, has been under escort since 2006.For Mr. Borrometi, it took just a year of reporting on the secret businesses and clandestine political ties of the mafia in southeastern Sicily for his independent news website, La Spia (The Spy), before criminals menaced him. In five years, he got hundreds of death threats from local mobsters.Mr. Borrometi, who trained as a lawyer, started writing for local papers when he was 17, inspired by a Sicilian investigative reporter, Giovanni Spampinato, who was killed by the mafia in the 1970s.He started his own website five years ago. His first investigation, on mafia infiltrations among top officials in the town of Scicli, contributed to the government\u2019s decision to dissolve city hall.His articles pull no punches. They detail the connections between political powers and the mob, naming names, and accompanied by photographs. \u201cPeople need to know who they are when they meet them at the bar,\u201d he said.At first, his articles prompted vandalism against him and late night phone calls. But things got physical after he began writing a series of stories that showed how Sicily\u2019s largest fruit and vegetable market was controlled by mobsters.He was feeding his dog outside his country home, when two men jumped him, grabbed his right arm, and twisted it behind his back until his shoulder muscles tore in three places.\u201cThe only words the attackers told me that day were, \u2018Mind your own business,\u2019 or \u2018This is only the first warning,\u2019 or a Sicilian, less polite, version of it,\u201d Mr. Borrometi recalled.Almost five years later, he still can\u2019t move his shoulder properly.That didn\u2019t stop him from continuing to report on the mafia and taking a number of the mafiosi who threatened him to court. One night, after a fire attack almost burned down his apartment, the police decided to put him under full-time protection.The mafia wasn\u2019t cowed.\u201cWe\u2019ll cut your head off, even inside a police station,\u201d the local mafia boss said in a public post on social media.His reporting \u2014 and police investigations \u2014 have by now exposed a wider network of mafia affiliates who move produce from the fruit and vegetable market in Vittoria, Sicily, to the rest of Italy and to Europe, in affiliation with other criminal groups.He found out that one of the companies growing the famed Pachino tomato, a special cherry tomato certified by Italy\u2019s Agriculture Ministry, was owned by the sons of two prominent mobsters. One of them had spent more than two decades in jail for mafia ties, and was now working for his son\u2019s company.The news spread, and the ministry took notice and cut the company off from the list of businesses that can sell Pachino tomatoes. Not only did the mobsters feel under attack by a reporter, they were out millions of euros in lost revenue.Last month, the mobsters decided to scale up their threats. The police say they intercepted a Sicilian mobster while he was discussing a plot with his sons to kill Mr. Borrometi with a car bomb.\u201cWe need a \u2018firework\u2019 like those in the 1990s, when one couldn\u2019t even walk on the streets,\u201d said the man, who was caught on a police wiretap. \u201cA death every once in a while is useful, so that all the whippersnappers calm down a little.\u201dThe reference was to the tense years when two Palermo prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, were brutally murdered alongside their bodyguards, and car bombs exploded around Italy, killing bystanders and damaging historic buildings.In the wiretapped conversation, the man was advocating for a return to that bloody time of overt intimidation of authorities and citizens alike. There hasn\u2019t been a mafia car bomb in Italy since then.\u201cThis shows how much investigative journalism angers the mafia, which thrives with its business in silence,\u201d Nino Di Matteo \u2014 a prominent mafia prosecutor, hence also a prime target \u2014 said on national television a few days after the police arrested those said to be planning the attack against Mr. Borrometi.\u201cJournalism has a fundamental role in the fight against the mafia, especially in a moment like this,\u201d said Mr. Di Matteo, who also travels with bodyguards. \u201cI believe we are underestimating a bit of the danger that the mafia represents to the country and to our democracy.\u201dMr. Borrometi is thankful, of course, that the police intervened before the plot against him could be put into action.\u201cI owe my life to my state, to those policemen and magistrates,\u201d Mr. Borrometi said during an interview at his home this month.And he owes his life to the men who protect him constantly, though once the armored door closes on his apartment in Rome\u2019s city center, he is alone.\u201cI am without my family and my loved ones,\u201d he said smiling, surrounded by framed anti-mafia recognitions. \u201cBut I have my wonderful job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Shifts From Trade War Threats to Concessions in Rebuff to Hard-Liners", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s recent threat to impose tariffs on as much as $150 billion worth of Chinese goods appeared to be the first volley in what looked like a full-scale trade war with the nation\u2019s greatest economic adversary. Now, suddenly, Mr. Trump seems ready to make peace.To alleviate trade tensions, Mr. Trump is considering easing up on a major Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, in exchange for China agreeing to buy more American products and lifting its own crippling restrictions on American agriculture, people familiar with the deliberations said.The shift is an abrupt reversal that reflects another twist in the pitched battle inside the White House between the economic nationalists, who channel Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist instincts, and more mainstream advisers, who worry about the effects of hard-line policies on the stock market and long-term economic growth.While the nationalists had recently seemed ascendant \u2014 pushing Mr. Trump toward a showdown with the Chinese over steel exports and their co-opting of American technology \u2014 a deal on ZTE, and potentially a range of other trade actions, would represent a victory for the mainstream contingent, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Mr. Mnuchin has taken the lead role in trying to head off potentially harmful tariffs and investment restrictions on China and has succeeded, at least for now, in persuading Mr. Trump to adopt a more conciliatory approach than the president\u2019s more hard-line advisers have advocated, according to people familiar with the deliberations.An agreement on ZTE, which administration officials said could be struck with a visiting Chinese vice premier, Liu He, later this week, would remove a major source of tension between the United States and China at a sensitive moment: In just a few weeks, Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, at a landmark summit meeting in Singapore.The president\u2019s reconsideration of sanctions imposed on ZTE stems in part from Beijing\u2019s demand that he consider lifting the penalties before the visit of Mr. Liu, Mr. Xi\u2019s senior economic adviser, who is arriving in Washington this week to try again to ease the friction. The Chinese made clear that Mr. Liu\u2019s visit was conditional on discussing the sanctions.Mr. Mnuchin has tried to broker a relationship with the Chinese and pressed for a high-level delegation to travel to Beijing to try to resolve tensions this month. He has tried to focus the president on a deal that would reduce the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China, much to the chagrin of more nationalist advisers.During their trip to Beijing early this month, the American delegation, which included top officials with divergent views, handed the Chinese a lengthy list of demands to radically change their trade practices and curtail the state\u2019s role in the economy.The list, which included cutting their trade surplus with the United States by $200 billion, halting subsidies to advanced manufacturing and slashing their tariffs to the same level as the United States, took the Chinese by surprise, according to people familiar with the visit, and it appeared to further sour relations between the two economic giants.The demands bore the imprint of Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative who is a longtime litigator on steel-dumping cases, and Peter Navarro, a trade adviser whose academic work has focused on the dire threat posed by China to American workers and companies.The Chinese offered very little in return, several officials said. But Mr. Trump, rather than escalating the conflict, now appears to be seeking a quicker, easier resolution of the dispute. In addition to Mr. Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council and a longtime free trade advocate, also favors striking some kind of deal, according to people familiar with his thinking.\u201cSecretary Mnuchin has been pushing for a more conciliatory view to China for this entire period, certainly since the launch of the 301 investigation,\u201d Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said, referring to the section of trade law that authorized an investigation into whether China had illegally obtained American intellectual property.\u201cWe see evidence that the Treasury Department does not want to impose investment sanctions on China as required by the original 301 findings,\u201d Mr. Scissors added.A senior Treasury Department official said Mr. Mnuchin has conferred with Mr. Trump and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, about China\u2019s ZTE concerns. However, the official said a review of the Commerce Department action against ZTE was not a precondition for trade talks.Among Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, Mr. Mnuchin has been more encouraged by China\u2019s expressions of willingness to address the trade imbalance between the two countries. Because of his national security responsibilities, officials said, he also considers how trade tensions could affect the negotiation with North Korea over its nuclear program. China, as North Korea\u2019s neighbor and largest trading partner, will play an influential role in those talks.The Trump administration threatened ZTE\u2019s existence as a business last month, when the Commerce Department ordered a seven-year halt in American shipments of computer microchips and software that are at the heart of most of ZTE\u2019s telecommunications gear.The Commerce Department accused ZTE of violating American sanctions by selling to Iran and North Korea and then covering up the exports and rewarding the executives involved. ZTE acknowledged it violated sanctions, but blamed the actions on poor internal controls rather than a deliberate defiance of the American legal system.ZTE, a 75,000-employee business that makes smartphones and cellphone tower equipment, began shutting down operations last week after it was unable to find alternative suppliers.The move also hit one of the biggest American telecom companies, Qualcomm, which lost the ability to export semiconductors to ZTE, one of its biggest customers. In China, Qualcomm\u2019s plan to acquire NXP Semiconductors had been stalled by a prolonged antitrust review, which many saw as retaliation for America\u2019s trade moves.The tweet provoked a swift and harsh response from Democratic and Republican lawmakers.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement, \u201cThis leads to the greatest worry, which is that the president will back off on what China fears most \u2014 a crackdown on intellectual property theft \u2014 in exchange for buying some goods in the short run.\u201dOn Monday, the White House denied that accommodating China\u2019s concerns represented a broken promise by Mr. Trump to protect America\u2019s interests, saying that the relationship with China was complex. \u201cHe\u2019s been tough and he\u2019s confronted them,\u201d said Raj Shah, the deputy press secretary.Mr. Ross said Monday that ZTE\u2019s fate should not be linked to the trade negotiations. \u201cZTE did do some inappropriate things \u2014 they admitted to them,\u201d he said in a speech. \u201cThe question is, \u2018Are there alternative remedies to the one that we had originally put forward?\u2019\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s offer to throw ZTE a lifeline found a receptive audience in Beijing, where the company\u2019s travails have crystallized the fears of Chinese leaders that their country depends too much on American technology.\u201cWe very much appreciate the positive attitude of the U.S. side to the issue of the ZTE Corporation, and are maintaining close communication with the U.S. on the implementation of specific details,\u201d Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.Hu Xijin, the chief editor of Global Times, a newspaper owned by the Chinese Communist Party, said on the social media service Weibo, \u201cNo matter if the previous sanction was a card in Washington\u2019s concerted move for a trade war on China, the newest decision is a good one.\u201dAna Swanson and Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Keith Bradsher from Taipei, Taiwan.

Her swing was quick as a bee\u2019s wing, sending the ball skyward as a gaggle of kids \u2014 mostly Filipino, some white \u2014 cheered and elbowed to bat next.The game, played on a recent afternoon, was a typical mixed gathering for Pyramid Hill, a one-pub town of around 500 people in central Victoria that has become a model of rural revival and multicultural integration.\u201cI\u2019m still surprised they\u2019re as open to us as they are,\u201d said Abigail Umali, 39, a veterinarian from Manila who works at a local pig farm, and whose daughter, Maria, was the girl at bat.\u201cThis school wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for them,\u201d said Kelvin Matthews, 36, the bowler, as he watched the children interact.It\u2019s called small-town living.\u201cPeople in the country mix, and need to mix,\u201d said Tom Smith, a pig farmer who inadvertently started the town\u2019s revival in 2008 when he sponsored visas for four workers from the Philippines. \u201cIt\u2019s just different out here; it\u2019s the only way to survive.\u201dRural collapse is a familiar tale, seen across the American Midwest and in many areas of Europe, where small communities have been squeezed by globalization. It\u2019s no different in Australia: an urbanizing country, as physically large as the United States, where towns of a few hundred people are fading like puddles in the sun.But the success of Pyramid Hill \u2014 and many other small Australian towns \u2014 suggests that there are opportunities being missed and lessons to be learned. At a time when politicians in Australia, and around the world, are calling for restrictions on immigration, small towns in Australia are asking for more immigrants.\u201cThere\u2019s a real network of people who know how to make this work, who make it work in their community and can share it with others,\u201d said Jack Archer, the chief executive of the Regional Australia Institute, a government research organization. \u201cThis is something we should really be thinking about scaling up.\u201dPyramid Hill is a quiet drive of about 240 kilometers, or 150 miles, from Melbourne, finishing with a stretch of land that is mostly empty except for golden wheat fields and lint-gray sheep.The community took its name in 1836 from a granite outcrop on the town\u2019s edge. From its peak, I had little trouble seeing newer landmarks, which rose above the countryside and hinted at local despair: grain silos that are no longer used; a pet food factory that shut down in 2008.Residents still talk about the era before the Filipinos came as one of quiet desperation. Streets without children. Homes decaying. The town\u2019s population bottomed out at 419 in 2011, down from 699 in the 1960s.\u201cWe were in dire straits,\u201d said Cheryl McKinnon, the mayor of Loddon Shire, the municipality that includes Pyramid Hill. \u201cWe needed our population to grow.\u201dEconomists often discuss immigration in terms of a multiplier effect. Newcomers don\u2019t just fill jobs, they also create them, by bringing demand for new products and services.This is especially true in Australia, where the minimum wage is 18.29 Australian dollars an hour ($13.70) and most migrants are skilled workers or students.Places like Pyramid Hill offer an alternative.\u201cThere just has got to be some employment opportunity,\u201d said Mr. Archer of the Regional Australia Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s more of that than people think.\u201dStatistics from the institute suggest that many rural communities suffer not from a lack of employment, but a lack of employees.Labor market participation in regional Australia \u2014 the areas outside major cities \u2014 is well above the national average. And since rural populations tend to be older, that means many people continue to work well after they might have wanted to retire.Mr. Smith, the pig farmer, rejected that pattern. He flew to Manila in 2008 to interview job applicants for his Kia-Ora piggery after placing a help wanted ad in a local newspaper.Two of his four original hires still work at Kia-Ora. Mr. Smith, 66, a taciturn farmer who warms up to strangers at the pace of an autumn morning, has retired from managing the piggery.To understand the town\u2019s revival, he told me, I would have to visit.One morning before 7 a.m., I found myself donning a paper jumpsuit and tall rubber boots for a day of pork production with Kia-Ora\u2019s mostly Filipino work force.We started in the breeding area, a series of long metal warehouses filled with tiny newborn piglets and pregnant sows big enough to knock a small car off the road.Gail Smith, the mating supervisor, was guiding Raymond Mabulac, one of the Filipino workers, on the latest methods of artificial insemination.\u201cWhen you\u2019re done, you need to hop in the pen and record them,\u201d she said.\u201cEasy,\u201d Mr. Mabulac said. \u201cNo worries.\u201dThat breezy rapport took time. It wasn\u2019t that Mr. Mabulac didn\u2019t speak English; he did. It was just sayings like \u201crightee-o\u201d that took him awhile to work out. \u201cAt first,\u201d Ms. Smith said, laughing, \u201cI don\u2019t think he had any idea what I was saying.\u201dKia-Ora adjusted and expanded slowly, bringing in new employees (and their families) over several years. Many of the new hires were old friends of the early ones, or attended the same university in the Philippines, studying veterinary medicine or animal husbandry.Some were already in Australia, like Ms. Umali, the vet, who moved to Pyramid Hill four years ago from Sydney with her husband and two children.\u201cIt was a big change,\u201d she said.Despite the hard work, there has been little turnover among the employees.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how warm the people are here,\u201d Ms. Umali said. Her voice seemed to crack with emotion. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned to adapt.\u201dResearch from the Regional Australia Institute shows that the areas reviving most quickly tend to offer new arrivals not just well-paying jobs but a sense of community.In the Shire of Dalwallinu, a town in Western Australia\u2019s Wheat Belt that is coming back to life thanks to migrants from the Philippines and elsewhere, residents helped workers move their families from abroad.In the small town of Nhill, in northwestern Victoria, locals have managed the arrival of ethnic Karen refugees from Myanmar since 2010, helping them find housing, learn English and engage in social activities.Pyramid Hill\u2019s evolution has been just as personal. Neighbors regularly meet to share food and learn about each other\u2019s cultures.\u201cEvery month there\u2019s one Australian speaker and a Filipino speaker, and we cook for each other,\u201d said Helen Garchitorena, 47, a leader of the exchange. \u201cWe explain the importance of the food, and we talk.\u201dCompared with those in many cities and suburbs, people in Pyramid Hill seem to have more time and interest in building bonds across ethnic boundaries. An annual Filipino \u201cfiesta\u201d was added to the town\u2019s events calendar in 2015, and every week seems to include an opportunity to socialize.A short walk away from the cricket match at St. Patrick\u2019s, for example, teenagers gathered for a trivia night at Pyramid Hill College, the public school where Ms. Garchitorena now works.The town has welcomed the Filipinos in part because families bring energy. But it also helps that, like the locals, many are Catholic, and they arrived in Australia already speaking some English.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to mesh together,\u201d said Ms. Garchitorena\u2019s daughter, Fionne, 15. \u201cI think it mostly works.\u201dStill, she said, there are growing pains. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I have rice for lunch and they\u2019ll say \u2018You\u2019re so Asian\u2019 \u2014 and I\u2019m like, well, yes, I\u2019m very aware of that.\u2019\u201dDuke Caburnay, 16, whose father works at Kia-Ora, said that he runs up against racism when his team plays Australian rules football in other small towns. White players sometimes hurl racial insults at him.Some of Pyramid Hill\u2019s adult Filipino residents also say they are expected to outperform white counterparts just to be considered equal.\u201cThey generalize a lot \u2014 Asians are like this, Australians are like that,\u201d said Fritzie Caburnay, 46, Duke\u2019s mother, who has a master\u2019s degree in public administration. \u201cSome people say the Filipinos have invaded.\u201dStill, she said, \u201cwe feel at home here.\u201dIt\u2019s a sentiment widely shared.Ms. Umali eventually explained why she has grown so loyal to the town. Last year, she said, her husband was at Kia-Ora working his usual shift when he collapsed in one of the pig pens.He died suddenly of a heart attack. He was 44.An outpouring of support followed for her and her two children, Raphael, 12, and Maria, 10, the cricket batter. Every day, friends and even total strangers would appear at the wood-frame home she rents beside St. Patrick\u2019s, smiling, carrying meals and money, or just offering emotional support.The principal of St. Patrick\u2019s, Colleen Hampson, had to fight back tears when discussing the tragedy and the community\u2019s response. So did Ms. Umali.\u201cWhat happened to me here, I can\u2019t even compare it to what would have happened in the Philippines,\u201d she said, looking away to gain composure. \u201cIt\u2019s actually overwhelming.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Last week, President Mamnoon Hussain announced that the general elections for the national assembly and four provincial ones would be held on July 25.Mr. Mulk enjoys a politically neutral reputation. His tenure as chief justice in 2014 was not marred by the accusations of judicial overreach that plagued some of the other Supreme Court leaders.\u201cI am hopeful that God will give him the passion and courage to successfully conduct free, fair and impartial elections,\u201d Mr. Shah, the opposition leader, said at the news conference.Mr. Shah said Mr. Mulk\u2019s name had been chosen from a list of four candidates. Other opposition politicians also welcomed the nomination.The biggest challenge for Mr. Mulk will be to ensure free and fair elections at a time of heightened tensions between leading politicians. Some have accused the military of denying the political party of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif a level playing field.Mr. Khan, a popular former cricket player, accused Mr. Sharif\u2019s party of having rigged the elections. He staged a protest sit-in in Islamabad that lasted months.The Supreme Court barred Mr. Sharif from holding public office for life, but he is hoping that if his party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, retains control in the summer elections, he can find a way back into power.When Mr. Sharif took power in 2013, the country\u2019s economy was in a nose dive, and power failures were crippling day-to-day life. Despite the political upheavals, Mr. Sharif\u2019s government managed to complete several power and infrastructure projects, showcasing them as his claim to win yet another electoral victory.But it is the grueling confrontation with the powerful military and the judiciary that poses the biggest challenge to Mr. Sharif\u2019s return to power.The military denies any meddling in politics. Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, the army chief, has publicly stated that the army remains committed to democracy.Five years ago, terrorism was one of the main concerns during the election campaign and several political parties, like the Pakistan Peoples Party and Awami National Party, could not campaign openly amid threats by the Taliban.The militant threat has since diminished, but there are concerns now that hard-line Islamists are being encouraged to take part in politics, which will give them greater legitimacy.\u201cWith the combination of curbs on free speech and political defections from Sharif\u2019s party,\u201d Mr. Rafiq, the political analyst said, \u201cthere\u2019s a belief that the elections are being prefigured in some way by a military-judicial combine.

{"Headline": "Lebanon Elections Boost Hezbollah\u2019s Clout", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Hezbollah and its political allies expanded their share of seats in Lebanon\u2019s Parliament, increasing their political clout at the expense of the country\u2019s Western-backed prime minister, according to preliminary election results released on Monday.The outcome of Lebanon\u2019s first parliamentary elections in nine years shored up Hezbollah\u2019s position in a way that is likely to alarm the United States, Israel and Gulf Arab nations like Saudi Arabia.Iran backs Hezbollah, a political party and militant group that maintains Lebanon\u2019s most powerful military force and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States. Iran has also invested in allies in Syria, Yemen and Iraq, whose parliamentary elections on Saturday could hand victories to groups aligned with Iran.While the number of seats held by Hezbollah itself remained largely unchanged at around 13, victories by political allies who support its maintenance of a vast arsenal increased the chances the group would play a key role in a coalition government and diminished the prospects for legislation that would challenge its status.The election\u2019s biggest blow was to the movement lead by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, the country\u2019s most prominent Sunni Muslim politician and an ally of the West.His group, the Future Movement, saw its parliamentary share shrink by about one-third, to 21 seats from 33 seats, in the 128-member body, Mr. Hariri told reporters on Monday.In Lebanon\u2019s complex, sect-based political system, the prime minister must be a Sunni, while the speaker of Parliament is a Shiite and the president is a Maronite Christian.While Mr. Hariri\u2019s movement lost ground to rival Sunnis, he still appeared poised to keep his job as prime minister.It remained unclear late Monday when the Lebanese government would release the official results for the poll, which was held on Sunday. That would begin negotiations to form a government, a process that could drag on for weeks or months.Lebanon\u2019s unique sectarian make up and place in the region make its politics about local issues like jobs, infrastructure and garbage collection as well as about regional rivalries and alliances. In general, the country\u2019s politics have long broken down between a camp affiliated with Iran and one oriented toward Saudi Arabia and the United States.Mr. Hariri, the leader of the latter camp, appears to have lost ground because his supporters were disappointed by his performance and because of the concessions he had to make to rival parties to secure his post as prime minister, said Emile Hokayem, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who was in Lebanon for the vote.The strong showing by Hezbollah and its allies could jeopardize the country\u2019s regional and international standing at a time when its leaders are counting on international support to prop up the economy, support the military and deal with the burden of nearly 1 million refugees from neighboring Syria.\u201cLebanon is very exposed to the Iran-centered turmoil in the region, so Hezbollah and the others are going to have to navigate carefully if they want to avoid the consequences of that,\u201d Mr. Hokayem said.Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a televised speech on Monday that the results would give \u201cprotection\u201d to what his supporters call \u201cthe resistance,\u201d or the regional alliance opposed to Israeli and American influence.Kassem Qassir, a Lebanese political analyst close to Hezbollah, said that the elections represented a victory for \u201cthe Iranian axis\u201d but that Hezbollah\u2019s leaders would seek to make decisions that were good for the country as a whole.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to control Lebanon,\u201d Mr. Qassir said. \u201cThe country is facing many challenges, and Hezbollah is in need of international and outside support.\u201dOther regional dynamics affected the vote.While Mr. Hariri appears to have mended his ties to the kingdom and its powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudis did not provide generous financial support for his campaign as they have in the past.In recent years, Saudi Arabia and Israel have become increasingly alarmed about Iran\u2019s growing influence in the Arab world, and they are likely to see further evidence of this in the election results.On Monday, a member of Israel\u2019s security cabinet said that the Lebanese state had become indistinguishable from Hezbollah, which he said would change Israel\u2019s calculus should it wage a new war against the militant group.\u201cThe State of Israel will not differentiate between the sovereign State of Lebanon and Hezbollah, and will view Lebanon as responsible for any action from within its territory,\u201d Naftali Bennett, the education minister in Israel\u2019s conservative coalition government, wrote on Twitter on Monday.The Lebanese government reported voter turnout at 49 percent, down from 54 percent the last time legislative elections were held in 2009. In Beirut, home to about half of the country\u2019s estimated 4.5 million people, turnout was between 32 and 42 percent, depending on the district.While returning many of Lebanon\u2019s power brokers to office, the elections also brought in new faces. An unprecedented number of women candidates ran, and the number in Parliament appeared to rise to seven from four, which is low compared to other states in the region.The campaign also saw the participation of dozens of independent candidates who said they represented \u201ccivil society\u201d and who focused on services like water and electricity and criticized the established parties for corruption and their inability to address the country\u2019s pressing problems.At least one was reported to have won, a female journalist.Also winning a seat was Jamil al-Sayyed, a retired general and former intelligence chief who is a close friend of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Markets Are Worrying Investors, Again", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdd a familiar item to the list of worries for investors: turmoil in the emerging markets.Turkey\u2019s central bank lifted interest rates sharply Wednesday, an emergency measure aimed at stopping the riptide of capital pouring out of the country in recent days.The central bank announced that it would raise a key borrowing rate by 3 percentage points, to 16.5 percent, after Turkey\u2019s lira dropped by as much as 5 percent during the day. In currency markets, moves of even 1 percent are viewed as exceptionally large.Argentina made a similar move this month after investors abruptly lost faith in the government\u2019s reform efforts. The Argentine peso plunged more than 20 percent, before the central bank lifted interest rates to 40 percent. The government is now negotiating a bailout package with the International Monetary Fund.The question on the minds of investors: Is this the start of a bust that could shake the world economy, similar to those that battered Russia, South Korea, Mexico and most of Southeast Asia in recent decades?Or is this merely a market hiccup, akin to the temporary setback that hit emerging markets in 2013?A checkered history of booms and busts hasn\u2019t stopped investors from pouring trillions of dollars into emerging markets in recent years, lured by the promise of higher rates of return than safer bets in the United States, Europe and Japan.Central banks in those large, developed economies had pushed interest rates sharply lower after the 2008 financial crisis, making the higher yields in riskier countries all the more attractive.Last year, investors pumped $1.2 trillion into fast-growing developing economies, especially those that were perceived as having responsible budget and central bank policies. That amount exceeded the totals in 2015 and 2016 combined.Many of those bets have paid off handsomely. Investors earned more than 9 percent on emerging-market bonds last year, much better than the roughly 3.5 percent they could have earned investing in the American bond markets. Emerging-market stocks did even better, rising more than 30 percent in 2017, compared with a 19 percent increases in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.But now money is flowing the other way. Some $8 billion has fled bond and equity markets in developing countries over the past month and a half, according to the Institute of International Finance, a banking industry trade group. And the sharp drops in Argentine and Turkish markets suggest that trickle is turning into a gusher.Many emerging-market enthusiasts say the recent anxiety simply reflects that investors are locking in gains and temporarily taking their money home.\u201cWhat is driving this is a massive bout of profit-taking \u2014 it\u2019s the first pullback in the past 10 quarters,\u201d said Jan Dehn, an emerging-market bond specialist at Ashmore Investment Management in London. \u201cTurkey and Argentina are weak spots \u2014 but they are just two countries out of 80. Over all, the fundamentals are incredibly strong.\u201dOthers think that Turkey and Argentina, while more fragile than their peers, may merely be the first dominoes to fall as the decade-long environment of low interest rates comes to an end.With the American economy strong, the Federal Reserve is gradually lifting short-term interest rates. Those act as a magnet for money from around the world, pushing the value of the dollar higher. All currencies are relative, so a stronger dollar translates into a decline in the value of other currencies. That trade-off is especially pronounced in emerging markets, whose economies rely on money from foreign investors.This can fuel a vicious cycle in which a strong dollar weakens emerging-market currencies, prompting investors to pull even more money out of those economies. That, in turn, further weakens their currencies.The concern is that the pattern could spread.\u201cIt is not just Argentina and Turkey,\u201d said James Donald, the head of emerging markets at Lazard Asset Management in New York. \u201cThere are some sizable countries suffering from current account deficits.\u201dA country runs a current account deficit if it takes in more money \u2014 in investments and trade \u2014 from foreigners than it sends to other countries. That leaves the country at the mercy of international investors to keep it afloat financially.So far, the rise in the United States dollar hasn\u2019t been especially sharp, especially compared with its rise in 2013, when the Fed first said it would start tapering off the support that the central bank had provided since the financial crisis. That ignited a phenomenon that market players labeled the \u201ctaper tantrum,\u201d and it caused a sharp drop in emerging markets such as South Africa, India and Turkey.The fact that the slight rise in the dollar is already putting emerging markets under pressure is a red flag to some experts, because it suggests the situation could get much more severe if the dollar keeps climbing.\u201cIf we\u2019re getting these kinds of moves for a shock that\u2019s really quite a bit smaller than the \u2018taper tantrum,\u2019 it makes me quite worried,\u201d said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a Trade War With China Isn\u2019t \u2018Easy to Win\u2019 (Slightly Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAt this point, it\u2019s looking as if Trump\u2019s tough talk on China trade will turn out to be as empty as his tough talk on, say drug prices. Faced with the prospect of actually going toe to toe with powerful interests \u2013 as opposed to doing harm to desperate immigrants, poor people who need health care, etc. \u2013 Trump keeps backing down, ignominiously. But what happened to all that bluster about trade wars being \u201cgood, and easy to win\u201d?1. Someone actually managed to explain the economics to him, and he realized that the trade war wasn\u2019t actually a good idea2. He just lost his nerve, as he consistently does when confronting people who aren\u2019t powerless3. He was bribed, with China offering sweet deals to his personal business interests4. The Chinese also have some kind of tapeIt tells you a lot about the state of American leadership that (1) is highly implausible, while 2-4 all seem quite possible. And this means that what I\u2019m about to say may amount to overthinking the issue.Still, I think there are some good reasons why even a crude mercantilist looking at the China situation might conclude that this particular trade war isn\u2019t nearly as easy to win as it might appear at first glance.But GATT-think needs some modifying in an era of complex international value chains. Even if producer interests predominate over consumer interests, what producers should care about is not how much they export but how much income they derive from exporting. That is, they should care about \u201cincome at risk,\u201d not \u201cexports at risk.\u201d These numbers can be very different, and in the case of US-China trade they are.Smartphones are an extreme case, but there\u2019s a lot of that sort of thing. The income China derives from exports to the US is probably not much more than half the face value of those exports. There\u2019s a bit of the same thing going on in the other direction \u2013 US aircraft, for example, contain quite a few foreign components \u2013 but it\u2019s much less extreme.What this means, in turn, is that even if we only focus on narrow producer interests \u2013 even if we take a mercantilist view \u2013 US-China trade is a lot less lopsided than it seems, which in turn means that the pain from a trade war would be a lot less asymmetric than the raw trade numbers might suggest.But wait, there\u2019s more. Apple sells those iPhones for considerably more than it costs to import them from China. This adds a whole additional chunk of US income at risk to the bilateral trade relationship. True, given time Apple could probably find other suppliers \u2013 but not right away, and not easily. Foxconn wasn\u2019t built in a day.Overall, it\u2019s still probably true that China would be hurt worse than the U.S. in an all-out trade war. But the pain wouldn\u2019t be at all one-sided. And it\u2019s possible, I guess, that Trump dimly recognized that reality, or at least noticed that his beloved stock market really doesn\u2019t like trade war talk.Actually, I\u2019m still betting that it\u2019s a bribe and/or some kind of tape. But worth talking through, anyway.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Suspends Tariffs on China, Stoking Fears of a Loss of Leverage", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration has suspended its plan to impose sweeping tariffs on China as it presses forward with trade talks, a gesture that will temporarily ease tensions between the two nations but rapidly increase pressure on President Trump to secure the type of tough deal that he has long said is necessary to protect American workers.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Sunday that the two countries had made progress as they concluded three days of intense trade negotiations in Washington late last week. The planned tariffs on as much as $150 billion worth of Chinese goods are off the table while the talks proceed, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re putting the trade war on hold,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201dThe reprieve came as many crucial details remained undecided, and trade experts warned that the suspension of tariffs could undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s leverage and thrust the United States back into the kind of lengthy \u2014 and ultimately fruitless \u2014 negotiations with China that have bogged down previous administrations.There are also large and lingering questions about what the United States planned to do with one of its most powerful bargaining chips: the Chinese telecom firm ZTE, which has been crippled by sanctions that prevent it from buying American components. Mr. Trump last week suggested on Twitter that he might rethink the company\u2019s punishment in return for trade concessions.Warnings from Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team and lawmakers about easing up on ZTE \u2014 which has been accused of failing to punish employees who violated trade controls against Iran and North Korea \u2014 prompted American officials to take a tougher stance on the company in talks. That, in turn, provoked a less cooperative stance from the Chinese negotiators, who had arrived from Beijing believing that the Trump administration might be prepared to relent. The standoff over ZTE was a significant reason more progress was not made during the talks in Washington, according to three people familiar with the discussions.On Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin said that the United States was not willing to revisit its penalties on ZTE, which gets a large amount of its semiconductors from Qualcomm, the San Diego-based chip maker. He said that there had been no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d linking a trade deal to ZTE\u2019s fate, although President Xi Jinping of China had asked Mr. Trump to consider offering relief to the company.Mr. Mnuchin insisted that the Trump administration was not \u201cgoing easy\u201d on China over ZTE or the trade talks. Mr. Trump wanted to be \u201cvery tough\u201d on ZTE, and that the tariffs could be put back in place if the trade negotiations collapsed, said Mr. Mnuchin, whose department is also required to send recommendations for restrictions on Chinese investment to the White House this week.\u201cHe could always decide to put the tariffs back on if China doesn\u2019t go through with their commitments,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday that a path to ZTE\u2019s revival exists, but that it would be arduous.\u201cIf any of the remedies are altered, they are still going to be very, very tough, including big fines, compliance measures, new management, new boards,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cThe question is whether there are perhaps some small changes around the edges. I think President Trump is doing this because there\u2019s some very good feeling between him and China.\u201d\u201cDo not, please, do not expect ZTE to get off scot-free,\u201d he added. \u201cIt ain\u2019t going to happen.\u201dOn Saturday, both countries released a joint statement that offered little detail about what had been agreed to, other than holding another round of discussions in China. Mr. Mnuchin said on Sunday that the countries had agreed on a \u201cframework\u201d under which China would increase its purchases of American goods, while putting in place \u201cstructural\u201d changes to protect American technology and make it easier for American companies to compete in China.And while Trump administration officials said last week that China was prepared to increase its purchases of American products by $200 billion by 2020, Chinese officials had pushed back on that claim, and the joint statement the two sides released lacked any such dollar figure.On Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin declined to confirm that figure. \u201cWe have very specific targets; I\u2019m not going to disclose what they are,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cThey go industry by industry.\u201dHe suggested that, under a deal, China would increase its purchases of American agricultural products by 35 percent to 45 percent this year and ramp up energy purchases over the next three to five years.Mr. Kudlow said on Sunday that the $200 billion number was a \u201crough ballpark estimate\u201d that both sides had used.\u201cThey are offering to make structural reforms, such as lower tariffs and lowering nontariff barriers, which will permit us to export billions and billions more goods to China,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cThat\u2019s the elementary point. That\u2019s the key point.\u201dMr. Kudlow had told reporters outside of the White House on Friday that the Chinese had offered at least $200 billion in new purchases of American goods. On Sunday, he walked that back.\u201cMaybe I got ahead of the curve but the number 200 billion deficit reduction, which is something the president likes, has been around by all the people on both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s too soon to lock that in.\u201dThe lack of specific commitments from the Chinese also disappointed some previous supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive moves on China, who saw that as a worrying sign for the administration\u2019s ability to secure meaningful reforms.\u201cIt certainly looks like President Trump is failing us on China,\u201d said Daniel DiMicco, the chairman of the trade lobbying group Coalition for a Prosperous America and a former trade adviser to Mr. Trump during his campaign. \u201cHe is letting down all those who voted for him and rewarding those who didn\u2019t. It appears the swamp got him.\u201dSome supporters of the administration\u2019s tough stance on China now fear that the White House is pursuing a quicker deal that would reduce the trade deficit \u2014 a longtime goal of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 as well as forestall a trade war, but sacrifice more ambitious goals the administration had discussed for reforming the Chinese economy.Derek Scissors, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the United States\u2019 response to China\u2019s \u201cpredatory behavior\u201d had been put on hold \u201cin exchange for things yet to occur, and Mnuchin won\u2019t tell us what they are.\u201dBrad Setser, a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, added that \u201cthe most concrete commitment that seems to have emerged out of the U.S.-China trade talks was a commitment on China\u2019s part to buy more of the things that it likely would buy more of no matter what: agricultural products and energy.\u201dIn a statement Sunday, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative who led an investigation last year into China\u2019s infringement of American intellectual property, said that the United States had agreed on a framework to address the serious issues his investigation had identified.\u201cGetting China to open its market to more U.S. exports is significant, but the far more important issues revolve around forced technology transfers, cyber theft and the protection of our innovation,\u201d he said. He added that the United States would use \u201call of its legal tools to protect our technology.\u201dSome Democrats, who have supported the president\u2019s plan to overhaul trade relations with China, expressed concern that Mr. Trump might be softening his aggressive stance in hopes of scoring a quick win on trade.\u201cIf President Xi is going to escape meaningful punishment for ZTE and fail to take strong actions on intellectual property, cyber theft, and American companies having free access to sell goods in China, and instead simply provide a promise to buy goods for the next few years, we will have lost,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said on Sunday.Noah Weiland contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Is Winning", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistFor those of us who feared disaster from this presidency but saw the first year as a period when Trump was relatively constrained, his \u201cI\u2019m in charge here!\u201d pivot was a worrying phenomenon. But it\u2019s the nature of the Trump era to confound all expectations, so naturally what followed the Cohn-Tillerson-McMaster exits and the tariff announcements and the stock market wobbles was \u2026 the most politically successful six weeks of Trump\u2019s presidency to date.Now \u201csuccessful\u201d is a relative term: Our president is still deeply unpopular, still under investigation and embroiled in scandal, still unable to push a substantial agenda through the Congress, still likely to see his party lose the House of the Representatives in November.This improvement might be surprising if you just follow the drumbeat of scandal coverage in the press, which has arguably only gotten stronger as Trump\u2019s lawyer has fallen under investigation and the Stormy Daniels business has gone from a sideshow to a main attraction.But while the pace of scandalous news hasn\u2019t slackened, the nature of that news has changed: A scandal that began with the promise of republic-shaking revelations about presidential treason is increasingly dominated by sex and lies and possible campaign-finance violations \u2014 in other words, Clinton-in-the-1990s territory, rather than the Manchurian Candidate scenario.Especially since Trump now enjoys an economy whose unemployment rate has fallen to late-1990s territory. In this climate, the president isn\u2019t likely to win a trade war but he can afford to fight a little one, and like Clinton in 1998 he can expect a little more forgiveness from voters for his sleaze.Without handing out the Nobel Peace Prizes ridiculously prematurely (of course the Nobel committee would never do that \u2026), it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s North Korean strategy has not prevented diplomatic efforts from advancing, or put us on some irreversible march to war. This makes northeast Asia the latest theater to defy, for now, the fears of sudden destabilization that drove so much reasonable foreign-policy anxiety about this president.But if the economy and foreign policy have boosted the president\u2019s fortunes, the most important boost may be coming from inside his own party, in the form of the totally nonexistent agenda that congressional Republicans have put forward since the tax bill passed.That nonexistence is, of course, an indictment of the G.O.P., but politically it\u2019s vastly preferable to the deeply unpopular legislation that the Republicans might otherwise be pursuing, if they were to reattempt Obamacare repeal or pursue some other item from the zombie-Reaganite playbook.A core fact of our era is that the national Republican Party is politically effective only as a vehicle for anti-liberalism, a rallying point for all the disparate groups who feel threatened by having our cultural elite in full control of government. Which means the G.O.P. is often more popular the less it attempts to legislate at all.If Trump has consistently missed opportunities to be the post-Reaganite policy maker that his party needs, he is now at least benefiting politically from exactly that inaction. And if Mueller and Kim and the economy cooperate, he could keep winning, within limits, for a while.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Capital or Labor Winning at Your Favorite Company? Introducing the Marx Ratio", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your InboxWho benefits the most when a company is successful: its shareholders or its employees? Capital or labor?It is a question that speaks to some of the oldest debates in economics. But now, thanks to a minor provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, we have a tool for measuring, in rough terms at least, how much any given publicly traded firm rewards its shareholders relative to its rank-and-file employees.Behold, the Marx Ratio.We named it for the 19th-century economist and philosopher Karl Marx, who argued that the interests of capital and labor are inherently in tension. His intellectual adversaries argued that those interests are in fact aligned, as successful companies inevitably reward both capital and labor.We take no stand in that debate. But we have come up with a simple way of calculating how the fruits of any given company\u2019s success are distributed.The Marx Ratio, as we\u2019re calling it, captures the relationship between a company\u2019s profits \u2014 the return to capital, on a per-employee basis \u2014 and how much its median employee is compensated, a rough proxy for the return to labor.Companies with high Marx Ratios offer particularly strong rewards to their shareholders relative to workers. For example, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer had a Marx Ratio of 2.64, meaning the per-employee earnings captured by shareholders were about 2.6 times as high as the compensation a typical employee received. Numbers below 1 signal the reverse: a more favorable return to labor. The  Marx Ratio of 0.498 for the health insurer Aetna means that it earned only half as much per worker for its shareholders as it paid its median employee.Companies with high Marx Ratios also included the tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris International; consumer products companies like Kraft-Heinz and Colgate-Palmolive; fast food giants McDonald\u2019s and Yum Brands (parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut); and almost all real estate investment trusts.Those that favored workers more tended to be in labor-intensive industries. They included the huge retailers Walmart and Amazon, hotel companies like Marriott and Hilton, and both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.Companies that record a net loss consequently have a negative Marx Ratio. For those companies, which in 2017 included General Electric and Citigroup, shareholders lost money while workers still got paid.Of the 394 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 that had reported their median compensation number by May 3, the median Marx Ratio was 0.82, meaning at a typical company the median pay was higher than the profit generated per worker.Beginning this year, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies in the United States to disclose their median employee compensation: how much pay the person in the middle of their distribution receives. The research firm MyLogIQ compiled the data; the remaining companies have more time because of the dates of their fiscal year. We spell out the math, and its limitations, below.Median compensation is an imprecise measurement of how much of a company\u2019s returns flow to labor. Among other things, it can be distorted by companies\u2019 use of contract and part-time labor, and a median pay number inherently fails to capture the full range of how a company\u2019s workers are paid.Given those flaws, the Marx Ratio isn\u2019t some definitive measure of how a company affects the economy and society. Rather, it is a tool for understanding the differences between companies and industries. In particular, the more a company\u2019s ability to generate profits is driven by things shareholders own \u2014 patents, a well-known brand or capital goods like machines and real estate \u2014 the higher its Marx Ratio will tend to be.To see how the Marx Ratio can help you understand the competitive dynamics and economic structure of an industry, consider how the numbers vary across well-known companies in some prominent industries.Wall Street may be the ultimate bastion of capitalism. But some of the highest Marx Ratios in the financial industry aren\u2019t found at the companies stocked with cutthroat traders and deal makers. Rather, the business of commercial banking \u2014 accepting deposits and making loans from branches around the United States \u2014 features a higher return to capital relative to labor.So for example, Wells Fargo has a Marx Ratio of 1.4, and JPMorgan Chase came in at 1.2. By contrast, Goldman Sachs\u2019s number was only 0.9 and Morgan Stanley\u2019s was 0.8.In effect, the profitability of those commercial banks is driven by things the company controls: their network of branches, their information technology systems, their brand reputation. Their employees, who include lots of bank tellers and loan officers, have little leverage with which to demand high pay; the median compensation at Wells Fargo was around $60,000.By contrast, the investment banks employ a lot more highly compensated, highly sought-after professionals, who in turn can demand premium salaries. The median compensation at Goldman was about $135,000. Those workers were more successful at claiming the value the organization created.Meanwhile, BlackRock, the giant asset management company, pays Goldman-esque salaries (median compensation: $141,987)  but manages to have a higher Marx Ratio than either commercial or investment banks, as it is able to manage a huge $6.3 trillion with a lean 13,900 workers.You see similar divides among the most powerful giants of the technology industry.Facebook is wildly profitable, generating almost $635,000 in earnings per employee for shareholders. It also pays those employees extremely well, with median compensation of $240,340, for a Marx Ratio of 2.64.More of Facebook\u2019s success accrued to capital \u2014 to the company\u2019s owners \u2014 than to labor. Its profits are driven by the network effects that keep both users and advertisers wedded to it, which are owned by shareholders. Rank-and-file software developers and advertising sales workers have less ability to extract a big chunk of the value being created.By contrast, Amazon is not very profitable \u2014 it is plowing most of the earnings from its mature businesses into longer-term investments in emerging ones. And its core retail business has low profit margins and requires vast armies in distribution centers and, with the acquisition of Whole Foods, grocery stores.With earnings per employee of only $5,359 and median compensation of about $28,000, Amazon has a Marx Ratio that is a mere 0.19. So far, neither the median Amazon worker nor Amazon shareholders are being rewarded very handsomely.Other prominent tech companies are somewhere in between. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, generates a healthy $158,000 in profit per employee, but like Facebook has a high median pay of $197,000. That\u2019s good for a Marx Ratio of 0.8. Other notable tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have not yet reported a median compensation number, but are also likely to end up in that middle ground once they do \u2014 Apple had earnings per employee in the most recent fiscal year of $393,100, and Microsoft came in at $171,000.The highest Marx Ratios were found at real estate investment trusts: companies with a favorable tax structure devised to invest in real estate. Publicly traded REITs in the sample had a median Marx Ratio of 4.13, higher than any other category of companies.This makes sense, as these companies work more as vehicles through which to deploy capital toward real estate than as conventional operating businesses. The highest Marx Ratio, for example, at 38, was for Duke Realty, an Indianapolis-based company that manages $6.2 billion worth of industrial real estate with a mere 400 employees (who, we might add, are well compensated, with median pay of $109,695).Some of the highest Marx Ratios \u2014 as well as some of the lowest \u2014 are to be found at oil- and gas-related businesses. This also makes sense. Energy companies are making huge bets, often with borrowed money, the success of which depends on the future market price and on their ability to extract petroleum.That explains how EQT Corp., a Pittsburgh-based natural gas producer, had one of the highest Marx Ratios among non-REITS (7.1), while Houston-based oil giant Marathon Oil had the lowest in the sample (-18.9). Marathon\u2019s $5.7 billion loss was due mainly to the sale of a Canadian oil sands business.Low oil and gas prices were bad news for many energy shareholders. Over all, the energy sector accounted for four of the five lowest Marx Ratios, a list that also included Hess, Noble Energy and NRG Energy.It is a good business for shareholders to be in when things are going well, but the risk they are taking on is real.Here are the calculations behind the Marx Ratio \u2014 and some of the limitations to the underlying data that make it an imperfect measure of how a company rewards capital versus labor.The numerator is the net income of the company in question per employee. Note that net income is subject to big year-to-year fluctuations, and doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect a company\u2019s continuing operating performance in any given year.Note what the numerator isn\u2019t \u2014 this isn\u2019t about the returns shareholders could earn through stock price appreciation, or dividends. This is focused on the underlying economics of the business; returns through the stock market can fluctuate for all kinds of reasons.The denominator is the compensation to the median employee, as disclosed in the company\u2019s proxy statement, which can create distortions in representing rank-and-file employees.Companies also have some degree of flexibility in how they calculate median pay, so comparisons are not necessarily apples-to-apples. For example, they may choose to use statistical sampling instead of actual payroll records, and may exclude non-U.S. employees depending on privacy rules in overseas markets.A better number for the idea we\u2019re really trying to get at would be average compensation for nonexecutive employees, but companies aren\u2019t required to report that publicly.We intentionally kept the math of the Marx Ratio simple. But if you want to make it a little more sophisticated, there are options.For one, you might adjust the calculation based on how much capital a company required to make its money. Shareholder\u2019s equity, for example, captures the book value of a company\u2019s assets minus its liabilities. If two companies generate similar profits but one requires much less equity to do it, it is essentially more efficient at generating returns for capital.You also might consider adjusting the measure of profitability to smooth out a company\u2019s returns to shareholders. After all, when a company records some enormous loss, it is frequently because the company is marking down the value of an earlier acquisition for which it paid too much, meaning it is capturing a past bad decision rather than providing information about future operating performance.Given all those limitations, the Marx Ratio should not be used as a definitive measure of how a company does or does not contribute to inequality. Rather, think of it as an important clue about how it is organized, how its economic structure works, and to whom its greatest rewards tend to flow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lebanese Voters Want Change. Few Expect It.", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAALBEK, Lebanon \u2014 Yahya Chamas says he is running in Lebanon\u2019s parliamentary election on Sunday because decades of government neglect and corruption have left his district in the hills of northeastern Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley with shaky infrastructure and its people in poverty.\u201cPeople are fed up,\u201d Mr. Chamas, a businessman and former member of Parliament, said in an interview at his home. \u201cWe hope we can change all these behaviors that don\u2019t lead to development into behaviors that lead to development.\u201dIt\u2019s a popular sentiment, but his chances are slim. While he has struggled to afford billboards and television spots, his main competitors are from established parties including Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s powerful militant group and political party, which owns its own television station. When Hezbollah holds rallies in his district, thousands of loyalists show up.Voters across Lebanon will vote in parliamentary elections on Sunday for the first time in nine years, and many of them are indeed fed up.The country\u2019s crises are many: a million Syrian refugees are straining public services; a shaky economy is increasingly teetering; garbage is piling up; fear is spreading of a new war between Hezbollah and Israel; and the political class has failed to find solutions.But despite the country\u2019s pride in being a rare Arab democracy, few expect the long-awaited elections to do much to solve its pressing problems.\u201cIs this going to bring a new government that is able to change things?\u201d said Sami Atallah, the director of the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies. \u201cNo, because we have a system that has successfully undermined all accountability mechanisms. As long as these are not in place, I can\u2019t see how these politicians will be able to deliver to the people.\u201dLebanon\u2019s political system is an unwieldy compromise based on sect-based power sharing. Half the seats in Parliament are assigned to Christians and half to Muslims. Most parties are based on sect and their supporters look to them for protection and patronage more than for sound policies. Some are still led by warlords from the country\u2019s 15-year civil war, or their offspring.Since 2009, the government has collapsed twice and the country went without a president for more than two years because the factions could not agree on one.There has been no parliamentary election since 2009 because Parliament decided not to have one. A departing Parliament was supposed to finish its four-year term in 2013, but decided that conditions were not right for elections to be held, so it effectively re-elected itself \u2014 twice.Since the civil war ended in 1990, parts of the country have been occupied at times by Syria and Israel, keeping the central state weak and allowing powerful figures to divvy up the economy.That dysfunction has spilled into the political system, creating a Parliament that cannot hold the government accountable, a politicized judiciary and a news media that is either heavily partisan or for sale to the highest bidder.\u201cAll these institutions that could play a role in the political system have been co-opted or destroyed, so you end up with confessional representation and no one being held accountable,\u201d Mr. Atallah said.The vote on Sunday will include more than 500 candidates competing in 15 districts for 128 seats. The vote will be the first under a new electoral law that supporters say will diminish the focus on sect and allow a wider range of candidates to run. But it is so complicated most voters do not understand it and no one can fully predict what effect it will have.In one notable change, dozens of women are running. In 2009, only 12 women ran, winning only four seats. Also new is a coalition of civil society candidates focused on improving services.\u201cYou have new voters, you have new candidates and you have a significantly improved system that we think will bring some new blood into the system,\u201d said Les Campbell, the regional director for the Middle East and North Africa for the Washington-based National Democratic Institute, who is in Lebanon with a team of observers.Since the last election nine years ago, 700,000 young people have become eligible to vote and may make their decisions differently than their parents, he said. But he was cautious about how much change to expect.\u201cI would never underestimate the ability of Lebanon\u2019s power brokers to find a way to get the new law to work in their favor,\u201d he said.The system still favors big parties and the wealthy.To buy airtime on television stations, candidates pay tens of thousands of dollars per hour.Pierre El Daher, the chief executive of LBCI, one of the country\u2019s most watched stations, said two candidates had spent more than $700,000 with his station during the campaign. Most spent less than $100,000.Some voters will follow the \u201cdevil-you-know\u201d philosophy, worrying that newcomers could bring unforeseen havoc.\u201cWe all hope for change, but we don\u2019t expect it,\u201d said Suha Ghader, a teacher. \u201cIn fact, God willing, the same people will get elected because I\u2019m scared of the alternative.\u201dThat hampers independent candidates like Mr. Chamas, who served in Parliament years ago but was expelled in 1994 because of allegations of drug smuggling, which he denies. (He says the accusation was cooked up by a powerful Syrian politician who was out to get him.)In the interview, he said he had bought billboards, spent $15,000 for an hourlong appearance on one television station and agreed to pay $25,000 for an hour on another. But when he turned down a morning show, he was offered evening slots that cost twice as much. An hourlong, prime time interview with a popular anchor cost $80,000, he said, more than he could afford.During the interview, his phone rang. It was a voter asking Mr. Chamas how much he would pay for a vote. Mr. Chamas said he did not buy votes, thanked the caller and hung up.It was unclear whether the caller was seeking the highest bidder for his ballot, a common practice in Lebanon, or secretly recording Mr. Chamas\u2019s answer to use in an attack post on social media.Mr. Chamas blasted the political class that has long led the country as self-serving and corrupt.\u201cThey have been ruling for 30 years, with corruption and without providing services,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no electricity, no roads, no economy. So who is responsible?\u201dThat view is a popular one, so the big parties have adopted a similar message.\u201cThe biggest problem in the country is corruption,\u201d said Ali Moqdad, an incumbent from Hezbollah who is also running in Mr. Chamas\u2019s district.When asked what he had done against corruption since entering Parliament in 2005, Mr. Moqdad responded, \u201cNothing.\u201d He blamed Lebanon\u2019s sectarian politics for making such change difficult.But his party\u2019s power to mobilize was clear an hour later during a large election rally nearby, where Hassan Nasrallah, the party\u2019s leader, implored the crowd via video link to vote. Thousands of people came, despite a violent hailstorm that had left the ground muddy.Mr. Moqdad said that 640 Hezbollah members from the area had been killed fighting in Lebanon and Syria in recent years. The party pays monthly stipends to their families, making it unlikely they would vote for anyone else.After the rally, two women posed for pictures with their young daughters, who both wore white wedding dresses and held framed photos of their fathers, fighters who had been killed in Syria.\u201cThose who are seeing the martyrs\u2019 photos on the walls of Baalbek, those who sacrificed their lives, should be ashamed of not voting for the Hezbollah list,\u201d said one of the women, Zeinab al-Bazal.Nada Homsi contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.Advertisement"}

The United States and China issued a joint statement on trade and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said planned tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods were on hold. China did not seem to commit to much that is concrete to gain a reprieve from the tariffs, a notable achievement for the country\u2019s negotiators.The joint statement said China would significantly increase its imports from the United States, but it did not say how much more it would buy and over what time period. The parts of the statement about investing in each other\u2019s country and protecting intellectual property were even vaguer.President Trump on Monday nevertheless promoted the statement as a win. But influential members of his administration who are still spoiling for a big trade fight will no doubt want to keep up the pressure on China \u2014 and Mr. Trump may at times share their desire in the coming months. Still, the events of recent weeks show that the United States was largely isolated in its trade fights and the Trump administration may have lacked the resolve or unity to keep up its hard-edged approach. The Trump administration can, of course,reintroduce the threat of tariffs if it believes China is failing to make concessions in the proceeding trade talks. But after stepping back this weekend, it will be harder for the Trump administration to make an aggressive stance appear credible.Indeed, the big question hanging over the Trump administration: Why did it withdraw its tariff threat now, before exacting hard, quantifiable concessions from China? One reason may be that the United States needs China\u2019s help in dealing with North Korea ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s summit with Kim Jong Un planned for June. Another reason may be that China was up for a long fight with the United States and signaled so. Whatever the cause, the takeaway for investors is that the Trump administration passed up an opportunity to show China that it meant what it said.Still, investors may not want to relax too much. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity has been rising even as he made combative moves on the trade front that at times roiled the market. In other words, there does not appear to be much political risk domestically, if any, to taking on China, and so Mr. Trump may use belligerent trade talk to stir up his base ahead of the midterm elections in November.But as long as he steps back from taking tough actions, investors will most likely take his rhetoric in stride. That stance has served them well.

But the pressure is on the Trump administration to back up its tough talk on China \u2014 a task that may be more difficult without the leverage of potential tariffs.The fight inside the White House is still real. Free-trade supporters like Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, are still slinging arrows at hard-liners like the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro. (While Mr. Mnuchin said the tariffs were \u201con hold,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said they were still possible.)The two sides have agreed on a \u201cframework\u201d under which China would increase its purchases of American goods, while putting in place \u201cstructural\u201d changes to protect American technology and to make it easier for American companies to compete in China.G.E. was advised by Morgan Stanley and Dyal Company, the boutique investment bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs deal maker Gordon Dyal, as well as the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. Wabtec was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Jones Day.The chief executive of G.E., John Flannery, has pledged to reduce the company\u2019s byzantine structure and focus on its fastest-growing core businesses. Making train engines isn\u2019t part of that equation.Even for a private company like Theranos, disclosure is the bedrock of American capitalism \u2014 the \u201cdisinfectant\u201d that allows investors to gauge a company\u2019s prospects.

They\u2019ve brought to their new jobs the tools and techniques used for national defense: combat exercises, intelligence hubs modeled on those used in counterterrorism work and threat analysts who monitor the internet\u2019s shadowy corners.\u201cShould we own 50 percent of every company in America?

{"Headline": "The Sunlit Studio a Son Built for His Photographer-Mother", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHome and Work6 PhotosThe 75-year-old Iturbide is waiting at the doorway, diminutive, her black hair short and wavy, her complexion milky. \u201cMauricio will be here soon,\u201d she says, as we enter her monolithic workspace, which is constructed of little more than red brick and wood-framed panes of glass. The architects created a hundred models before agreeing on the current design: three nine-foot-high, 300-square-foot rooms stacked atop one another, along with two interior bricked-in patios on the first floor furnished with clay pots of cacti and other regional plants, which offer the only visual disruption of the house\u2019s earthen hues and exacting lines. Inside, the brick walls are adorned with little but the shadows of the day\u2019s moving light.Taking the broad wooden stairs, which are joined by invisible steel supports and appear suspended in midair, Iturbide walks us from the formal first-floor living room, with its Isamu Noguchi paper lantern and low, modernist sofa, past the casual second-floor family room and up to the top floor of the building. \u201cThis is my studio, where I work,\u201d she says, her arms outstretched to take in the airy 16-by-19-foot space, lit by the sun coming in through two wall-size windows. Here, on a nine-foot-long oak table, Iturbide edits her photographs. Forty years of archives are stored in dozens of flat, black boxes on custom hardwood bookshelves that rise from either side of the table. \u201cThe interior space is very important for me and my work,\u201d she says. \u201cI need to be alone often.\u201dThis is not the first time Iturbide\u2019s son has made her a building: Across the street is her main house, a cream-colored adobe structure that Rocha built in 1991, when he was 25 and had just finished architecture school. In 2014, seeking more space (and freedom from her belongings), Iturbide purchased an empty lot and asked him to build on it. Her only condition was that it be made of brick: \u201cWhat I wanted was to be tranquil in my studio,\u201d she says. \u201cI gave him total freedom.\u201d The result, which took two years to complete, combines four kinds of brick \u2014 handmade in different dimensions in Puebla, a city known for its ceramics \u2014 with tzalam, a heavily grained hardwood brought from Mexico\u2019s tropical south. Iturbide calls the building her \u201csmall factory of bricks.\u201dITURBIDE WAS BORN in Mexico City, the eldest of 13 children in a rich, conservative Roman Catholic family. She had wanted to be a writer, but her father forbade it, and at 19, she married an architect, Manuel Rocha D\u00edaz, and had three children in eight years: Manuel, a composer; Mauricio, the architect; and Claudia, who died suddenly when she was 6.After Claudia\u2019s death, Iturbide divorced her husband and enrolled in film school at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. There she met a professor, Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo, who had become one of Latin America\u2019s leading photographers, and whose pictures chronicled other artists at work. \u201cHe opened my life,\u201d she says, \u201cand with him I got to know Mexico.\u201d When she turned from film to still photography in her 30s, she became enamored of indigenous cultures, living for weeks at a time in the town of Juchit\u00e1n on the southern coast of Mexico among the women of the Zapotec tribe. Iturbide was drawn to \u201cthe character of the women, their independence, how they manage the economy,\u201d and began recording their daily routines. It was in Juchit\u00e1n that she developed her signature style, making close-up portraits in high-contrast black-and-white that captured the residents\u2019 mundane activities: visiting the market, drinking a beer. Her 1979 photograph of a Zapotec woman carrying seven live iguanas on her head, \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Iguanas,\u201d has become one of Mexico\u2019s iconic images.As Iturbide talks about the Zapotec women, her son silently takes a chair beside her. He is 52, short-haired and solid, listening attentively to his mother; occasionally, he touches her shoulder gently. \u201cMy relationship with my mother has always been fundamental,\u201d he says later. \u201cWe talk about what each of us is doing, and we share ideas about the way we see the world.\u201dIndeed, like this house, Rocha\u2019s major commissions, such as the School of Visual Arts of Oaxaca (2001) and the P\u00e1tzcuaro courthouse in Michoac\u00e1n (2015), place long outdoor corridors between glass-walled atria and imposing walls of volcanic stone, tile or brick, often punctuated with holes to strategically obscure or expose the sun. Most of his structures are sparsely furnished, and all virtually eliminate visible artificial illumination. Next, he\u2019ll finish his expansion of Diego Rivera\u2019s Anahuacalli Museum in Coyoac\u00e1n, a multistory structure of black volcanic rock that offers a stark contrast to Rivera\u2019s vibrant murals.After that, there\u2019s another dwelling to make for his mother: this one a country home in Malinalco, a pre-Columbian town in a valley backed by dramatic clay cliffs two hours south of Mexico City. In recent decades, Iturbide has shifted her focus from people to landscapes; her new surroundings, she hopes, will provide her with the inspiration that city life no longer can. The two are still planning what her future space might look like, but they both agree there will be fewer walls and more windows, the structure\u2019s vistas over the stone bluffs as expansive as possible. \u201cIt will be wide open, not like this,\u201d Iturbide says, her son nodding in agreement. \u201cThere, I want to see everything.\u201dAn earlier version of this article provided an incorrect photographer credit: The black-and-white images are by Graciela Iturbide, not Gabriela Iturbide.Produced by Su WuAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In South Sudan, a Never-Ending Hunger Season Puts Millions in Danger", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Times went to South Sudan to document the extent of hunger as food grew scarce. This year is expected to be the worst yet, as millions potentially face acute malnutrition.JUBA, South Sudan \u2014 The hunger season came early this year.By February, once seen as a time of plenty, Nyabolli Chok had run out of food for her three children in their village here in South Sudan. She knew they had to leave.\u201cWe were eating leaves off of trees,\u201d she said, describing how she boiled them into a watery soup.\u201cRon reath,\u201d she said \u2014 her words for the hunger season. South Sudan\u2019s dozens of ethnic groups use different names for the months when food becomes scarce until the next harvest. But the fears are the same: malnutrition, disease, even death.And this year is expected to be the worst yet.More than four years of civil war \u2014 most of this young country\u2019s existence \u2014 have chased millions from their homes, leaving countless farms abandoned. The economy has been obliterated. Fighting has overcome some of the nation\u2019s most productive land. Food prices are ruinously high.Even during harvest time in January, when food was most abundant, more than five million people \u2014 almost half the population \u2014 did not have enough to eat. Now, as food runs out over the next few months, international officials expect that number to grow considerably, with millions potentially facing acute malnutrition.On top of that, peace talks have stalled and cease-fires have largely been ignored, which means the fighting has cut off some areas from emergency help. Aid workers have been targeted by government and rebel fighters alike, making food distribution increasingly difficult.Even here in the capital, which had been largely immune to the food crisis, many families are finding it impossible to pay the steep prices demanded in the city\u2019s markets, their options vanishing as the currency crashes.Families from across the country pile into a clinic for malnourished children, setting aside the political and ethnic divides that have torn this new nation to shreds. Some mothers come from areas backing the government. Others have husbands, brothers and sons who fight for the rebels.Dozens of the women lie outside on the floor, their children wrapped in blankets. The signs of malnutrition are clear: Swollen bellies and emaciated limbs. Skin hanging in folds from tiny bones. Bodies covered in open sores, the painful result of edema breaking the skin.Cecilia Kideen struggled to feed her 9-month-old daughter, Sarah. Her breast milk is not enough, as she barely eats one meal a day.\u201cThe mothers,\u201d she said, \u201care really suffering.\u201dSouth Sudan, the world\u2019s newest nation, was born from an enormous international push to end decades of conflict between the north and south of what was then Sudan.But just two years later, the new country was at war.\u201cThere are very few populations that are escaping the impacts of hunger,\u201d said Elizabeth White, Oxfam\u2019s South Sudan policy adviser. \u201cBut all roads lead back to conflict and insecurity.\u201dAt the nation\u2019s southern border, dozens of refugees cross a narrow bridge into Uganda each day, bringing stories of hunger with them.Mary Yar, 20, arrived with her 1-year-old son at a small reception center on the Ugandan side. At the site, the first assessment that refugees go through is a malnutrition screening\u201cThere is no food there,\u201d Mrs. Yar said of her home village, pointing back toward the bridge to South Sudan.During the height of the hunger season last year, South Sudanese arrived by the thousands, said Geoffrey Chandiga, a child assessment officer.He keeps a tally of new arrivals on a whiteboard, noting that officials are bracing for an uptick in the months ahead.Two years ago, South Sudan\u2019s war expanded into southern parts of the country that had long been seen as the country\u2019s breadbasket. People flooded across the Ugandan border. Most have yet to return.Under a sharp midmorning sun in the capital, Elizabeth Kenyi and her husband, Johnson Ali, plucked vegetables from their garden along the White Nile, a tributary of the Nile.For two decades, they have sold their okra, peppers and tomatoes in a nearby market. But even with a plentiful harvest this year, they are finding it harder than ever to feed their family of seven.\u201cThe money that I got from the garden is useless,\u201d Mr. Ali said.While their produce commands a higher price than it did last year, prices for the staple grains they buy, like maize and sorghum, are climbing fast.South Sudan's currency is in freefall and hyperinflation has squeezed virtually everyone. Before the war, one American dollar was worth about five South Sudanese pounds. By March, a dollar was worth about 220 pounds.It found that people here typically needed to spend 155 percent of their daily income for a single plate of bean stew. To put it another way, a meal that would cost a New Yorker just $1.20 would cost someone in Juba the equivalent of $321.70.With agriculture in tatters, emergency aid is keeping a growing share of the country alive.By early 2018, half of South Sudan\u2019s population relied on food aid, according to the United Nations, and the percentage will grow as the hunger season reaches its peak in the coming weeks.But delivering that aid is another matter entirely. The rainy season hits during these lean months, too, turning many roads into rivers of impassable mud.Beyond that, at least 100 humanitarian workers have been killed here since the start of the conflict, 30 in the last year alone, targeted by warring parties that think the efforts are helping their enemies.Even within the protected camps set up around the country by the United Nations, there is not enough food to go around.The United Nations provides food to registered camp residents, but thousands inside have no official status, so they rely on their neighbors for food. The rations are simply not enough.Aid workers say that so much of the country is on the move \u2014 with vast numbers of people fleeing places where violence erupts \u2014 that most new arrivals to Mrs. Chok\u2019s camp have not been registered in more than a year. That means she and countless others receive nothing.Tafisa Nyattie, 30, who has lived in a camp here since 2013, has six children. Her food rations regularly run out, so she leaves the camp daily to gather firewood, hoping to earn enough money for milk and soap to wash her children\u2019s clothes.She walks up to three hours in each direction, braving threats from government forces before returning with a large bundle of wood on her head.On another day, she said, she was beaten and her leg was badly injured. But when she saw how hungry her children were, she decided she had no choice but to head back out again.\u201cYou just go, and you don\u2019t know if you will come back to your children,\u201d Mrs. Nyattie said.The malnutrition clinic offers a chilling glimpse of what this hunger season may hold.The hospital ward, frequently dark because of intermittent electricity, is treating nearly a dozen more children each day than it did this time last year. They come from around the country to be weighed, measured and given antibiotics and a milk formula before moving on to Plumpy\u2019Nut, a peanut-based nutritional paste \u2014 if their bodies can handle it.Many of the families here are not even victims of the horrors that have chased millions from their homes. Some have jobs, career plans and families to lean on \u2014 yet their children are still going hungry.Selwa Anania, a restaurant worker from Juba, brought her 2-year-old son, Taban Zacharia, to the clinic. Her small salary does not go far in the market. Most days, it is only enough for a single meal of porridge.Sylvia George, 27, fanned her son, Mandela Bisa, 2, who lay half-conscious on a bed, hooked up to an intravenous drip. The child\u2019s father is a student at Juba University, and the three live with Ms. George\u2019s mother, whom they rely on for food. There is never enough.For now, with the peak of the hunger season still weeks away, the clinic manages the steady flow of patients, said Josephin Ruben, the head nutritionist.But, she noted anxiously, there \u201cwill not be enough when we get to June and July.\u201dMegan Specia and Kassie Bracken were 2018 fellows with the International Women\u2019s Media Foundation\u2019s African Great Lakes Reporting Initiative.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Expected to Leave Iran Deal, Allies Say", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is expected to announce on Tuesday that he is withdrawing the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, European diplomats said after concluding that they had failed to convince him that reneging on America\u2019s commitment to the pact could cast the West into new confrontation with Tehran.If the diplomats are correct, the announcement will be the most consequential national security decision of Mr. Trump\u2019s 15 months in office \u2014 though it could be eclipsed in coming weeks by his direct negotiation with North Korea\u2019s leader over surrendering its nuclear arsenal.One senior European diplomat who has been deeply involved in trying to persuade Mr. Trump to stay in the deal told reporters on Monday the chance that the president would keep the agreement intact was \u201cvery small.\u201dAt the heart of the deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which was reached in July 2015 after more than two and a half years of negotiation, lay a bold trade.The West would end three decades of sanctions and isolation of Tehran that had crippled the country\u2019s economy and fueled domestic impatience with its clerical leaders. In return, Iran agreed to ship roughly 97 percent of its nuclear fuel out of the country, and forgo production of nuclear fuel, even for ostensibly peaceful purposes.The negotiation with Iran was the signature foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration, and throughout the 2016 campaign Mr. Trump called it a \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cinsane.\u201dBut for more than a year, he was reluctantly persuaded by advisers that it was better than any alternative, and that the United States had no Plan B if it was the first to breach the arrangements. Those advisers \u2014 Rex W. Tillerson and Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 were ousted in recent months and replaced with two of the Iran agreement\u2019s most vociferous critics, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser.In the 28 months since the arrangement went into effect, international inspectors have said they have found no violations \u2014 apart from minor infractions that were quickly rectified.The restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program under the deal could survive.Under the deal, the restrictions on research and development in Iran\u2019s nuclear program would begin to lift after a decade. After 15 years, Iran would be able to produce as much fuel as it wanted \u2014 though never for the purpose of making weapons.Mr. Trump has insisted that \u201csunset clause\u201d simply put off the day when Iran would become a nuclear-armed state. The agreement, he has said, failed to address Tehran\u2019s growing missile capability and expanding influence in the Middle East \u2014 all funded, he insisted, from cash that was returned to the Iranians as a part of the deal, as well as its resumed oil trade.The senior European diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity when meeting with a group of reporters on Monday, called it \u201cpretty obvious\u201d that Mr. Trump would no longer waive American sanctions against Iran, as he has done since the start of his presidency to uphold the deal.Rather than push the issues off for another decade, Mr. Trump is betting he can force Iran into a new negotiation.It is unclear whether the president might mollify three major allies \u2014 Britain, France and Germany \u2014 by allowing them to maintain economic relations with Tehran without penalizing any of their firms. But European officials said that was not clear.A few hours later, Mr. Trump turned to Twitter again to declare that he would be announcing his decision at 2 p.m. Tuesday at the White House.However the White House engineers the specifics of the announcement, diplomats say they are now adjusting to a new reality in which the fundamental trade with Iran is dead.\u201cIt can\u2019t be saved,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a longtime former diplomat now at the Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cWhatever Trump decides, it\u2019s the beginning of the end of the accord, either death by one, or 1,000, cuts.\u201dBy the middle of Monday, his visit seemed a last gasp: He was told that the decision was all but preordained, officials said.President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany similarly argued that the Iran accord was flawed but could be built upon. The allies had suggested that the West could impose new sanctions against Iran\u2019s ballistic missile development and armed support for the Syrian regime, for Hezbollah, for Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Palestinian territories \u2014 but keep the nuclear deal intact.\u201cMy view \u2014 I don\u2019t know what your president will decide \u2014 is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,\u201d Mr. Macron told a group of reporters in Washington during his visit last month.But it has been difficult for Europeans to answer Mr. Trump\u2019s demands because it is clear that Iran will not agree to reopening the terms of the accord itself. And if it were to be reopened, Iran had a series of demands of its own.Should Mr. Trump withdraw from the accord, Iran could accurately claim that Washington was the first to violate it \u2014 a propaganda win. And Iran would be free, if it chose, to resume fuel production, according to diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations.The mantra of the European negotiators toiling to retain the nuclear deal has been \u201cto fix it, not nix it.\u201d But Mr. Trump has come at the problem from a different perspective: He argues that the only solution is a clean slate.Mr. Trump has told visitors he believes that once the current agreement is destroyed, Iran will come to the table to negotiate a new one. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated the initial accord with Mr. Kerry for more than two years, has said Tehran will not participate in such negotiations since it already spent years doing so.The narrow decision Mr. Trump will have to announce on Tuesday is whether he is willing to once again waive American sanctions on Iran, holding up America\u2019s commitments under the deal.Yet even if Mr. Trump reimposes those sanctions, Europeans note that there are some delays built into the accord \u2014 a reconciliation period of about a month, and delays of 120 to 180 days before renewed American sanctions bite.In a world of Trump brinkmanship, all that could allow time for further negotiations.Iran can go to the brink as well, however, and anticipating its response is difficult. Hard-liners are already arguing to resume uranium enrichment and plutonium production. But it is entirely possible Iran will choose to abide by the deal for now, to make sharper the split between the United States and its European allies.That may not be sustainable, European officials said. Over time, pressure will grow inside Iran to leave, since many there believe the sanctions relief has not led to the kind of national economic revival that the country\u2019s public was told to expect.Iran\u2019s leaders have been cryptic about its potential response.\u201cIf America leaves the nuclear deal, this will entail historic regret for it,\u201d President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said in a speech broadcast live on state television in recent days.\u201cIf we can get what we want from a deal without America, then Iran will continue to remain committed to the deal,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said.The Europeans are also worried that abandoning the deal will embolden Israel in its own struggle with Iran in Syria and Lebanon. That could lead to another bloody war, as Iranian troops and proxies move closer to the occupied Golan Heights and Tehran continues to ship missiles into Syria and southern Lebanon.Oddly, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has led the charge to persuade Mr. Trump to abandon the deal, his top military advisers have dissented. The commander of the Israeli Defense Forces, Gadi Eizenkot, has repeatedly said that the agreement \u201cis working\u201d and delaying Iran\u2019s efforts to obtain a weapon by a decade to 15 years. Former military officials have largely agreed.But Mr. Trump\u2019s base of supporters has insisted that the deal essentially sold out long-range American interests. After hesitating, Mr. Trump appears to have decided to make good on his past promises.David E. Sanger reported from Washington and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Ends Protected Status for Thousands of Hondurans", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTens of thousands of Hondurans who have lived in the United States for up to two decades must prepare to leave, government officials announced Friday, a decision that effectively spells the demise of a humanitarian program that has protected nearly half a million people who had sought refuge from unstable homelands.The Trump administration is ending temporary protected status for Hondurans who have been allowed to live and work in the United States since 1999, after a hurricane that ravaged their country. With an estimated 86,000 people currently registered, Hondurans represent the second-largest group of foreigners who have benefited from the program.Determined to rein in both legal and illegal immigration, the Trump administration since last year has scrapped protections for more than 300,000 citizens from countries, mainly in the Caribbean and in Central America, that have suffered natural disasters. On Friday, the Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, said she had determined that conditions have improved sufficiently in Honduras to warrant suspension of protected status for its citizens in the United States, according to a department statement.The announcement comes just days after a caravan of 300 Central American migrants arrived at the United States border, including many Hondurans seeking refuge from gang-related violence and political turmoil.Hondurans in the program have until January 2020 to get their affairs in order and depart.\u201cI did everything right: I worked hard, started a company, had two children and made investments here,\u201d said Samuel Contreras, a licensed contractor on Long Island who arrived in 1998, shortly after Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras. \u201cThe bank approved a $300,000 mortgage because I have good credit and income. Now I don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201dBut of all these countries, Honduras is perhaps the most volatile. The Central American nation has one of the highest homicide rates in the world. Irregularities in last November\u2019s presidential election have led to huge street protests, which have turned violent.Signed into law by President George Bush in 1990, the temporary protected status program once enabled some 435,000 people from 10 countries crippled by natural disasters, war and other adversities to live in the United States.\u201cT.P.S. will still be on the books, but will have been virtually emptied of beneficiaries at a time of the greatest number of forcibly displaced in recent history and an unprecedented number of complex crises giving rise to displacement,\u201d said Donald Kerwin, executive director of the Center for Migration Studies in New York.Immigrant advocates and the Honduran government had asked the United States to extend the program, as has happened several times since 1999. This week, more than 600 faith leaders signed a letter asking the administration for an 18-month extension, calling a termination \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\u201cThis can\u2019t be,\u201d said Cristiane Rosales-Fajardo, founder of NOLA Village, an advocacy group in New Orleans, where Hondurans outnumber other Hispanics. \u201cThey rebuilt our houses and the city after Hurricane Katrina. When nobody wanted to come, they were here bringing New Orleans back to life.\u201dOn Twitter, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican congresswoman from South Florida, called the administration\u2019s decision \u201cwrongheaded\u201d and detrimental to families and the economy.Jessica Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, whose members include beneficiaries, said the reversal amounted to a \u201ccallous policy.\u201d\u201cThe cancellation of T.P.S. for Honduran immigrants is a death sentence for many of those who would be sent back to a country being roiled by political repression and violence,\u201d Ms. Morales said.According to the Center for Migration Studies, Hondurans with protected status have 53,500 American-born children; 85 percent participate in the labor force, compared with 63 percent of the overall United States population, and nearly 20 percent have mortgages.\u201cI never took a cent from the government,\u201d said Mr. Contreras, the Long Island contractor.The end of protection for his wife, who is from El Salvador, was the first blow to the family of Mr. Contreras, who has become an immigration activist at an organization called Make the Road New York.The Trump administration says that a program designed to provide temporary, disaster-related help has instead become a quasi-permanent green light for hundreds of thousands of people. It argues that the only criteria the government should consider in continuing the program is whether the original reason for the designation \u2014 in this case, devastation from the hurricane \u2014 persists.\u201cSince 1999, conditions in Honduras that resulted from the hurricane have notably improved,\u201d the Homeland Security Department statement said. \u201cAdditionally, since the last review of the country\u2019s conditions in October 2016, Honduras has made substantial progress in post-hurricane recovery and reconstruction from the 1998 Hurricane Mitch.\u201dCritics of the program agree.\u201cThe hurricane was a generation ago, and Honduras long ago reverted to its regular messed-up state, not the special post-hurricane messed-up state required by the T.P.S. statute,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors curbs on immigration. \u201cThere can be no honest basis for an extension.\u201dThe program provides temporary legal status and work permits to people already in the United States, whether they entered legally or not. The Homeland Security secretary decides when a country merits the designation and whether to renew it, if conditions warrant it.Hondurans have been on tenterhooks since last year, when T.P.S. designation for their country was up for renewal. In November, the government allowed it to automatically extend for six months, citing a need for further assessment.Among the 86,000 Hondurans who currently have protection under the program, according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, 45,600 re-registered for the six-month extension. An unspecified number out of the total have obtained legal status in the United States, the agency said, and, thus, will not have to leave.T.P.S. holders carry a card that is similar to a driver\u2019s license, which enables them to work legally. They also have Social Security numbers. However, they are not entitled to federal or state loans and other assistance.Catherine Sarmiento, 23, who has had protected status as a Honduran since age 8, finished four years of college last year and found a job as a nuclear medicine technician at a hospital in Florida. Her parents and sister, also living in Florida under protected status, face the loss of their legal resident status and work permits, too, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all worried,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole family is worried.\u201dIn a statement, the foreign ministry of Honduras said it \u201cprofoundly lamented\u201d the end of the program for its citizens who had integrated into the United States by working hard and contributing to the economy.About 61 percent of Hondurans lived in poverty in 2016, according to the World Bank, and Honduras has the biggest gap between rich and poor of any country. Hondurans working in the United States under protected status account for 12 to 15 percent of remittances sent to the country, money typically sent to help relatives.Don Emilio Valle, 73, who lives in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, said he receives $400 monthly from his son Emilio in Dallas to support his wife and three grandchildren.\u201cWith that money we can survive and feed ourselves,\u201d Mr. Valle said. If the money dries up, he added, \u201cwe\u2019ll have nothing.\u201dWork prospects for Hondurans forced to return there would be bleak, said Raf Ponce, the deputy coordinator of the Social Forum for the Foreign Debt and Development of Honduras, a research institute in Tegucigalpa, the capital.\u201cThe Honduran labor market demands people with a low level of preparation, mostly relatively cheap labor,\u201d he said, adding that the Honduran work force is overwhelmingly young, and many of those likely to return from the United States are more educated, older and likely to face discrimination if they seek work.Many facing the loss of their protected status said they would resort to living in the shadows, like the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, rather than return to their troubled homeland.Sonia Paz, 55, who arrived in Los Angeles when she was 22, has three children and grandchildren, and said she had no intention of leaving. She works as a nanny in Pacific Palisades, west of Los Angeles.\u201cI have nothing in Honduras,\u201d she said. \u201cTo go back would be the kiss of death.\u201d Her hometown is San Pedro Sula, notorious for gangs that target people with relatives in the United States for extortion. \u201cThey find out that you were in America and take the little you have away from you, or kill you.\u201dRon Nixon contributed reporting from Washington, and Jeff Ernst from Tegucigalpa, Honduras.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medical Mystery: Something Happened to U.S. Health Spending After 1980", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe New Health CareThe spending began soaring beyond that of other advanced nations, but without the same benefits in life expectancy. What happened? Health spending and life expectancy are not necessarily closely related, so it\u2019s helpful to consider them separately. \u201cConfronted with fiscal pressures, as the share of G.D.P. absorbed by health care spending began to get serious, other nations had mechanisms to hold down spending,\u201d said Henry Aaron, a health economist with the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe didn\u2019t.\u201dBut none of this explains the timing of the spending divergence. Why did it start around 1980?Mr. Starr suggests that the high inflation of the late 1970s contributed to growth in health care spending, which other countries had more systems in place to control. Likewise, Mr. Cutler points to related economic events before 1980 as contributing factors. The oil price shocks of the 1970s hurt economic growth, straining countries\u2019 ability to afford health care. \u201cThus, all across the world, one sees constraints on payment, technology, etc., in the 1970s and 1980s,\u201d he said. The United States is not different in kind, only degree; our constraints were weaker. These are all highly valuable, but they came at very high prices. This willingness to pay more has in turn made the United States an attractive market for innovation in health care.Yet being an engine for innovation doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into better outcomes. Almost no matter how it\u2019s measured, longevity in the United States has not kept pace with that of other nations. Again, the inflection point is around 1980. Why?The lack of universal health coverage and less safety net support for low-income populations could have something to do with it, Ms. Glied speculated. \u201cThe most efficient way to improve population health is to focus on those at the bottom,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t do as much for them as other countries.\u201d Slow income growth could also play a role because poorer health is associated with lower incomes. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that, apart from the richest of Americans, income growth stagnated starting in the late 1970s,\u201d Mr. Cutler said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fast Bus Service in New York City? It\u2019s Possible", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDr. Decker directs the New York City program at TransitCenter, a philanthropic foundation that supports transit reform across the United States.Imagine being able to board a bus shortly after arriving at the stop. If the front of the bus is too crowded, enter the back door and find a seat. The bus then glides down a dedicated lane with traffic signals set to green, taking you from Jackson Heights, Queens, to Bushwick, Brooklyn, in 25 minutes.But one key thing is missing from the plan. The New York City Department of Transportation \u2014 whose jurisdiction falls under Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2014 controls the traffic flow on the streets buses travel. Therefore leadership from Mr. de Blasio is essential to any effort to transform bus service. The mayor campaigned on a vision of making New York a fairer, more equitable city. With the bold new plan issued by the transit authority, he has an opportunity to help two million of the city\u2019s residents reach their destinations quickly.New York buses are the slowest of any big city in the country, wait times are unpredictable and by both measures, things are getting worse. It\u2019s not surprising that ridership on buses in the city dropped 21 percent between 2002-2017, a period when the city\u2019s population grew by 7 percent. Those who can access another option for getting around increasingly do.The problem is due in part to traffic congestion, and the mayor\u2019s ability to control the flow of traffic gives him two powerful tools: dedicated bus lanes and priority at traffic signals. Those low-cost strategies have proven very effective at dramatically increasing bus speeds and reliability, and expanding bus usage, in cities like London, Seattle, Seoul and San Francisco.It\u2019s logical to question the value of bus lanes in New York today. They are often blocked by cars and trucks and are used by the police for parking. Despite being weakened by those violations, bus lanes have still sped up travel times on routes that have them. For example, the addition of a bus lanes on First and Second Avenues in Manhattan increased travel speed by 11 percent. If respected and enforced, bus lanes would do much more to speed and increase reliability of bus trips.Buses in New York spend roughly 20 percent of their time at red lights. The city has the technology to time traffic signals to turn green when a bus approaches, but only applies it to a small fraction of intersections. In addition to dramatically stepping up deployment of smarter signals, the city could also adjust passive signal timing to optimize bus movement on many more avenues.Mr. de Blasio can leave an important legacy of transportation fairness and equity by implementing an ambitious plan that prioritizes public transit on city streets, including 10 new bus lanes and signal priority on at least 20 new routes each year. He should direct the New York City Police Department to enforce transit-only lanes. The mayor campaigned on addressing growing inequality in the city, but his lack of leadership is unfairly leaving bus riders at the curb.Tabitha Decker is the deputy executive director of TransitCenter, a foundation devoted to improving urban mobility.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman C.E.O. Blankfein Is Likely to Step Down in December", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new era at Goldman Sachs is taking shape.The Wall Street giant\u2019s president, David M. Solomon, is likely to be named chief executive officer by the end of this year, and he is already structuring his senior management team, according to people familiar with the firm\u2019s plans.Yet in recent weeks, Mr. Blankfein has quietly laid the groundwork to step down late this year. His exit will likely take place in conjunction with the firm\u2019s annual dinner for retired partners in December, two people said. Mr. Solomon, who is 56, would step in shortly after that.The timetable is not settled and could change, these people cautioned.Given what is likely to be a relatively short run-up to his promotion, Mr. Solomon is starting to sketch out the possibilities for a new management team, according to Goldman employees.One big question is who will succeed him as Goldman president, a role that is often shared by two executives. Contenders include John Waldron, the firm\u2019s co-head of investment banking; Eric S. Lane, who co-heads its investment management division; and Stephen M. Scherr, who runs the consumer banking division.\u201cThe simple fact is that no decisions have been made,\u201d said Jake Siewert, a Goldman spokesman.The expected leadership transition will mark the end of a prosperous but rocky era for the Wall Street firm.When Mr. Blankfein was named C.E.O. in 2006, he took over a wildly profitable investment bank known for both its seasoned deal advisers and its aggressive stock and bond trading. Buying and selling assets using its own money as well as clients\u2019 funds, Goldman made many billions of dollars in trading each year. Among its most lucrative wagers was that the United States housing market would suffer in 2007. That market cratered, almost bringing down the banking industry and the entire American economy.Mr. Blankfein, a onetime gold salesman known for his intellect and dry wit, steered Goldman through that tumultuous period, but not without the firm suffering huge damage to its reputation. It was pilloried by politicians for appearing to profit at the expense of clients, and became synonymous with Wall Street avarice.Since then, Goldman\u2019s business model has been hurt by tough federal regulations intended to curb risk-taking on Wall Street. The firm, once reliant on its high-flying traders, now has to look elsewhere for new revenue.Under Mr. Solomon, Goldman\u2019s investment banking business flourished, ranking among Wall Street\u2019s top firms for advising on corporate mergers and acquisitions. But that is a much less profitable business than trading had been before the crisis. And other Goldman divisions, such as investment management and consumer banking, remain too small to pick up the slack.Last year, Mr. Solomon and his co-president, Harvey M. Schwartz, presented Goldman\u2019s board of directors with a plan for generating billions of dollars in additional revenue. Their ideas, which were accepted by directors, included expanding the investment-banking business into midsize cities like Dallas and Seattle, enlarging Goldman\u2019s online-lending business and doing more trading of currencies and commodities on behalf of large corporations.Mr. Solomon was informed in early March that Mr. Blankfein and the board had chosen him as the next C.E.O., say Goldman officials. Shortly after that, Mr. Schwartz, the other leading candidate for the top job, announced plans to retire.But aside from continuing the shift into more consumer-focused areas, it isn\u2019t clear whether Goldman under Mr. Solomon will look much different than under his predecessor.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized how it emerged that Goldman Sachs and Apple were working on a credit card product. It was disclosed by two people familiar with the companies\u2019 talks; it was not announced by Goldman Sachs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roaring Protests of Commencements Past Make Way for a More Subdued Stand", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProtests at college commencements are almost a rite of spring, and this graduation season is no different. Some of the demonstrations this year have shapeshifted into actions more subdued than those of just a few years ago. Some are small events within larger ceremonies. And silence as a protest tactic is being used to make a point without ruffling too many feathers.At Northern Michigan, the university\u2019s president, Fritz Erickson, appeared pleased with the outcome. In a statement, he said he appreciated that the governor, a Republican, still came, despite advance word that he would be met by protests. He said he was proud that the students had been respectful.In a moment of heightened political turmoil in the nation at large, including on college campuses, commencement protests seem oddly quieter than in some years past.One reason, analysts say, may be that colleges are seeking out commencement speakers who bring inspiration \u2014 not tumult \u2014 and whose ideologies are often more in line with those of their largely liberal student bodies.Across the country, members of the class of 2018 are taking their first steps into the real world. Can you match these pearls of graduation wisdom with the person who said them?\u201cIn other words,\u201d he said, \u201ca sort of prior restraint or self-policing may be at work here.\u201dTo be sure, students are plenty passionate, and say that even if their campuses have not erupted with widespread demonstrations at commencement, they are concerned about certain issues.\u201cSexual violence is appalling,\u201d said Amelia Sampat, 26, who graduated this year from the Kennedy School at Harvard and helped organize the \u201cTimesUpHarvard\u201d action.\u201cMaybe graduation isn\u2019t the best time and place for us to bring this up, but so many students wanted the opportunity to take a stand,\u201d she said. Students snapped up all 2,000 stickers that were printed.\u201cWe wanted the administration to know that students care deeply about this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had a silent action, not a loud protest, because we want to work with the administration in a collaborative way.\u201dThe quieter tone is in striking contrast to that at commencements just a few years ago.If you were giving a commencement speech, what would you say? What do you wish you had known when you were a 20-something?It was a more tranquil scene at Boston College\u2019s commencement this year, when Wilton D. Gregory, the archbishop of Atlanta and the nation\u2019s highest-ranking black Catholic bishop, gave the address. Students cheered his message on the importance of movements like Black Lives Matter and #MeToo.That was the same year that Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, bailed as commencement speaker at Smith College as critics accused the I.M.F. of damaging the economies of developing nations.In 2014, protesters demanded that invitations be rescinded for at least 16 commencement speakers, the foundation said. (Some, like Ms. Rice and Ms. Lagarde, withdrew while others did not.)By sharp contrast, the foundation said it was aware of very few cases so far this year in which protesters had demanded that an invitation be rescinded.Some students are expressing their concerns outside of commencement time anyway, such as at mass marches against gun violence and on behalf of women. Throughout the year, many have been protesting visiting speakers with whom they disagree.\u201cThe most combative students disgorged their anger during a year of protests against Charles Murray, Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann Coulter, often with unhappy consequences,\u201d said Todd Gitlin, a professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University and author of \u201cThe Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage.\u201dNow, he said, \u201cwhile students dislike the Trump ascendancy, many are focused on narrow concerns, or are demoralized, or are looking for year-end occasions to celebrate \u2014 not denounce.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Yes, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, had muttered something near the end of the previous year about the stock market\u2019s \u201cirrational exuberance,\u201d but investors shook off his words after a few days, the bull market resumed, and Greenspan opted to shut up and run with it. The Thai currency crash that began a long series of financial crises around the world was a few months off. The American economy was humming. Washington was in the midst of a bipartisan rush to cut spending, regulations, trade barriers and taxes.I acquired a copy back in 1997, but am somewhat ashamed to admit that I had never, until a few weeks ago, actually read it. When I got the assignment to review Kuttner\u2019s latest, I figured the time had come.\u201cEverything for Sale\u201d holds up well, I can report. Yes, parts are inevitably dated, and no, maybe Kuttner didn\u2019t need to go into quite such detail on, say, the early history of workers\u2019 compensation. But to me none of his market critiques comes across as entirely wrong (although it would be easy to find people to dispute his take on airline deregulation), and many have since become widely accepted. Most economists who study such matters now agree with Kuttner that financial markets are prone to swing from bubble to economy-damaging bust. One now frequently hears arguments, sometimes from corporate executives, that maximizing shareholder value is a muddle-headed and counterproductive aim for corporations. Most Americans now really do seem to want less of a free market in health care rather than more.Turning after this to Kuttner\u2019s latest, \u201cCan Democracy Survive Capitalism?,\u201d was probably unfair. For one thing, it\u2019s not as good: The book is a timely polemic against globalization and marketization, not a document meant to withstand the test of time. For another, 675 straight pages of Robert Kuttner (I\u2019m not counting endnotes or indexes, but I did read the acknowledgments) is a lot to take. The man is not a thrilling writer, or much of a humorist.He is by this point something of a national treasure, though. From his alt-media start in the 1960s as assistant to the legendary investigative journalist I. F. Stone, to his decades of writing for mainstream outlets ranging from The New Republic to The Washington Post to Businessweek, to his cofounding of the proudly lefty American Prospect (where he is still on the masthead as co-editor) and Economic Policy Institute, Kuttner has tirelessly poked holes in dominant economic narratives and consistently espoused a social-democratic populism that is looking much better than some of the alternatives these days.A key phrase in Kuttner\u2019s work is \u201cmixed economy,\u201d meant to describe a system in which markets and for-profit businesses play a crucial role, but share power with institutions like labor unions and mutual associations and are ultimately subservient to democratically elected governments. That\u2019s more or less how things worked in the United States and Western Europe in the decades that followed World War II, which delivered widely shared prosperity on a scale never before seen.The details of the mixed economy varied from nation to nation, but that was sort of the point. Unlike the universalist utopian visions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the self-regulating market, the mixed economy requires endless tinkering and compromise. It also requires that nation-states have enough autonomy to go their own way. \u201cCan Democracy Survive Capitalism?\u201d is chiefly the story of how this autonomy was constrained.During a break from journalism in the late 1970s, one learns from the book, Kuttner drafted the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for his then-boss, Senator William Proxmire. That law prohibited American businesses from paying bribes to foreign officials. It was, Kuttner writes, \u201can exceptional instance of a nation-state setting progressive rules for globalism.\u201dOver the past four decades, though, global capitalism has increasingly come to set the rules for nation-states. This has occurred mostly through the mechanism of ever more free and powerful financial markets, but also through such multilateral bodies as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, World Trade Organization and European Union.There are lots of international organizations, Kuttner writes, but the only ones that seem able to compel nations to do anything are the ones setting economic rules. And while the I.M.F. and World Bank were created in the waning days of World War II with the idea that they would give nations space to pursue domestic economic goals without having to worry about currency crises and such, they evolved in the 1970s into what Kuttner calls \u201cinstruments for the enforcement of classical laissez-faire as a universal governing principle.\u201d The results, in his telling, include skyrocketing inequality, stagnant middle-class incomes and, in recent years, a right-wing populist backlash embodied in the United States by the election of Donald Trump.Accounts of the economic changes of the past half century have tended to focus on how new technologies ranging from the computer to the shipping container reordered global markets, the workplace and society. Kuttner gives such factors awfully short shrift, but one can understand why. Others have downplayed political choices, so he puts them front and center.Kuttner isn\u2019t an especially original or compelling analyst of electoral politics, and the weakest parts of this book are those in which he describes the rise of Trump, or the 1990s embrace of markets by the Democrats in the United States, Labour in the United Kingdom and the Social Democrats in Germany. But never fear: There\u2019s lots more space devoted to the less personal politics of institutions and rules, where Kuttner is in his element.In this he follows in the footsteps of the economic historian Karl Polanyi, whose 1944 classic \u201cThe Great Transformation\u201d is a model for this book. Polanyi argued that the 19th-century economic brew of \u201cinternational free trade, competitive labor market, and gold standard\u201d had, while bringing rapid economic growth for a time, eventually proved so unstable and destructive of existing social relations that it led to fascism. Kuttner\u2019s sadly plausible argument is that the renewed global economic order based on free trade, competitive labor markets and the dollar standard is now pushing politics in a similar direction.What can stop it? Well, I don\u2019t want to give away the ending, but it should be pretty clear by now that Kuttner doesn\u2019t think salvation lies in global hand-holding. He made national headlines last summer when he reported that Stephen K. Bannon, then still chief strategist in the Trump White House, had telephoned him out of the blue (Bannon did have an assistant email first to arrange the call). After declaring himself a longtime fan of Kuttner\u2019s work, Bannon had argued that \u201cif the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\u201d Kuttner wants the Democrats to win, but he too thinks economic nationalism is the ticket.Justin Fox is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion and the author of \u201cThe Myth of the Rational Market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "AIDS Runs Rampant in Venezuela, Putting an Ancient Culture at Risk", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "The disease threatens an entire indigenous population, the Warao people of the Orinoco Delta, as government programs collapse.Supported byJOBURE DE GUAYO, Venezuela \u2014 After the other villagers had drifted away to do chores, Rafael Peque\u00f1o finally found himself alone with the headman and opened the hardcover notebook on his lap. The men were sitting in a palm-thatched hut perched on stilts on the edge of a branch of the Orinoco River.It had been two years since Mr. Peque\u00f1o, a nurse, had visited this poor indigenous village in the remote Orinoco Delta region of eastern Venezuela. His notebook contained a registry of patients who had been part of an H.I.V. treatment program that, like the rest of the nation\u2019s public health system, had fallen apart.Mr. Peque\u00f1o took a roll call of the infected.\u201cArmando Beria,\u201d he said, reading from the top of the list.\u201cStill here,\u201d replied the headman, Ram\u00f3n Quint\u00edn.\u201cEbelio Quinino,\u201d the nurse continued.\u201cStill here.\u201d\u201cMario Navarro.\u201d\u201cDead.\u201d\u201cWilmer Medina.\u201d\u201cDead.\u201dOf the 15 villagers who had been part of the treatment program, five had died of AIDS, the disease caused by H.I.V. In all, more than 40 residents of this village had died of AIDS or AIDS-like symptoms in the past several years \u2014 in a settlement of only about 200.\u201cI\u2019m very worried,\u201d Mr. Peque\u00f1o said quietly. He looked stunned. \u201cIt\u2019s wiping out this community.\u201dIn recent years, amid profound shortages of medicine coupled with widespread ignorance, H.I.V. has spread rapidly throughout the Orinoco Delta and is believed to have killed hundreds of the Warao indigenous people who live in settlements like Jobure de Guayo along the serpentine channels winding through this swampy, forested landscape.Even under the best of circumstances, it might be difficult to control the disease\u2019s spread in such an isolated and deprived area. But the government has ignored the issue, medical specialists and Warao community leaders say, leaving the population to face a profound existential threat alone. Already, deaths and the flight of survivors have gutted at least one village.\u201cIf there\u2019s no intervention, it\u2019s going to affect the existence of the Warao,\u201d he warned. \u201cA part of the population is going to disappear.\u201dThe epidemic plaguing the Warao is a crisis within a crisis, a dramatic example of how Venezuela is failing to grapple with a resurgent AIDS emergency even as the annual numbers of new H.I.V. infections and AIDS-related deaths around the world continue to decline.Under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela\u2019s H.I.V./AIDS prevention and treatment program was world class and the country seemed to have the disease under control.The government has even stopped distributing free condoms, which can help prevent the spread of H.I.V., activists say. The price for a pack can cost the equivalent of several days\u2019 pay at minimum wage.The government\u2019s inaction, the activists say, is especially egregious considering that President Maduro \u2014 like his predecessor \u2014 has cast himself as a champion of the nation\u2019s indigenous people.The Maduro administration did not respond to requests for interviews with officials of the national H.I.V. prevention program, the health ministry and the ministry of indigenous affairs.The government has released health statistics only sporadically in recent years, and doctors often dispute their accuracy. But AIDS activists and specialists say that H.I.V. infection rates and the number of AIDS-related deaths have skyrocketed. So, too, has the number of once stable H.I.V. patients whose health has collapsed for lack of a regular supply of antiretroviral drugs and medicines to treat opportunistic diseases.Among the most disadvantaged Venezuelans, he said, are the Warao.\u201cIt\u2019s a population that has been totally neglected.\u201dThe Warao, Venezuela\u2019s second-largest indigenous group, have made their home for many centuries in the soggy delta region where the muddy waters of the Orinoco River fan out into distributaries that merge with the Atlantic Ocean.Numbering about 30,000, they now live in hundreds of impoverished settlements in open-sided stilt homes perched at the edge of the region\u2019s streams and rivers.The area is hard to reach. There are no roads, so travel is restricted to boats, mostly dugout canoes. There are no telephone landlines, and nearly the entire region is without cellphone signal. Only the largest villages have electricity, though usually only at night \u2014 and the generators that provide it often run out of fuel or break down.It can take several hours traveling by high-speed powerboat to reach the settlements from the state capital, Tucupita, but a fuel mafia now controls the distribution of gasoline in the region, driving costs beyond the reach of nearly every resident. River pirates make access to the delta even harder.H.I.V. was first detected among the Warao in 2007 and is thought to have been introduced by a returning migrant, one of many young Warao who have sought work in far-off Venezuelan cities as house cleaners, security guards, laborers, street vendors and prostitutes.By comparison, H.I.V. prevalence among the adult population in South and Central America was 0.5 percent.Worsening matters, the type of virus that had entered the population was particularly aggressive, with the potential to generate AIDS more quickly than other strains \u2014 within several years of infection.The epidemic, the researchers warned, could be \u201cdevastating\u201d for the Warao.The disease was also spreading in an information vacuum among the Warao.\u201cSome of them simply never believed me or paid attention to me,\u201d recalled Dr. Julian A. Villalba, a Venezuelan who led the investigation and is now a clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School.He also ran up against government intransigence. As officials became aware of his alarming discoveries, he said, some tried to intimidate him and impede his work.\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to show that the politics were failing,\u201d Dr. Villalba said, referring to the Maduro government.Since then, the absence of prevention programs and severe language barriers \u2014 many Warao are illiterate and do not speak fluent Spanish \u2014 have allowed ignorance about the disease to flourish.Msgr. Ernesto Jos\u00e9 Romero, the apostolic vicar of Tucupita, said he has repeatedly spoken with the state governor and other officials about the crisis, to little effect.\u201cWe have a government that wants to silence everything,\u201d Monsignor Romero said in an interview in San Francisco de Guayo, a town in the lower delta region. \u201cThey say it will be resolved. But more and more people die.\u201dDr. Villalba estimates that more than 80 percent of the Warao who tested positive under his auspices between 2010 and 2012 are now dead.Mr. Peque\u00f1o, the nurse, knew all of those victims. They were his friends, neighbors and relatives. Many were also his patients. Born and raised in San Francisco de Guayo, Mr. Peque\u00f1o has worked for 15 years at a small medical clinic there. He has also served as the state\u2019s point person in the lower delta region for the distribution of antiretroviral medicine.Not that there has been much to hand out.From time to time, he said, officials in Tucupita send boxes of medicine downriver, sometimes with visiting medical students from the Central University of Venezuela. But it is never enough to ensure a steady supply for all the H.I.V.-positive patients in the area, he said, and most of the time he has none to give.\u201cI\u2019m like a soldier without a weapon,\u201d Mr. Peque\u00f1o, 34, lamented. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything.\u201dStranded in San Francisco de Guayo for most of the past couple of years, Mr. Peque\u00f1o lost touch with many of the H.I.V. patients in villages he had been monitoring. But on a recent morning, he hitched a ride with me to go check in on some of them.Approaching Jobure de Guayo and clutching his notebook with the patient registry, Mr. Peque\u00f1o pointed the boat toward the compound of Mr. Quint\u00edn, the headman. As the boat puttered along the waterfront, people warmly hailed the nurse from their homes.Mr. Peque\u00f1o took a seat on the floor of the Quint\u00edn family\u2019s communal kitchen, an open-sided platform made from hand-hewn wood planks and protected by a palm-thatched roof. The air sung with sounds of a preindustrial society. The crackle of a wood fire. A guacamaya\u2019s squawk. The swish of an oar pulling through the water. The knock of a machete against raw taro.No family in Jobure de Guayo had been hit as hard by the epidemic as the headman\u2019s extended clan, which had lost at least 12 people to AIDS or AIDS-like symptoms in the last two years. Men, women and children died in their palm-fiber hammocks, slung in six houses clustered around the communal kitchen.\u201cThere is no medicine in the hospital. Why?\u201d Mr. Quint\u00edn asked. \u201cIn the past, if you were sick, they did everything possible to hospitalize you. Now, no,\u201d he said.\u201cMy people are dying.\u201dArmando Beria, 25, a resident of Jobure de Guayo, was on Mr. Peque\u00f1o\u2019s patient list. He said he first heard about AIDS when a doctor visited the settlement in 2013 and tested people for the virus. \u201cI did the examination and he said, \u2018You have it, too,\u2019\u201d Mr. Beria recalled.He believes he may have contracted it through having sex with other men when he was younger \u2014 a common practice among young Warao, especially before they are married. Researchers believe that men having sex with men was an important means of early dissemination of H.I.V. among the Warao. But the virus is now rampant in the broader population, and heterosexual sex and breast milk now appear to be other common forms of transmission.Mr. Beria has dealt with recurring bouts of diarrhea, headaches and muscle pain, and has begun to lose weight, though he continues to have enough energy to fish and harvest taro for his wife and four young children.His wife has twice tested negative for H.I.V., most recently a year ago. But telltale lesions have started to appear on her body. \u201cI think she has it now,\u201d he said, though he is powerless to know for sure in the absence of tests.Medication adherence among the Warao \u2014 when there is medication available \u2014 is poor, Mr. Peque\u00f1o said. Patients abandon their medicine because it makes them feel nauseated, or because they start to feel better.And in the absence of antiretroviral drugs, many Warao have sought solutions in traditional medicine, turning to a key figure in Warao society, the wisidatu, a kind of shamanic healer. The sickness, many Warao believe, is the result of witchcraft.Some in Mr. Quint\u00edn\u2019s family say they have fallen victim to a curse inflicted on them by a former village resident whom others accuse of being a hoarotu, a darker kind of shaman.Mikaela Perez, 33, a granddaughter of Mr. Quint\u00edn, said the conflict originated in a dispute between her father and another villager. She said the villager put a hex on her father, whose death from AIDS-like symptoms was followed by a rash of others in the family.\u201cA family that\u2019s coming to an end,\u201d Ms. Perez said, her expression plain. \u201cBefore we all lived together very happily. But now it\u2019s coming to an end.\u201dIsayen Herrera contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

In recent weeks, Mrs. May\u2019s predicament has been complicated by the House of Lords, the unelected chamber of Parliament, which has inflicted 10 defeats on her Brexit legislation, adding amendments that she will try to overturn in the House of Commons, the main chamber.Mrs. May\u2019s problems over a withdrawal are coming to a head over her promise to leave Europe\u2019s customs union, which guarantees tariff-free trade with Continental Europe.This issue has come to symbolize a deep division: Pro-Europeans want to stick close to the bloc, Britain\u2019s biggest trade partner, in order to protect the economy, while hard-line Brexit supporters want to break free and to negotiate other trade deals with non-European nations.Some supporters of Brexit have hinted they would challenge Mrs. May\u2019s leadership if she tried to soften the economic consequences of a withdrawal by sticking close to the bloc\u2019s economic rules and forming a close customs arrangement. There is speculation that some Brexit cabinet cheerleaders \u2014 Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox \u2014 might quit.But if she pleases the hard-line Brexit faction, Mrs. May will struggle to get approval for her plan from Parliament.\u201cIt is as remarkable as it is depressing that, with less than a year to go until Britain formally leaves, the Brexit inner cabinet is still debating what kind of customs arrangements the U.K. should be seeking,\u201d wrote James Forsyth, political editor of the right-wing, Brexit-supporting magazine The Spectator.Indirectly, at least, Brexit appeared to have played a role in shaping the local election results. Mrs. May\u2019s party generally polled well in parts of England that voted to leave the European Union, while Labour performed well in areas that wanted to remain, as did the smaller, more pro-European, Liberal Democrats, who made gains.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s Election Shook Obama: \u2018What if We Were Wrong?\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Riding in a motorcade in Lima, Peru, shortly after the 2016 election, President Barack Obama was struggling to understand Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory.\u201cWhat if we were wrong?\u201d he asked aides riding with him in the armored presidential limousine.He had read a column asserting that liberals had forgotten how important identity was to people and had promoted an empty cosmopolitan globalism that made many feel left behind. \u201cMaybe we pushed too far,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cMaybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.\u201dHis aides reassured him that he still would have won had he been able to run for another term and that the next generation had more in common with him than with Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama, the first black man elected president, did not seem convinced. \u201cSometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early,\u201d he said.Set to be published next week by Random House, Mr. Rhodes\u2019s memoir, \u201cThe World as It Is,\u201d offers a peek into Mr. Obama\u2019s tightly sealed inner sanctum from the perspective of one of the few people who saw him up close through all eight years of his presidency. Few moments shook Mr. Obama more than the decision by voters to replace him with a candidate who had questioned his very birth.But his book offers a new window, if only slightly cracked open, into the 44th president\u2019s handling of Russia\u2019s intervention in the 2016 election to help Mr. Trump get elected and the aftermath.In handing over power to someone determined to tear down all he had accomplished, Mr. Obama alluded to \u201cThe Godfather\u201d mafia movie: \u201cI feel like Michael Corleone. I almost got out.\u201dMr. Rhodes describes the reaction of foreign leaders. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan apologized for breaching protocol by meeting with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan after the election. Mr. Obama urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to take on a more vocal role defending the values they shared.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told Mr. Obama that she felt more obliged to run for another term because of Mr. Trump\u2019s election to defend the liberal international order. When they parted for the final time, Ms. Merkel had a single tear in her eye. \u201cShe\u2019s all alone,\u201d Mr. Obama noted.And yet despite criticism even from former advisers to Mr. Obama, Mr. Rhodes offers little sense that the former president thought he could have done more to counter Russian involvement in the election. Mr. Obama had authorized a statement to be issued by intelligence agency leaders a month before the election warning of Russian interference, but was thwarted from doing more because Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, refused to go along with a bipartisan statement.Mr. Rhodes called Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal \u201cstaggeringly partisan and unpatriotic.\u201d But Mr. Obama, whose Supreme Court nomination had been blocked by Mr. McConnell for months, seemed less surprised.\u201cWhat else did you expect from McConnell?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe won\u2019t even give us a hearing on Merrick Garland.\u201dStill, in preparatory sessions before meetings with the news media before the election, aides pressed Mr. Obama to respond to criticism that he should speak out more about Russian meddling. \u201cI talk about it every time I\u2019m asked,\u201d he responded. \u201cWhat else are we going to do? We\u2019ve warned folks.\u201dHe noted that Mr. Trump was already claiming that the election would be manipulated if Hillary Clinton won. \u201cIf I speak out more, he\u2019ll just say it\u2019s rigged,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Mr. Rhodes writes that neither he nor Mr. Obama knew at that time that there was an F.B.I. investigation into contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s recent unsubstantiated claims that the departing president placed a \u201cspy\u201d or multiple spies in his campaign.Mr. Rhodes writes he did not learn about the F.B.I. investigation until after leaving office, and then from the news media. Mr. Obama did not impose sanctions on Russia in retaliation for the meddling before the election because he believed it might prompt Moscow into hacking into Election Day vote tabulations. Mr. Obama did impose sanctions after the election but Mr. Rhodes\u2019s suggestion that the targets include President Vladimir V. Putin was rebuffed on the theory that such a move would go too far.Mr. Obama and his team were confident that Mrs. Clinton would win and, like much of the country, were shocked when she did not. \u201cI couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I should have seen it coming,\u201d Mr. Rhodes writes. \u201cBecause when you distilled it, stripped out the racism and misogyny, we\u2019d run against Hillary eight years ago with the same message Trump had used: She\u2019s part of a corrupt establishment that can\u2019t be trusted to bring change.\u201dOn election night, Mr. Obama spoke by telephone with Cody Keenan, his chief speechwriter, and Mr. Rhodes to figure out what he should say. Mr. Rhodes asked if he should offer reassurance to allies. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m the one to tell them that,\u201d the president said.The next day, Mr. Obama focused on cheering up his despondent staff. At one point, he sent a message to Mr. Rhodes saying, \u201cThere are more stars in the sky than grains of sand on the earth.\u201dBut days later, Mr. Obama seemed less sanguine. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he told aides. \u201cMaybe this is what people want. I\u2019ve got the economy set up well for him. No facts. No consequences. They can just have a cartoon.\u201dHe added that \u201cwe\u2019re about to find out just how resilient our institutions are, at home and around the world.\u201dThe day Mr. Obama hosted Mr. Trump at the White House after the election seemed surreal. Mr. Trump kept steering the conversation back to the size of his rallies, noting that he and Mr. Obama could draw big crowds, but Mrs. Clinton could not, Mr. Rhodes writes.Afterward, Mr. Obama called a few aides to the Oval Office to ruminate on the encounter. \u201cI\u2019m trying to place him in American history,\u201d he said.\u201cHe peddles\u201d bull, Mr. Rhodes answered. \u201cThat character has always been part of the American story. You can see it right back to some of the characters in Huckleberry Finn.\u201d\u201cMaybe,\u201d Mr. Obama answered, \u201cthat\u2019s the best we can hope for.\u201dFollow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}

Music, was meant to announce Valee, a 29-year-old from Chicago, as the latest addition to the tastemaking label. But instead of acting like a newly minted star, leaning into a world of stylists and on-demand everything, he brought a sewing machine from home.\u201cI put stuff together,\u201d Valee said with a shrug during a recent trip to New York. It was an understatement, but also an all-purpose job description, one that hinted at the motivations of a man who is less a born rapper than a detail-obsessed D.I.Y. aesthete, always looking for a fresh creative angle.While honing his music, which he often self-produces and records at home, Valee has turned odd hobbies into odd jobs, toeing the line between eccentric and modern-day Renaissance man. He does carpentry, construction and electrical work, and builds koi ponds, too. He customizes fast cars \u2014 full-size and remote control \u2014 and cooks. He\u2019s tattooed others, as well as his own arms and legs.\u201cI talk to a lot of rappers and people in the industry,\u201d said Andrew Barber, Valee\u2019s manager and an influential fixture in Chicago rap music. \u201cNobody else has ever offered to come build a bar in my house.\u201dValee, obviously, is not your typical rapper.\u201cI\u2019m real easygoing,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t look at the view counts, I don\u2019t look at the comments \u2014 it\u2019s a distraction. I would just rather be busy waiting on the next beat, so I can say something better than I just said.\u201d\u201cI just felt proud of being able to tell my mom that \u2019Ye reached out,\u201d Valee said, adding, \u201cHe saw that I built on my own with a small team.\u201dIn keeping with the times, Valee has continued to release a steady stream of new songs and distinct, minimalist music videos as he builds toward a body of work worthy of a proper debut album. \u201cI have probably 250 songs in the chest,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I want to increase the quality.\u201d\u201cHe had a fully formed thing,\u201d Mr. Barber said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that you hear in this era, but it sounded current. And he just looked cool as hell.\u201dAnd while Chicago\u2019s musical reputation has bifurcated into the hyperaggressive drill sound popularized by Chief Keef and G Herbo or the theatrical positivity of Chance the Rapper and his acolytes, Valee was neither. Yet he \u201cwas being embraced by both scenes,\u201d Mr. Barber said \u2014 as likely to be played at a downtown hipster club or a strip club on the far South Side.\u201cSpent $1,200 on a Yorkie,\u201d he raps, \u201cfed it Benihana\u2019s food.\u201d Elsewhere, an airport salad functions as a hiding place for marijuana and a custom vehicle (\u201cSuper Sport with frog eyes\u201d) winds up \u201cdouble-parked at Five Guys.\u201dPaul Rosenberg, the new chief executive at Def Jam, which oversees G.O.O.D., and Eminem\u2019s longtime manager, called Valee \u201can authentic and infectious standout,\u201d citing \u201chis immediately recognizable voice and melodic cadences.\u201d The rapper, he said, is \u201cexactly the type of artist we are excited to help build a fan base and career with.\u201dValee, tortoise-like, said he is chasing stability. Still, one of the downsides of not jumping up and down for attention in an oversaturated field is that, well, sometimes you don\u2019t get attention.Mr. Barber said that a big part of his job was to get Valee to come \u201cout of his shell and be a celebrity.\u201d Backstage at a private show for New York University students, Valee\u2019s D.J. and producer Rio Mac got in on the cheerleading, too, urging his friend to hype up the college crowd. \u201cI want you to stick your chest out,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re like a sex icon.\u201dValee demurred. \u201cI\u2019m an old man,\u201d he said. \u201cA big weekend for me is Home Depot and a Caesar salad.\u201dEarlier, touring the vintage seven-figure merchandise at Cooper Classic Cars in the West Village, he was similarly fixated on the little things, earning affection from the shop owner for his appreciation of obscure details and his poetic longings.Referring to the new, ground-level warehouse apartment he has been building for himself, Valee said wistfully, \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to pull my classic car up directly to my kitchen, get out and leave the groceries right there.\u201dBut press him long enough, and he will admit to less elegant ambitions, as well. \u201cI want chart-topping records \u2014 all of that,\u201d Valee said, leaving the luxury cars as his friend played the breakout hit \u201cLook Alive,\u201d by Blocboy JB, featuring Drake. \u201cI would love to one day have 100 million views on something.\u201cWhat\u2019s the song, what\u2019s the beat?

{"Headline": "How to Minimize the Risk of Food Poisoning", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthThe year is not yet half over and already there have been seven documented multistate outbreaks of food poisoning. The latest involved eggs in their shells containing salmonella and packaged chopped romaine lettuce contaminated with the especially dangerous \u201chamburger bug\u201d E. coli O157:H7.With summer and its accompanying picnics and outdoor food fests fast approaching, more outbreaks are likely to mar the fun of unsuspecting diners this year. We live in a global food economy and most people purchase and consume foods produced thousands of miles away that are often packaged in bulk to simplify food preparation at home and in restaurants.Meat, poultry and fish may come from huge farms where hundreds of thousands of animals are raised together, increasing the chance that food poisoning organisms will spread widely before they are detected.Cases are no longer mainly tied to foods made with raw eggs (like homemade mayonnaise and eggnog) or undercooked meat and poultry. Harmful organisms now show up in foods that were not considered a problem years ago, like raspberries, cantaloupe, ice cream, salami, scallions, parsley, apple cider and even toasted oat cereal.Once home, store the foods safely. Never place raw meat, poultry or fish in the fridge where it can drip onto other foods, especially foods already cooked and fresh fruits and vegetables that may be consumed raw.Don\u2019t defrost frozen foods on the counter. Take them out of the freezer in ample time for them to thaw in the fridge or use a microwave oven with a defrost feature.Be doubly sure to wash melons, especially cantaloupe and others with rough skins, before cutting into them lest you transfer nasty organisms from the surface of the fruit to the flesh within. But experts do not recommend using soap or bleach on foods.Don\u2019t assume that because the food was locally grown or from a farmers\u2019 market, it\u2019s free of potential hazards. Large producers operate under strict rules to prevent contamination; small local farmers may not adhere to the same constraints.Before preparing to cook, use soap and warm water to wash your hands, under your nails and up to your wrists. Use a commercial cleanser or a solution of one teaspoon of bleach in a quart of water to clean kitchen surfaces.When prepping foods, use separate cutting boards and knives for raw animal foods and produce, even produce you plan to cook, or wash the equipment thoroughly with soapy water between the two.Always refrigerate foods that are being marinated, even if the marinade is acidic. Never use the same marinade on the food after it has been cooked \u2014 unless you boil it first for 10 minutes \u2014 and don\u2019t reuse it to marinate something else.Cook animal products to the proper temperature: 160 degrees for ground meat; 165 for poultry; 145 for pork and fin fish; until the flesh is opaque for most shellfish, and until shells open for clams, oysters and mussels. After a food is cooked, put it on a clean platter.If you\u2019re hosting a buffet and expect prepared or raw food to remain unrefrigerated for hours, use a portable burner (like a chafing dish) to keep hot foods hot and set those that should be cold over crushed ice.But no matter how carefully you handle food at home, it is difficult if not impossible to reduce your risk of food poisoning if you rely heavily on restaurant-prepared and takeout foods. All it takes is one food handler along the line who harbors a noxious organism and fails to take needed precautions against contaminating the food being prepared and served.That said, pinpointing the cause of a food poisoning incident can be very tricky. It may \u2014 or may not \u2014 originate with the last food or drink you consumed. Different organisms take varying amounts of time to produce symptoms that might be recognized as food poisoning, and the \u201ctransit time\u201d it takes for food to make its way through the digestive tract varies from person to person.For example, while an attack of Staphylococcus aureus typically occurs in two to four hours after consuming a contaminated food, it can take as long as two days for a norovirus or Yersinia infection to cause misery, and E. coli O157:H7 can take up to 10 days before it results in bloody diarrhea and possible kidney failure.And if you want to know how efficient your digestive tract usually is, eat a cob of corn and notice how long it takes before undigested kernels appear in your stool. This could help you pinpoint the source of a suspected food poisoning attack.Also, while the most common symptoms of food poisoning include vomiting and diarrhea, several organisms \u2014 shigella, Yersinia and Clostridium perfringens \u2014 only cause diarrhea, and a severe infection with Listeria monocytogenes involves mainly fever. A hospital-based lab may be able to quickly identify the cause with a DNA test on a stool sample.For further guidance, consult the website FoodSafety.gov.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No, Bill Cosby and R. Kelly Were Not Lynched", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Tillet writes about race, gender and sexual violence.It is not surprising that those defending these two high-profile African-American men tried to link their fates to the historical narrative of African-American men who were lynched after being accused of raping white women. The fact that it rings so hollow now is progress.In 1893, after white mobs had murdered more than 200 African-Americans the year before, the anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells gave a speech in Boston that noted how charges of rape had been used to \u201cdestroy the manhood of the citizen.\u201d She described these allegations as \u201ca new cry, as false as it is foul\u201d that \u201chas proclaimed to the world that virtue and innocence are violated by Afro-Americans who must be killed like wild beasts to protect womanhood and childhood.\u201dOne way the metaphor was used was to condemn prosecution and news media coverage of African-American men who were accused of sexual assault. (Of course, there continued to be black men falsely accused of, and unjustly imprisoned for, the rapes of white women, as in the case of the Central Park Five.) But it was also used to dismiss black women who were often the victims of assaults. And it was effective, because it was so hard to challenge.By the \u201990s, the metaphor was cemented in the American consciousness. So much so that Clarence Thomas\u2019s declaration that his confirmation hearings had morphed into \u201ca high-tech lynching\u201d because of Anita Hill\u2019s sexual harassment accusations all but guaranteed his appointment to the Supreme Court.Their use of the lynching metaphor is doubly egregious because it ignores the other part of Wells\u2019s original formulation: When a black woman is raped, she said, \u201cit is different,\u201d a crime \u201cfor which nobody is lynched and no notice is taken.\u201dWells aimed to protect black women against rape by white men. But her understanding of how lynching also obscured violence against black women shaped a generation of black feminist scholars and activists who are now on the front lines of the fight for racial and gender justice in their communities and our larger country.Twenty years ago, my sister, Scheherazade, and I created a multimedia performance, \u201cStory of a Rape Survivor.\u201d I had been raped not just once but twice in college by black men, and she started a photo documentary of my recovery. We knew that by going public, we risked being labeled liars, or worse, race traitors.How things have changed since then. Black women \u2014 Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi \u2014 founded the Black Lives Matter movement. A black woman, Tarana Burke, started the \u201cMe Too\u201d revolution. And hashtags like #TrustBlackWomen have gone viral. The most paramount social-justice movements of our time now reflect the experiences of black girls and women who live at the intersections of oppression.The result has not only been a more inclusive grappling with the past and the ways in which black women have been forgotten as victims of lynching and police violence, but also a new reckoning with the present \u2014 one in which we start listening to the stories of our most vulnerable citizens, and finally believe them.Advertisement"}

What it does have is:Yes, the ride-hailing business should be regulated, but not to make it more like the disaster it is replacing.DAVID BERMAN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:The editorial waxes nostalgic about the \u201cbygone era\u201d before green cabs, Uber and Lyft, when \u201ceach type of car service tended to stay in its lane.\u201dMoreover, the vast majority of city taxi drivers \u2014 who earn around $35,000 per year working punishing weeks on New York\u2019s streets \u2014 rent their cabs from fleets that own hundreds of medallions (the licenses to operate a cab), a practice that fueled the era of Bitcoin-like speculation that drove medallion prices to stratospheric heights.Smart regulations can and must ensure that the technological revolution of for-hire-vehicles (and autonomous vehicles to come) provides efficient transportation for all users. But in tackling the challenges of the present, let\u2019s not gloss over the failures of the past.To the Editor:As a driver of a yellow cab for six and a half years, I care about this issue with every fiber of my being. I have watched my income plummet by well over 30 percent over that span and have seen the city do nearly zip to alleviate the situation. It has been tough to pinpoint who exactly is at fault.Yes, the medallions were overpriced when they hit over $1 million a few years ago. The city was going to auction off 2,000 more as a way to generate revenue, only to watch that effort fail because there would be too many taxis on the streets. A few years later and there are well over 50,000 for-hire vehicles competing with us that didn\u2019t exist when I started, with the numbers growing every month. Where were the traffic study, the environmental impact study and the admission that someone messed up by letting them loose?Sure, you may think that it\u2019s a win-win for the consumer. But Uber loses $1 billion per quarter and can\u2019t even treat its employees properly, and this is the behemoth that\u2019s supposed to represent all that\u2019s right with the gig economy. Yes, the Taxi & Limousine Commission failed to upgrade the taxis to the 21st century and reform outdated rules. But drivers like me who never had a say in this ended up taking the fall. We can only hope that the city gets it right this time around.To the Editor:Taxis and Uber are essentially in the same market, but Uber, and similar companies, slipped in because there is no street hailing. Taxis are a lesson in regulatory capture and failure. Regulations are initially adopted to protect consumers and the general public. Over time that breaks down as consumers are ignored, harassed, overcharged and forced into cabs that are filthy, or have drivers who are surly or cannot speak English.The taxi industry became a monopoly just waiting for something to break the cabal. Uber and its compatriots are just the disruptive force to do the trick. If taxis are highly, but poorly, regulated, Uber resists all regulation. It does not matter much whether Uber drivers are contractors or employees; Uber is a transportation company and must accept all that entails.Cities must reinvigorate taxi regulation so that it serves the public, and Uber must be under the same regulation. First and foremost, regulation should provide safety and customer service, but it should also encompass rate controls, congestion limits and pricing, insurance, driver licensing and much else. There is no reason that taxi hailing and app hailing should be regulated differently.To the Editor:I\u2019ve been taking taxis for almost 50 years. Contrary to what many people think and say, I have generally found the drivers to be incredibly hard-working family men (and some women) who are polite and love this city as much as I do. I don\u2019t understand why the powers that be in the city let Uber and the rest take over our streets and decimate the taxi industry just like that. Shame on them!DONNA KENTON, NEW YORKTo the Editor:This has become a crisis of unintended consequences, and New Yorkers, particularly taxi and livery drivers, do not have the luxury of letting elected officials take their time to find solutions as the situation grows increasingly dire.As a protectionist measure, there has always been a supply cap on the number of taxi medallions permitted in the city. This cap, rightly or wrongly, created a supply and demand system favoring medallion holders and the taxi drivers. Now livery providers like Uber have joined the city streets with no caps, and what we have is chaos.Livery companies should have cap barriers similar to taxi medallions to protect both the drivers and the people who use the services. Drivers can\u2019t make a living, and people who use a livery service can\u2019t get where they are going, because the city streets are so clogged with livery cars. Supply way exceeds the demand, and everyone suffers. Emergency services such as fire trucks and ambulances are also impeded by the increased congestion.SALLY GREENSPAN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:The Times editorial fails to address one of the fundamental attractions of Uber over taxis, and that is the convenience of using an app to order an Uber car to your location when you need one. That the taxi industry still refuses to coordinate all taxis and permit people to call one to their location is its own failure of business enterprise. Let taxis be permitted to be the sole random street-hailing service for customers. But strongly urge them to include an app-hailing program. Their failure to modernize should not be supported by the city administration.To the Editor:The most important lesson of the New York City taxi mess is that government-granted monopolies disserve the public interest. The technology that makes Uber and Lyft possible was available to New York\u2019s taxi medallion holders, but, protected by their taxi monopolies, they stuck with the status quo and let service deteriorate. Uber and Lyft succeeded only because New York visitors and residents were starved for good service made possible by new technologies.Like most monopolists throughout history, the medallion holders put monopoly profits ahead of service to the public. The last thing New York\u2019s government should do is to reward their greed by bailing them out.HENRY H.

{"Headline": "Trans Fats Should be Eliminated Worldwide by 2023, W.H.O. Says", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe World Health Organization on Monday announced a sweeping plan that urges governments around the globe to eliminate the use of trans fats, the industrially produced edible oil that gave birth to margarine, Crisco and other artery-clogging products that have been linked to millions of premature deaths.Artificial trans fats, better known to many American consumers as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, have contributed to a half million deaths a year, many of those in developing countries ill-equipped to address the health threats posed by a product cherished for its low price and long shelf life.A number of countries have already moved to restrict or ban trans fats, also known as trans fatty acids, including Denmark, Switzerland, Canada, Britain and the United States. Next month, all products sold in the United States must be free of industrially produced trans fats. Thailand is expected to issue a ban in the coming weeks.But trans fats remain popular in many emerging economies, particularly in South Asia, where local producers dominate the edible oil industry and regulations are weak or nonexistent.\u201cThe reality is that global food companies have done an amazing job reducing trans fats in rich countries but they have largely ignored Asia and Africa,\u201d said Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Until now, efforts by the Indian government to reduce the use of vanaspati have been stymied by food producers.Dr. Francesco Branca, chief nutritionist for the W.H.O., said the initiative seeks to overcome such resistance through public education and by encouraging governments to enact regulations that eliminate trans fats produced by local food manufacturers.But the health agency has also enlisted multinational companies that have already made the shift from trans fats to share their technological know-how with local producers. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to switch to more healthy oils, and consumers will not be able to taste the difference,\u201d Dr. Branca said. \u201cThis is really the low-hanging fruit for preventing cardiovascular disease, and it doesn\u2019t cost much money for governments to make it happen.\u201dAmong those that have joined the effort are Mondelez International, the American food giant that produces Oreos, Cadbury chocolates and scores of snack foods that previously contained trans fats. \u201cWe support the organization\u2019s work and broader industry efforts to share best practices and help guide other companies toward the achievement of W.H.O.\u2019s global objective,\u201d a company spokesman said in an email.Popularized in the 1950s, and once lionized as a healthy alternative to the saturated fats found in butter and lard, trans fats have been implicated in sudden heart attacks and strokes, but they are also associated with an increased risk for Type 2 diabetes and even infertility in women.Invented at the turn of the last century, trans fatty acids are created by changing the molecular structure of vegetable oils. The process hardens the oil, extending its shelf life and giving products like icing and cupcakes a creamy texture, but the product also wreaks havoc on the human circulation system. Their damaging effects include a rise in levels of so-called bad cholesterol and a decline in levels of good cholesterol.Dr. Walter C. Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H.

There\u2019s only one problem: \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to buy some trans fats,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we can\u2019t find it anywhere. \u201cAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Boots Riley Infiltrated Hollywood", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "FeatureThe cult indie rapper smuggled his radical anticapitalism into his biting new film \u2018Sorry to Bother You.\u2019Supported bySo he honed a spiel consisting of \u201cvarious levels.\u201d Level 1 was 23 words long, and on a recent afternoon, in a coffee shop in Riley\u2019s hometown, Oakland, Calif., he recited it to me more or less exactly as he recited it over the years to potential actors, producers, investors and advice-givers:\u201cIt\u2019s an absurdist dark comedy with magical realism and science fiction, inspired by the world of telemarketing. It\u2019s called \u2018Sorry to Bother You.\u2019\u2009\u201dAt which point he would take them to Level 2:\u201cCassius Green is a black telemarketer with self-esteem issues and existential angst who discovers a magical way to make his voice sound like it\u2019s overdubbed by a white actor.\u201dRiley let that premise sink in, then moved to Level 3:\u201cThis catapults him up the ladder of telemarketing success, to the upper echelon of telemarketers, who sell weapons of mass destruction and slave labor via cold calling. In order to do this, he has to betray his friends who are organizing a telemarketers\u2019 union.\u201dWho, at this point, could resist knowing more? And who, having heard the rest \u2014 the coke-snorting billionaire bad guy, the climactic battle, the many dystopian flights of fancy \u2014 could resist helping Riley get the thing up on screen? The answer was: plenty of people. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting many responses,\u201d he recalls.Riley has a sly grin, a slight build and a large afro. To comb it, he carries around a kitchen utensil called an angel-food-cake cutter \u2014 designed to slice delicate desserts, it does double-duty as a pick and fits comfortably in his back pocket. He furrows his brow frequently while talking to people, and if this is disconcerting at first, it turns out to be essential to his charisma, because it shows he\u2019s actually listening to what you\u2019re saying: Many entertainers are expert at connecting with crowds and much less adept in one-on-one interactions, but Riley takes visible pleasure in conversation.He is also a veteran hustler, and when it looked as if \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d might never materialize, it wasn\u2019t for lack of enterprise. At one point Riley sneaked into a private dinner at the Napa Valley Film Festival to get his script to Viggo Mortensen, with whom Riley shared an acquaintance. (Mortensen passed on participating.) He wrote to an email address belonging to the wife of Colin Firth, because the actor once approached Riley at a party rapping some Coup lyrics. (Firth said he couldn\u2019t do the movie, either.) But Riley, who is 47, had invested too much time to give up, and there were flashes of support. The comedian David Cross, who performed alongside Riley years ago at a fund-raiser for Palestinian medical services, read the script and told Riley to count him in. Further encouragement came from Patton Oswalt, who made a similar commitment, and the author Dave Eggers, who gave the script a look and, after calling it one of the best unproduced screenplays he\u2019d ever read, published it with McSweeney\u2019s as a book in December 2014.In late 2015, this gradual accumulation of boosters finally yielded funding, and more actors circled the project. Jordan Peele considered starring as Cassius for a time, then Donald Glover did, until Glover\u2019s \u201cAtlanta\u201d co-star, the captivatingly droll Lakeith Stanfield, signed on as Cassius for good. Over 28 days last summer, Riley shot the movie around Oakland and Berkeley, completing a cut in time for Sundance, where Annapurna \u2014 the prestige picture house behind films by Paul Thomas Anderson, David O. Russell and Kathryn Bigelow \u2014 bought its distribution rights for seven figures. The buzz surrounding the film was excellent, if echoey: Vice called it the \u201cmost bonkers movie\u201d at the festival; Vanity Fair called it \u201ca bonkers social satire\u201d; Slate called it a \u201cfeverish, bonkers satire.\u201d\u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d comes out in wide release in July. The film is visually ingenious and funny, yet grounded by pointed arguments about the obstacles to black success in America, the power of strikes and the soul-draining predations of capitalism. A self-described communist since his teens, Riley has said he aims \u201cto help build a mass movement that can use withholding of labor as a strategy for social change.\u201d That credo suffuses \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d and, notwithstanding the delay in getting it made, the film\u2019s timing could hardly be better. In Hollywood, two recent blockbusters by black directors \u2014 Peele\u2019s horror hit \u201cGet Out\u201d and Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d \u2014 staged nuanced readings of race within fantastical scenarios. Fresh anxieties about the precariousness of work and the increasingly precarious place of the worker have, meanwhile, permeated the cultural mainstream, from mounting critiques of the so-called gig economy to the teachers\u2019 strikes enjoying popular support nationwide to Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cReady Player One,\u201d a Hollywood vision of the future that features characters who become indentured servants to rapacious tech overlords.Culture is not a substitute for direct political action, of course, but as Riley has put it, \u201cit tills the soil and gets people ready\u201d \u2014 and he has spent his life tilling the soil. While \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d may register as a thoroughly Trump-era artifact, its concerns have long been with him. He wrote it toward the end of Barack Obama\u2019s first term, back when many liberals, he says, simply \u201cturned a blind eye to real problems.\u201d The film didn\u2019t need to change from one president to the next, because \u201cthe system hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dRiley connects with others easily, on the street and in his art \u2014 he has been writing rhymes about radical politics long enough to know how to frame ideas in punchy, compelling language. It\u2019s a skill at the intersection of activism and art-making, which is where he sits. In high school, when he still went by his given name, Ray, he acted in student plays and danced at talent shows. (During a senior trip, where he wore a pair of brown Florsheim boots, his schoolmates gave him his nickname.) He also joined the Progressive Labor Party, at 15, and worked to unionize California farmworkers, linking up with \u201cMexican dudes who came to the Central Valley with the purpose of fomenting revolution, doing work in the fields \u2014 the literal fields. They had a vision that wasn\u2019t new, but it was new to me, about how you could create a mass radical movement step by step.\u201dHis conviction, forged in the P.L.P., is that as long as politicians are beholden to big-money \u201cpuppeteers,\u201d the best strategy for change is to bypass the puppets and directly threaten the string-pullers\u2019 economic interests, through work stoppages \u2014 the one radical act, perhaps, that entrenched power can\u2019t co-opt. \u201cIt affected me because it wasn\u2019t this vague notion of \u2018change the world,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said of his time among the farmworkers. \u201cIt was, \u2018Here\u2019s a way things can happen.\u2019\u2009\u201d After that he became an advocate for Palestinian rights and a prominent member of the Occupy movement, helping Oakland residents to protest home foreclosures. In the wake of the Ferguson protests and amid the rise of Black Lives Matter, Riley, in an interview with \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d disputed the notion that \u201call you need to do is get your voice in the streets and things will change,\u201d describing mere attempts to \u201cshame power into action\u201d as ineffectual. Rather, he argued that demonstrators should \u201ccombine social movements with the ability to withhold our labor\u201d in order to \u201cgive social movements teeth.\u201dOne of Riley\u2019s influences in revolutionary thinking was his father. As a San Francisco State student in the 1960s, Walter Riley was an anti-Vietnam War activist; in 1968 he drove a Muni bus around the city and helped establish a rank-and-file caucus of fellow drivers. He later volunteered as a housing-and-welfare-rights advocate in Chicago, where Boots was born, then as an auto-industry organizer in Detroit. By the time Boots was 13, they were back in Oakland, where Walter, deciding that he could do good as a civil rights and criminal-defense lawyer, went to law school and started a practice.In 1989 Boots enrolled at San Francisco State himself, studying film. \u201cI did shorts, but they were style exercises, very abstract, figuring it out,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I was making music to go in the films.\u201d Outside class, he joined anti-racist protests. \u201cWhite supremacists said they were going to take back the Bay Area,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey had the \u2018Aryan Woodstock\u2019 in Napa, and they\u2019d have rallies in Union Square, with cops surrounding these Nazis.\u201d Riley and his cohort liked to lob soda cans over the police officer\u2019s heads, aiming for those within \u2014 a technique he pays homage to in \u201cSorry to Bother You.\u201dRiley worked part time for U.P.S., a Teamster job at which he met two aspiring rappers, Spice 1 (Robert Green Jr.), who became a prominent gangsta rapper in the \u201990s, and E-roc (Eric Davis). \u201cWe\u2019d rap in the bellies of planes we were loading up at Oakland airport,\u201d Riley recalled. He and Davis founded the Coup with the East Bay DJ Pam the Funkstress, and when they landed a record deal, Riley quit school. (Pam died last year at 51.)Looking back on the Coup\u2019s first album, the brash \u201cKill My Landlord\u201d (1993), Riley dismissed it as \u201ca pamphlet on tape,\u201d criticizing what he saw as its leaden pileup of leftist lingo. His assessment may be overly harsh, but Riley\u2019s point was to underscore a subsequent broadening in his artistic approach that tracks through to \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d: \u201cI moved to trying to talk to folks who don\u2019t identify with those politics.\u201dHe went on to fill his songs with cleverly loaded wordplay (\u201cI slang rocks, but Palestinian style\u201d) and set galvanizing slogans (\u201cWe got hella people, they got helicopters\u201d) to freewheeling funk. Many of Riley\u2019s most beloved verses unfold as vivid, frequently comic narratives. For \u201cFat Cats, Bigga Fish,\u201d from 1994, he assumed the voice of a pickpocket who, posing as a waiter to hunt wealthy marks at an Oakland gala, overhears a developer pitch the mayor on a conspiracy to turn low-income housing into condos. \u201cAin\u2019t no one player that could beat this lunacy,\u201d the narrator concludes, realizing just how small-fry his own thievery is by comparison: \u201cAin\u2019t no hustler on the street could do a whole community.\u201d Even as the Coup took off on the indie circuit and landed videos on MTV and BET, Riley remained an activist. During a four-year hiatus between the group\u2019s second and third albums, he phone-banked for nonprofits \u2014 a miserable experience that he tapped when it came time to write his movie.One of the Coup\u2019s best-known moments was a result of wild chance. In September 2001, the group gained notoriety for an eerily coincidental cover for its album \u201cParty Music\u201d \u2014 designed months earlier \u2014 in which Riley and Pam stand before a Photoshopped World Trade Center, holding up drumsticks and a bass-tuner as if they are detonators, as the towers explode behind them. (This cover, intended as a metaphorical blow against capitalism, was changed against his wishes after the Sept. 11 attacks.) Riley became an outspoken guest on shows like \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d and \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d with Bill Maher, unflagging in what you might call his blanket bipartisan disdain for politicians. Asked by RT America in 2011, for example, about whether Barack Obama represented a \u201creal change\u201d from his predecessors, Riley replied, \u201cIt\u2019s really like we just got a black manager at McDonald\u2019s, and all the workers at McDonald\u2019s are happy, thinking that everything\u2019s gonna be different, but no, you still gotta get your ass in front of that cash register and you\u2019re still gonna have to sweep and mop the floors just as hard \u2014 and you\u2019re gonna still get paid the exact same amount, although you got a new, handsome, black manager.\u201dDuring our walk through Oakland, we passed a tiny vintage clothing store called Regina\u2019s Door, and its owner, Regina Evans, a congenial woman in a headwrap, emerged to hug Riley. In addition to selling clothes, the shop offers financial support and \u201ccreative arts healing\u201d to survivors of sex trafficking and provides a venue for Evans\u2019s plays, which Riley has attended. She gave Riley a happy update on one of the women she helps support, then let him know about a new play she would be mounting soon in Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s very weird and different, about a slave who kills herself and rebuilds her life with two spirits she can\u2019t really see but knows are there,\u201d Evans said. \u201cWriting it, I came to a standstill and got scared: \u2018I don\u2019t think this is gonna work.\u2019 Then I started reading your movie reviews, and everyone\u2019s saying, \u2018It\u2019s crazy but it\u2019s awesome.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, Boots wrote a crazy script,\u2019 and I started writing again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Riley said, nodding.In Riley\u2019s hands, these fantastical elements have a clear dramatic purpose. Cassius\u2019 ability to speak with a \u201cwhite voice\u201d (provided by David Cross) is a way to poke fun at perceptions and performances of racial identity. The film\u2019s central villain, a company with the innocuous name of Worry Free, signs laborers to unpaid lifetime contracts in exchange for a guarantee of meals and glammed-up prison-style housing \u2014 bunk beds crammed beneath chandeliers. Worry Free\u2019s scheme seems a touch less far-fetched when considered alongside old company-owned mining towns, Foxconn City in Shenzhen or even tech campuses with their free amenities and napping pods, meant to blur the line between work and life and extract more value from employees in the name of providing perks. Eggers, a longtime San Franciscan, said: \u201cWhen I read Boots\u2019s script, I\u2019d just published \u2018The Circle\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 a 2013 dystopian novel set in Silicon Valley \u2014 \u201cand it struck me that we were both picking up on changes we\u2019ve seen in the Bay Area. There\u2019s this strangely sinister cast to life here sometimes, where it\u2019s still idyllic and free and open but also there\u2019s a sense of consolidation of power, of wealth and of control that was never part of the Bay before.\u201dCassius begins the movie broke and aimless, renting a room from his uncle Sergio (Terry Crews), who is facing imminent foreclosure. When the telemarketing firm rewards Cassius\u2019 supernatural cold-calling prowess with promotions and praise, these represent a concrete means to save Sergio\u2019s house and the first time in Cassius\u2019s adult life that people in power have told him he\u2019s good at something \u2014 even if that something turns out to be shilling for weapons manufacturers and Worry Free (whose sarong-sporting chief executive is played with slick, winking malevolence by Armie Hammer). Cassius comes to see his striking co-workers and his radical artist girlfriend, Detroit (a transfixing Tessa Thompson), as impediments to the blossoming of his own excellence, but Riley and Stanfield make it compellingly tough to dismiss his motivations here as merely selling out. \u201cBoots and I wanted to make sure he was relatable,\u201d Stanfield told me, \u201ca normal guy in an otherworldly situation that actually has a lot in common with real-world situations.\u201dAmong the questions the movie raises is whether black success within capitalism is something to reflexively celebrate or whether the success of individuals who belong to an exploited class serves to ratify and consolidate \u2014 rather than thwart or ameliorate \u2014 the system doing the exploiting. Discussing this question, Riley used the example of the resolutely capitalist Jay-Z: \u201cWhen people listen to Jay-Z, they\u2019re working all day or trying to work and pay their bills, and what they hear is someone who\u2019s free. Who doesn\u2019t have to worry about the electricity. But all we\u2019re taught is that those who are rich deserve to be rich because they worked harder than the rest of us or they\u2019re smarter. And this may be true of some of those folks, but there are definitely very poor people who are very smart and work hard. It\u2019s just that this system can only have a few people on the top. So Jay-Z is saying: \u2018You can do this, too, I\u2019m trying to give you game,\u2019 and it ends up explaining poverty as a system of bad choices. Yes, maybe you can make better choices and be the crab that gets out of the bucket \u2014 but that\u2019ll be at the expense of all the other crabs in the bucket.\u201dIn the past, Riley has criticized Hollywood as abidingly reactionary in the stories it tells about black people: \u201cAll these movies \u2014 whether it\u2019s \u2018Menace II Society\u2019 or \u2018Boyz N the Hood\u2019 \u2014 the moral is \u2018Move some place else and everything\u2019s better,\u2019\u2009\u201d he has said. \u201cAnd the message is always \u2018We\u2019re destroying ourselves,\u2019 and there\u2019s no mention of anything systematic.\u201d At one point, drinking coffee on stools in an uptown cafe, I brought up \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Riley told me that he admires Ryan Coogler and considers him \u201ca mentor,\u201d but his praise for that film came with an asterisk: \u201cIt was great \u2014 for a superhero movie. One of the best I\u2019ve seen. But I have a problem with superheroes in general, because, politically, superheroes are cops. Superheroes work with the government to uphold the law. And who do the laws work for?\u201d Riley answered this question with a smirk. \u201cPut it like this: We all love bank robbers, because we know that in the two sides of that equation, the robbers are the ones to root for, not the banks. Only in superhero movies and the news do they try to make us think we\u2019re against the bank robbers!\u201dI asked Riley if, when shopping the film, he ever deployed his own version of a white voice. He said no, then elaborated. \u201cEverybody feels like they\u2019re the exception,\u201d he went on. \u201cThere\u2019s a story I tell, which was told to me by Tom Morello,\u201d who was the guitarist for Rage Against the Machine, with whom Riley formed a side project several years ago. \u201cRage were going to shoot a music video for one of their songs, Michael Moore directed it and the idea was they were gonna show up on Wall Street and play loud in the middle of the day, and when the cops came, and when Wall Street people came and yelled at them, even if it got shut down, that would be the video. So they get there, they play the song one time. Tumbleweeds. Play it again. Nothing\u2019s happening \u2014 a couple cops talking into their radios. They play it a third time and start hearing a rumble. \u2018Are they sending SWAT in?\u2019 And then, from around the corner, they see hundreds of people in business clothes coming closer, chanting \u2018Suits! For! Rage!\u2019 They\u2019re fans!\u201d (In the finished video, for the song \u201cSleep Now in the Fire,\u201d a few men in trading-floor jackets rock out in the crowd.)Transgressive gestures have a dispiriting way of being absorbed by the forces they\u2019re intended to transgress, and so I initially took this story to illustrate how Rage Against the Machine had been revealed, in this moment, as insufficiently radical. But for Riley, it conveyed an altogether different point, one that reflected the baseline faith in other people that a lifelong activist must sustain in order to keep going: \u201cIt turns out that Rage have hundreds of fans on Wall Street who are totally into what they\u2019re saying, and who felt like they were against the system, too, but this was just what they had to do because the system wasn\u2019t going anywhere. And that\u2019s what most of us feel. That we\u2019re only doing what we\u2019re doing because there\u2019s no way to change things.\u201dWealth in the East Bay has historically concentrated itself in the hills. Today, despite some fast-gentrifying exceptions, the general rule still holds: The flatter the land, the poorer the people living on it. Spring Mansion \u2014 named for its original owner, the mining and real estate tycoon John Hopkins Spring \u2014 was a universe away from the Oakland flats, where Riley grew up and shot most of the film. Modeled on Empress Elisabeth of Austria\u2019s Achilleion Palace, the mansion sits ostentatiously on three acres, with balustraded terraces and a view, through palm trees, out to San Francisco Bay. The place is currently uninhabited, sitting on the market with a $7.5 million asking price, but for the next 12-odd hours, a plutocrat\u2019s palace would become a communist\u2019s playground.Something about this situation seemed to make Riley a touch uneasy \u2014 or, at least, to strike him as grimly amusing. Part of his decision to shoot \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d in his hometown was his knowledge that he could call in favors, make handshake deals and save money. He enlisted friends as extras and used other friends\u2019 artwork to decorate scenes. That spirit of community-abetted thriftiness extended all the way to the film\u2019s Oakland premiere on April 12, where Riley wore a vintage three-piece suit that Regina Evans had given him gratis, \u201cstuffed into a trash bag with a bunch of other suits,\u201d he said. Riley had gravitated toward Spring Mansion in the first place because a local musician he knew once shot a video there for peanuts, and Riley figured he could finesse a similar deal. \u201cBut then line producers and location scouts insist on getting involved, and it\u2019s out of your hands,\u201d he said. Today\u2019s reshoot would result in maybe five seconds of new film. Considering this, Riley chuckled and shook his head. The footage was necessary, but \u201cif we\u2019d been able to get to this when we were first here,\u201d he said, \u201cit would have taken 10 minutes instead of a whole day and, like, $100,000.\u201dLakeith Stanfield flew up from Los Angeles and was driven straight to the mansion. Crew members had erected their temporary gate on the patio, marking the spot where Stanfield was to stand, consult his phone and enter the code. \u201cI love how non-actory Keith is,\u201d Riley told me. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t learn all his lines until right before, so you get this sense that he\u2019s actually figuring out what he\u2019s going to say in the moment.\u201d\u201cHello, beautiful people,\u201d Stanfield said, greeting the crew as he walked on set.\u201c777-9311,\u201d Riley sang to him \u2014 the title of a 1982 track by the Time and, for no reason other than his love for the song, the code he wanted Stanfield to type in.Boots\u2019s directing style, Tessa Thompson later told me, fosters a spirit of exploration: \u201cHe did this really cool thing with me and Lakeith, where he had us do takes of scenes, but without using any words. He said, \u2018I heard Spike Jonze does this, let\u2019s try it!\u2019 \u2014 I loved that he said he\u2019d borrowed it from someone he respected. On the one hand he has this chutzpah and confidence, but he also has the ability to be humble and trust other people to know things that he doesn\u2019t.\u201dAfter a few takes at the mansion, Riley broke in and altered Stanfield\u2019s pacing a bit, to give himself options in the editing room. \u201cAy, check this out,\u201d he said. It was a phrase I heard him utter several times that day \u2014 a rhetorical device that made instructions sound like shared discoveries. \u201cThis time, try starting out of frame, then walking in,\u201d he went on. \u201cI\u2019ll cue you.\u201d They shot the keypad sequence a few more times, then moved the camera around to the other side of the fence to capture Stanfield head-on.I asked Riley whether Annapurna had given him any larger notes about the movie, expressed concerns beyond the level of logistical snags. He said no, but did mention a bit of test-screening feedback the executives passed along about the movie\u2019s final moments, which \u201cunsettled\u201d some viewers. That reaction was fine by him: Riley ends the film on a note of volatility, introducing disconcerting new information in the closing seconds and then leaving this, and one of the film\u2019s major antagonisms, unresolved.When it came to endings, though, Riley emphasized that unresolved was not the same thing as unhappy. \u201cIt\u2019s never all the way good or all the way bad,\u201d he said, \u201cas long as the fight is going on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Fastest Growth in the U.S. Means for Idaho Politics", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOISE, Idaho \u2014 The tech company office where Mikelle Oliver works as a recruiter opened two and a half years ago and is now so crammed she must share a desk.Ms. Oliver and her 200 co-workers will soon move to another building and be joined by 300 more employees. A housing development of 3,000 homes on Boise\u2019s edge, planned for a 20-year build-out, is about a decade ahead of schedule. On the city\u2019s hippest strip, young people pack the outdoor cafes on a late spring weeknight.These are heady times for Idaho\u2019s biggest metro area, with an influx of newcomers, a spike in home prices and a jolt of high-wage jobs in professions like payroll services and accounting that have made Idaho the fastest-growing state in the nation. Boise has driven the growth \u2014 more than four in 10 Idaho residents now live within a half-hour\u2019s drive of the State Capitol in the heart of the city.With that wave of urbanization and economic development has come a new political chemistry in this conservative rural state. Idaho\u2019s new residents, clustering in Boise\u2019s boom zone, are creating uncertainty about how they might vote in Tuesday\u2019s primary for governor in a moment when economics, politics and demographics are all in motion.No one is expecting a revolution; the long dominance by Republicans is almost certainly secure. Still, political experts said, the election could be pivotal for both parties as a measure of whether prosperity and new blood push Democrats and Republicans toward moderation, or away from it.Sam McMahon, 22, who grew up east of Seattle and graduated this spring with a degree in computer science from Boise State University, is among the new deciders. He described himself as an enthusiastic but uncommitted Democrat who planned to vote on Tuesday in a primary where the open seat for governor is the headline attraction. Boise\u2019s mayor, Dave Bieter, a Democrat, said newcomers like Mr. McMahon were making some traditionally Republican state legislative seats on the city\u2019s edge competitive for the first time in recent memory.Tiffany Amos also plans to vote. She came to Idaho from California for college, and she and her husband have put down roots, buying a home here last summer. She said she planned to vote for a Republican but hasn\u2019t decided who will get her support in a crowded field. Gov. C. L. Otter, a Republican known to all as Butch, is retiring after 12 years.Many residents \u2014 some in frustration, others with a sigh of relief \u2014 said they thought that Idaho could emerge from this election cycle superficially unchanged, shifted only in the nuances and margins despite the churn of new wealth, new population and anxiety about where it all might lead.More economic energy than ever is flowing from Boise, but the legislature is very likely to remain firmly in the grip of conservative rural lawmakers. More retirees are moving in for the attractive home prices and taxes, but so are more young tech workers who want good schools. Democrats have felt a surge of enthusiasm in the city itself, but Republicans have seen even more as new conservatives from places like Southern California have flocked to the suburbs.\u201cPeople keep thinking, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve got all these people moving in, it\u2019s going to kind of moderate and you\u2019re going to get a two-party system,\u2019 \u201d said Gary Moncrief, a retired professor at Boise State University who has studied the state for 40 years. \u201cPeople have been talking about that now for 30 years and it just hasn\u2019t happened, and part of that is because of the nature of the people that are moving here.\u201dIn the primary, almost all the candidates for governor are reaching out in various ways to the altered electorate, either to suggest that greater change is possible now in a boom economy, or that the line against further change will be defended.For the Democrats, a Boise businessman, A. J. Balukoff, is pledging to fight for improved health care and more education spending, and is facing an insurgent progressive to his left in Paulette Jordan, a former state legislator who would be, if elected, the first Native American governor of Idaho. Ms. Jordan promises to raise the minimum wage and fight climate change.On the Republican side, the three leading candidates are making pitches to very distinct segments of the electorate, and tapping into concerns about where the state might be headed. Ra\u00fal Labrador, a congressman from the Boise suburbs, is running on conservative issues like abortion and gun rights. Tommy Ahlquist, a physician and businessman who has had a hand in the boom as a developer, is pledging more economic growth. Brad Little, the lieutenant governor, is appealing to voters who want an experienced hand at the helm.If new voters do in fact tip any of Tuesday\u2019s outcomes, it will be the voice of the West Coast \u2014 liberal, conservative or something between \u2014 that rises above the din. Los Angeles County has in recent years sent more residents to Ada County, which includes Boise and its western suburbs, than any other place. Utah County in Utah and San Diego and Orange Counties in California are close behind.\u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating election \u2014 I think a lot of people are going to be poring over the numbers the day after, and the day after that, because everyone is anxious to understand what shift is really occurring,\u201d said Jeff Sayer, a former director of the Idaho Department of Commerce.Some changes are already here, and for longtime residents, drenched with meaning and symbolism. The Boise Co-op, for example, a beloved 45-year-old symbol of the North End \u2014 generally considered the city\u2019s most liberal neighborhood \u2014 spent $3.5 million to open a grocery store in Meridian, 10 miles to the west, where conservative politics run deep and California license plates are common.The Meridian store now outpaces the original during membership drives, sometimes by a three-to-one margin, and attracts shoppers like Ashley and her husband, Ray, transplants from the San Francisco area who did not want their last names used because of a backlash they say is running hot against Californians. They left California last year, they said, seeking a more conservative environment in which to raise their children, ages 9 and 3. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t agree with California politics,\u201d Ashley said.Whether voters in the midst of a boom move left or right, many residents say the strains of change are deep, as farms and ranches on the city\u2019s edge get chewed up into housing, and high-wage tech workers outcompete the locals. Klea Gentle, a hotel sales manager, said the frustrations of shopping for a home in Boise\u2019s North End, and getting beaten by cash offers far above the asking price, were shocking in a once quiet market.Ms. Gentle is a Democrat who said she had found herself moving to the left and would vote for Ms. Jordan. Politicians and economists said they have been looking at how other Western cities handled urban booms before Boise\u2019s, from Denver to Salt Lake City.Ms. Oliver, 29, the tech recruiter, said it felt like a bubble.\u201cThere are not enough companies to sustain the amount of growth we\u2019re seeing, and salaries are not keeping up,\u201d she said. She described herself as Republican-leaning but undecided in the governor\u2019s race. In any case, she added, political change is inevitable sooner or later from the wave of new people. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen it yet, but it\u2019s definitely coming,\u201d she said.Her employer, Paylocity, an Illinois-based company that expanded in Idaho in 2015, will continue its growth curve outside Boise. The company is taking space in Meridian, which is now Idaho\u2019s second-largest city, grown from sleepy farm roots within a generation and now home to one of the busiest traffic intersections in Idaho, footsteps from the Boise Co-op.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobless Rate Looks Like Old Times, but the Economy Doesn\u2019t", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe last time the unemployment rate fell below the 4 percent threshold was in 2000, during a period of frenetic activity remembered as the dot-com boom.Nine years into a sustained, if less feverish, economic recovery, that milestone has been achieved again.The Labor Department said Friday that the jobless rate in April fell to 3.9 percent, raising anew the question of just how tight the labor market can get, and for how long.In the past half-century, only the late 1960s brought an extended period when the rate stayed below 4 percent.\u201cWe\u2019ve continued to add jobs routinely every month for so long, and the unemployment rate we have reached is amazing,\u201d said Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job site ZipRecruiter.President Trump crowed about the landmark on Friday, tweeting, \u201c4% is Broken!\u201dThe steady-as-she-goes economy has produced a record 91 straight months of job growth. That may represent a healthier foundation than the dot-com era, when pride \u2014 or, as it was branded, \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d \u2014 went before a fall.But the banner number announced Friday did not resolve any of the broader questions that economists have about this unparalleled run.The most prominent is a mystery that has proved impervious to easy explanation: why wage increases haven\u2019t been more robust, when the market continues to edge toward full employment.Friday\u2019s report showed that hourly earnings went up by 2.6 percent over the past year, not much faster than inflation. The subdued wage gains eased the prospect that the Federal Reserve would accelerate its plans to raise interest rates, helping to send stocks higher. But lagging pay also reflects how the economy of 2018 is fundamentally different from earlier eras.\u201cA 3.9 percent rate today doesn\u2019t suggest as tight a labor market as 3.9 percent in 2000 or 3.9 percent in the late 1960s,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief United States economist.A lot has changed since the turn of the century. The share of working-age women in the labor force began to fall in 2000, after increasing for decades. Men have been dropping out for much longer. The upshot is that a smaller share of people are participating in the labor market, and it\u2019s easier to get low levels of unemployment when fewer people are vying for jobs.In fact, a shrinking labor force in April is part of why the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent even as payrolls grew by a fairly routine 164,000 jobs.The population is also older than they used to be, on balance. The baby-boom generation has moved steadily toward retirement over the last two decades. And those still working have not helped push wages up. Generally, workers climb the economic ladder fastest when they are young, and so an older work force may weigh on average wages, economists say.In 2000, wages for rank-and-file workers rose at an annual rate of around 4 percent. Part of the problem now is that some 60 percent of the jobs added since 2010 have been in low-wage, service-sector jobs, according to Morgan Stanley.Fifty years ago, there were plenty of factory jobs paying a decent wage, and unions held much greater sway. Manufacturing accounted for one in four jobs; today it\u2019s not even one in 10.The tech explosion of the late 1990s gave rise to lucrative roles in companies based on new business models. The share of the economic pie going to workers rose steadily for the first time since the 1970s \u2014 a feat not repeated since.Average hourly earnings were 2.9 percent higher in January than a year earlier, a hopeful sign that wages might be gaining traction in a tight labor market. Their stubborn failure to do so is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year.\u201cNo one is creating an e-commerce group out of nothing anymore,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing firm. Instead, companies are bulking up their warehouses to compete with Amazon, slotting in tens of thousands of relatively low-paid pickers, packers and stockers over the past several years.Mr. Gimbel said he had seen a particular hunger for new bodies in call centers, which offer candidates the minimum wage to deal with consumers\u2019 complaints about the gadgets they ordered online.More recently, Mr. Trump\u2019s flirtation with a trade war has thrust uncertainty into the economic picture. The White House has provided little clarity about whether its newly imposed steel and aluminum tariffs will extend to allies like Mexico, Canada and the European Union, and it seems no closer to smoothing over economic tensions with China.Uncertainty over the price of raw materials could prompt factories to cut back from their recent hiring spree. Manufacturers added 73,000 jobs in the first quarter, much more than in the same period last year.\u201cA faster pace of wage growth would be great for households, but in a way that would create even more difficulty for policymakers,\u201d Ms. Zentner said. An acceleration could force Fed officials to raise rates more aggressively, which would raise the cost of car loans and credit card debt.However mixed the blessing, Ms. Zentner said, the ever-tightening job market could soon force faster growth in paychecks. \u201cWe are getting closer and closer to that flash point, but we don\u2019t know exactly when it is going to happen,\u201d she said.A wave of bigger raises has already reached Chandler Steffy\u2019s roofing company in Clive, Iowa.Three years ago, Mr. Steffy could pay laborers less than $15 an hour. No longer. In March, the latest month measured at the state level, the jobless rate in Iowa was 2.8 percent, one of the nation\u2019s lowest. Mr. Steffy now pays roofers $25 an hour, including benefits.His rate for subcontractors has been spiking. It went up 7 percent in March, and will rise another 7 percent in May. There will be bumps in June and August, too. It\u2019s all Mr. Steffy can do to keep himself in the game.\u201cThere\u2019s a price war going on for labor,\u201d he said. He has had crews leave job sites before finishing a roof because they got a better offer from another contractor. \u201cThe next 18 months are going to be crazy,\u201d he said.Ben Casselman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Doesn\u2019t Have to Be Trump\u2019s Doormat", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Simon and Mr. Stevenson\u00a0worked on Middle\u00a0East policy in the administration of President Barack Obama.After months of swaggering hesitation, President Trump finally announced the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran, to which Britain, France, Russia, China, Germany and the European Union are also parties. This action tramples on European leaders, who urged Mr. Trump to exercise restraint in the interest of international security and multilateralism.But mere words aren\u2019t going to dissuade this White House. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has treated Europe like a doormat, questioning the value of NATO, ridiculing the mission of the European Union and dismissing European exhortations on policy matters.Given all this, the European Union in particular may feel compelled to acknowledge the harsh reality that it has yet to act like an organization with a G.D.P. roughly equal to that of the United States \u2014 and to change the situation by signaling to Washington that on certain matters it refuses to be ignored. The trouble the European Union has had uniting around highly sensitive issues \u2014 immigration, for example \u2014 is perhaps understandable. But the Iran deal does not appear to be divisive: From the pro-Brexit Mr. Johnson to the avowed internationalist Mr. Macron, European politicians understand its value.What can Europe do to get Mr. Trump\u2019s attention? President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has indicated that his country will continue to adhere to the terms of the deal for the time being and deal with other parties to it in hopes of securing its benefits. This confers on the European Union, Britain and France \u2014 all of which are parties \u2014 some leverage. Acknowledging Iran\u2019s compliance and continuing to do business with Iran without imposing sanctions would mitigate the effect of the White House\u2019s sanctions and make it easier for advocates of the deal in Tehran to make their case.The administration\u2019s challenge \u2014 the American ambassador to Germany has already said that German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations now \u2014 might prompt Europe to go further. The European Union could, for instance, announce the withdrawal of member-states\u2019 ambassadors from the United States. Isn\u2019t this what states do when diplomatic partners breach solemn agreements, expose them to security risks and threaten to wreak havoc on their economies? That is, after all, what the administration is threatening to do by courting the risk of a Middle Eastern war and applying secondary sanctions to European companies. Depending on the American response, European capitals might even follow up with expulsion of American ambassadors.It would be hard to fault these moves as irresponsible, given that they would not impair vital security functions like intelligence-sharing and law enforcement coordination. They would, however, symbolize a stark diplomatic breach that could extend to other areas in which the Trump administration needs allied support. Thus, the White House would face the first hard choice in this whole process: a full-blown crisis in trans-Atlantic relations. If the administration\u2019s next move were to impose secondary sanctions on Europe, the Europeans could slap its own penalties on American multinational corporations, which in turn would place additional pressure on the White House.For the European Union to target the United States commercially for attempting to adversely affect legitimate trade relationships would be radical. But it would arise in response to correspondingly egregious American behavior. By virtue of the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement, European allies conferred economic leadership on the United States. Now the United States, in breaching the Iran deal and reimposing sanctions, has turned the very weapon that those allies bestowed on it against them.No matter what the European Union or its member states do, it\u2019s unrealistic to think that Mr. Trump will change his mind on the Iran deal. But Europe\u2019s objective would be to keep Iran in a deal that continues to block Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear bomb irrespective of American policy. Iran wouldn\u2019t stick with it unless they thought the European Union could deliver on sanctions relief. The moves suggested here would go a long way toward making this case.There are few recent historical examples of effective European opposition to American foreign policy. Europe essentially opposed the United States\u2019 involvement in the Vietnam War, but the United States\u2019 military and substantial economic autonomy meant that it had no real leverage, and Cold War realities probably would have constrained the exercise of that leverage even if it had existed. And the Vietnam War, as vexing and tragic as it was, occurred off the beaten trans-Atlantic path and had geographically containable effects.The Iran case is different. Europe is at odds with the United States on an agreement to which it is a party, concerning a matter of wide-ranging strategic and regional importance. If this doesn\u2019t end the European Union\u2019s doormat foreign policy, we might as well start referring to it as the 28 colonies ruled from across the ocean. This is not an outcome the United States should welcome. As Britain learned in 1939, it\u2019s a lot better to have allies than colonies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Ohio Special Election Shapes Up as a Big Test of the \u2018Blue Wave\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Ohio primary voters selected establishment candidates on Tuesday for the next big test of the Democrats\u2019 promised \u201cblue wave,\u201d a House special election this August in the suburbs of Columbus that could indicate just how strong Democrats will be in November with college-educated, affluent voters.The special election, which will take place 13 weeks before Election Day, will offer clues of Democratic strength, particularly on the kind of suburban terrain that will be critical in numerous races this fall as Democrats try to wrest control of the House.Most of the recent special House elections in Republican seats have built up steam until an Election Day that has garnered remarkable attention, even in seats where the Democrat had little shot. The Tiberi seat is likely to be no different.\u201cIf I was the Republican Party, I\u2019d be pretty concerned about it,\u201d said Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio. Voters were fond of Mr. Tiberi, he said, but he predicted that Mr. O\u2019Connor could win over people repelled by the \u201cconstant chaos\u201d and \u201cdemeaning nature\u201d of the Trump presidency.Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, invoked the woman Republicans love to run against, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader.\u201cI just saw the opposition research book on Danny O\u2019Connor, and he is a classic liberal,\u201d Mr. Stivers said on Wednesday. \u201cHe might say he\u2019s not going to vote for Pelosi. Maybe she\u2019s not liberal enough for him.\u201dThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was noncommittal about its plans even as it was taking a shot at the Republican candidate. A spokesman for the committee, Jacob Peters, said \u201cthe D.C.C.C. will continue to assess\u201d the contest.But he said, \u201cThe reality is that Troy Balderson is a heavily damaged nominee who just spent a lot of time and money to make the case that he is the greatest threat to Medicaid and health coverage for central Ohio families.\u201dAt 33, Mr. Lamb is not much older than Mr. O\u2019Connor. And like Mr. Lamb, Mr. O\u2019Connor said he would not support Ms. Pelosi.\u201cI think we need a wholesale change in leadership on both sides,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor said in an interview on Wednesday.Mr. O\u2019Connor described himself as a pragmatist focused on issues like health care and the economy. He did not leap at the chance to critique Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, though he pushed back on Mr. Trump\u2019s promised wall along the border with Mexico.The Balderson campaign signaled that Ms. Pelosi would be a central figure in the contest, a tactic Republicans used against Mr. Lamb.\u201cDanny O\u2019Connor and his Nancy Pelosi agenda are just completely out of step with the voters in this district,\u201d said Brad Shattuck, a strategist for the campaign.\u201cTroy is a conservative who wants to go up there and get something done,\u201d Mr. Shattuck said. \u201cAnd I think that juxtaposes with someone who just wants to go up there and support Nancy Pelosi and her agenda.\u201dThe district\u2019s significant suburban population \u2014 with many affluent, college-educated voters \u2014 will make it a noteworthy test case in the run-up to November. Among Ohio\u2019s 16 congressional districts, it has the highest median household income and the highest percentage of adults with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an opportunity for there to be kind of a Trump backlash in this district,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, who wrote a book about Ohio\u2019s presidential voting history. He said it was the kind of district filled with Republicans who might think that someone like George W. Bush, Mitt Romney or Mr. Kasich \u201cis a better fit for their sensibilities\u201d than Mr. Trump.But Mr. Kondik cautioned, \u201cI still think you\u2019d rather be the Republican in this district.\u201dThe winner of the special election will not have much job security. Mr. O\u2019Connor and Mr. Balderson each won two separate primaries on Tuesday, one for the special election and one for the general election in November. Regardless of the outcome in August, both candidates will appear on the ballot again in November when voters choose a representative for a full two-year term.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Softening His Tone, Calls for More Talks on Car Emissions", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump on Friday directed his administration to negotiate with California over a proposed rollback of fuel economy and tailpipe emissions standards, a move that could avert a damaging court battle with the potential to sow chaos in the auto industry.Mr. Trump\u2019s directive at the meeting grants a reprieve to automakers, who lobbied for a relaxation of rules aimed at cutting tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide \u2014 a major contributor to global warming \u2014 but in recent weeks became increasingly nervous that the zealousness of the proposed rollbacks would provoke a battle with California.It remains unclear whether administration officials and California can hope to reach a compromise.The sides are far apart, and, given previous statements by Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency head, it was unclear whether any negotiations would be \u201ca good-faith engagement or for show,\u201d said David Friedman, who served as acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration under President Barack Obama.A senior administration official said at least one auto executive suggested to Mr. Trump and his team that the federal government had tools at its disposal to maximize its leverage in those negotiations, including the flow of federal funding to the state, approval of California\u2019s next request for an emissions waiver and possible legal action against the state.Automakers hope to head off a wider legal battle, which could plunge the American auto industry into regulatory chaos, with California and 12 other states that follow its lead imposing a stricter set of fuel economy rules than the rest of the country.\u201cThis is a case of be careful what you wish for,\u201d said Jeremy Acevedo, manager of industry analysis at Edmunds, the auto research company. \u201cAt the start, it seemed like a great win for automakers. But California\u2019s really digging in their heels.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re now trying to navigate that relationship, which made this meeting so seminal,\u201d Mr. Acevedo said.Conservative voices close to the administration, however, are continuing to urge Mr. Trump to take a more forceful approach.As the E.P.A. proposes rolling back fuel economy standards, here\u2019s a look at how automakers have made their cars more efficient so far.Mr. Trump has previously pushed for an aggressive rollback, saying last March that the Obama-era rules \u201cwould have destroyed, or further destroyed, the auto industry.\u201d In exchange for action in reducing regulatory burdens, he had demanded that automakers open new plants and import fewer cars from outside the country \u2014 a demand he reiterated on Friday.\u201cWe\u2019re really talking about environmental control,\u201d he told reporters at the start of the meeting, \u201cand manufacturing of millions of more cars within the United States.\u201dAt stake are standards that would have required new cars and trucks to average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025. Adopted in 2012, the rules would have cut oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels over the lifetime of all the vehicles affected by the regulations and reduced carbon dioxide pollution by about six billion tons.Any proposal to revise the rules must still be reviewed by the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget and published in the federal register, then undergo a public comment period and may undergo further changes before being finalized.The heads of two of the auto industry\u2019s largest lobbying groups, Mitch Bainwol of the Auto Alliance and John Bozzella of Global Automakers, issued a joint statement after the meeting.\u201cWe thank President Trump for inviting us to the White House to discuss the automotive sector,\u201d they said. \u201cWe also appreciate the President\u2019s openness to a discussion with California on an expedited basis.\u201dHiroko Tabuchi reported from New York.

{"Headline": "Half a Cheer for Democracy in Lebanon", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bazzi is a journalist.Perhaps the most encouraging thing about the parliamentary elections on Sunday in Lebanon is that they were held at all after years of delay and political inertia, corruption, economic stagnation and foreign meddling.During the electoral campaign, few candidates or parties offered solutions to these systemic problems. Instead, most of the electioneering focused on mobilizing sectarian sentiments among Lebanon\u2019s 4.5 million people.Even with these sectarian appeals, a majority of voters stayed home. The turnout was 49 percent, dashing hopes that the Lebanese would embrace their first national vote in nine years. The election was originally scheduled for 2013, but the Lebanese Parliament extended its own term and postponed the balloting several times using the ruse that security concerns made it difficult to hold elections.A new law laid out a parliamentary map on Sunday that was different from that of past elections, dividing the country into 15 districts and 27 sub-districts, and establishing a complex new system of proportional representation that allowed voters to choose both a slate of candidates in larger districts and a preferred candidate running in their sub-districts. The new law, which replaced a winner-take-all system, was pitched by some Lebanese leaders as a way to enable independent and civil society groups to compete against established, largely sectarian-based parties and political bosses.The election did weaken Mr. Hariri, whose party, the Future Movement, lost more than a third of its parliamentary bloc, dropping to 21 seats from the 33 seats it won during the last election.Mr. Hariri is still positioned to return as prime minister and form a cabinet, but regional forces will shape the political jockeying that follows the election. Lebanon\u2019s sectarian political structure leads to a weak state, and it is often exploited by outside powers, including Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia.Most Lebanese leaders \u2014 who have built substantial networks of patronage through decades of war and corruption \u2014 are too invested in the system to change it. And the outsiders are resistant to reforms that could reduce their influence.Hezbollah\u2019s own patron, Iran, may apply pressure to delay the formation of a new government \u2014 and Mr. Hariri\u2019s return as prime minister \u2014 after President Trump backed out of the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Mr. Hariri\u2019s Saudi backers, especially the assertive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, might be emboldened by Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear agreement to once again challenge Hezbollah and Iranian influence in Lebanon.Since the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Lebanon has been one of the most bitterly contested playing fields in the regional proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Lebanon\u2019s consociational political structure \u2014 which seeks to balance the competing interests of 18 religious sects \u2014 makes it uniquely vulnerable to exploitation by outsiders.Under the country\u2019s unwritten National Pact, adopted when Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943, the president must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni, and the speaker of Parliament a Shiite.Seats in Parliament are divided equally among Muslims and Christians, then further subdivided among different sects. This arrangement has kept any one sect from assuming hegemony; but it also ensures, by pitting each sect against the others in a zero-sum race for political spoils, that they will continue trying.The division of power was based on a 1932 census, which showed Maronites as the majority in Lebanon. Since then, the government has refused to conduct a new census, fearing that it would upset the confessional equilibrium. By the 1960s, when Muslims began to outnumber Christians, Muslims demanded a new balance of power.When civil war broke out in 1975, the political imbalance prompted each of the major sects to form its own militias. As the war waned in 1989, Lebanon\u2019s political class negotiated the Taif Accord, a new power-sharing agreement that weakened the Maronite president and granted more authority to the Sunni prime minister and his cabinet. But the sectarian patronage network was left largely intact.The silver lining in the low turnout in the latest elections might be that the majority of Lebanese are disillusioned by a political system built on patronage and sectarian gerrymandering.By staying away from the polling booths, Lebanon\u2019s silent majority sent a clear message to the political class: a cosmetic change in election law is not enough. Lebanon needs a new, more democratic means of sharing power \u2014 one that is not as easily manipulated by sectarian leaders and foreign powers.Mohamad Bazzi, an associate professor of journalism at New York University, is the former Middle East bureau chief for Newsday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Next Privacy Battle in Europe Is Over This New Law", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new European data privacy legislation is so stringent that it could kill off data-driven online services and chill innovations like driverless cars, tech industry groups warn.If the current draft prevails, the law will require Skype, WhatsApp, iMessage, video games with player messaging and other electronic services that allow private interactions to obtain people\u2019s explicit permission before placing tracking codes on users' devices or collecting data about their communications.Industry and consumer advocates are essentially fighting over a contentious issue central to the post-Cambridge Analytica online economy: whether data-driven digital services represent more of a boon to consumers or the kind of surveillance that can threaten democracy.The ePrivacy Regulation will replace and broaden an older European Union directive \u2014 which covered traditional telecommunications like voice calls \u2014 by also covering digital communications like text messaging and video chat apps.The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users\u2019 electronic communications: obtaining consumers\u2019 explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.\u201cDo you really want that app to use your metadata? Do you really want them to read your content on a dating app?\u201d Ms. Sippel asked. \u201cConsumers need to get back control over what is happening with their lives and their data.\u201dBut tech industry groups and their supporters argue that ePrivacy\u2019s consent requirement and other provisions are so onerous that they would hinder innovations like smart cars, which automatically transmit safety information back to the manufacturer. And requiring companies to provide equal communications services to people who opt out of data mining, they say, could cause sites or apps that rely on data-driven advertising to start charging fees or close down.\u201cEvery stakeholder I have talked to from industry, from all sizes from the very biggest to the very smallest businesses, are unanimously opposed to this,\u201d he said.Tech companies and trade groups have waged a furious, multipronged lobbying campaign to shut down, or at least weaken, the legislation.Cisco, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, the American Chamber of Commerce, DigitalEurope and the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe, a digital advertising industry group, have all lobbied officials at the European Commission about ePrivacy, according to a lobbying database created by Transparency International EU, a nonprofit research group in Brussels.How much they are spending on the effort is unclear. While companies and trade groups that lobby European Commission officials must provide financial details on annual lobbying expenditures, they do not have to break out the spending by issue.Industry associations have also lobbied the Council of the European Union, whose leadership rotates every six months. For the ePrivacy law to be enacted, the Council must first come to its own consensus on the bill before negotiating the law\u2019s final language in a three-way discussion with the European Parliament and the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm.Elitsa Zlateva, a spokeswoman for the permanent representation of Bulgaria to the European Union, said her country\u2019s officials were committed to the bill\u2019s progress. She declined to provide names of other trade groups that the country\u2019s representatives had met with on ePrivacy.The \u201cBulgarian presidency acts as an honest broker,\u201d she wrote in an email, and works to balance the interests of European member states, citizens and business.Christian Borggreen, vice president for the computer industry group in Europe, said he hoped that the ePrivacy Regulation would not conflict with the G.D.P.R. and that it would \u201cadd meaningful privacy protection without unduly hurting digital innovation.\u201dMichela Palladino, director of European policy and government relations at the Developers Alliance, said of the ePrivacy bill\u2019s restrictions on handling user content and metadata: \u201cThat is something that is too extreme and will really cut potential business opportunities\u201d for many industries that rely on data.Ms. Sippel said hewing to industry opinions was impeding progress on the ePrivacy effort.\u201cIn my view, we have some weak governments on the Council that are not willing to get into trouble with industry,\u201d she said, emphasizing that she was expressing her opinion and not stating an official parliamentary position. \u201cSo, for the time being, they haven\u2019t found a common position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Anniversary of House Obamacare Repeal, Democrats Look to Extract a Price", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI think her vote is wildly unpopular among constituents in the district,\u201d Mr. Brindisi said. \u201cAnd what adds insult to injury is that she celebrated her vote by snapping selfies of herself at the White House, gleefully cheering a vote that would take health insurance away from thousands of her constituents.\u201dHouse passage of the Obamacare repeal bill left that chamber\u2019s Republicans in a no-win situation. They took the hard vote, but because the Senate failed to follow suit, no one can claim a victory. Now Democrats hope to extract a price. Far from the liability that the Affordable Care Act has been in past elections, Democrats believe health care will be a key advantage heading into this fall\u2019s midterm elections.Mr. Brindisi said the repeal bill, the American Health Care Act, would have had devastating effects on the district that Ms. Tenney represents in upstate New York, harming hospitals that are important to the local economy and diminishing access to opioid treatment.But in an interview last week, Ms. Tenney, a former state assemblywoman who is in her first term, showed no sign of regret.The House voted in May 2017 on a  health care bill to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act.\u201cThe real issue is, how are we going to make health care affordable again?\u201d she said. \u201cWe polled \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 twice,\u201d she added. \u201cPeople want Obamacare repealed in the majority in my district.\u201dOn one level, the passage of the House repeal bill was a political achievement for Republican lawmakers; after years of campaign promises, they could tell their political base that they had done what they had pledged to do, even if the Senate stumbled once the baton was handed over to that chamber.But viewed another way, the House repeal bill amounted to a political gift to Democrats. Opponents said its enactment would have left people with pre-existing medical conditions unable to afford health coverage and would have resulted in health plans that omit benefits that are currently required, like maternity care and mental health services. Republicans said Democrats\u2019 claims were exaggerated, if not false. But the bill never became law, and supporters have no way of getting real-world evidence to rebut them.Just this week, they gained an assist from an unlikely figure: Tom Price, Mr. Trump\u2019s former secretary of health and human services, who said that ending the requirement that most people have coverage, known as the individual mandate, would increase costs for people buying insurance.Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a former chairman of the House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, cast doubt on how much of an effect the repeal bill would have in midterm races.\u201cI don\u2019t think talking about a bill that didn\u2019t happen is particularly effective,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople punish you for things that you do successfully, not for things that never happen just because you cast a vote.\u201dMr. Cole suggested that a more significant risk stemmed from Republican voters who are disappointed that their party\u2019s lawmakers ultimately failed to repeal the health law despite years of promises. \u201cIt\u2019s more a matter of deflating our base than enraging the other side because they\u2019re already pretty enraged and energetic, anyway,\u201d he said.Then there is the question of how much health care will remain a prominent issue when last year\u2019s repeal effort is an increasingly distant memory.Mr. Kim, a former National Security Council staff member in the Obama White House, said he wants every voter to know about Mr. MacArthur\u2019s role, which landed him a speaking slot at the Rose Garden ceremony.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t just a yes vote,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cHe\u2019s got his name on it.\u201dMr. MacArthur said he was not worried.\u201cThe reality is I didn\u2019t come here to be a potted plant,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here to work on problems facing the American people, and health care costs are hurting my constituents.\u201dBut that Rose Garden ceremony remains a touchstone.Elissa Slotkin said she was contemplating a run for Congress when she saw her Republican congressman, Mike Bishop of Michigan, at that Rose Garden celebration.\u201cHe was smiling and beaming and proud and thrilled,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI turned to my husband and said, \u2018You do not get to do this. You don\u2019t get to ignore the public and vote against their interests and keep your job.\u2019\u201dMs. Slotkin, a former senior official in the Defense Department, jumped in. She is seen by the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm as a formidable challenger.Mr. Bishop bristled at his critics.\u201cIn order to win this, the Democrats have infused fear and panic, and they have done so by misrepresenting the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you need to do that to win, then count me out, because I would never do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Corrupt Leaders Are Falling Around the World. Will It Boost Economies?", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyAs the rogues\u2019 gallery of fallen world leaders grows, you might be tempted to conclude that ours is the most corrupt era in history. Early last month, the former South Korean president Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in prison and fined $17 million for bribery, extortion and abuse of power. That same day, the former South African president Jacob Zuma, forced to resign in February by his own party, appeared in court to face charges over a $2.5 billion arms deal. The next day came an even bigger blow: Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s former president and current front-runner in polls for October\u2019s presidential election, began serving a 12-year jail term on corruption charges \u2014 in a federal police building he himself inaugurated more than a decade ago.Lula is a casualty of what may be the largest corruption scandal ever. An octopuslike bribery scheme carried out by the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht has spawned investigations in more than a dozen countries, implicating leaders from Chile to Colombia, Mexico to Mozambique. (The scandal has also led to a $3.5 billion fine levied by the United States Justice Department against Odebrecht and inspired a new Netflix series.) In Peru alone, three former presidents are facing trial or serving jail time on Odebrecht-related charges.With the crisis still metastasizing, it was hard not to be cynical when, in mid-April, the region\u2019s presidents gathered in Lima for the Summit of the Americas to deliver high-minded speeches on this year\u2019s theme: \u201cDemocratic Governance Against Corruption.\u201d Donald Trump skipped the meeting, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his stead. It was a measure of the speed of these unfolding scandals that the White House couldn\u2019t keep up. Pence\u2019s official schedule initially included \u201ca banquet hosted by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru.\u201d The only problem: Kuczynski was forced to resign three weeks earlier, one day before he was to face certain impeachment on corruption charges.Behind all these grim headlines, however, lies a larger and more encouraging truth: Corruption is being exposed, denounced and prosecuted more vigorously, and at higher levels, than ever. In Latin America, at least, these are not just momentary flare-ups at the scandal du jour; they seem to be the rumblings of a historic shift. \u201cJudges, journalists and the public now have the strength to take on high-level corruption,\u201d says Kevin Casas-Zamora, a former vice president of Costa Rica and senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue. \u201cIt\u2019s not that corruption is getting worse or better, but that societies are more willing and able to uncover it.\u201dThe \u201csand\u201d argument, however, has gained far more traction in recent years. \u201cAt this point, the evidence is fairly settled that corruption is a drag on long-term growth,\u201d Casas-Zamora says. The World Bank estimates that bribes siphon off around $1.5 trillion from the global economy each year \u2014 about 2 percent of world\u2019s gross domestic product and 10 times the value of overseas development aid. Much of that money, the bank says, goes into the pockets and foreign bank accounts of elites rather than into the public investments \u2014 schools, courts, hospitals, roads \u2014 that are needed to lift economies over the long haul. By degrading social norms and civic virtues, not to mention the rule of law on which investment depends, corruption rots the foundations of a healthy economy.For citizens in the developing world, this is not an academic debate. They see the costs of corruption every day: in shoddy public services; in \u201cpublic servants\u201d suddenly driving luxury cars; in small businesses pushed into the informal economy out of fear that taxes and laws will be unfairly applied. Corruption is, in effect, a regressive tax. According to the World Bank, poor families in developing countries often spend twice as much of their income on bribes as high-income families. As the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, put it: \u201cEvery dollar that a corrupt official or a corrupt business person puts in their pocket is a dollar stolen from a pregnant woman who needs health care; or from a girl or a boy who deserves an education; or from communities that need water, roads and schools.\u201d He concluded: \u201cIn the developing world, corruption is Public Enemy No. 1.\u201dJust a few years ago, Peru was growing so fast that it was considered, with Mexico, Chile and Colombia, one of the \u201cPacific Pumas.\u201d But the collapse of commodity prices hit hard \u2014 Peru depends heavily on mining \u2014 and the Odebrecht payoffs in exchange for major infrastructure projects laid bare the country\u2019s vast inequalities and injustices. Corruption has plagued Latin America since the days of colonial occupation, but in this case, the cure hurts almost as much as the disease. The Odebrecht scandal has paralyzed construction ventures across Peru, says Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, \u201cbut it is also making the government more prudent for new public investment projects.\u201d It\u2019s bitter medicine, but if it helps Peru begin to overcome its culture of corruption, the economy will be far healthier in the long run.A central driver of the anticorruption movement is a young generation of judges and prosecutors armed with greater independence and, in some cases, tough new transparency laws. Many countries in Latin America have adopted stricter accountability laws in the last two decades, though only Brazil has tested them effectively. S\u00e9rgio Moro, the lead prosecutor in Brazil\u2019s biggest corruption cases, has leaned on two other new tools, plea bargains and whistle-blower protections, to persuade underlings to testify against top bosses and leaders, including Lula. \u201cTwenty-five years ago, there were no rules, no conventions, no jurisdictions against corruption,\u201d says Delia Ferreira Rubio, chair of the global anticorruption group Transparency International. It\u2019s the collective responsibility of governments, civil society and businesses, Ferreira Rubio says, \u201cto ensure that impunity does not prevail.\u201dAfter an earlier wave of corruption scandals led to the fall of presidents in Brazil and Peru, daily life resumed, and corruption only worsened. Will this time be different? The social and legal progress over the last 20 years may signal a tectonic shift. But corruption fights back, too. In some countries, threatened elites are trying to curb civil society, weaken prosecutors and attack the press. Even top prosecutors say corruption cannot be rooted out with only court cases, even ones that break the spell of impunity. The goal is to build \u201csystems of integrity\u201d throughout society. And that requires commitment greater than the platitudes emanating from the Summit of the Americas. Such a prospect may be years, even generations, away. But the biggest psychological obstacle may have fallen already. As Casas-Zamora says, \u201cThe sense of fatalism about corruption is disappearing.\u201dBrook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mo Salah of Liverpool Breaks Down Cultural Barriers, One Goal at a Time", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIVERPOOL, England \u2014 Mohamed Salah\u2019s routine is familiar now. As the Liverpool Football Club stadium erupts joyously around him, celebrating yet another of the Egyptian\u2019s goals, he runs to the fans closest to him, arms outstretched. He stands stock still, soaking in the adulation.Once his teammates have congratulated him, he walks slowly back to the center circle. \u201cThen there is this pause,\u201d said Neil Atkinson, host of The Anfield Wrap, a Liverpool fans\u2019 podcast, and a regular at the stadium.His faith \u2014 and his public displays of it \u2014 have also made him a figure of considerable social and cultural significance. At a time when Britain is fighting rising Islamophobia, when government policy has been to create a \u201chostile environment\u201d for illegal immigrants, he is a North African and a Muslim who is not just accepted in Britain, but adored.The Premier League, and European soccer in general, has always been popular in Egypt, but now thousands pack Cairo\u2019s coffee shops and shisha bars to watch Liverpool\u2019s games.\u201cNo Egyptian has done what Mohamed has done, which is why his rise is so important to the public,\u201d said Ahmed Atta, an Egyptian soccer analyst. \u201cEveryone is watching the Premier League now. Social media is awash with pictures of him.\u201dMr. Salah\u2019s popularity is not just the result of his prowess on the field; just as important is his philanthropy. \u201cHe is constantly donating money to charities and to his hometown,\u201d said Said Elshishiny, the coach who discovered his talent as a child in Nagrig, a town in the Nile Delta. \u201cIt is enough to make anyone adore him.\u201dThat he sees no need to disguise his faith only fuels his popularity. \u201cPeople love the fact that he is not scared of kneeling in prayer in front of everyone in a non-Muslim country at a time of rising Islamophobia,\u201d Mr. Atta said. \u201cIt is like a victory to them.\u201dIt feels the same way to the Muslim community \u2014 drawn largely from Syrian, Yemeni and Bangladeshi backgrounds \u2014 on Merseyside, the region that includes Liverpool. \u201cMuslims are under pressure\u201d in Britain, said Abu Usamah Atthababi, imam of Al Masra mosque in Toxteth, an inner-city district of Liverpool.\u201cThere is not only evidence that it is on the rise,\u201d said Mr. Versi, \u201cbut it is becoming more normalized: It is becoming acceptable to express Islamophobic sentiments in mainstream circles.\u201dThe toxicity of the dialogue around Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, as well as the virulent anti-immigrant stance of the right-wing news media, Mr. Versi said, contributed to an environment in which \u201cpeople are more comfortable expressing bigoted views.\u201dLiverpool has seen problems, too. The city considers itself more welcoming than many places in Britain: a \u201ccity of outsiders, an anti-establishment city,\u201d as Mr. Atkinson put it. Liverpool has not always enjoyed the easiest of relationships with the rest of the country, he said, adding that \u201cit maybe knows more than most what it is to be tarred as \u2018other.\u2019 \u201dStill, the police had to increase security at mosques in Liverpool in the wake of the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. And a mosque in Birkenhead, on the opposite bank of the Mersey River from Liverpool, was vandalized after the July 7 attack in London in 2005. The Merseyside police force recorded a 75 percent increase in hate crimes from 2012 to 2016.But the fact that it is a Muslim being feted is significant, too. \u201cEvery Muslim is proud of him,\u201d said Ali Aden, selling groceries and a surprisingly large range of perfumes from his stall outside Al Rahma Mosque in Liverpool. \u201cSometimes, we are made to feel like second-class citizens. For someone to come from the Middle East to our city is a great source of pride.\u201d\u201cThings like that can break down barriers,\u201d he said, pointing out that the simple sight of seeing Mr. Salah bow and reflect after scoring a goal can help to \u201cremove the stigma\u201d that some may attach to the sight of a Muslim praying.\u201cHe can help to bridge the Muslim community and the rest of the city,\u201d Mr. Atthababi said. \u201cHe can show people that we are closer to Salah than we are to extremists.\u201dTo others, though, the message that Mr. Salah\u2019s success sends to Muslims is just as important, because he made his triumphant return to England four years after being buried on the bench for a season at Chelsea.\u201cHe gives more confidence to the younger generation especially,\u201d Dr. Albarbandi said. \u201cYou can see and feel the impact. They are more active, more outgoing, their morale is higher. He has shown that if you engage, if you work hard and prove yourself, nobody is going to stop you praying, nobody is going to stop you wearing a beard. People will respect you, whoever you are.\u201dOutside Al Rahma mosque, Abdul Aziz and Mohamed Yaffe were hurrying to Friday prayers. Mr. Yaffe was happy to talk about Mr. Salah; Mr. Yaffe is a Liverpool fan, enamored as anyone with the team\u2019s star. Mr. Aziz, though, demurred a little. \u201cThese are difficult questions to answer,\u201d he said.Mr. Yaffe looked at him sympathetically. \u201cHe\u2019s an Everton fan,\u201d he said, by way of explanation, referring to Liverpool\u2019s city rivals. Mr. Aziz smiled. As long as Mr. Salah does not score against Everton, he said, he is happy for him, happy for what he is doing for the community.That is one gap Mr. Salah has already bridged. \u201cFaith comes first,\u201d Mr. Aziz said.Nour Youssef contributed reporting from Cairo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Truckers\u2019 Strike Paralyzes Brazil as President Courts Investors", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Brazil is roaring back, at least according to President Michel Temer.That was the message Mr. Temer\u2019s government sought to convey in a series of upbeat statements issued over the past couple of weeks leading up to a foreign investment forum that begins Tuesday in S\u00e3o Paulo.Yet a weeklong standoff between striking truck drivers and the government has provided a stark counternarrative, illustrating the shaky recovery of Brazil\u2019s economy, Latin America\u2019s largest, and the widespread disdain Brazilians have toward their ruling class.Hundreds of trucker roadblocks sealed off highways across the country as a protest against rising fuel prices ground Brazil\u2019s economy to a halt in recent days. Gas stations from S\u00e3o Paulo, the financial capital, to Manaus, in the heart of the Amazon, have run out of fuel.Dozens of flights have been canceled, fresh food supplies in supermarkets have dwindled and millions of chickens and pigs have been culled because of a lack of animal feed. On Monday, many schools and universities suspended classes.An announcement by Mr. Temer on Thursday that he had struck a deal with the strike leaders proved premature. Roadblocks were maintained through the weekend and oil workers announced that they intended to go on strike this week, raising the prospect of a deepening crisis that has laid bare the weakness of Mr. Temer\u2019s lame-duck government ahead of a presidential election in October.Over the weekend, Mr. Temer issued an order authorizing the military to clear roads using force, if necessary, a move that drew condemnation from human rights groups.But after that threat failed to bring the strike to an end, Mr. Temer appeared weary as he announced in a televised statement on Sunday that the government would subsidize the cost of diesel to drop the price at the pump by 12 percent. He also said truck drivers would pay less in tolls and get more government contracts. The measures were striking concessions by a government that has sought to rein in spending as Brazil emerges from a long, crippling recession.\u201cOur fundamental and correct concern is with the truckers and I understand their difficulties,\u201d said Mr. Temer, the most unpopular president in modern Brazilian history, according to polls. \u201cWe all understand the natural difficulties of truckers in their work.\u201dFuel costs have soared in Brazil as oil prices have risen globally, and the real, Brazil\u2019s currency, has depreciated. Under the current policy, the price of diesel fuel has fluctuated on an almost daily basis. As part of the latest agreement, diesel price adjustments will occur on a monthly basis.Union leaders have urged drivers to accept the latest deal. But on Monday, as fuel tankers escorted by police officers and soldiers began to restock some gas stations, many protesters held firm.\u201cThe government has now met all of the demands in relation to diesel prices, and at a very high cost to public coffers,\u201d said Laura Barbosa de Carvalho, a professor of economics at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, who pointed out that taxpayers would ultimately pick up the tab. \u201cBut the big question is: Is this movement still focused on the price of diesel or does it have a bigger component that wants to destabilize the country?\u201dMr. Temer\u2019s speech on Sunday night prompted Brazilians frustrated by what they see as a failed government to honk their horns and bang pots from their windows in protest in many cities across the country. It was a sign of the mistrust and outright hostility many Brazilians feel toward the president.A poll published by the Globo website on Monday showed that 55 percent of Brazilians disapproved of the strike, but a full 95 percent disapproved of the way Mr. Temer has handled it.The strike has been the most disruptive period of unrest since Mr. Temer helped lead an effort to impeach his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, in 2016. Since then, Mr. Temer has spent much of his political capital fending off accusations of corruption and obstruction of justice stemming from the wide-ranging graft scandal known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash.On Monday morning, roughly one hundred protesters gathered at an oil refinery on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, which has been one of the focal points of the strike. Truckers were a minority at the demonstration. But scores of unemployed oil workers, motorcycle couriers and public transportation workers said they wanted their grievances addressed as well.\u201cThis started with the truckers, but it reached millions,\u201d said Alexsandro Faria, 39, an unemployed scaffold builder who worked at the refinery for seven years before being laid off in 2016. \u201cThis is the best moment to call attention to our demands. If we only stay on our sofas, complaining about corruption, it won\u2019t work.\u201dSeveral strikers have voiced support for a military intervention, arguing that the country was safer and more orderly during the dictatorship that lasted from 1964 to 1985. While support for a step that drastic is by no means widespread among strikers, calls for the military to step in have riled up crowds at protest sites over the past week.\u201cIt isn\u2019t just about the truckers anymore,\u201d said Antonio Marcos Rocha, a proponent of a military intervention who was wearing a Brazilian flag around his waist as he distributed free sandwiches to a crowd outside the refinery. \u201cIt\u2019s against corruption.\u201dAs the protests have struck a chord with many Brazilians, politicians across the political spectrum have taken aim at the increasingly isolated and weakened president.Leftist leaders, who have traditionally championed workers\u2019 rights, and right-wing politicians both sought to portray themselves as champions of the truck drivers as the government threatened to prosecute business leaders who have backed the strike.\u201cOnce more, the Temer administration uses the military to hide its incompetence,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cWith the increase in fuel prices, society is paying prices that are too high for the mistakes of a government that does everything to save its own skin and keep itself in power.\u201dThe timing could hardly be worse for Mr. Temer as he sets out to promote Brazil\u2019s economic recovery before would-be foreign investors while defending the legacy of his two years in office.Mr. Temer was recently mocked for unveiling a slogan that suggested that Brazil had advanced 20 years in the span of two. Critics were quick to point out that a slight variation in punctuation made the slogan convey that Brazil had in fact regressed two decades in two years.But Mr. Temer sought to strike a bullish tone on Monday as investors arrived in S\u00e3o Paulo, where fuel trucks have needed police escorts to resupply airports.\u201cBrazil is opening to the world and the world is reconnecting with Brazil,\u201d he said in a statement prepared for the event. He noted that on his watch, inflation has dropped and interest rates have fallen to 6.5 percent from 14.25 percent, and investor confidence has begun to grow in his market-friendly policies.The economy has pulled out of recession, but the recovery has been tenuous. The value of the currency has slumped to a two-year low, in large part because of uncertainty over Brazil\u2019s political future. Voters have turned their backs on the traditional parties mired in the corruption investigation.Mr. Temer is set to leave office having failed to pass critical structural changes he pushed for, including an overhaul of the bloated pension system.While truck drivers weigh their options, oil workers unions have announced a three-day strike starting on Wednesday to demand, among other things, a reduction of fuel prices and the firing of Pedro Parente, the president of the state-run oil company, Petrobras.\u201cThe government has tried to sell this idea that it solved the country\u2019s economic problems,\u201d Ms. Carvalho, the economics professor, said. \u201cThis crisis is evidence that it was never true.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Democrats\u2019 Midterm Dilemma", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistI think that many prominent elected Democrats have tried to follow this advice. The spirit of the activist Resistance is certainly visible in Congress, but legislatively the party\u2019s leaders have mostly battled Trump the way they would have battled any Republican, and around the country the party\u2019s successful nominees have focused as much on unpopular aspects of the Republican agenda as on Trump\u2019s various grotesqueries.This decline reflects the fact that in the just-the-policy debate that Zingales recommended, Trump now has three advantages. First, he\u2019s presiding over the best economy in 10, 15, maybe 20 years. Second, his foreign policy, however blunder-rich, keeps failing to produce the feared descents into war \u2014 the main metric by which voters tend to judge success or failure overseas. Third, his party has wisely stopped trying to pass major new legislation, abandoning an unpopular agenda in favor of behind-the-scenes deregulation and judicial confirmations.Had Republicans actually passed their wildly unpopular Obamacare replacement, their current position would be much weaker. But because they failed they have less of a record to answer for, and so unlike Democrats defending the then-unpopular Obamacare amid a bad economy in 2010, G.O.P. candidates in 2018 will probably be running as standpatters amid low unemployment. This is not the sort of visionary agenda that sets op-ed hearts aflutter, but it allows Republicans to duck away from their many unpopular policies and simply advertise themselves as stewards of prosperity \u2014 which in a normal election would probably be a ticket to a decent-enough showing.I offer the first possibility only theoretically; I know that the current alignment of forces in the party makes a move rightward all but unimaginable. But the second possibility, #fulltiltpopulism, is already being tried out by Bernie Sanders and a clutch of ambitious senators, who are offering single payer and a job guarantee as the Big Ideas that will crush Trumpism and deliver a new Democratic era.If that\u2019s the case, then the Democrats are likely to be pushed inexorably toward precisely the place that Zingales warned them not to end up \u2014 toward an electoral battle in which the policy stakes seem to diminish, and the awfulness of Trump himself becomes once again central to their message.Like Zingales, I think a campaign that harps too much on the president\u2019s outrages risks playing into Trump\u2019s hands. But there are smarter and dumber ways to go about it. The dumb ways would be either to just rehash Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed \u201clook how terrible this guy is\u201d messaging or to turn the rhetorical dial all the way to 11 and talk constantly about treason and fascism and the looming fall of the republic.Of course this message is itself provisional and self-limiting. But limits are what ambitious Democrats may have to live with if neither a disaster nor a downturn nor a true Robert Mueller bombshell intervenes.And limits are probably what they should have expected all along. The rule of the age of Trump, after all, is this: It is always possible to beat him. It is never so easy as it looks.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korea\u2019s Big Moment Is Upended by Trump", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The moment had been portrayed by North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, as a show of good faith ahead of his meeting with President Trump: the destruction of North Korea\u2019s only known nuclear test site.With foreign journalists watching on Thursday, the North Koreans detonated explosives to destroy tunnels and buildings at the site in the country\u2019s remote mountains.Mr. Trump\u2019s move blindsided the North Koreans so completely that the invited foreign journalists learned about the cancellation on their smartphones \u2014 even before some of their hosts did. One of the journalists, Will Ripley from CNN, read the text of Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal letter to their official North Korean chaperones on the return train ride from the remote nuclear test site, Punggye-ri.\u201cI can tell you there was a real sense of shock,\u201d Mr. Ripley said in a phone interview with CNN. \u201cThey immediately got up and left.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s letter to Mr. Kim attributed the cancellation to what the American president called the \u201ctremendous anger and open hostility\u201d displayed by North Korean officials in recent statements. But the timing of the letter coincided almost precisely with North Korea\u2019s public relations effort to present itself as transparent and flexible on the nuclear issue.North Korea said on Friday that it was still willing to give Mr. Trump \u201ctime and opportunity\u201d to reconsider his decision, according to a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.North Korea allowed a select group of journalists from Britain, China, Russia, South Korea and the United States to watch its engineers detonate blasts in the tunnels in Punggye-ri, where the country has conducted all six of its nuclear tests. No independent outside nuclear monitors were invited to verify the dismantlement of the site.In the ceremony on Thursday, North Korea set off explosives in three of its four tunnels at the Punggye-ri site, according to dispatches by reporters at the scene. The fourth tunnel had already been closed for fear of contamination after the North\u2019s first nuclear test in 2006.The North Koreans also blew up test-observation facilities, as well as barracks for site personnel and a metal foundry, the reports said.Two dozen international journalists were invited to witness explosives rigged inside the tunnels, and they were then escorted outside to viewing decks 500 yards away, where they filmed the detonations.North Korea invited mostly TV journalists to ensure that its action would be broadcast worldwide.Even before Mr. Trump canceled the summit meeting, some analysts feared the moves would be reversible \u2014 as when the North disabled and then restarted a nuclear reactor years ago. But Thursday\u2019s reported demolition at the test site was the first concrete step North Korea had taken under Mr. Kim toward what Washington had been hoping would be a complete nuclear dismantlement.It is still not known whether the country will give up its nuclear arsenal \u2014 an uncertainty that has only intensified now that the much-anticipated meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim has been canceled.Since no weapons experts were present Thursday, it is not even clear whether North Korea destroyed all of the tunnels at the test site, or if the explosions would prevent the site from being used again.When Mr. Kim met the leaders of South Korea and China in recent weeks, he told them he was willing to discuss relinquishing his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal in return for security guarantees, the lifting of sanctions and other incentives from the United States.But North Korea abruptly changed its tone last week, warning that Mr. Kim would not meet Mr. Trump if Washington insisted on its quick and \u201cunilateral nuclear abandonment\u201d without offering incentives.Some analysts had played down the significance of North Korea\u2019s decision to shut down the site. They said that after six tests, all conducted in deep tunnels, the site had most likely caved in and become too unstable for another test.But when he met with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea last month, Mr. Kim rebuffed skeptics, saying that at the time, the Punggye-ri site still had two functioning tunnels where nuclear tests could be conducted.Other analysts cautioned that the North might be shuttering the site in a way that could allow it to be reopened quickly.But Mr. Wright called the development on Thursday \u201ca meaningful and pretty dramatic action nonetheless.\u201d It could take the North months or longer to reverse the disabling of the facilities at the site, he said.\u201cDismantling the nuclear test ground was done in such a way as to make all the tunnels of the test ground collapse by explosion and completely close the tunnel entrances, and at the same time, explode some guard facilities and observation posts on the site,\u201d the North\u2019s Nuclear Weapons Institute said in a statement.The institute said there was no leakage of radioactive materials during the explosions. It said that the entire site would be closed after further removal of aboveground structures and personnel, adding that North Korea was committed to building \u201ca nuclear-free peaceful world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Out of Good Options for Venezuela", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Noriega is a former assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs.Last week at a conference in Miami, the director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council, Juan Cruz, took aim at the regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela.Rather than fear a coup, the international community should encourage all Venezuelans \u2014 including soldiers \u2014 to restore democracy.President Trump has denounced Mr. Maduro and urged his counterparts in the region to take more concrete measures to press for change. But the United States cannot lead from behind when it comes to confronting the Venezuelan cabal that is managed by Cuba, bankrolled by China, armed by Russia, and exploited by Iran, Hezbollah and Colombian narco-terrorists. If the United States regards Mr. Maduro\u2019s government as an illegitimate, criminal regime that threatens regional stability it should act accordingly.While the Treasury Department has applied targeted sanctions against Mr. Maduro, Vice President Tareck El Aissami, and dozens of other senior officials implicated in human rights abuses and corruption, sanctions are no substitute for proactive engagement.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should empower a new team of American diplomats to make the case for change in Venezuela.The United States should break off diplomatic relations with Caracas and recognize members of the democratically elected National Assembly as the only legitimate representatives of the Venezuelan people.Washington should reveal the results of prolonged criminal investigations into Mr. El Aissami, who is suspected of narcotics trafficking and having ties to terrorism, and into Diosdado Cabello, a top regime official suspected of running a cocaine cartel with Venezuelan military officers. Issuing or unsealing indictments in such cases will help to expose the dangerous narcostate in Caracas.In keeping with that judgment, the Assembly should demand that members of the military comply with their constitutional duty to restore democratic order. And officers should be assured that if they move to oust Mr. Maduro their families and futures will be safeguarded, and the armed forces will be restored as an apolitical, professional institution.And to ensure that power will be passed promptly to legitimate civilian authorities, members of the Assembly should establish a process for designating an interim successor to Mr. Maduro. They also should form an impartial electoral council to plan and conduct free and fair presidential elections under international supervision.Finally, Venezuela\u2019s democratic leaders should plan for receiving and distributing humanitarian assistance and reactivating social services. They must develop strategies for jump-starting and sustaining the recovery of the private economy. Transitional leaders should start a global effort to locate and claim billions of dollars looted from the Venezuelan people by corrupt officials.If the military were to depose Mr. Maduro tomorrow, the Venezuelan people would likely regard it as a rescue mission more than a coup. Even within the military, regime insiders have told me, no more than 20 percent of the soldiers, whose own families are suffering from hunger and repression, would defend Mr. Maduro.President Trump\u2019s team has an extraordinary opportunity in Venezuela to take the lead to advance democratic values, defend American security, and confront narcotrafficking through a strategy that could unite America\u2019s political parties and most of our American neighbors. It is a tough challenge, but well worth the effort.Roger F.

A year later, there were warrants for his arrest for his longtime support of the Gulenist movement, believed by some to be behind the deadly, failed 2016 coup to topple the authoritarian regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a former friend and political ally.No one, it seemed, knew where Mr. Sukur went. We found him hiding in plain sight near the Stanford campus, running a high-end cafe and bakery that features, among other items, a selection of Turkish food and coffees.In Turkey, during the good years, Mr. Sukur would be mobbed by fans. In Palo Alto, most customers do not recognize the man clearing dishes or bringing food and drinks to their table.A decade ago, about when Mr. Sukur retired from soccer, Mr. Erdogan was steering Turkey toward the European Union. Mr. Sukur was elected to Parliament in 2011 as part of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party.But in recent years, Mr. Erdogan has clamped down on perceived threats \u2014 the military, courts, media, even the internet. Tens of thousands of journalists, academics and political opponents have been detained.Mr. Sukur left Parliament, quit the party and quietly came to California to visit friends, he said. He soon decided to build a life in the Bay Area. He bought a share of Tuts Cafe and Bakery, which was under construction in downtown Palo Alto, and his wife and their three children, now ages 12, 16 and 18, later joined him.After the coup, Mr. Sukur\u2019s houses and bank accounts in Turkey were seized, he said. His elderly father was jailed for months. Mr. Sukur presumes that he will never see his parents again. He does not know if he will ever return to Turkey.Still, he considers himself far luckier than the Turks who find themselves under the thumb of Mr. Erdogan and swept up by the political upheaval. His long-range plan is not to run bakeries, but to coach soccer and build sports academies \u2014 something he always thought he would do in Turkey, with his fame and wealth.\u201cLife is not where you live,\u201d Mr. Sukur said over a plate of Turkish meatballs. \u201cIt\u2019s what you do where you live.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\u201cI wanted to be true to the spirit of graffiti and street art: vandalism, ambition, rebellion,\u201d Mr. Gastman said. \u201cWe hope this show continues to legitimize this art form and shines a light on the people who have dedicated and risked their lives for their passion.\u201d\u201cBeyond the Streets\u201d runs through July 6.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

Does That Make Them Killers?", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "Prosecutors are increasingly treating overdose deaths as homicides, but they aren\u2019t just going after dealers. Friends, family and fellow users are going to prison.Supported byHIBBING, Minn. \u2014 In West Virginia, a woman woke after a day of drug use to find her girlfriend\u2019s lips blue and her body limp.In Florida, a man and his girlfriend bought what they thought was heroin. It turned out to be something more potent, fentanyl. She overdosed and died.In Minnesota, a woman who shared a fentanyl patch with her fianc\u00e9 woke after an overdose to find he had not survived.None of these survivors intended to cause a death. In fact, each could easily have been the one who ended up dead. But all were charged with murder.As overdose deaths mount, prosecutors are increasingly treating them as homicide scenes and looking to hold someone criminally accountable. Using laws devised to go after drug dealers, they are charging friends, partners and siblings. The accused include young people who shared drugs at a party and a son who gave his mother heroin after her pain medication had been cut off. Many are fellow users, themselves struggling with addiction.Such cases are becoming more common even as the role of the criminal justice system in combating drug abuse has become hotly contested, and even as many prosecutors \u2014 including those who pursue overdose death cases \u2014 say they embrace the push to treat addiction as a public health crisis rather than a crime.Overdose prosecutions, they say, are simply one tool in a box that should include prevention and treatment. But there is no consensus on their purpose. Some believe they will reduce the flow of drugs into their communities, deter drug use or help those with addiction \u201chit bottom.\u201d To others, the cases are not meant to achieve public policy goals, but as a balm for grieving families or punishment for a callous act.\u201cI look at it in a real micro way,\u201d said Pete Orput, the chief prosecutor in Washington County outside Minneapolis. \u201cYou owe me for that dead kid.\u201dWho owes whom for what is less clear in the case of the Malcolm family in Breckenridge, Colo., where Michael Malcolm\u2019s younger son was charged in the overdose death of his older brother, with whom he shared drugs purchased on the internet. The cost of prosecution and incarceration, Mr. Malcolm said, would have been better spent on addiction treatment that the family could not afford. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like blaming the leaves on the tree, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about the roots?\u201dIn 15 states where data was available, The New York Times found more than 1,000 prosecutions or arrests in accidental overdose deaths since 2015. Between 2015 and 2017, the number of cases nearly doubled. Dozens more cases were documented in news reports. In all, overdose prosecutions were found in 36 states, with charges ranging from involuntary manslaughter to first-degree murder.In Minnesota, the number of such cases \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cmurder by overdose\u201d \u2014 quadrupled over a decade. Pennsylvania went from 4 cases in 2011 to 171 last year after making it easier to prosecute.A few cases hinged on whether one person injected the other. But in others, the accused may not have even been present when the drugs were taken. Some defendants had tried to save the life of the victims by calling 911, attempting C.P.R. or administering naloxone, an overdose-reversal medication. Prosecutors need not show that the death was intentional, only that the accused provided the drugs or helped the victim obtain them.In Pennsylvania two years ago, Caleb Smith, an aspiring doctor who had just completed a master\u2019s degree in biomedical sciences, gave his girlfriend what he thought was Adderall, purchased on the internet, but was actually fentanyl.After he was charged in her death, he committed suicide.When Kimberly Elkins needed relief from chronic pain, her fianc\u00e9, Aaron Rost, would tape a fentanyl patch to her chest or upper arm.But when the couple wanted to get high, they shared the patch, swallowing the gel inside. Both were unemployed in Hibbing, a town in the remote Iron Range of northern Minnesota whose economy is bound to the global price of ore. On Facebook, Mr. Rost listed his job as \u201cgetting my life straight.\u201dOn a Saturday in December 2015, Ms. Elkins tore off a piece of patch, and Mr. Rost tucked it in his mouth as he left the house to go hunting. That afternoon she woke up in the hospital. The couple had overdosed \u2014 she in the laundry room, he at the door, dressed in bright orange and still holding his bow.Mr. Rost, she learned, had not survived. He was 36. When the police came to take her statement, it never occurred to her that his death would become a criminal case.Back home, mourning Mr. Rost, she took all the pills she could find and washed them down with vodka. At the hospital, Ms. Elkins promised her adult son she would get sober, then checked in to a nearby crisis center.When the police came there to arrest her, two months after Mr. Rost\u2019s funeral, on murder charges, she thought it was a mistake. \u201cWhat are they talking about?\u201d she asked a friend. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill Aaron.\u201dMark S. Rubin, the county attorney who brought charges against Ms. Elkins, compared overdose prosecutions to fatal collisions, saying that prosecuting those involved was \u201cpainful\u201d but \u201cpart of our responsibility.\u201d\u201cPeople agree, you know, there\u2019s nobody forcing someone to take the controlled substance. But somebody might agree to take it from their friend or their boyfriend or girlfriend and they end up dying because of it,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cWe feel that constitutes a crime of possibly murder in the third degree, but at least manslaughter in the second degree.\u201dMs. Elkins, now 49, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and is serving a four-year sentence at a prison in Shakopee, 200 miles from home. She arrived out of breath for an interview in the visiting room, apologizing for being late. The dark hollows that circled her eyes in her arrest mug shot had faded, and her initial bewilderment at being accused had given way to the reality of prison drabs and a metal bunk.\u201cI was like no, this isn\u2019t a mistake anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I struggle really hard with this, is trying to find my responsibility in it.\u201dAfter her arrest, family and friends debated that very question on Mr. Rost\u2019s Facebook page.\u201cHow the hell can u sit there and blame her for it all considering whether she gave it to him or not he still had the choice,\u201d one wrote, calling Mr. Rost\u2019s sister, who supported the prosecution of Ms. Elkins, \u201cheartless.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m heartless?\u201d the sister responded. \u201cI had to plan a funeral for a 36-year-old man.\u201dThe concept of overdose prosecutions took hold after the cocaine-related death in 1986 of Len Bias, the college basketball star, two days after he was drafted by the Boston Celtics. A friend, who called 911 when Mr. Bias collapsed, was accused of providing the cocaine, but was acquitted.Soon after, states began passing so-called Len Bias or \u201cdrug delivery resulting in death\u201d laws. Louisiana made it second-degree murder. Pennsylvania created a crime punishable by up to 40 years in prison. Congress passed the sweeping 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which included a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years for federal cases in which drugs resulted in death or serious injury.The Len Bias laws were supposed to go after drug dealers \u2014 \u201cgreed-soaked mutants,\u201d Howell Heflin of Alabama called them on the Senate floor.But the role of dealer is far less clear cut than lawmakers envisioned. The legal definition of drug dealing, or \u201cdistribution,\u201d typically covers behavior that is common for even casual users, including sharing, giving drugs away or getting reimbursed for a buy. Under complicity laws, helping to arrange a deal can be treated the same as dealing.Unlike child endangerment or \u201csocial host\u201d laws aimed at holding parents responsible for underage consumption, Len Bias laws make adults criminally liable for the actions of other adults.Among groups of regular drug users, on any given day the role of \u201cdealer\u201d might be filled by whoever happens to have gas money, a connection to a supplier or a working phone.In order to gain a better sense of where defendants fit on the user-dealer continuum, The Times looked to Pennsylvania, where overdose prosecutions have soared since a change in the law in 2011 made it unnecessary to prove that the accused had malice toward the victim. The Times examined drug-related death cases filed in criminal court in the first half of last year \u2014 82 cases in all, with 80 defendants.At least 59 of the accused were drug users themselves, according to police reports, court filings and interviews with law enforcement officials and defense lawyers. Roughly half had a relationship with the victim other than that of dealer. That group included six boyfriends, one girlfriend, a cousin, a brother and a son.A few of those charged had tried to save the victims. (Good Samaritan laws protect those who call for help from drug possession charges, but generally not homicide charges.)And while some people say there is never a good reason to help someone obtain drugs, particularly someone with addiction, others insist that there are many, including preventing withdrawal sickness or protecting them from the danger of a street buy.In one Pennsylvania case, a woman was headed for detox, but knew she would not be admitted unless she tested positive for drugs. Her boyfriend told the police he had not wanted her to drive to Baltimore to buy heroin alone, so he helped her arrange the deal and promised her $40 if she brought him along.He was not with her later that night when she overdosed and died, but he now faces a charge of drug delivery resulting in death.Pete Orput raised a coffee mug that proclaims, \u201cI am a ray of sunshine,\u201d with an expletive embedded therein. A recovering alcoholic, former Marine and now the prosecutor in Washington County outside Minneapolis, Mr. Orput is not given to sugarcoating.The opioid manufacturers he is suing are \u201ccorporate schlockmeisters.\u201d Prosecutors he deems overzealous are \u201cpolitical hacks.\u201d And as to whether overdose prosecutions have had an impact on the street, the answer is simple: \u201cNo.\u201dHe has found no reason to believe that such cases deter users or dealers, and says they rarely lead to high-level suppliers.But Mr. Orput still prosecutes in overdose cases. He has filed third-degree murder charges against three high school students who sold synthetic drugs to a classmate; a 21-year-old with a drug addiction who sold pills to a National Guardsman; and a woman who gave her husband methadone.He recognizes the shortcomings of this approach even as he feels compelled to take action. Each time his phone rings late at night with word of another death, he takes half an Ambien, smokes a couple of cigarettes in the bathroom, thinks about the grieving family he will soon meet \u2014 and then considers who will pay.Overdose prosecutions picked up steam under the Obama administration. In 2015, the National Heroin Task Force recommended that cases against heroin dealers whose drugs proved fatal should be prioritized for three reasons: the product might be particularly potent, the prosecutions would serve as a deterrent, and the attention would educate the public about the \u201csevere harm caused by heroin.\u201dDavid Hickton, co-chairman of the task force and a former United States attorney in the Western District of Pennsylvania, said he resisted attempts to make exceptions for drug distributors who suffered from addiction. \u201cYou\u2019re either a trafficker or you\u2019re a user,\u201d he said in an interview, adding, \u201cBut it\u2019s really not a bright line in the real world on the streets, I recognize that.\u201dIn recent years, the overdose prosecution idea has spread from district attorney to district attorney. One PowerPoint presentation instructed investigators to \u201ctreat an overdose scene as a homicide scene from the beginning\u201d; to look for remnants of naloxone, the revival agent, as evidence that someone was there when the victim died; and to use the victim\u2019s cellphone to set up another deal before the supplier finds out the victim is dead.Some cases are handed off to federal counterparts as the basis for larger takedowns, but more often the cases begin and end with bottom-rung sellers.Even hard-liners like John Walters, the director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George W. Bush, question the use of overdose homicide prosecutions without more systematic proof that they reduce drug use and emergency room visits. \u201cIn the absence of that, this is all gestures,\u201d Mr. Walters said.But many law enforcement officers hope that the cases act as a deterrent. When five people overdosed in two months in Twin Lakes, Wis. (population 6,000), the police charged 10 with reckless homicide. \u201cWe kind of want to put a bubble around our community and say we don\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019re not going to accept this here,\u201d said Adam Grosz, the chief of police.But one of his detectives, Katie Hall, said that the arrests had little effect on supply and demand: \u201cIf we can take one off, well, then they just go to the next one.\u201dParadoxically, the punitive approach to overdoses is underpinned by the same rationale as the push to treat addiction as a public health issue. In the prosecutorial worldview, a criminal investigation dignifies victims by treating their deaths as crimes instead of sad inevitabilities.\u201cThe analogy for me is the dead prostitute,\u201d Mr. Orput said. \u201cYou know, years ago, the cop would look and go, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what happens,\u2019 and that\u2019s what they\u2019d say with the junkie: \u2018That\u2019s why we don\u2019t do drugs.\u2019\u201dThe case of Nick Klamer and his childhood friend, Chase Thistle, shows just how hard it is to untangle the knot of blame in a fatal overdose.Mr. Klamer\u2019s death from heroin sent his father, Don Klamer, into a torture of regret and self-reproach. \u201cI was the one that dropped the ball,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the one that was supposed to be keeping him alive.\u201d Because of his addiction, the Klamers had long feared that Nick \u2014 dark-haired, green-eyed and lip-pierced, trailed by a cloud of Axe body spray and Acqua di Gio \u2014 would die young.And yet the prosecution of Mr. Thistle, who was with Mr. Klamer when he scored and used, has helped the family cope, organizing an incomprehensible loss into a story in which Mr. Klamer is the victim. Addiction is a slippery adversary that cannot be held to account. But Mr. Thistle can be.Mr. Klamer, 26, had been doing well in the months before his death in August 2015, living with his father in the rural Wisconsin town of Lodi, where their lawn backed right onto the lake. He worked the 6 a.m. shift with his father at a tool and die shop, and kept himself isolated from old friends and old habits by having no phone and no car.But then, Mr. Thistle came home.\u201cIt was only like a month,\u201d said Melissa Klamer, a sister, \u201cbetween when Chase started coming around again and when Nick died.\u201dChase was the first friend Nick made when he moved to Wisconsin as a young teenager. The Klamers say they thought he was a bad influence, but it was Nick who first injected Chase with heroin in high school, not the other way around, and Ms. Klamer says her brother felt responsible for his friend\u2019s addiction.And it was Mr. Klamer who woke his father after midnight one night, asking for a ride. On the way, he asked for $200, telling a cooked-up story about a friend with a broken-down car. Credulous, his father drove the two friends to a parking lot in Madison, where they met up with friends and used the money to score. When they got home at 3 a.m., Nick said that he was going to stay up and go fishing before work.Instead, the two young men shot up in a cinder-block boathouse at the edge of the Klamers\u2019 backyard. Don Klamer went to work alone. In the afternoon, he came home and found his son\u2019s body on the cracked boathouse floor.Mr. Thistle later told the police that he had left his friend alive and snoring and walked back to his grandparents\u2019 house, where he shot up again and overdosed himself.In all, four people from the parking lot were charged in Mr. Klamer\u2019s death. All pleaded guilty \u2014 two to reckless homicide, one to distribution. Mr. Thistle alone went to trial. He was convicted of reckless homicide and sentenced to three years in prison.The Klamers say Mr. Thistle, after he was revived, could have done more to save Mr. Klamer, like telling the police, who went to the Klamer home to do a welfare check but got no answer at the front door, to look in the boathouse.But Mr. Thistle\u2019s mother, Melinda, said it made as much sense to blame her son as it did to blame her, as the person who gave birth to him. Other people, she said, had played at least as big a role. \u201cNick\u2019s dad gave them $200 \u2014 two drug addicts, recovering drug addicts,\u201d she said.Don Klamer had told the police much the same thing, sobbing and slamming his fist into a table.\u201cI drove them right to his drug dealer,\u201d the police report quoted him saying. \u201cI killed my own son.\u201dSara Simon and Susan C.

{"Headline": "Trump Against the Liberal Tide", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The accompanying chart measures support for higher immigration levels from 1992 to 2016. White moderates and conservatives, including Republicans and independents, showed relatively little change over those 24 years. Among white liberals, though, support for increased immigration grew from a low of 4 percent in 1996 to 38 percent in 2016.Goldberg broke down the data by age groups and found that the driving force was young, white liberals aged 18 to 24. In an email, Goldberg wrote:To sum up, both social media and the progressive direction of the Obama years helped lay the groundwork for the progressive/multicultural normative context that Trump would later enter and threaten to smash. For liberals, Trump and his supporters were perceived as white supremacists who aspired to \u201cmake America white again.\u201dIn other words, he continued,in an era where \u201cwhiteness\u201d has become increasingly associated with moral injustice (past and present), liberals are determined to distinguish themselves as \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cunlike the deplorable white majority.\u201dIn further support of his argument, Goldberg produced the following graphic from ANES surveys:In our email exchange, Goldberg argued that Trump\u2019s election produced what he calls \u201cmoral panic\u201d among liberals:Liberal progressives perceive Trump as a threat to the increasingly egalitarian/multicultural moral order. They fear that he will undo or turn back the clock on many of the gains they\u2019ve made over the past few decades. America under Obama was trending in the progressive direction \u2014 towards a proverbial \u201cend of history\u201d or egalitarian multicultural utopia. Trump then emerges and is perceived as not only \u201ccrashing the party,\u201d but also as threatening to return it to its \u201cwhites only\u201d/exclusivist format.First, \u201cimmigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents,\u201d and second, \u201cimmigrants burden the country by taking jobs, housing and health care.\u201dThe percentage of self-identified Democrats and Democratic leaners who agreed that immigrants strengthened the country grew from 48 percent in 2010 to 84 percent in 2017. Conversely, the share of Democrats describing immigrants as a burden fell from 60 percent in 1994 to 12 percent in 2017.\u201cMany pro-immigrant positions are at an all-time high (among Democrats) in public opinion,\u201d Nick Gourevitch, a Democratic pollster, told me by email, \u201cespecially questions around immigration strengthening society and the positive impact of immigration.\u201d\u201cTaking that position is now a signal that you are not with Trump and you are not with white nationalist elements of the Republican Party,\u201d Gourevitch added. \u201cIf you are strongly anti-Trump now, you are almost, by definition, pro-immigrant, pro-racial justice.\u201dIn testing racial attitudes, Pew asked voters to choose between \u201cblacks who can\u2019t get ahead in this country are mostly responsible for their condition\u201d and \u201cracial discrimination is the main reason why many black people can\u2019t get ahead these days.\u201d The percentage of Democrats citing discrimination grew from 28 percent in 2010 to 50 percent in 2016 to 64 percent in 2017.A similar pattern, although less extreme, can be seen in responses to questions on environmental issues. For example, from 2006 to 2014, the percentage of Democrats who believed that there is \u201csolid evidence that the average temperature on earth is getting warmer,\u201d fluctuated from the mid to high 70s. In 2017, it shot up to 92 percent.Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, sees the trends among Democratic voters as a clear plus, with little downside:There has been a tremendous shift in the public to progressive positions and awareness \u2014 on marijuana, on marriage equality, on calling out racism, on #MeToo, on support for comprehensive sex education and women\u2019s reproductive health issues. Democrats are both leading the way and catching up. Millennials are the future and they are totally in support of these positions.Jonathan Cowan, president of Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank, is more ambivalent.On the plus side, he wrote in an email,this shorter-term trend clearly comports with the multi-decade trend in which both the country at large and the Democratic Party itself have become increasingly more open-minded, pluralistic and progressive on a range of social issues, including racial justice, immigration and women\u2019s rights.Cowan then shifted to what he called \u201cthe rest of the story\u201d:Not all of the country is moving at the same pace. Donald Trump won a national election playing a brand of racial politics not seen in this country since George Wallace. So while Democrats fight for progress and justice on racial issues, we cannot be dismissive or scornful of voters who do not share precisely the same views or beliefs, but who nonetheless want an alternative to the hard-core misogyny, nativism and racism of Trump.Third Way analyzed all 435 House districts in anticipation of the 2018 election and reached the conclusion that the key fights will be in districts that require appeals to swing voters to win.The study found that 168 districts are virtually certain to elect Democrats, who currently hold 165 of these seats. On average, these districts are 44 percent white and 56 minority.Conversely, there are 195 districts almost certain to elect Republicans. They are 75 percent white and 25 percent minority. 193 are held by Republicans, and, based on past voting records, Democrats face long odds making gains in these deep red districts.Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at liberal leaning New America, contends that the hostility of Democratic elites to Trump is driving the leftward shift among Democratic voters.\u201cOpinion leadership among Democratic elites has become much more \u2018woke\u2019 over the past several years,\u201d Drutman said by email:Democratic politicians and journalists have spent more time talking about social justice issues and championing the causes of historically disadvantaged groups, and there\u2019s a basic cue-following that happens. What it means to be a Democratic is shifting, and voters are updating their views to fit with that.At the same time, Drutman noted, many conservative whites have left the Democratic Party, effectively increasing \u201cthe percentages of self-identified Democrats taking more liberal stands on cultural issues.\u201dPerhaps most important:Democrats are defining themselves in opposition to Trump, and to stand in opposition to Trump is to take liberal stands on social and cultural issues.Animosity to Trump is one of many factors driving liberal positioning among Democrats. Matt Grossmann, a political scientist at Michigan State, pointed to some of these in an email:It\u2019s hard to sort out the roles of Black Lives Matter, police violence, Trump statements, Democratic comments on Trump, social desirability pressures for educated liberals, increasing education among Democrats, campus movements, me too, etc.Grossmann added:The general explanation is that, as a result of all of that, political elites, including the presidential candidates, and the media are talking more about these views, with Democrats publicly taking liberal positions and Trump-era Republicans taking the opposite views.Cowan argues that rapid advances in digital communications have played a crucial role in the liberalization of Democratic voters:There are a series of Great American Awakenings sweeping the country in the early part of the 21st century, and each of these awakenings are being radically accelerated by the ubiquity and advent of digital technology and the stories and movements it enables people to tell and build, e.g. The outrageous mistreatment of African Americans at Starbucks now caught on cellphone video or dash cams, the rise of the #MeToo Movement and the ability of social media platforms to empower, amplify and sustain the stories of Dreamers.From a strategic vantage point, there is no question that the United States \u2014 and the world for that matter \u2014 is moving in the same direction as the Democratic Party. Still, a question remains: Is the Democratic Party too far ahead of the electorate, in danger of being swamped by reaction?In a series of surveys for NBC/WSJ, Public Opinion Strategies asked voters to make a choice similar to the one posed above by Pew:A. \u201cImmigration adds to our character and strengthens the United States because it brings diversity, new workers, and new creative talent to this country.\u201dB. \u201cImmigration detracts from our character and weakens the United States because it puts too many burdens on government services, causes language barriers, and creates housing problems.\u201dThe percentage of all voters choosing A has grown steadily from 41 in 2005 to 47 in 2010 to 54 in 2013 to 64 in 2017. Democrats have led the charge, going from 42 percent in 2005 to 81 percent in 2017, but equally significant are the shifts that Public Opinion Strategies found among Republican constituencies:In 2010, a majority, 54 percent, of white Southerners agreed that immigration weakens the country; by 2017, a majority, 53 percent, said immigration strengthens the country. Similarly, 59 percent of women without college degrees said immigration hurts the country; by 2017, 53 percent said immigration helps the nation.Immigration is one of a package of issues that fall under the broad category of liberalization \u2014 something Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard, calls emancipation.Over the course of the years covered by the chart, from the 1960s to the present, America\u2019s two major parties have taken opposing sides in a large-scale social struggle over emancipation: the Democrats on the front lines fighting against conservative resistance, a rear-guard Republican action that is determined to maintain the status quo or roll it back. The advantage has rotated from one party to the other over the past several decades.The Republicans are back in power now. Trump\u2019s fervent millions stand loyally behind him. The president is pushing ever more aggressively to bring the emancipation project to a halt. But his foothold is insecure \u2014 and he is rowing against the current.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Colorado, a Fracking Boom and a Population Explosion Collide", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWELD COUNTY, Colo. \u2014 A new oil rig will rise behind a middle school in this sprawling county in the coming months, its slender tower bearing an announcement: fracking is back.But this growth is also spurring a return of the turmoil that accompanied the last boom, pitting neighbor against neighbor and communities against companies in a fight over which projects should be allowed to pierce the land.In Weld County \u2014 the center of the state\u2019s oil and gas activity and home to more than 23,000 active wells \u2014 that tension has converged at a school called Bella Romero Academy. Just behind the school, workers are laying the foundation for a 24-well project that will pull oil and gas from the earth as students race across the playground.The project has the support of state regulators and the county commission. But it is opposed by the school board, the superintendent and many parents, some of whom say they support fossil fuel development but are alarmed by such a large operation so close to their school.Well heads will sit 828 feet from the edge of Bella Romero property.\u201cIt\u2019s like they said, \u2018Put it where the Mexicans live, over there it\u2019s O.K.\u2019\u201d said Yveth Haro, 42, whose son Elian, 10, is a student at Bella Romero. \u201cWell I don\u2019t think it\u2019s O.K.\u201dOther sites, he said, \u201cdid not have all those critical characteristics.\u201dWhile oil and gas companies have long operated in Colorado, they flooded the region in the 2000s as increased use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, unlocked possibilities. By 2013, communities along the Front Range were pushing for control of their own backyards, enacting laws that tried to curb fracking near homes and playgrounds.The conflicts come amid a population surge driven in part by outdoors-oriented millennials fleeing high-cost cities, and by industries like aerospace and finance. Much of that growth is in Denver, Boulder and the area to the north that happens to sit above fuel-rich shale.The uptick in production, however, comes at a time of political uncertainty. Gov. John Hickenlooper \u2014 a Democrat thought of as friendly to the industry \u2014 is term-limited this year, and liberal candidates are lining up to replace him. A leading contender is Jared Polis, a congressman well-known for his attempts to rein in drilling.Already, oil and gas representatives are pouring millions into the race to defend a business they calculate contributes $32 billion a year to the state\u2019s economy.Just as important could be an upcoming Colorado Supreme Court ruling in which justices will decide whether state regulators must prioritize public health and the environment when approving permits, rather than balancing those factors with the benefits of production.If the court decides the state must consider health first, said Sharon Jacobs, a law professor at the University of Colorado, it could have sweeping effects, raising the bar for new permits.Or, depending on how regulators interpret the ruling, they could continue issuing permits as usual.It is also increasingly diverse, and school parking lots are jammed with deep-rooted farming families, Mexican immigrants and refugees from places like Burma and Somalia.Bella Romero Academy, with its red-and-yellow brick walls and bilingual signs, teaches several hundred students in grades four to eight. The buffer zone between the school and the incoming oil project is the students\u2019 soccer field and a drainage ditch.The school is surrounded by homes. Longhorn cattle, llamas and goats live at its perimeter.The fight over the project is complicated by the fact that the largely conservative county has benefited enormously from oil and gas, which has flooded the region with money and jobs and is embraced by much of the community.Don Warden, the county\u2019s finance director, called the shale below him \u201cthe gift that keeps on giving.\u201dToday, County Road 49 is so crowded with oil derricks and tanks that some residents call it the Frack Freeway. And while new wells may raise alarm elsewhere, they\u2019ve become the norm in Weld, where fracking operations are tucked into neighborhoods and already border several schools.\u201cYou\u2019re talking to a person who lives within about 200 feet of a drilling operation,\u201d said Barbara Kirkmeyer, a county commissioner. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you shouldn\u2019t move in next to it.\u201dThe project near Bella Romero, however, has exposed fissures, with even a few industry supporters saying that the combination of the operation\u2019s size and proximity to students takes development too far.Among the operation\u2019s fiercest opponents is Patricia Nelson, 28, whose son Diego, 5, will attend Bella Romero when he reaches fourth grade.\u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that they keep it away from the schools, keep it away from the homes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to a point where the industry, I feel, is starting to cause more problems than what they\u2019re worth.\u201dIn response, the company has made \u201cunprecedented accommodations,\u201d said Mr. Cain, and will complete 80 percent of work outside school hours, employ a sound wall and a noise-minimizing drill rig, and pipe out oil and gas, rather than trucking it, reducing traffic and emissions.Mr. Cain called the episode an anomaly at a company with an otherwise admirable reputation for safety.Together, the fires have heightened safety concerns, and activists have staged protests outside the school, sometimes carrying fliers to educate parents, many of whom do not speak English.Environmental groups and the N.A.A.C.P. Colorado State Conference are suing the state over the project, alleging that regulators erred in approving the permit.Still, while some neighbors oppose the project, others do not.\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t bother me a bit,\u201d said Shawn Elliott, 50, who lives next to Bella Romero.Bert West, 81, another resident, agreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful. Everyone is screaming. But it\u2019s jobs, and it\u2019s money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And the consequences are certain to ripple through the bloc, where leaders worry about another financial crisis just as Greece finally seems to be exiting from its eight-year bailout program.\u201cEven if they have retreated on leaving the euro, what they\u2019re proposing in terms of the social program and minimum guaranteed salary will blow a hole through all the eurozone rules,\u201d said Anthony L.

The proposed expansion of spending is a direct challenge to \u201cthe whole philosophy of economic governance and rules governing the eurozone area,\u201d he said.The cumulative Italian debt is already about 130 percent of gross domestic product, more than twice what the eurozone is supposed to require, and probably too big to bail out if necessary.The uncertainty around the Italian economy will also be a further major blow to the ambitions for eurozone stabilization and reform laid out by Mr. Macron, proposals that have already been sharply watered down by Germany.With a critical European Union summit meeting coming in June, Mr. Rahman said, \u201cthis will be deeply unhelpful to Macron, because the Italians will be the excuse for Germany to do nothing serious on reform.\u201d\u201cThe window for eurozone reform, already narrow, is shrinking fast,\u201d he said.There are worries in security terms, too.France, Britain and Germany, as signatories to the Iran nuclear deal, had been discussing new sanctions against Iran as part of their effort to persuade President Trump to keep to the Iran deal.The economic situation in Italy is hardly good, which was a major contributing factor to the victory of the League and Five Star. Henrik Enderlein, a professor of political economy at Germany\u2019s Hertie School of Governance and now in Florence, put four charts on Twitter showing poor Italian performance compared with the rest of the eurozone, with the comment, \u201cYes, I am worried.\u201dThe charts showed poor economic growth, very high debt, very high levels of nonperforming loans in Italian banks and low popular support for the euro. Italian GDP per capita is lower now in real terms than it was nearly 20 years ago, when Italy joined the euro, noted Matthew Goodwin, a political scientist at the University of Kent.The other factor that helped the new coalition was the strong feeling among Italians that the European Union had let them down over migration; Italy and Greece have now become the primary landing spots for refugees and economic migrants from the Middle East and Africa.Promises made during the campaign to deport up to 500,000 migrants could also bring Italy into sharp conflict with Brussels, Mr. Grant said. \u201cDeportation of that size would be impossible without violating due process,\u201d he said.That could force Brussels to start an Article 7 process against Italy for breaking the fundamental commitments to the rule of law that would be \u201cmore serious\u201d than the process begun against Poland for meddling with the independence of the judiciary.In the end, Mr. Gardner and Mr. Rahman said, Italy is likely to be kept in line more by the financial markets than by Brussels itself. Brussels has been \u201clazy and complacent\u201d in the face of the Italian election challenge, Mr. Rahman said. \u201cBut what will really decide if there is a crisis, are the markets,\u201d he said.And with Mario Draghi, an Italian, soon leaving as head of the European Central Bank, it is not clear that a successor would be as willing to provide a backstop to Italian debt in the way Mr. Draghi promised to do. \u201cDon\u2019t assume the E.C.B. will be the same,\u201d Mr. Rahman said.Mr. Gardner added: \u201cEvery leader has to take account of the bond markets. Even Berlusconi had to.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Decolonizing the Art Museum: The Next Wave", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMs.\u00a0Viso is an independent curator\u00a0and museum consultant,\u00a0and a former museum director.Museums have long considered themselves above the fray of the political. But the past 18 months have brought unexpected challenges, and leaders across the country are being confronted with an urgent question: How do museums reconceive their missions at a time of great societal reckoning around race and gender, and as more diverse audiences demand a voice and a sense of accountability?As director of the Walker Art Center, in Minneapolis, I faced this challenge in 2017 after a controversy over the placement of a public sculpture, \u201cScaffold,\u201d by Sam Durant. The work, first exhibited in Europe in 2012, depicted gallows that represented seven state-sanctioned executions between 1859 and 2006. It was intended to critique the persistence of the death penalty in the old hierarchies that placed a museum\u2019s authority above its public\u2019s feelings had been in charge.It is not easy to acknowledge one\u2019s blind spots. What I had hoped would be an opportunity for public education and \u201ctruth to power\u201d in the presentation of \u201cScaffold\u201d was simply not possible because of the continuing historical trauma about an unreckoned-with colonial past. This was a humbling public admission for a person whose career has been devoted to providing a platform for underrepresented histories.We have been here before. In the 1980s, during the Reagan presidency and the AIDS crisis, culture wars over artistic censorship raged. I was coming of age as a Cuban-American in an era of institutional critique. In my first curatorial jobs, I fought along with others to present art that exposed the underlying power structures of white establishment culture, corporate America and the federal government. But these efforts failed to effect lasting change.Thirty years later, we are fighting the same cultural battles, and the curators who emerged then are today\u2019s besieged leaders. Despite best efforts to make meaningful change, exponential gaps remain between the growing minority-majority American population and those who lead, support, attend or are employed by art museums. Wealth disparity and the shifting values and expectations of the next generation of museum donors are also factors.The surging commercial art market has become another colonizing force, even as it has opened new economies for artists of color. There are now two incompatible art worlds: one committed to inclusion, artistic freedom and change, the other driven by money and entitlements. When agendas collide, there are casualties. Major museums with recent leadership turnovers, apart from the Walker, include the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Queens Museum in New York, where directors and curators (all of them women) have stepped down.Breakthrough actions are required in this era of reckoning and accountability. Susan Goldberg, National Geographic\u2019s first female editor in chief, set a courageous example. For her April 2018 issue, she commissioned an outside assessment of the magazine\u2019s treatment of race throughout its history. She discovered that until 1970, it \u201cdid little to push its readers beyond the stereotypes ingrained in white American culture.\u201d Rather than minimize her institution\u2019s history, Ms. Goldberg addressed it.The exhibition \u201cAmericans,\u201d developed by the noted Comanche curator Paul Chaat Smith at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian, confronts the racism inherent in the celebration of Thanksgiving and the naming of certain sports teams. It does so in the nation\u2019s capital with directness, honesty and humor. Its success points to the recognition \u2014 by major, predominantly white-run institutions like the Smithsonian \u2014 of the need to elevate alternative perspectives that disrupt mainstream understanding.Individual artists have also taken bold steps to challenge institutional status quo. When Mark Grotjahn relinquished a prestigious artist award and acknowledged that the prize had been bestowed upon too many white male artists before him, many were startled. Sam Durant\u2019s concession of the intellectual property rights to the Dakota people also demonstrated an unprecedented willingness to listen and seek earnest reconciliation.Systemic change takes time, vision and nuanced leadership at every level, most especially among donors and museum boards. Selfless investment and fortitude are required. So is a willingness to endure discomfort. To move forward, the entire ecosystem must devote itself to a longer game.Art can illuminate the fissures in society and in return offer opportunities for healing. But should artists be the only ones to bear the brunt of this responsibility? If museums want to continue to have a place, they must stop seeing activists as antagonists. They must position themselves as learning communities, not impenetrable centers of self-validating authority.If they do not, museums run the risk of becoming culturally irrelevant artifacts. Now is the time to be open to radical change. The next wave of decolonizing America\u2019s art museums must succeed, because to lose our capacity for empathy in a democracy is not an option.Olga Viso is an independent curator and museum consultant, and a former director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C.

{"Headline": "I Also Went to the Royal Wedding", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd all I got was a devastating reminder of my own insignificance.These were the sparkling images beamed from the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead on May 19 to dazzle a global audience: The bride in lustrous, heavy white silk. The groom lustily biting his lip as he cast his eyes upon her. Oprah Winfrey striding into a medieval chapel in a dress the color of chilled ros\u00e9. Everyone was desperate to see Ms. Markle. They did not hunger to see her; it is possible to live for weeks without solid food. These people needed Ms. Markle as they needed oxygen. They needed to witness firsthand the color of the dress she had chosen to wear for the afternoon of her last day as a divorced single woman. They needed to watch the fading light glint off her shiny, healthy hair \u2014 and would it be up or down? They needed, each, to scream their personal well-wishes at her, or maybe just to feel her name rip out of their throats \u2014 MEGHAN! \u2014 so it could never be said that they\u2019d had the opportunity to try to command her attention and failed to. Minutes crawled by. The crowd grew angrier at the prolonged wait for whoever might be going to come outside, their energy mutating from excited to inconvenienced to furious. When a public event staged by members of the British royal family is executed correctly, the overall picture inspires white-hot jealousy powerful enough to split an atom. You have to get in close if you want to see the seams \u2014 if you want to determine if Meghan Markle honestly believes in her heart that the Queen of England is the highest power on earth, below God. So, I had to go to the wedding.And yet, the extent to which her image, name, initials and flag of origin had been officially monetized, even before she had married into the royal family, was staggering. Images of Ms. Markle and Prince Harry were used to sell an official $261 \u201climited edition royal wedding commemorative cup and saucer pair\u201d finished with 22-karat gold in the (multiple) gift shops of Buckingham Palace. They were incorporated into the display of an official commemorative wedding coin for sale at the Tower of London, where two of Ms. Markle\u2019s royal wife predecessors were jailed by their husband before their beheadings (on site). At Kensington Palace, the couple\u2019s London home, their portraits were used to sell an officially monogrammed pill box. The souvenir shop inside St. George\u2019s Chapel, mere yards from where Ms. Markle and Prince Harry exchanged their vows in the presence of God, sells a book that observes, on the topic of Ms. Markle\u2019s yearslong romantic relationship with a Canadian chef named Cory Vitiello, \u201crumors persist that they were still an item when Harry and Meghan first met.\u201d Speaking of bunting \u2014 strings of paper triangles highly prized by the British people \u2014 there was so much of it strung in cheery zigzag patterns around Windsor that Ms. Markle could have tightrope walked across the town from end to end without ever having to touch the ground. \u201cBoo to Camilla!\u201d a white-haired woman hissed at the screen, in clarification. \u201cThose are for Charlie boy.\u201d When the queen emerged from her car, many in the crowd waved at her image.Shortly before noon, a vintage Rolls-Royce containing Ms. Markle and her mother Doria Ragland flew past the crowds gathered on the Long Walk so quickly that the only claim anyone could make about her dress was that it appeared to be white. The crowd turned to the video screens to get a better look than real life provided. And then, much more quickly than it began, it was over. The police could eat ice cream again, and did. A trio of elderly Brits speculated about whether the couple would have sex before that evening\u2019s private reception. The crowd, which, moments before, had sung a proud pledge to the monarch, dropped their plastic flags on the ground and abandoned them. The day was too fine to waste on ceremony.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Putin\u2019s 4th Term, More a Coronation Than an Inauguration", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Vladimir V. Putin took the oath of office on Monday for a fourth term as Russia\u2019s president, in a ceremony staged in a gilded Kremlin hall once used to crown czars and replete with pageantry, highlighting his vast accumulation of authority after nearly two decades in power.Mr. Putin, a former KGB agent, has ruled Russia as prime minister or president for more than 18 years, and in that time has crafted an image as a steely nerved leader and the man best qualified to rebuild his country after the collapse of the Soviet Union.In a theatrical touch, a televised ceremony began on Monday with Mr. Putin sitting at his desk in the Kremlin, suit jacket looped over his chair, as if hard at work until moments before the ceremony. A phone rang, letting him know it was time for his fourth term; he donned his jacket and walked alone through the red-carpeted Kremlin corridors and into a hall packed with about 6,000 invited, cheering guests.In a short speech, Mr. Putin suggested his focus had now turned to domestic matters and improving Russia\u2019s economy for the \u201cwell-being of every family,\u201d though there were no words of reconciliation in the country\u2019s tense relations with the West.\u201cThe country\u2019s security and defense capabilities are reliably ensured,\u201d Mr. Putin told the audience of government ministers, lawmakers, religious leaders and celebrities.\u201cNow we will use all the possibilities we have first of all for the resolution of internal, and most essential, tasks of development,\u201d he said. \u201cA new quality of life, well-being, security and health for the people, that is what is important today.\u201dWhile lower key than Mr. Putin\u2019s inauguration in 2012, the ceremony\u2019s regal themes nevertheless gave it the air of a coronation.The honor guard and flag bearers wore uniforms with tall military caps, of a style dating from Russia\u2019s war with Napoleon in 1812. The ceremony itself unfolded in a Kremlin hall used to crown three czars \u2014 Alexander II, Alexander III and Nicholas II \u2014 as well as previous presidential inaugurations. And later, Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, gave Mr. Putin an 18th century icon while blessing him for his new term.Abroad, Mr. Putin has sought to restore Russia\u2019s sway in world affairs. During his third term as president, he intervened militarily in Ukraine and Syria, putting him at loggerheads with the West. And, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, he directed Russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential election to aid Donald J. Trump.The arrests added images of swinging nightsticks and shoving matches with the police to the inaugural events. The repression, Vedomosti, a business newspaper, wrote, risked \u201cspoiling the upcoming inauguration more even than the protest.\u201dThe violence included a throwback to an earlier era of crowd-control tactics in Russia. Men wearing Cossack uniforms and carrying a type of traditional leather whip known as a nagaika had mingled in the crowd, occasionally lashing out. The Echo of Moscow radio station reported Monday that the Cossack group had won municipal contracts to train for and help with crowd control, though it remained unclear whether they acted in an official capacity on Saturday.Mr. Putin signed decrees on Monday outlining his goals, such as reducing poverty and, by the end of his six-year term, raising Russian life expectancy to 78 years, from 72 now. He signaled political continuity by nominating a longtime ally, Dmitri A. Medvedev, as prime minister.Whether Mr. Putin shifts gears on economic policy hinges on the possible appointment of a liberal economist, Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former finance minister, to a new post as economic adviser, analysts said. Kremlin hard-liners oppose Mr. Kudrin for advocating an easing of tensions with the West, as well as efforts to revive trade. Mr. Kudrin has also argued for raising taxes and the retirement age to shore up the budget.Mr. Putin first became president on Dec. 31, 1999, when Boris Yeltsin, ailing from heart troubles, resigned. Mr. Putin was then elected in 2000 and served twice, the constitutional limit for successive terms. He then became prime minister for one term, before returning to the presidency in 2012. For his third and now fourth spells as president, the term was extended to six years from four.While not short on pomp, the ceremony on Monday was less elaborate than his inauguration in 2012.In 2012, the police cordoned off much of the city center to allow Mr. Putin\u2019s motorcade to glide through quiet streets toward the Kremlin. Eerie images of the leader in an empty city sparked criticism that Mr. Putin had lost touch with the people.This year, he stayed within the Kremlin grounds. He walked from his office to a motorcade that drove from one Kremlin building to another, escorted by motorcycles.In the ceremony, Mr. Putin strode through several interlinked, gilded and chandeliered halls in an historical Kremlin palace before arriving at the Andreyevsky Hall, where guests waited. Few foreign dignitaries attended. Among those in the hall were Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the former German chancellor and longtime supporter of Mr. Putin.Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Tourism Ruin the Rainbow Mountain of Peru?", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first glance, the mountain in the Peruvian Andes, with its bands of soil the color of turquoise, lavender, red-violet and gold, seems Photoshopped.But the otherworldly sight, standing 16,000 feet above sea level, is real. People living nearby call it Vinicunca, the Rainbow Mountain.The varicolored mountain, with sediment created from mineral deposits over millions of years, was discovered only about five years ago, locals say. But it has become a must-see attraction for hikers, bringing much-needed cash to the area but also prompting concern about possible damage to the previously unspoiled landscape.Santos Machacca, 29, a mountain guide in the Cusco region, in southeastern Peru, said that the Rainbow Mountain might have been discovered only recently because of climate change.\u201cWe have asked the elders that live in Pitumarca,\u201d a town near Vinicunca, \u201cand they said that the mountain was under the snow,\u201d Mr. Machacca said in a recent interview. \u201cGlobal warming has caused the ice to melt, and a colorful mountain appeared from under it.\u201dMr. Machacca, a member of the Q\u2019ero community, said the mountain was an appealing destination for trekkers not only because of its beauty, but also because of the climate.\u201cThey love to go because when you are up there, you can feel the pure air and you forget everything and you connect with the Apus of Ausangate,\u201d he said, referring to legends of mountain spirits watching over the Peruvian Andes.The big crowds have breathed new life into the economy of the remote region around the mountain, creating jobs for residents in the area, many of whom have been alpaca herders.Roughly 500 villagers have now moved back to their ancestral land, according to The Associated Press, in order to act as guides to tourists across the Andes. They charge $3 per person, bringing in around $400,000 a year.But there may be a high price to pay for the tourism boom.\u201cFrom the ecological point of view, they are killing the goose that lays the golden eggs,\u201d Dina Farfan, a Peruvian biologist, told The A.P.According to Mr. Farfan, a severe impact on the environment is already evident. A swamp that had been a refuge for migrating ducks was turned into a huge parking lot for tourist vans. A 2.5-mile trail has been severely eroded by hikers.And a Canadian mining company, Camino Minerals Corp., has applied for mining rights in the area.A local Pampachiri leader, Gabino Huaman, questioned whether enough had been done to prepare members of the community to host and guide the tourists streaming to the Peruvian Andes.\u201cWe don\u2019t know one word in English,\u201d he was quoted as saying in The Associated Press, \u201cor first aid.\u201dThe high altitude and long distance of the trail can make for a challenging hike, and tourists usually need to acclimate their bodies before beginning the trek to the top of the fluorescent mountain.To overcome altitude sickness, some people carry small oxygen tanks, while others resort to chewing coca leaves.John Widmer, an American tourist who visited Vinicunca in April 2017, detailed a \u201cnot so colorful experience\u201d in a blog post dripping with irritation.\u201cIt was the bad weather combined with irresponsible guides, unprepared hikers and horrendous trail conditions that made this one of the worst treks we\u2019ve ever been on,\u201d Mr. Widmer wrote.He lamented the environmental destruction occurring from the large numbers of tourists, adding that \u201cthe beautiful and fragile alpine environment is getting completely demolished\u201d by the hordes of eager hikers who journey to the mountain.\u201cI\u2019m ashamed at the fact that we, too, personally destroyed a bit of the Andes during our trek to Rainbow Mountain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Potential Auto Tariffs Prompt Warnings From Industry and Allies", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump likes to keep allies and adversaries guessing, but his decision to begin a trade investigation that could trigger auto tariffs was met by surprise at home and abroad, and prompted warnings that it could destabilize global supply chains.Mr. Trump has argued that tariffs would encourage companies to move production back to American soil after years of offshoring and he has seized on levies as a way to force trading partners to make concessions, such as limiting exports to the United States.But critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach say the president is sowing uncertainty that threatens to undercut economic growth and send trading relations to a previously unseen level of disarray.Mr. Trump\u2019s latest tariff threat came Wednesday, in the middle of a series of foreign policy challenges: White House officials canceled a meeting with North Korea, drew the ire of lawmakers by considering easing penalties on a Chinese telecom firm and said they had secured a $200 billion trade concession with China, only to have the deal fall through.But that wasn\u2019t all. This week, India filed formal challenges to Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs at the World Trade Organization, joining the European Union, Japan, Russia and Turkey.Even members of the president\u2019s own party warned of the debilitating uncertainty businesses are facing from his scattershot approach.\u201cYou pass a permanent tax reform for corporations and say, let\u2019s do business in America,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the president of the American Action Forum, a conservative-leaning think tank, and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cAnd then every day, you don\u2019t know which of your goods will have a tariff wall around it. It makes no sense.\u201dPromises to shake up American trade were a mainstay for the president on the campaign trail, and the idea of auto tariffs graced the trade to-do list on the white board in the office of the former White House adviser Steve Bannon in the early months of the administration. On Thursday, the United Autoworkers President Dennis Williams was cautiously optimistic about the president\u2019s decision to examine auto imports on national security grounds. Mr. Williams said he believed the United States should have been looking into imports long ago.But beyond the president\u2019s base, the threat of tariffs on cars, trucks, S.U.V.s and auto parts appeared to provoke alarm from nearly every corner, with warnings that it would ultimately hurt American workers and consumers more than anyone else.\u201cIf this proposal is carried out, it would deal a staggering blow to the very industry it purports to protect and would threaten to ignite a global trade war,\u201d said Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, blasted the potential for tariffs on imported vehicles as a \u201cbad idea,\u201d and added, \u201cThis is a dangerous course and should be abandoned immediately.\u201dThe administration authorized the investigation under the same legal statute it used to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in March. As with that action, the Commerce Department on Wednesday said imported vehicles may pose a national security threat because they had degraded American manufacturing and put domestic technological development at risk.But many find the national security argument specious. Roughly 44 percent of cars, trucks and S.U.V.s sold in the United States last year were imported, but 98 percent of American car imports came from major allies, like Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Japan and South Korea.Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, said that the idea that there could be a national security threat posed by cars and car parts from Canada \u2014 many of which cross the border multiple times in their journey from the factory to the customer \u2014 was \u201cfrankly absurd.\u201d\u201cThat is a point that we are making very clearly to our U.S. partners and allies,\u201d she said.Margaritas Schinas, the senior spokesman for the European Commission, said there was \u201cno justification\u201d for the United States to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum on national security, grounds. \u201cInvoking national security would be even more far-fetched in the case of the car industry,\u201d he said.In an interview Thursday on CNBC, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who is leading the investigation, said the administration was defining national security \u201cbroadly,\u201d to include the impact on employment and other factors. \u201cEconomic security is military security,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd without economic security, you can\u2019t have military security.\u201dMr. Trump has framed the threat of tariffs as a potential source of leverage in talks to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement, which have largely stalled over rules governing how carmakers can qualify for Nafta\u2019s zero tariffs.On Wednesday, President Trump said automakers would be \u201cvery happy\u201d with his announcement. But few seemed pleased.While many companies said they were still waiting to see the likely effect of the measure, carmakers, auto parts suppliers and car dealers said it threatened to raise their costs, depress auto sales and jobs in the United States, and make American-made products less competitive worldwide. The industry has already been hit by the tariffs on steel and aluminum, which have weighed on their profit margins, and the threat of looming trade action against China, as well as potential Chinese retaliation.\u201cIf the tariffs actually went into effect, it would upend the supplier industry,\u201d said Ann Wilson, senior vice president for government affairs at Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents auto parts makers. \u201cWe are very dependent on the ability to bring in parts from other parts of the world for final production in the U.S., and if that\u2019s no longer financially viable, the question becomes, is the production of vehicles in this country going to be financially viable?\u201dKristin Dziczek, the vice president of Industry, Labor & Economics at the Center for Automotive Research, said automakers would be slow to adjust their own investment decisions until they see how any potential tariff decisions might come to pass.\u201cThis is an industry that is big and slow and costs lots of money to build up capacity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear how this all proceeds. But what it does immediately is introduce a lot more risk and uncertainty into an industry that doesn\u2019t deal well with uncertainty.\u201dDespite the president\u2019s vow to defend and strengthen American manufacturing, companies said they worried that the president and his advisers did not understand the complex web of materials and components that are sourced from around the world, and how they support vast numbers of American jobs. They also worried that foreign retaliation could hinder United States automakers from selling abroad.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, estimated that if partners do not retaliate, a 25 percent auto tariff would boost the size of the United States economy by 0.04 percent a year, adding 23,000 jobs in the process. Americans would buy 160,000 fewer vehicles in that time, he estimated, but domestic automobile production would increase by 300,000 vehicles because more of the cars purchased would be made in the United States.But if other countries were to retaliate with tariffs of their own, Mr. Zandi said, \u201cG.D.P. and jobs will decline.\u201dSeveral leading Democrats and Republicans criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s fondness for injecting confusion into trade matters.Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy \u201cstarts with bluster and it tends to end with uncertainty,\u201d said Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cThere\u2019s one arena in which measured responses are important, it\u2019s in the international trade arena. It\u2019s certainly going to have effects on investors and consumers.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the finance committee, called the talk of auto tariffs \u201cdeeply misguided.\u201d\u201cTaxing cars, trucks and auto parts coming into the country would directly hit American families who need a dependable vehicle,\u201d he said.Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, who has criticized Mr. Trump for exposing farmers and ranchers to retaliation from trading partners, said the president was \u201ctrading away our long-term interests in exchange for short-term headlines.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any coherence to either the trade policies that he\u2019s pursuing or how he engages our trading partners in the work of negotiating the agreement,\u201d he said.Milan Schreuer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

(for ultra long range) planes, which have extra fuel capacity, are made of a carbon fiber that is lighter than the aluminum of traditional jets and burn less fuel because they have only two engines, compared with the four on many other long-haul jets.The flights will have 161 seats \u2014 67 in lie-flat business class and 94 in premium economy, which uses bigger seats that have more legroom than traditional coach seats but do not have the ability to become a bed.The nonstop flight is primarily meant to appeal to business travelers, which is why Newark airport was chosen as the New York gateway. It gives the airline easy access to business customers in Manhattan and in northern New Jersey.\u201cThe nonstop flight length is at least about two to three hours shorter than the one stopper, maybe even four hours,\u201d in terms of door-to-door travel time for most customers, said Mak Swee Wah, the airline\u2019s executive vice president, commercial. The company has not yet released pricing information.But on a flight that long, passenger comfort is a big issue.\u201cThe thing that the passengers view as most important will be comfort,\u201d Mr. Mak said.To that end, the airline is specially tailoring its in-flight meal service for the route. The exact schedule and menu options are still being decided, but the airline said that meal service on such a long flight takes more planning and orchestration than on shorter routes.As on other Singapore flights, travelers will be able to personalize what they watch with their seat-back entertainment system. Ahead of their flights, passengers will be able to create a playlists of movies, television shows and music that will be available onboard. The playlists will sync with their seat-back screens, and will even carry over to the return flight \u2014 no need on the return flight to fast-forward through a movie half-watched on the outbound leg.\u201cThis latest generation of planes has inbuilt features which enhance wellness,\u201d Mr. Mak said. Because the plane is not made of aluminum, which is more susceptible to corrosion than carbon fiber, the cabin can be kept at higher humidity.A350 cabins are also pressurized at a lower altitude than usual, so passengers feel as if they are flying at only 6,000 feet. (Most airplanes are pressurized to 8,000 feet.) The cabin features an LED lighting system that can mimic different times of the day, helping customers combat jet lag before they even reset their watches or sync their phones to a new time zone.\u201cWhat makes the airplane perfect for this kind of mission, first of all, is that it\u2019s capable of doing it,\u201d said Marisa Lucas Ugena, Airbus\u2019s head of A350 product marketing. \u201cThe key factor for Singapore Airlines is that this aircraft is extremely efficient. It\u2019s allowing them to reopen this service and make money on it.\u201d\u201cIt was a product that was very well received,\u201d Mr. Mak said. \u201cUnfortunately, the economics at that time were challenging. The A340 was not the most efficient plane, and a number of other factors made it not economical to carry on.\u201dThose Airbus A340s were configured to make the New York-to-Singapore flights possible and relatively cost-effective, but that meant it was not economical to use them on any other routes. So when Singapore Airlines ended the route in 2013, those planes were also pulled from service. The new A350s are more integrated into the Singapore Airlines fleet.\u201cBeing part of the larger pool makes the economics of the operation more sound,\u201d Mr. Mak said.In recent years, there has been a surge in ultra-long-haul flights as low fuel prices and new aircraft that are lighter weight and more efficient have made them cheaper to operate than before. Ten years ago, there were 10 ultra-long-haul flights, according to Samuel Engel, the senior vice president of aviation at the consulting group ICF. Today, there are 23 such routes in service, with more set to start in the coming months. He considers a flight to be ultra-long-haul if it travels more than 8,000 miles nonstop or takes more than 15 hours.\u201cThis really is a case of the technology opening up new possibilities to the economics,\u201d Mr. Engel said. And people have always been fascinated with the idea of traveling to far-off places, he added.\u201cWe\u2019re partly fascinated by the magic of being able to teleport yourself to Kowloon, as it were,\u201d he said, referring to the area of Hong Kong, \u201cin a good night\u2019s sleep and a movie.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oh, What a Stupid Trade War (Very Slightly Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistMy regular column for tomorrow is about health care, but I felt I needed to weigh in on this idiocy, and not just on Twitter.The official \u2013 and legal \u2013 justification for the steel and aluminum tariffs is national security. That\u2019s an obviously fraudulent rationale, given that the main direct victims are democratic allies. But Trump and co. presumably don\u2019t care about telling lies with regard to economic policy, since that\u2019s what they do about everything. They would see it as all fair game if the policy delivered job gains Trump could trumpet. Will it?OK, here\u2019s the point where being a card-carrying economist gets me into a bit of trouble. The proper answer about the job-creation or -destruction effect of a trade policy \u2013 any trade policy, no matter how well or badly conceived \u2013 is basically zero.Why? The Fed is currently on a path of gradually raising interest rates, because it believes we\u2019re more or less at full employment. Even if tariffs were expansionary, that would just make the Fed raise rates faster, which would in turn crowd out jobs in other industries: construction would be hurt by rising rates, the dollar would get stronger making U.S. manufacturing less competitive, and so on. So all my professional training wants me to dismiss the jobs question as off-base.And the answer, almost surely, is that this trade war will actually be a job-killer, not a job-creator, for two reasons.First, Trump is putting tariffs on intermediate goods \u2013 goods that are used as inputs into the production of other things, some of which themselves have to compete on world markets. Most obviously, cars and other durable manufactured goods will become more expensive to produce, which means that we\u2019ll sell less of them; and whatever gains there are in primary metals employment will be offset by job losses in downstream industries.Playing with the numbers, it seems highly likely that even this direct effect is a net negative for employment.Second, other countries will retaliate against U.S. exports, costing jobs in everything from motorcycles to sausages.In some ways this situation reminds me of George W. Bush\u2019s steel tariffs, which were motivated in part by hubris: the Bush administration thought of America as the world\u2019s unchallengeable superpower, which we were in military terms; they failed to recognize that we were by no means equally dominant in economics and trade, and had a lot to lose from trade conflict. They quickly got schooled by an angry European Union, and backed down.In Trump\u2019s case I think it\u2019s a different kind of illusion: he imagines that because we run trade deficits, importing more from other countries than they sell to us, we have little to lose, and the rest of the world will soon submit to his will. But he\u2019s wrong, for at least four reasons.First, while we export less than we import, we still export a lot; tit-for-tat trade retaliation will hurt a lot of American workers (and especially farmers), quite a few of whom voted for Trump and will now find themselves feeling betrayed.Second, modern trade is complicated \u2013 it\u2019s not just countries selling final goods to each other, it\u2019s a matter of complex value chains, which the Trump trade war will disrupt. This will produce a lot of American losers, even if they aren\u2019t directly employed producing exported goods.Third, if it spirals further, a trade war will raise consumer prices. At a time when Trump is desperately trying to convince ordinary families that they got something from his tax cut, it wouldn\u2019t take much to swamp whatever tiny gains they received.Finally \u2013 and I think this is really important \u2013 we\u2019re dealing with real countries here, mainly democracies. Real countries have real politics; they have pride; and their electorates really, really don\u2019t like Trump. This means that even if their leaders might want to make concessions, their voters probably won\u2019t allow it.Consider the case of Canada, a small, mild-mannered neighbor that could be badly hurt by a trade war with its giant neighbor. You might think this would make the Canadians much more easily intimidated than the EU, which is just as much an economic superpower as we are. But even if the Trudeau government were inclined to give in (so far, top officials like Chrystia Freeland sound angrier than I\u2019ve ever heard them), they\u2019d face a huge backlash from Canadian voters for anything that looked like a surrender to the vile bully next door.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S.-China Trade Talks End With Strong Demands, but Few Signs of a Deal", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Senior Chinese and American officials concluded two days of negotiations on Friday with no deal and no date set for further talks, as the United States stepped up its demands for Chinese concessions to avert a potential trade war.The American negotiating team, which included Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the United States trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, headed for the airport after the talks and did not release a statement. But a list of demands that the group took into the meeting called for reducing the United States\u2019 trade gap with China by $200 billion over the next two years and a halt on Chinese subsidies for advanced manufacturing sectors.The demands, which spread on Chinese social media and were confirmed by a person close to the negotiations, suggested that both sides hardened their positions this week despite the two days of talks. Senior Chinese officials and their advisers were also sending a deliberate message to the West that the days of Beijing being conciliatory were over, and that China was staking out its own position in the negotiations.The person close to the negotiations insisted on anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities.The extensive list of United States trade demands was unexpectedly sweeping, and showed that the Trump administration has no intention of backing down despite Beijing\u2019s assertive stance in the last few days. \u201cThe list reads like the terms for a surrender rather than a basis for negotiation,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University.Here are the highlights of the demands:China must \u2026\u25a0 Cut its trade surplus by $100 billion in the 12 months starting in June, and by another $100 billion in the following 12 months.\u25a0 Halt all subsidies to advanced manufacturing industries in its so-called Made In China 2025 program. The program covers 10 sectors, including aircraft manufacturing, electric cars, robotics, computer microchips and artificial intelligence.\u25a0 Accept that the United States may restrict imports from the industries under Made in China 2025.\u25a0 Take \u201cimmediate, verifiable steps\u201d to halt cyberespionage into commercial networks in the United States.\u25a0 Strengthen intellectual property protections.\u25a0 Accept United States restrictions on Chinese investments in sensitive technologies without retaliating.\u25a0 Cut its tariffs, which currently average 10 percent, to the same level as in the United States, where they average 3.5 percent for all \u201cnoncritical sectors.\u201d\u25a0 Open up its services and agricultural sectors to full American competition.The United States also stipulated that the two sides should meet every quarter to review progress.Chinese officials put the talks in a positive light. \u201cThe two sides agreed that a sound and stable China-U.S. trade relationship is crucial for both, and they are committed to resolving relevant economic and trade issues through dialogue and consultation,\u201d Xinhua, the official news agency, said soon after the talks ended.But the negotiations also highlighted key differences \u2014 and the American delegation\u2019s tight-lipped departure from Diaoyutai, the parklike enclosure of guesthouses where the talks were held, suggested that the two sides had made little headway in solving them.Before the trade talks began, people involved in China\u2019s policymaking said, Beijing was willing to act on some concessions previously laid out by President Xi Jinping. Among the most notable was a willingness to make it slightly easier for foreign automakers and financial services companies to compete in China.But China has its own demands. Beijing wants the United States to relax restrictions on exports of high-tech commercial products that may have military applications. During the trade talks here this week, Chinese officials also took issue with the penalties that American officials imposed last month on ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company, for repeatedly violating United States sanctions on Iran.The Commerce Department banned all shipments of American wares to ZTE, including chips and other equipment that are essential to many of the company\u2019s products. The move appears to have strengthened China\u2019s resolve to continue its drive for self-sufficiency and to curb imports in various high-tech fields.China\u2019s push to upgrade its technology accounts for many of its disagreements with the United States. The American document reiterated Trump administration calls for a broad halt of Chinese subsidies to manufacturers in advanced technology industries. And Chinese officials have defended the Made in 2025 program as essential to upgrading the economy and have said they would not agree to any limits on the Made in China program.Beijing has said it would be willing to reduce some trade barriers, but only if the United States also lowered trade barriers. Chinese officials particularly object to American limits on the export of high-tech goods that have both civilian and military applications, contending that these restrictions prevent sizable potential exports.They also objected to United States demands for a specific cut in the bilateral surplus. Li Gang, the vice president of the Commerce Ministry\u2019s research and training institute, said in a separate interview last month that a $100 billion cut in the surplus was \u201cimpossible.\u201d China\u2019s surplus has been widening lately as the United States economy grows fairly strongly and takes in more imports.The Commerce Department announced on Thursday in Washington that the trade imbalance with China had widened slightly in March compared with the same month a year ago, although it narrowed slightly compared with February, possibly for seasonal reasons.The lack of a deal this week, as well as the failure to schedule further talks right away, does not rule out the possibility that Chinese negotiators will visit the United States next month for further talks. One possibility that American officials have considered is whether China might send Vice President Wang Qishan, who is close to Mr. Xi, on a follow-up trip.So far, the Chinese side has been led by Liu He, a Politburo member who is also the vice premier for finance, trade and technology.Trade experts have been saying for weeks that Chinese officials would like to resolve the dispute with the United States so that they can go back to focusing on issues closer to home.\u201cThat\u2019s the immediate problem, because it\u2019s a headache for them that\u2019s distracting from a very pressing domestic agenda,\u201d said Christopher K. Johnson, a former C.I.A. officer who analyzed China and now holds the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The Beijing talks were unlikely to result in a comprehensive deal, but experts said they could still be a first step toward reaching some sort of accord.\u201cThere\u2019s no way our team is going to risk signing up to something without getting back here and making sure that Trump is happy with it first,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s also some optics where Trump wants to be seen standing with Wang Qishan and striking the deal.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019re still several jumps down the track from that.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Teacher Pay Is So Low in Some U.S. School Districts That They\u2019re Recruiting Overseas", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGLENDALE, Ariz. \u2014 The latest wave of foreign workers sweeping into American jobs brought Donato Soberano from the Philippines to Arizona two years ago. He had to pay thousands of dollars to a job broker and lived for a time in an apartment with five other Filipino workers. The lure is the pay \u2014 10 times more than what he made doing the same work back home.But Mr. Soberano is not a hospitality worker or a home health aide. He is in another line of work that increasingly pays too little to attract enough Americans: Mr. Soberano is a public school teacher.\u201cIn these times, you have to be innovative and creative in recruiting,\u201d said Patricia Davis-Tussey, Pendergast\u2019s head of human resources. \u201cWe embrace diversity and really gain a lot from the cultural exchange experience. Our students do as well.\u201dThe district, which covers parts of Glendale, Avondale and north Phoenix, is a hotbed of activism in the teacher walkout movement, known as #RedforEd. Picketing educators say they have had to move in with their parents, apply for food stamps and pay out of pocket for classroom essentials like graph paper and science supplies. They argue that taxes are too low to adequately fund schools, or for teachers to secure a middle-class lifestyle.In response to the teacher walkout, Republican lawmakers introduced a budget that provides new funding for salaries and classrooms. But leaders of the #RedForEd movement said the bill fell far short of their demands, and would restore only about a quarter of the $1.1 billion in annual cuts that they say schools have weathered since the last recession.In Pendergast, where salaries of around $40,000 are a source of pain and protest for the district\u2019s American educators, Mr. Soberano is thankful for the pay.Much like other foreign workers, he went into debt to find a job in the United States. He said he used savings and a bank loan to pay $12,500, about three years\u2019 worth of his salary in the Philippines, to Petro-Fil Manpower Services. That is a Filipino company of Ligaya Avenida, a California-based consultant who recruits and screens teachers for the J-1.The payment covered Mr. Soberano\u2019s airfare and rent for his first few months in Arizona, as well as a $2,500 fee for Ms. Avenida and a fee of several thousand dollars to Alliance Abroad Group, a Texas-based company that is an official State Department sponsor for J-1 visa holders. The J-1 lasts three years, with the option for two one-year extensions. For each year he works in the United States, Mr. Soberano will owe Alliance Abroad an additional $1,000 visa renewal fee.\u201cYou have to make some sacrifices to leave your family way back home,\u201d Mr. Soberano said. Every night, he prepares lessons for his seventh- and eighth-grade science students, and every morning, he wakes up at 4 a.m. to video chat with his wife and two teenage daughters, who are ending their day in Manila. Despite their separation, he said the experience has been rewarding, \u201cteaching in a different culture, but also, financially.\u201dThe school districts that recruit teachers like Mr. Soberano say that they have few other options, because they can\u2019t find enough American educators willing to work for the pay that\u2019s offered. They say that the foreign teachers are being given valuable opportunities, and that American students are enriched by learning from them. But critics argue the teachers are being taken advantage of in a practice that helps keep wages low and perpetuates yearslong austerity policies.Though J-1 teachers account for only a tiny share of Arizona\u2019s 60,000 public schoolteachers, international recruitment has spread quickly in recent years, as sponsor companies market themselves to districts facing shortages and word spreads among administrators. According to the State Department, 183 Arizona teachers were granted new J-1 visas last year, up from 17 in 2010.\u201cRather than increase salaries, districts may once again resort to recruiting internationally as a way to solve the teacher shortage,\u201d Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, a national teachers\u2019 union, said in a statement. She added that while her union \u201cwill fight for everyone working in our communities and educating our kids to have fair wages, rights and workplace protections regardless of where they\u2019re from, the use of the J-1 visa program to fill long-term shortages is an abuse of an exchange program.\u201dAdministrators and researchers say experienced foreign educators can be a better option for students than the substitutes who would otherwise fill these positions. But research is clear that teacher churn negatively impacts academic achievement. J-1 teachers are, because of the visa\u2019s limitations, temporary; and without higher pay and regular raises, administrators in these districts say it will be impossible to attract enough American teachers and keep them in the classroom.During the recession, districts found it easier to hire American workers, since more of them were looking to teach. But as the economy picked back up, hiring became difficult in states like Arizona, which have pursued years of tax cuts that have dampened school budgets and teacher pay. The Pendergast district has lost $1.6 million over the past five years because of state and local cuts, according to administrators.The superintendent, Lily Matos DeBlieux, has sought private donations to fund a Spanish-English dual-language program, a monthly lunch discussion to help parents navigate their children\u2019s education and many other efforts. \u201cWith the little we have, we have done an incredible job,\u201d she said.But hiring remains a challenge. Even with 48 J-1 visa-holders teaching this year, Pendergast has still had to rely on 20 long-term substitutes, said Ms. Davis-Tussey, the chief of human resources.In addition to interviewing international candidates via Skype, district staff members have traveled to Manila several times since 2015 to interview teachers. Mr. Soberano met with the district there in June 2016, and just two months later, arrived in Arizona to teach at Sunset Ridge Elementary School in Glendale. The Philippines was the top sender of J-1 teachers to the United States in 2017, followed by Jamaica and China.The 15,000-mile round-trips made sense, Ms. Davis-Tussey said. Many short-staffed schools turn to Teach for America, which recruits recent college graduates and career-changers for two-year stints in the classroom. But to hire a Teach for America recruit, who may have no teaching experience or coursework in education, the district must pay $5,000 per teacher, in addition to salaries.For a similar amount, a single trip to the Philippines can net dozens of candidates, all of whom, as required by the J-1 program, have degrees in education or the subjects they teach, and at least two years of experience in a Filipino school.Mr. Soberano holds one bachelor\u2019s degree in education, with a focus on physics, and another in philosophy. He has also studied theology. He has over 20 years of classroom experience.The Pendergast district did not owe any money to the companies that connected it with recruits in Manila. Those costs were borne by the Filipino teachers.James Bell, president of Alliance Abroad, the visa sponsor, said a financial arrangement like Mr. Soberano\u2019s is just one of several models the company uses, and that in some cases, school districts pay visa3,5 renewal fees. Alliance Abroad sponsors several hundred J-1 visa holders each year, according to Mr. Bell, working primarily in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas and Utah. He said the biggest demand was for special-education teachers, though districts also looked to hire in science, math and foreign languages.In Gila Bend, a small town 70 miles southwest of Phoenix, 11 Filipino teachers who room together in several shared apartments commute to work by van 100 miles round-trip each day, according to Peggy Perry, a secretary in the district\u2019s central office. In Casa Grande, halfway between Phoenix and Tucson, about 25 Filipino teachers with J-1 visas are teaching science, math, special education and English, said Mary Ann Amerson, head of human resources for the Casa Grande Union High School District.The district works with Ms. Avenida, the California-based consultant, to find the teachers and interview them via Skype. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay any money for it,\u201d Ms. Amerson said. The recruits pay the fees.Ms. Avenida said her company, which uses the name Avenida International Consultants in the United States, recruited 250 Filipino teachers with J-1 visas in 2017. According to State Department data, that would account for more than half the total number of J-1 visa holders who arrived from the Philippines last year.\u201cSomebody has to foot the bill,\u201d she said \u2014 and in a climate of tight school budgets, that somebody is the teacher.In Mr. Soberano\u2019s case, it was not until his second year on the job that he had paid back the money he owed and was able to begin sending some home to his family. He has had to live austerely. In his first year in Arizona, he shared an apartment with five other Filipino teachers, and he now rents a room in the home of a Filipino-American family.Still, he said he was nothing but grateful for the opportunity. \u201cThe district is very supportive,\u201d he said. Pendergast created a welcome committee to assist the Filipino teachers, and colleagues pitched in by buying groceries and driving the newcomers to work.In addition to financial challenges, foreign educators face instructional ones. Administrators across the country who work with J-1 visa holders say the teachers must learn the federal requirement for inclusion, which requires that disabled children be taught alongside nondisabled peers, in the least restrictive environment possible.And classroom management techniques differ across cultures. \u201cIn the Philippines, the teacher there is really an authority figure,\u201d Mr. Soberano said. \u201cOnce I stood in front of the class, everybody kept quiet.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the case in Arizona.\u201cOne thing I also learned is to be friends with the students,\u201d Mr. Soberano added, \u201cto know more about each one and especially their family. How are they doing? When you understand them, I remove that kind of problem.\u201dState Department regulations require J-1 teachers to engage in cultural exchange activities with their students. The J-1 program was created by the 1961 Fulbright-Hayes Act, with the purpose of fostering understanding between nations. Mr. Soberano said that once a month, he teaches a lesson on Filipino culture, and that his students have been most interested in discussing the differences between the Filipino and American education systems. In the Philippines, Mr. Soberano tells them, school is stricter and more academically challenging.New regulations from the State Department, which went into effect in 2016, require J-1 holders to return to their home countries for at least two years after their visas expire before reapplying. Mr. Soberano said he may do that. But his wish is to reside legally in the United States and work long-term as a teacher. \u201cI would love to bring my family here,\u201d he said.In Denver public schools, 20 bilingual education teachers hold H-1Bs and about three hold J-1s. But in the future, the district said, it may expand its use of the J-1.\u201cWe still don\u2019t have enough people to fill the openings,\u201d said Bart Muller, the managing director of employee and labor relations for the system. \u201cThe political environment has been a little challenging over the last year and a half. The bottom line is there are a lot more hoops to jump through with H-1B, while J-1 is fairly simple. You can do it expeditiously.\u201dAnd in Arizona, where many teachers are expected to improve test scores using aging textbooks inside buildings in need of repair, districts worry that a modest increase in teacher salaries and school funding won\u2019t be enough to persuade more local candidates to enter the profession.\u201cQuite frankly, for a lot of the teachers, some of the fun and creativity has been taken out of it with mandates,\u201d said Ms. Amerson, the head of human resources in Casa Grande. \u201cIt seems like we spend the whole entire second semester testing kids.\u201dIn Pendergast, Ms. Davis-Tussey agreed that higher pay alone would not be enough to fill the empty jobs that have forced her to look to the Philippines.\u201cThat respect for the profession is just as important as the money,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for a long time, teachers have felt, not only did they not have money, but what they were doing was being brushed aside and not respected.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congress Approves First Big Dodd-Frank Rollback", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A decade after the global financial crisis tipped the United States into a recession, Congress agreed on Tuesday to free thousands of small and medium-sized banks from strict rules that had been enacted as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to prevent another meltdown.In a rare demonstration of bipartisanship, the House voted 258-159 to approve a regulatory rollback that passed the Senate this year, handing a significant victory to President Trump, who has promised to \u201cdo a big number on Dodd-Frank.\u201dThe bill stops far short of unwinding the toughened regulatory regime put in place to prevent the nation\u2019s biggest banks from engaging in risky behavior, but it represents a substantial watering down of Obama-era rules governing a large swath of the banking system. The legislation will leave fewer than 10 big banks in the United States subject to stricter federal oversight, freeing thousands of banks with less than $250 billion in assets from a post-crisis crackdown that they have long complained is too onerous.Republican lawmakers and the banking industry cheered a measure they said would help unshackle banks \u2014 and the economy \u2014 from regulatory burdens.Paul D. Ryan, the House Speaker and Wisconsin Republican, said the bill\u2019s passage was a step toward \u201cfreeing our economy from overregulation.\u201d\u201cOur smaller banks are engines of growth,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBy lending to small businesses and offering banking services for consumers, these institutions are and will remain vital for millions of Americans who participate in our economy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bad bill under the guise of helping community banks,\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic minority leader, said during debate on the House floor on Tuesday. \u201cThe bill would take us back to the days when unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited an historic financial meltdown.\u201dThe Dodd-Frank bill was a Democrat-led initiative that passed with the support of just three Republicans and it has been under constant attack from Republicans ever since. Left-leaning lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio have blasted their more moderate colleagues, like Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, for supporting the legislation, and Democratic leaders have tried to prevent any lawmakers from crossing the aisle to support the bill.Ms. Pelosi and Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, wrote a letter to their House colleagues urging them not to support the bill. \u201cWe must not allow the G.O.P. Congress to drag us back to the same lack of oversight that ignited the Great Recession,\u201d they wrote.The overtures did not prevent several Democrats from crossing party lines in favor of the legislation \u2014 33 Democrats voted for it, and one Republican, Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, voted against it.Once the bill is signed by Mr. Trump, small and medium-sized banks will no longer be required to undergo \u201cstress tests\u201d aimed at measuring their ability to withstand a severe economic downturn. The legislation also offers a reprieve to big \u2014 but not behemoth \u2014 banks, allowing large institutions like American Express and BB & T to no longer be deemed \u201csystemically important\u201d and subject to stricter oversight.The bill also exempts some loan originators, including small lenders, from certain disclosure requirements under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Democrats say this will open the door to discriminatory practices because the rules required collection of credit scores, loan amounts and interest rates in an effort to expose redlining and lending discrimination.While the legislation does little to help the very largest banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, the Trump administration has been working behind the scenes through its regulatory agencies to weaken capital requirements and ease other restrictions on such firms.Republicans saw Tuesday\u2019s vote as merely the beginning, not the end, of the Dodd-Frank legislative rollback.For years, House Republicans have been pushing for a more significant overhaul of Dodd-Frank and last year passed the Financial Choice Act, which would have crippled the consumer bureau and revoked the Volcker Rule. However, that bill stood no chance of gaining Democratic support in the Senate and Republicans, looking to score a victory before the midterm elections, ultimately chose the pragmatic path of approving the bipartisan Senate legislation.Republicans, and some Democrats, say that the Dodd-Frank law has unnecessarily hurt small- and medium-sized banks that did not play a role in the financial crisis and have been collateral damage in Washington\u2019s campaign to corral their bigger brethren. They say the regulations have cut off the flow of credit to many Americans who depend on smaller banks for business and personal loans.Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the bill was a victory for Americans who depend on small banks and credit unions.\u201cThe Main Street banks and credit unions that these people depend on, they\u2019ve been suffering, they\u2019ve been suffering for years under the weight, the load, the volume, the complexity and cost of heavy Washington bureaucratic red tape,\u201d he said.Mr. Hensarling said he remained hopeful that the Senate would consider some of the other, smaller deregulation bills that the House has passed, but their fates remain uncertain.Aaron Cutler, a former senior policy adviser to House Republicans and now a partner at Hogan Lovells, said the bill was just a first step. \u201cHopefully this is the first of many legislative pieces to come that improve financial regulations,\u201d he said.Conservative groups that have been strong opponents of Dodd-Frank say more must be done to fix the regulatory overreach created by the crisis.\u201cThe legislation unfortunately leaves intact the bulk of Dodd-Frank, including its most crushing burdens on consumers, investors, and entrepreneurs,\u201d said John Berlau, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank. \u201cTo provide real financial relief for Americans, much more is required of Congress, the president and regulatory agencies.\u201dTo those who lived through the financial crisis, the deregulatory efforts have prompted concern.Sarah Bloom Raskin, who was deputy Treasury Secretary during the Obama administration, said she was worried about the cumulative effect of the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory efforts. She said that there has been a troubling lack of economic analysis about the policies that are being put in place.\u201cOverall resilience is being weakened in unexamined ways,\u201d Ms. Raskin said.Senior White House officials said after the bill passed that they hoped to get it to Mr. Trump\u2019s desk for signing before Memorial Day. While they would not say that it fulfilled the president\u2019s promise of repealing Dodd-Frank, they called it an important step toward ridding the economy of regulations that have held back growth.Earlier versions of this article incorrectly identified the name of the think tank where John Berlau is a senior fellow. It is the Competitive Enterprise Institute, not the Conservative Enterprise Institute.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Save the Saudi Golden Goose", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Wald is the author of \u201cSaudi, Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom\u2019s Pursuit of Profit and Power.\u201dFor almost 40 years, Saudi Aramco has operated with a tremendous degree of independence for a national oil company. That has worked well for the company and for the country: Aramco has prospered financially and almost single-handedly funded the Saudi state and the royal family.But that could all be changing. Mohammed bin Salman, the hugely popular crown prince, is reshaping his country, and he seems intent on putting his stamp on Aramco. There are signs that the government is exerting new control over Aramco\u2019s most fundamental decisions.This is a mistake. Too much interference could destabilize the company and, by extension, a large part of the Saudi economy. When it comes to the future of Aramco, the government in Riyadh needs to let the professionals do their jobs.Aramco is unique among national oil companies. Rather than seizing the company through nationalization, the Saudi government purchased Aramco from its American owners in transactions in the 1970s. The Saudi leadership in the 1970s insisted on a legal purchase to avoid disrupting a hugely profitable enterprise.After the purchase, the Saudi government essentially left the business to Aramco employees who were, at the time, a mix of American and Saudi managers. In less than a decade, Saudi executives took the reins. Many of them had worked their way up within Aramco starting when they were teenagers. The professional oilmen were in charge.The company was owned by Saudi Arabia, but it collected its own revenue and controlled its own finances. Ali al-Naimi, Aramco\u2019s chief executive from 1988 to 1995, told me recently that the Saudi finance ministry tried to co-opt the company\u2019s finances in the 1980s. \u201cWhat they wanted was all the income to come to the ministry and they dole out our expenditures,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said no way. The income comes to us and we give you royalty, taxes and dividends from our profits. We cannot have the income come to you directly.\u201dThe king at the time, Fahd, sided with Mr. Naimi, because he understood that Aramco\u2019s independence was vital to the success of the venture and thus the wealth of the Saudi state, people and royal family.Therein lies the problem. The company has always made its own decisions about its next steps. It is now waiting for direction from the outside. Even the identity of this \u201cshareholder\u201d is unclear. Who really owns Aramco? The official company line is that it is owned by the Saudi government. But what does that mean? Mr. Naimi made sure that the finance ministry stayed far away from Aramco\u2019s revenue, and although the oil ministry represents Saudi Arabia in OPEC, it does not determine Aramco\u2019s strategy.But right now, and for the foreseeable future, Saudi Arabia still depends on Aramco for its wealth, and the monarchy depends on that wealth for its power. Without a strong, independent Aramco, power could be precarious.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Attacks on Obamacare, the Uninsured Rate Held Steady Last Year", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe numbers suggest a surprising resilience of the health law.Among states that expanded their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate actually fell last year. Among states that didn\u2019t expand, it rose a little.Over all, Obamacare has substantially reduced the number of Americans without insurance. According to the report, 19.3 million fewer people were living without health insurance in 2017 compared with 2010, when the Affordable Care Act passed Congress.New health insurance options aren\u2019t the only thing that has changed since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.

{"Headline": "In Devastated Puerto Rico, Universities Get Just a Fraction of Storm Aid", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Since Hurricane Maria\u2019s deadly rampage last September, the Education Department has doled out tens of millions of taxpayer dollars in disaster relief to colleges and universities supposedly affected by last year\u2019s hurricanes.Only a fraction has gone to institutions where the storm had its most profound impact: Puerto Rico.Instead, elite institutions like New York University and the University of Southern California have received aid, as have Liberty University, the Christian school in Virginia run by President Trump\u2019s ally Jerry Falwell Jr., and Grand Canyon University, a Christian, for-profit college in Arizona. Some of those universities have been clear about why they took the money \u2014 N.Y.U. had already enrolled Puerto Rican students temporarily displaced by the storm when the Education Department forwarded funds to defray the costs. Others, like Grand Canyon, have refused to explain with any detail.And while Puerto Rico\u2019s share of the aid was roughly in line with states also affected by last year\u2019s hurricanes, like Florida, the devastation is not at all comparable.In Puerto Rico, some academic and administrative buildings at colleges and universities were completely destroyed; wooden panels still cover windows and block passageways to molding, stench-filled rooms. Structural damage has run up such astronomical insurance costs that institutions cannot afford the 2 percent deductibles.Others \u201chave stayed without their families because they wanted to continue their studies, but they\u2019re nervous,\u201d Ms. Cividanes-Lago said. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely fragile. We\u2019re very vulnerable.\u201dNow, as the Education Department prepares to dispense another $175 million in aid to higher education institutions, members of Congress and education advocates are pleading for a change in course. Lawmakers urged the department to abandon an application that is estimated to take 40 hours \u2014 and is not offered in Spanish. They say it would be too burdensome for institutions on an island that still lacks access to water and electricity, let alone functional technology.\u201cWe believe that the department\u2019s proposal to require applicants to fill out immense amounts of paperwork for disaster relief funds is yet another example of the Trump administration\u2019s failure to prioritize Puerto Rico,\u201d said the letter, drafted by Representatives Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez and Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, all Democrats of New York.A New York Times analysis of the $41 million in total aid disbursements made by the department shows that $8.9 million went to institutions in Puerto Rico, $4 million went to Texas, $8 million to Florida and $53,915 to the Virgin Islands.Congressional leaders and Puerto Rico higher education advocates say that is not nearly enough. Some pointed to a Monday announcement from Ms. DeVos on disaster aid to primary and secondary schools to illustrate this point. The department said it would provide $693 million in disaster aid to K-12 school systems affected by natural disasters, with the vast majority, $589 million, going to Puerto Rico.\u201cYou can see that those are more in line with the need of the areas, so that begs the question, Why is the proportion so different in Puerto Rico when it came to funds for higher education?\u201d said Enrique Fern\u00e1ndez-Toledo, director of the Puerto Rico Relief and Economic Policy Initiative at the Center for American Progress.In November, the Hispanic Association of Colleges & Universities submitted a request to Ms. DeVos on behalf of 65 of Puerto Rico\u2019s private and public universities to at least double the island\u2019s total allocation of work-study grants to help students work their way through college. Only 5 percent of students on the island who qualify for federal need-based aid received federal work-study funding, but more than 80 percent of students work part-time jobs to help pay their way.After the hurricane, those jobs vanished. The proposed fund would have helped make up lost wages for all students with new tutoring jobs and hurricane relief work.The request was not granted.In March, the department released the data. Five Puerto Rico institutions did top the list of those that received the largest sums, but the island\u2019s schools accounted for only 13 of the 41 institutions that received more than $100,000. On the mainland, the schools that received the largest disbursements \u2014 $200,000 or more \u2014 were not in areas in the path of the hurricane.And while the department \u201cstrongly urged\u201d institutions to award the money to students affected by the hurricane, it did not require them to.Department officials said the disbursements were based on a statutory formula, authorized by Congress.\u201cIf members are unhappy with the allocation, then they should change the language in the statute and we\u2019d be happy to oblige,\u201d said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the department.Institutions were deemed eligible if they participated in the two financial aid programs from which the money was dispensed, or they accepted more than 20 students from affected areas.\u201cWe are very sensitive to concerns that the universities in Puerto Rico have about skimming students who were important to their own academic mission,\u201d said John Beckman, a spokesman for the university.Grand Canyon University, which received about $239,000, would not say how many affected students were enrolled. A Liberty University official said the school did not count out the number of students who benefited from its $200,000 award, but officials said the university financially supported students, mainly from Florida, in a number of ways after the hurricane.Southern New Hampshire said it had more than 11,000 students from the affected states, about 50 of whom were from Puerto Rico, and planned to return any unused funds to the Education Department.The University of Florida disbursed its first federal aid allocation of $77,453 to 38 students, said Rick Wilder, the director of student financial affairs. The remainder will be reserved for returning students who demonstrate need next year.\u201cWe\u2019re always excited to get additional funding for any needy students,\u201d Mr. Wilder said.In the coming months, the Education Department will award $100 million in additional emergency funding to colleges and universities and their students in areas directly affected by hurricanes and wildfires, and $75 million to help defray costs for those that took in students from the affected areas.But congressional leaders wrote last month that the voluminous application, which requires two applications and a detailed accounting of expenses and funding received thus far, would place on Puerto Rico a \u201csignificant and unnecessary burden that was never intended by Congress.\u201dLawmakers noted that the application process for this round of funding was markedly different from the other disaster relief disbursements of similar scale. In 2005, after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf Coast, institutions in Louisiana and Mississippi were able to gain access to $190 million in congressionally appropriated funds without an application.And they noted of the most recent disbursements: \u201cIt is unclear why institutions located in the disaster areas and experienced greater harm are being subjected to disproportionate hurdles relative to institutions that experienced no damage at all.\u201dLillian Negr\u00f3n Col\u00f3n, president of the Universidad Central de Bayam\u00f3n and president of ACUP, wrote that the department\u2019s application \u201cconstitutes an overwhelming task at a most critical point.\u201d\u201cIn just a few months, the island will be entering its 2018 hurricane season,\u201d she said, \u201cand our people, including us who are trying to keep institutions of higher learning operational, are still struggling.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described imprecisely how New York University used hurricane relief funds from the Department of Education. N.Y.U. was given funds to defray the costs of Puerto Rican students it had enrolled at the university, not to enroll Puerto Rican students temporarily.Lindsey Cook contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Parent Company Helped Shape Saudi Arabia\u2019s Reform Movement", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe price of oil was in free fall and a youthful population restive.So the government of Saudi Arabia turned in recent years to the parent company of the political data firm Cambridge Analytica for help, according to Western consultants who worked in the kingdom, company executives and a review of public documents.The consultants and executives spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were bound by nondisclosure agreements.Under King Salman, who came to power in January 2015, the Saudis have turned to an array of consultants as crashing oil prices laid bare the kingdom\u2019s lack of economic diversification. Some consultants, such as McKinsey & Company and the Boston Consulting Group, carried blue chip pedigrees, while SCL, founded in 1993 as Strategic Communication Laboratories, was known for its clandestine work.The notion that the company\u2019s psychological research played a role in plotting out the Saudi reform efforts could fuel renewed debate about the intentions of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The prince is variously seen as his region\u2019s most important social and economic reformer, a ruthless opportunist or some combination of the two.SCL\u2019s work was shrouded in secrecy, but one former analyst at the company, James Lovell, who listed the Saudi project on his LinkedIn profile, said he \u201canalysed focus group data, contributed to presentations and wrote reports for a research project on economic reform in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d A project manager at Cambridge Analytica, Alexandra Wicksell, wrote in her profile on the same site that the work was \u201cfocused on developing the national reform initiative for the country\u2019s drive to diversify its economy away from its oil dependency.\u201dOthers who saw the work described it less benignly.One Western consultant, who was not involved in the project but who viewed SCL\u2019s report, referred to the firm\u2019s finding as \u201cMachiavellian,\u201d calling it a manual for the royals to manage popular sentiment by figuring out where they should loosen their grip. The consultant said the report used dozens of focus groups to examine levels of frustration and satisfaction, as well as the legitimacy of the royal family and the political structure, and showed there was widespread discontent.The consultant\u2019s account was consistent with that of a former employee at SCL. The company\u2019s work, said the former employee, was aimed at conducting a behavioral analysis of the population and then creating strategies to keep the government viable in an era of declining oil prices.A company executive referred to the work as advancing human rights but declined to comment further. The Saudi government declined to comment.The research by the consultancy was taking place against a bleak new reality. Oil fell to below $30 a barrel in 2016 from more than $100 in 2014. That presented severe economic risks in a country where 70 percent of the population is under 30.SCL had worked in Saudi Arabia before. It was listed among the countries where the firm had clients on a 2014 PowerPoint presentation obtained by The New York Times. Its most recent work was commissioned by the Saudi Ministry of Economy and Planning, one of the ministries carrying out the Vision 2030 plan.To what extent the company influenced the kingdom\u2019s plans is hard to say. But in Prince Mohammed\u2019s telling, winning over the population has been a critical first step.An earlier version of this article misstated when SCL Group conducted a project in Libya. It was after Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was no longer in power, not during his tenure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hand-Me-Down Plane That Crashed Reflects a Cuban Air Industry in Crisis", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Almost 40 years old by the time it crashed on Friday just outside of Havana, killing 110 people, the aging Boeing 737 had changed ownership nearly a half-dozen times, passing from operators in the United States to Canada, from Cameroon to the Caribbean.\u201cI actually flew that exact plane,\u201d said John Cox, the head of the consultancy Safety Operating Systems, who traced the aircraft\u2019s ownership back to 1979, when it was new and belonged to Piedmont Airlines, his former employer.Though the cause of the crash has not been determined, the plane itself is a powerful symbol of Cuba\u2019s troubled aviation industry. As tourism to the island surges, Cuba\u2019s national airline finds itself struggling to acquire enough planes to meet the demand and maintain its decrepit fleet.Cuba\u2019s economy has long been in shambles, and experts say the troubles plaguing its aviation sector stem from the same obstacles that have bedeviled the country for decades: economic mismanagement and the United States embargo of the island.Cuba\u2019s problems have gotten so bad that, a few weeks ago, the country grounded most of its domestic flights because of safety concerns over its fleet. To continue flying, officials have been forced to lease planes from foreign outfits that sometimes use decades-old planes, like the one that crashed and burned right after takeoff on Friday, killing nearly everyone on board.The old Boeing 737 had been leased to Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n, the state airline, by a relatively unknown Mexican company with just three aircraft in its fleet.Some aviation industry analysts were taken aback at the plane\u2019s advanced age.\u201cThat\u2019s one of the oldest passenger jets I have heard of that is still in service,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, an aviation and aerospace consulting company in Fairfax, Va.Though Mexican officials said the plane had passed safety inspections as recently as November, it is one of just 100 of its model still in circulation across the globe, reflecting the limited options the Cuban government has in order to continue operating its state airline.\u201cWhether the airline is going to survive is an open question,\u201d said George Farinas, a retired Delta pilot who works as a civil aviation inspector and is writing a book about the history of Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n. \u201cThey are in a major crisis right now.\u201dMr. Farinas said that Cuban officials even decided in the past against working with the Mexican company, Damojh Aerol\u00edneas, also known as Global Air, after the flight crew that came with the lease got lost in the air on one trip. But they eventually reversed the decision, he said, \u201cprobably out of desperation.\u201dAdel Yzquierdo Rodr\u00edguez, Cuba\u2019s transportation minister, said Saturday that Cubana had been renting the plane for less than a month from Damojh, and that under the rental arrangement, the Mexican owner was responsible for the aircraft\u2019s maintenance.Analysts sometimes disagree about which is more to blame for Cuba\u2019s troubled aviation industry: the American embargo of the island or the country\u2019s own history of economic mismanagement.Some experts say the sanctions have crippled the nation\u2019s ability to gain access to the vendors and financing needed to get new aircraft. The Cubans themselves have made the case numerous times, blaming the decades-old sanctions for their aging planes, which include Russian-made aircraft that are difficult to find parts for.\u201cIf it were not for the embargo, they would be able to access a robust capital market for financing Western aircraft,\u201d said Samuel Engel, the senior vice president at ICF Consulting and an expert in the international airline industry.But many analysts say that, while a process is involved, Cuba can indeed get access to such markets, as well as planes.\u201cThe embargo does play a role in inhibiting business with Cuba, but there are policies to promote the sale of aircraft,\u201d said Dallas Woodrum, an associate at Akin Gump in the firm\u2019s Washington office. \u201cWhether businesses decide to take advantage of that is a different question, and a matter of their risk tolerance and what type of reward they see.\u201dCuba also suffers from a cash flow problem that further hinders the purchase of international goods \u2014 a product of the sanctions but also, critics say, its poor stewardship of the economy.\u201cThe challenge is that they don\u2019t manage the industry well,\u201d said Emilio Morales, president of the Miami-based Havana Consulting Group, which focuses on the Cuban economy. \u201cThe business requires capital; it requires financing to maintain the planes.\u201dFounded in 1929, Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n was once the pride of the Caribbean, replete with modern planes and top-flight maintenance. But as with so many elements of Cuba\u2019s infrastructure and transportation, that progress began to slowly, and then suddenly halt, following the revolution, economic sanctions and, later, the fall of the Soviet Union, which had helped keep the nation afloat financially.Cars hailing from the 1960s roll down pockmarked streets, past unpainted buildings and under worn bridges. And while the government has maintained its commitment to social services, whether free health care or education, money has grown scarce.That reality has set in for the airline industry, leaving the state airline with limited options to upgrade old planes or get new ones.Cubana has struggled with a spotty safety record in the past \u2014 including several crashes in the late 1990s that left scores dead. The tragedies include crashes in Ecuador, Guatemala, Venezuela and off the island\u2019s southeast coast.Friday\u2019s crash occurred just after noon, following the plane\u2019s departure from Havana for the eastern city of Holgu\u00edn. Emergency workers and nearby residents raced to the scene, where the battered remnants of the plane kicked up plumes of thick smoke, trying to rescue survivors.Ramiro Santana Mart\u00ednez, 46, a construction worker who lives about 50 yards from the crash site, said he was near his house when he heard an explosion, quickly followed by a second one.He joined neighbors and strangers who converged on the smoldering husk of the plane, looking for survivors. Mr. Santana said charred bodies, some dismembered, were scattered across the site; some had been thrown clear of the wreckage.A volunteer rescuer spotted movement under some fallen branches: a woman\u2019s hand. Mr. Santana and others rushed to help pull the crying woman out and get her to an ambulance. She was burned and bloodied but conscious.Mr. Santana said he also helped pull out two other people, both men, who were breathing at the time but inert. Cuban officials said three women ended up surviving the crash, though they were in listed in \u201cextreme critical\u201d condition on Saturday.Mr. Yzquierdo, the transportation minister, said that among the 110 dead were 99 Cuban passengers, two Argentine passengers and two passengers from a disputed area of the Western Sahara.Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Yzquierdo, said that 15 victims had been identified so far, including 10 adults and five children.Those on board the plane included five crew members, all Mexican. As part of its contract, Cubana hired them to operate the aircraft, an agreement known as a wet lease.

{"Headline": "China Cuts Tariffs Ahead of U.S. Commerce Secretary\u2019s Visit to Beijing", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China announced Thursday evening that it would cut tariffs sharply on July 1 for an eclectic array of imported goods, the latest in a series of moves by Beijing to dismantle steep trade barriers at a time of rising frictions with the United States.The tariff cuts came less than two days before Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is due in Beijing for wide-ranging talks aimed at addressing American frustrations with China\u2019s $375 billion bilateral trade surplus with the United States. But the categories the Chinese Finance Ministry selected for tariff cuts cover few American goods, and appeared to be targeted at China\u2019s goal of developing sophisticated industries rather than low-value mass manufacturing.The moves came as China and the United States, the world\u2019s two biggest economies, continued their wide-ranging economic and diplomatic sparring. The countries have alternated between attacking each other over trade issues and working together on efforts to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons. At times, President Trump has praised his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at other times he has swiftly criticized Beijing for its trade practices, sometimes in quick succession.In its latest action, China is making a modest peace offering, without really giving up much.Some of the 1,449 categories of goods slated for tariff cuts involve food products from other countries, like fish, olives and grilled seaweed. Other categories include low-value manufactured goods like handbags and certain inexpensive garments, typically made in factories that have already been shifting from China to lower-wage competitors like Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Vietnam.Chinese workers\u2019 wages have soared over the past 15 years, and Beijing is engaged in a broad effort to steer the economy toward high-wage industries like semiconductors and away from factories making garments and handbags.\u201cThe goods seeing cuts are not relevant to trade with the U.S.,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a trade specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. \u201cFor China, it fits the goal of moving up the value chain \u2014 heavy subsidies for semiconductors and now less protection for textiles and consumer appliances.\u201dChristopher Rogers, a trade analyst at Panjiva, an international commerce data firm recently acquired by S.&P. Global Market Intelligence, estimated that the tariff cuts would cover about 1.1 percent of China\u2019s $1.95 trillion in annual imports. \u201cThe cuts are more to do with keeping a lid on inflation and improving consumer spending power than to do with keeping President Trump happy,\u201d he said.The Chinese move could nonetheless have political benefits for Beijing.China is energetically trying to rally other governments to its side in its showdown with the United States. Beijing\u2019s latest move could assuage concerns from many European countries and developing nations about their own trade deficits with China as well as loss of manufacturing jobs. At the same time, trade ministers elsewhere have been deeply troubled by the Trump administration\u2019s moves to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from around the world.But by cutting tariffs in more than 1,000 lightly traded categories, China could end up reducing its average tariff considerably without actually running the risk of a big surge in imports.Mr. Xi, China\u2019s president, had called during a speech in April for cuts in Chinese tariffs on imported cars and some consumer goods, as part of Beijing\u2019s long-term policy of gradually opening to international competition.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly at one point to President Xi Jinping of China. He is Mr. Xi, not Mr. Jinping.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "75-Year-Old Mayor Is Attacked in Greece, and Nationalists Rejoice", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHESSALONIKI, Greece \u2014 The 75-year-old mayor of Greece\u2019s second-largest city was brutally assaulted by a far-right mob at a public gathering over the weekend, an attack that brought gleeful expressions of support from nationalist groups and heightened concerns about a rise in hate crime in the country.The mayor, Yiannis Boutaris, who is known for his liberalism and outspoken views against far-right violence and racism, was attacked Saturday afternoon in the northern city of Thessaloniki by about a dozen people during a ceremony commemorating the World War I genocide of Pontic Greeks by Turkish forces.Nationalist groups, notably the far-right Golden Dawn, have capitalized on growing frustration in Greece. The economy has been hobbled by years of austerity imposed on the debt-racked country by international creditors, and a huge migrant influx has further strained tensions.Greece has often been the first port of call in Europe for migrants fleeing war and economic misery in Afghanistan, Syria, countries in Africa and elsewhere.Prosectors ordered an investigation on Monday to determine the \u201cmoral instigators\u201d of the attack on Mr. Boutaris, and four men who were arrested in connection with it \u2014 a 36-year-old, two 20-year-olds and a 17-year-old who have not been publicly identified \u2014 were charged with causing bodily harm, vandalism and disturbing the peace.It was unclear whether the men were acting on their own or aligned with a far-right group, but members of nationalist, anti-immigrant organizations were conspicuous in praising an attack that was otherwise condemned by others on the political spectrum.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras condemned the \u201cbarbaric\u201d attack on Mr. Boutaris in a speech to his cabinet on Monday in which he also hit out at \u201ca dark and extreme section of the main opposition\u201d that, he said, \u201clays out the carpet for the far right.\u201dWhile also condemning the attack, the conservative opposition New Democracy, which is leading Mr. Tsipras\u2019s leftist party, Syriza, in opinion polls, responded by accusing the prime minister of the \u201cpolitical and moral legitimization of violence\u201d through \u201cpolarizing and toxic rhetoric.\u201dMembers of far-right groups, however, could barely contain their excitement. \u201cBravo to each and every one who carried out his duty in Thessaloniki today. Respect,\u201d wrote Ourania Michaloliakou, the daughter of Nikos Michaloliakos, the leader of Golden Dawn, on Twitter. In another, she wrote, \u201cMy God, why can\u2019t I be in Thessaloniki today,\u201d adding, \u201cWell done, dudes.\u201dChristos Paschalidis, an official with a nationalist group, Anasa, in the northern city of Kavala, struck a similar note with a post on Facebook, saying that Mr. Boutaris \u201cgot what he deserves. Well done to the boys.\u201d\u201cNow it\u2019s the turn of the traitor\u201d lawmakers, he added, using a term often used by populists to condemn politicians who backed Greece\u2019s acceptance of international bailouts that imposed years of austerity on the country.The assault was the focus of a front-page story by a Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, with the headline, \u201cAn attack on friendship.\u201d That was an apparent reference to Mr. Boutaris\u2019s championing of closer ties between Greece and its traditional rival, Turkey, and efforts to increase tourism between the two countries.Mr. Boutaris has hailed Thessaloniki as the birthplace of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the progressive founder of modern Turkey, and he has been instrumental in pushing plans for the creation of a Holocaust museum in the city, which lost some 50,000 Jews to the Nazis.In March, statistics from the Greek police showed that hate crimes more than doubled last year, with 184 attacks recorded, compared with 84 in 2016. Some observers have said that most assaults go unreported and that the actual figures are much higher.Speaking to the municipal council Monday evening, Mr. Boutaris called on all Greek political parties to condemn violence and marginalize \u201cthugs of all kinds.\u201d\u201cThere is no other way,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause tomorrow someone else will be in my place, and will be beaten \u2014 for his ideas, for his religion, for his sexual orientation, for the color of his skin, for being different.\u201d\u201cFor as long as I am mayor I will not allow Thessaloniki to return to an era of darkness,\u201d he added, citing the killing of the leftist politician Grigoris Lambrakis by right-wing thugs in 1963 during the protracted social tension that followed Greece\u2019s civil war.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a New Jersey Sports Bar Made a $3 Million Bet and Won", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOCEANPORT, N.J. \u2014 It was a weekday night, and some of the regulars were perched in the sports bar at Monmouth Park, a struggling racetrack near the Jersey Shore. A few members of the town council had rolled in after their weekly meeting for some beer and popcorn. Others were there to bet on horse races around the country, their eyes trained on a row of flat-screen televisions along a back wall showing horses barreling down the homestretch.But in a state whose legal challenge led to the toppling of a federal law that banned the practice, perhaps no place else has been as prepared to wade into the potentially lucrative world of sports betting as the sports bar at Monmouth Park.A room that was essentially a Formica-lined cafeteria received a $3 million dollar face-lift that started five years ago as the operator of the track and one of the world\u2019s biggest sports betting operators formed a partnership to wager that New Jersey would prevail in its legalization efforts.Now their bet has finally hit, and Dennis A. Drazin, the racetrack operator, and William Hill, a London-based international sports betting operation with dozens of locations in Las Vegas and across Nevada, are hoping to cash in.\u201cIt was always going to be a sports book,\u201d Mr. Drazin said, \u201cso we envisioned that when we built it and put in the money, assuming that we would survive any legal challenge.\u201dThe possibility of shuttering Monmouth Park instilled fears among residents about the impact on the local economy. \u201cEveryone in town seems to have worked here at one point,\u201d said Joseph A. Irace, the borough council president, as he gathered a few tables together for the council members to sit around. \u201cThis is our biggest employer.\u201dMr. Drazin, a trial lawyer who comes from a family steeped in local horse racing and owns, breeds and races his own horses, took over as operator of Monmouth Park in 2012, after the track had fallen on hard times. Sports betting, Mr. Drazin believed, was perhaps its last best chance to reverse its fortunes.But he needed a partner with money who was willing to start developing a sports betting hall long before the Supreme Court even took up the case.Fortuitously, Joe Asher, the chief executive of William Hill U.S., had read about Mr. Drazin\u2019s legalization campaign, and he wanted in. Mr. Asher called Mr. Drazin from Las Vegas and flew to New Jersey to meet him. The two men spent a day at Monmouth Park watching the action from Mr. Drazin\u2019s box.One of Mr. Drazin\u2019s horses was racing that day \u2014 and it won.\u201cI thought that was a good omen,\u201d Mr. Asher said.He agreed to pour $1 million into renovating what would become the William Hill Sports Bar, while Mr. Drazin would contribute $500,000 and later added another $500,000. Both eventually doubled those investments, and William Hill also said it would spend an additional $5 million to eventually open another betting venue at the racetrack.Both men realize that for any sports betting operation housed at the racetrack to be successful, they would need to eat into the margins of their biggest competitor: the black market.Since many people who bet illegally do so easily on any number of websites, the team at Monmouth will also have to go mobile to cast a wider net for customers.\u201cThe effort is going to be and the challenge is going to be moving people from the black market into the legal market,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Asher said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s just going to happen overnight.\u201dIn Nevada, the only state where sports betting has been legal, William Hill\u2019s app accounts for about 60 percent of total wagers the company accepts. In New Jersey, the apps run by the state\u2019s three horse racing tracks, including Monmouth, brings in a total of about $150 million in bets per year.Launching a mobile app for the Monmouth sports betting operation would take time to ensure it abided by state regulations and had been sufficiently tested.Despite all the preparations, William Hill has hit another small speed bump in its plan to start welcoming sports bettors as soon as Memorial Day.Stephen M. Sweeney, the Democrat president of the New Jersey Senate, inserted language into a bill outlining sports betting regulations that would effectively ban any outlets from taking bets in the future if they opened before the bill becomes law.For Mr. Drazin, it was just one more detour in a journey that began in 2010.So, for a few more weeks, the William Hill Sports Bar will not have all its bells and whistles. The flat screen TVs lining the semicircle outer wall will still show ESPN and live feeds from horse tracks around the country, but the massive screens on either side of the bar, to display live sports lines, will stay dark.But some customers are just happy that what had once seemed like a long shot will soon become a reality.\u201cI don\u2019t care if they don\u2019t take a bet until the first week of football,\u201d said Bruce Britton, 56, as he tugged on his blue replica New York Giants jersey of Odell Beckham Jr.He has been coming to the track since the 1970s, recalling sneaking under fences to place horse bets as a kid, and is hoping that sports betting will bring back new energy and crowds to the track.\u201cAs long as it\u2019s passed,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s coming.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At the time, the organization hinted that girls would eventually be welcomed at all levels.Effie Delimarkos, a spokeswoman for the Boy Scouts of America, said on Wednesday that the decision to welcome girls came after years of receiving requests from families and girls.The Boy Scouts of America may also be hoping to buoy its slumping membership.

At its peak in the 1970s, the Boy Scouts of America, incorporated in 1910, had closer to five million members.The announcement drew a muted response from the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., a departure from its previous statements that revealed that the once-amicable relationship between the two organizations had splintered.Last summer, the president of the Girl Scouts accused the Boy Scouts of America of trying to undermine the organization through a \u201ccovert campaign to recruit girls.\u201d\u201cI formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 percent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts,\u201d Kathy Hopinkah Hannan, the president of the Girl Scouts, wrote at the time to her counterpart, Randall Stephenson of the Boy Scouts.In October, Girl Scouts leaders said they felt \u201cblindsided\u201d by the announcement that the Boy Scouts of America was officially opening its doors to girls.The Girl Scouts is \u201cdedicated to building that critical STEM work force pipeline that businesses and communities across the country are looking for,\u201d Ms. Acevedo said. \u201cGirls are our country\u2019s great untapped resource and are the key to our nation\u2019s competitive advantage in the new digital economy we\u2019re living in.

It will also be available for both boys and girls.Niraj Chokshi and Matthew Haag contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Talk of U.S. Troop Cuts Unnerves South Korea and Japan", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 With diplomacy moving apace to end North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, Northeast Asia is bracing for something few had thought likely just months ago: a reduction or withdrawal of American troops from South Korea.These forces have been the bedrock of the 65-year-old alliance between Seoul and Washington since the 1950-53 Korean War, serving as a bulwark against North Korean aggression and preserving a shaky peace that allowed South Korea to build its economy into a global powerhouse.Now their presence is being questioned by President Trump, who is skeptical of maintaining a costly American military presence overseas, and by North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, who called last week for a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War.The news jolted South Korea and Japan, where many are deeply skeptical about Mr. Kim\u2019s reported vow to negotiate away his nuclear weapons and fear that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica-first\u201d diplomacy will leave them fending for themselves as China asserts its military prowess.\u201cFor South Korea, living with a nuclear-armed North Korea is much better than living without American troops,\u201d said Shin Won-sik, a retired three-star South Korean general. \u201cIf they are gone, we will lose proof that the Americans will defend us. We will lose confidence that if war breaks out, we can win.\u201dThe possibility of a troop reduction emerged as other signs of diplomatic progress on the Korean Peninsula were reported on Friday.In Washington, Mr. Trump told reporters that a time and place for his meeting with Mr. Kim had been set, and that details would be announced soon. And the United Nations aviation agency, which governs international air routes, said its directors would visit North Korea next week to discuss the possibility of opening routes to South Korea.In Seoul, President Moon Jae-in moved quickly Friday to calm jitters about an American troop reduction, especially among older conservatives, who consider the United States military\u2019s presence a sacrosanct symbol of national security and are deeply skeptical of Mr. Kim\u2019s intentions. Mr. Moon\u2019s office said news that the White House was considering drawing down troops was \u201cnot true at all.\u201d\u201cThe Moon government doesn\u2019t want the focus of public attention to move from the denuclearization of North Korea to the withdrawal of U.S. troops yet, which is such a political hot potato,\u201d said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul. \u201cBut if a peace treaty is signed, the U.S. troops are bound to peter out. Much of the reason they are staying here will be gone.\u201dOn Friday, the White House announced that Mr. Moon would meet with Mr. Trump in Washington on May 22 for talks about North Korea and other matters.Conservatives in South Korea bristle at the possibility of a troop withdrawal, arguing that it would expose their country to potential foes far stronger than North Korea, like China and Japan, which have invaded numerous times over the centuries. South Koreans reacted to Washington\u2019s past efforts to pull out troops with calls for arming the country with nuclear weapons of its own.Although South Korea\u2019s navy and air force are superior to the North\u2019s, North Korea has a much bigger army, including stockpiles of chemical and nuclear weapons and huge batteries of artillery, rockets and missiles that could hit Seoul, a city of 10 million people.For decades, the American military has protected South Korea and Japan under its nuclear umbrella, and it shares high-tech military surveillance and conducts annual joint war games preparing for any conflict.For many in the region, giving up that protection is an unsettling prospect, even if peace comes to the peninsula.\u201cThe reason foreign investors stay in South Korea, and its stock market doesn\u2019t panic even when China\u2019s military prowess grows and North Korea conducts its nuclear weapons, is because of the U.S. military presence here,\u201d said Mr. Shin, who was the South Korean military\u2019s top operational strategist before he retired in 2015.\u201cIf they shake the alliance for the sake of denuclearizing North Korea,\u201d he added, \u201cwe will have an economic crisis before a security crisis.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s reported directive came as Seoul and Washington were negotiating to decide how much more South Korea should pay than the $800 million a year it is currently paying for the 28,500 United States troops here. Mr. Trump wants a bigger burden-sharing from Seoul, which has resisted.Trump administration officials say a full troop withdrawal is unlikely. They say that rethinking the force\u2019s size and configuration was overdue, and that they want to see if a smaller force can provide adequate security.The fate of the American troops has become one of the most delicate points of discussion as the two Koreas, the United States and China engage in fast-paced diplomacy over how to end the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program.South Korean officials say North Korea is not insisting on a pullout of American troops during the latest round of negotiations with Seoul and Washington. They say they want the troops to stay as a regional stabilizer even if a peace treaty is signed.In past negotiations, North Korean officials told their South Korean and American counterparts that they could support the United States military presence in South Korea if Washington and Pyongyang normalized ties and the troops served a \u201cpeacekeeping role\u201d to prevent China from becoming a dominant military power in the region.A troop withdrawal could send a bad signal to Japan, where about 50,000 American military service members are based, analysts said.\u201cAcross the waters in Japan, I think it\u2019s going to be read very, very poorly and really make the Japanese anxious about what exactly are the U.S. commitments\u201d in the region, said Jeffrey Hornung, a political scientist at the RAND Corporation.Under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan has stepped up its own show of military force, and Mr. Abe has sought to revise the pacifist clause in the country\u2019s Constitution. On Thursday, he released a video message calling for amending it to make explicit the legality of the country\u2019s Self-Defense Forces, as Japan\u2019s military, which has about 225,000 active members, is known.On Friday Mr. Abe\u2019s office called American forces \u201cessential\u201d for the security of the region.If Mr. Trump were to succeed in pulling troops from the Korean Peninsula, it could embolden Mr. Abe to push through a constitutional change while citing the reduced American military presence in the region.The Japanese public has long opposed any constitutional change and on Thursday, thousands of people protested the idea in Tokyo. But recent polls show opinion is increasingly divided.Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington, struck a moderate tone.He said \u201cthe U.S. presence is more symbolic than really there to fight against North Korea,\u201d given the strength of the South Korean military and the fact that North Korea\u2019s missiles are a bigger threat than an actual invasion.Mr. Fujisaki added that as long as the Trump administration consulted the Japanese and South Korean governments about its plans, \u201cit\u2019s not that big a concern.\u201dChina has long wanted American troops to leave South Korea, and analysts there said a drawdown of United States troops \u2014 or a complete withdrawal \u2014 could drastically reshape the balance of power in the region.\u201cThe end of American troops in South Korea may indicate the beginning of the dissolution of the U.S. alliance in the Asia-Pacific,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cIf the American alliance system was gone, China would be greatly relieved.\u201dChoe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, and Motoko Rich from Tokyo.

{"Headline": "Do Your Summer Plans Include Employment?", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStudent OpinionWhat are you going to do this summer? Will you spend time working at a seasonal or part-time job?You can still find high school and college students boiling hot dogs and cleaning the fryer at the clam shacks, country clubs and state fairs that spring to life when the weather turns hot. But the food that fuels a summer vacation is now more likely being prepared by temporary workers from other countries or local adults trying to make the gig economy work for them.\u201cIt used to be all college kids,\u201d said Bob Benser Jr., who owns the Murdick\u2019s Fudge shops on Mackinac Island, between Michigan\u2019s Upper and Lower Peninsulas. The Murdick family first opened a candy shop in 1887, starting a confection craze that is so much a part of the culture here that summer tourists are called fudgies.Although youth employment in the United States still spikes in the warmer months, the number of teenagers in the summer labor force fell to 43 percent in 2016, from almost 72 percent at its peak in 1978, according to the most recent figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.Pressure has come from several directions. School started stretching into summer. Employment laws became more restrictive. Scooping cones or running a dough-filled Hobart were no longer considered worthy r\u00e9sum\u00e9 builders.\u2014 Have you ever had or do you now have a job? If so, where?\u2014 Have you ever sought paid summer employment?\u2014 How difficult do you think it is for people without much work experience to find jobs?\u2014 What are the most sought-after summer jobs among teenagers where you live?

{"Headline": "Democrats\u2019 Next Big Thing: Government-Guaranteed Jobs", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Prominent Democrats \u2014 stung by their eroding support from working-class voters but buoyed by the deficit-be-damned approach of ruling Republicans \u2014 are embracing a big idea from a bygone era: guaranteed employment.The \u201cjob guarantee\u201d plans, many of them pressed by Democratic White House hopefuls, vary in scope and cost, but they all center on government-sponsored employment that pays well above the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage \u2014 a New Deal for a new age, absent the bread lines and unemployment rates of the Great Depression. The most aggressive plans seek to all but eradicate unemployment and to set a new wage floor for all working Americans, pressuring private employers to raise wages if they want to compete for workers.How such guarantees would be paid for is still largely unresolved. And criticism of the idea has emerged not only from conservatives who detect a whiff of socialism but also from liberals who say guaranteed employment is the wrong way to attack the central issue facing workers in this low-unemployment economy: stagnant wages.But Democratic leaders hope the push will help their party bridge the growing political divide between white and minority workers, and silence the naysayers who accuse the party of being devoid of new, big ideas.The employment plans, along with single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care, free college, legalized marijuana and ever less restrictive immigration rules, are parts of a broader trend toward a more liberal Democratic Party in the Trump era.Many conservative economists, and some liberals, fret over the plans\u2019 often large costs, which some Democrats would cover by repealing pieces of President Trump\u2019s signature tax cuts. The plans could force private companies to compete with the government for workers, distort an already tight job market and push some firms out of business, they warn.Most of all, they question the need for any government jobs program when unemployment has dipped below 4 percent.\u201cI don\u2019t know if the Democrats have noticed, but jobs are doing very well,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council. He said the administration would oppose such plans.The most ambitious proposal, an outline from Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and another possible White House hopeful, would promise a government job in areas such as construction, child care and park maintenance to anyone who wants one, paying a \u201cliving wage\u201d and offering benefits on par with what current federal employees earn.Behind the stampede is Democrats\u2019 desire for tangible programs to offer to working-class voters, which they could contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s racially divisive immigration appeals to white workers.\u201cWe are living in a world where Trump and Trumpism is trying to drive wedges between people,\u201d said Neera Tanden, a former adviser to President Barack Obama and to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, who is the president of the Center for American Progress. \u201cIt\u2019s important to the country and the progressive movement that we have ideas that matter in the lives of working people who are black, brown and white.\u201dTo win control of Congress this fall and defeat Mr. Trump in 2020, she added, \u201cWe have to have some answers for how to get good jobs with a decent living for people who didn\u2019t go to college.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a very large hammer in search of a nail,\u201d said Anne Kim, the director of domestic and social policy at the Progressive Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the wrong nail. We really should be searching for solutions to the wage stagnation problem.\u201dAdvocates of the more targeted jobs plans say they are needed to help workers who are still stuck on the bad side of the improving national employment numbers.\u201cIt\u2019s a strong argument in many parts of the country that, for folks who are out there committed to finding a job, we should create this transitional program to help them get on their feet,\u201d Mr. Van Hollen said. \u201cYou have a lot of Republicans right now who say they want to help people who are out of work by taking away their health care or other benefits, but are doing nothing to help them find a job.\u201dAnd then there is the cost. Mr. Sanders\u2019s office said his plan is not yet complete and thus cannot be assessed, for costs or for the benefits it would bring to the economy. Others estimate their plans would cost hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade, but could be funded all or in part by rolling back some parts of the tax law that Mr. Trump signed in December, estimated to cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years.Democrats\u2019 casual attitude toward cost is in part a reaction to the Republican tax bill, which was passed without much concern for rising government red ink. It also reflects a growing belief among many liberals that a clear lesson from Mr. Trump\u2019s victory is that Democrats need to go bold \u2014 and spend big.\u201cThe Republicans for the last 30 years have been running on supply-side economics,\u201d Mr. Khanna said. \u201cYou cut taxes, that\u2019s going to grow the economy, that\u2019s going to pay for deficits. Democrats need to change the script.\u201dAdvertisement"}
