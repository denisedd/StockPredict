{"Headline": "These Lights Are Like a Mood Ring for Your Room", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you sit at the communal table long enough and gaze up at the honeycomb-patterned ceiling, you just might notice the lights shifting between different shades of white. They, too, are meant to contribute to your well-being, by delivering optimal brightness and color temperature at different times of day.\u201cWhether people are ready for it or not, it\u2019s happening and coming,\u201d said Natalia Lesniak, a senior lighting designer at Lumen Architecture, the New York firm that worked with Vamos Architects to create the lighting for Honeybrains.\u201cIt\u2019s like green building 10 years ago \u2014 it\u2019s going to become the default,\u201d said Ms. Lesniak. \u201cAnd LEDs are the technological advantage that are allowing us to do it.\u201dMany are playing catch-up to Ketra, an eight-year-old brand in Austin, Tex., that works exclusively on circadian lighting systems \u2014 or what it calls \u201cnatural light.\u201d Ketra\u2019s bulbs and fixtures can be found in Whole Foods Market at Bryant Park in New York, the offices of Squarespace and Vice Media, Manhattan\u2019s TMPL gym, the Art Institute of Chicago, and, yes, restaurants like Honeybrains.\u201cThe lighting we want when it\u2019s bright outside is fundamentally different than what we want when it\u2019s dark outside,\u201d said Nav Sooch, Ketra\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe concluded that what the world needed was lighting that would adapt for the situation and the time of day.\u201dKetra bulbs have red, green, blue and white LEDs inside, as well as sensors that monitor and adjust them to achieve desired light levels and colors throughout the day. Color temperatures range from about 1,400 to 10,000 kelvin. (For comparison, the color temperature of candlelight is below 2,000 kelvin, traditional incandescent bulbs are roughly 2,700 to 3,000, and natural daylight can be well over 5,000.)The brand\u2019s primary goal is nuanced whites, but when it\u2019s party time, the products also can bathe rooms in a rainbow of bright colors.For those who want to try circadian lighting on a smaller scale, GE Lighting offers C-Sleep retrofit bulbs (less than $50 a pair from online retailers) and the C by GE Sol lamp (less than $150 purchased online), which similarly change color temperature at different times of the day, and are controllable through an app and virtual voice assistants.\u201cPart of the original premise was around wellness and bringing people the ability to influence their quality of sleep by manipulating the quality of light they\u2019re exposed to,\u201d said Jeff Patton, the general manager of connected home product management at GE Lighting. \u201cMore companies are doubling down in this area because it\u2019s a real benefit to consumers and has implications to our overall quality of life.\u201dThe Lighting Research Center has partnered with the United States Navy to test circadian lighting in submarines; it has collaborated with Mount Sinai Hospital in New York to evaluate the light\u2019s use in recovery rooms for transplant patients; and it has worked with the National Institute on Aging to increase the comfort of people suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.However, Mariana G. Figueiro, the director of the Lighting Research Center, warned that homeowners swapping out a few bulbs shouldn\u2019t expect the same results as participants in a controlled study.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that some manufacturers are overstating the benefits,\u201d she said. \u201cWe caution people that you really need to measure to make sure that you are delivering the circadian stimulus that you need to. Your eyes alone won\u2019t tell you whether you\u2019re delivering the right amount of light.\u201dAnother impediment to effective circadian lighting is that few people spend their days in confined environments. We are exposed to wildly different light conditions as we move between city streets, vehicles and offices, and gaze at smartphones, computers and televisions.\u201cThe important thing about circadian lighting is that it\u2019s really a 24-hour light-dark pattern,\u201d Dr. Figueiro said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know what else you\u2019re being exposed to over the rest of the day, I can\u2019t guarantee it\u2019s going to be beneficial.\u201dHealth advantages aside, the promise of consistently pleasant light has been enough to win over some converts. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s really more about the feel-good factor,\u201d said Suzan Tillotson, president of the New York lighting design firm Tillotson Design Associates. \u201cWe understand that when it\u2019s dark outside, you really want a warmer light. Bright blue light doesn\u2019t feel good after the sun has set.\u201dThat\u2019s one reason Ms. Tillotson used 10,000 Ketra bulbs in her lighting scheme for the new 134,000-square-foot Manhattan headquarters of the advertising and design agency R/GA, where the lights cycle between warm and cool white over the day, but also beam colors for special events and to identify different conference rooms.\u201cThe results have been very favorable,\u201d said David Boehm, the executive vice president of global facilities at R/GA. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quantified it, but because the lighting is so adaptive, I think it\u2019s helped people endure long days in what can be a very straining kind of environment \u2014 that is, being in front of monitors or presentations all day long.\u201dOne piece of evidence in support of the technology is that employees no longer unscrew bulbs from ceiling fixtures or amass piles of their own lamps to create comfortable lighting at their desks.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that people even realize it\u2019s there,\u201d Mr. Boehm said.And that is perhaps the ultimate compliment \u2014 the same could be said about daylight on a sunny afternoon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon, the Elephant in the Antitrust Room", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhen it comes to antitrust enforcement, one of the guiding principles is the effect on consumer prices. So the antitrust question of the moment is this: Will combining AT&T with Time Warner or Sprint with T-Mobile so diminish competition that prices go up?To justify the move, Amazon cited higher costs and the fact that it\u2019s only the second increase since it introduced its Prime service, for $79, in 2005. Still, Amazon\u2019s move suggests a degree of pricing power that its anxious rivals can only envy. Amazon said it now had over 100 million Prime customers, and its first-quarter profit, announced last week, jumped more than 120 percent, sending its stock price soaring.Netflix, too, has been raising prices, doing so most recently in October.As the seemingly unstoppable Amazon juggernaut rolls on, there\u2019s no doubt that media and telecommunications markets are converging and undergoing radical transformation. AT&T wants to combine its distribution channels with Time Warner\u2019s content creation, a transaction known as vertical integration because the two companies aren\u2019t direct competitors.While antitrust challenges to vertical combinations have been rare, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger on grounds that the combined companies might threaten to withhold Time Warner content to extract higher prices from rival distributors (a claim the companies have dismissed as economic nonsense).But Amazon is already vertically integrated \u2014 it creates content and distributes it over the internet. So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings).AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, repeatedly referred to the technology giants during the trial, and made clear that they are what drove the merger. \u201cThe media and entertainment industry is going through some rather significant disruption,\u201d he testified. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from predominately folks in the tech sector.\u201dThe Time Warner chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, made the same argument. \u201cThey have the content, the programming, and they have the technological capability of delivering it straight to you,\u201d he said, adding that by \u201cthey\u201d he meant the FANGs. \u201cAnd they can communicate with you about that relationship and what to watch and how to value the program.\u201dIn closing arguments this week, AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s lead trial lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that a combined company could use the kind of data about its users that is routinely collected by the tech companies to enhance its programming and offer more targeted advertising. It could use the resulting higher revenues to reduce consumer prices by what he estimated to be $500 million per year.The government\u2019s lead lawyer, Craig Conrath, provided a counterargument: \u201cThe fact that AT&T may want to compete in some other market, that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to reduce competition in the pay-TV market,\u201d he said. (The pay-TV market has traditionally included subscription TV providers, including cable and satellite, but not over-the-internet providers like Amazon and Netflix.)AT&T sees Netflix, YouTube and Amazon as \u201cthe wolves at the door,\u201d said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. \u201cThat\u2019s the center of their theory.\u201dTime Warner\u2019s content companies, like HBO, CNN and the Turner channels, \u201care just islands of content unmoored from the consumer,\u201d he said.Of course, the argument can be made that AT&T doesn\u2019t need to buy a company like Time Warner \u2014 it could create a media content company of its own. That\u2019s what Amazon and Netflix did, and both companies now outspend Time Warner on original programming.But from a consumer standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cThe major tech platforms are becoming vertically integrated as they create their own content to push out over their distribution platforms,\u201d Rich Greenfield of the investment firm BTIG wrote in a recent research note. \u201cIn turn, is it O.K. to be vertically integrated if you build your way in, but not to buy your way into it? What if instead of an acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T just spent $8 billion a year on content creation, the way Netflix is \u2014 would that be legal, but buying Time Warner is not?\u201dWhether the FANG companies compete in the same markets with AT&T and Time Warner is of more than academic interest \u2014 it could well influence Judge Richard Leon\u2019s decision, which he said he would deliver no later than June 12.If Judge Leon does take such an expanded view of the market, AT&T and Time Warner would most likely prevail. Even if he does find some violations, he could impose conditions on the merger rather than block it entirely, much as Comcast had to accept conditions on its purchase of NBC Universal.Making a case that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile merger would benefit consumers is far more difficult. The deal has drawn near-unanimous opposition from antitrust experts.The Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up, in contrast to AT&T-Time Warner, would be a horizontal merger \u2014 a combination of direct competitors, that way reducing the number of players operating in the market. Those kinds of deals have traditionally received more antitrust scrutiny.The government rejected the same merger less than four years ago, and the result was robust competition and lower prices for wireless services \u2014 exactly what antitrust regulators fervently hope for. Before that, in 2011, the government blocked a proposed merger of AT&T and T-Mobile.So the question is whether the markets in which they compete have so changed since then that a merger now wouldn\u2019t harm consumers.The two companies will need to argue that the market is no longer just the four wireless providers, but now includes the technology giants and broadband and cable companies like Comcast. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile would command only a small share of such a vastly expanded market, and wouldn\u2019t have the power to raise prices.That may arguably be the case for video, which can now be streamed over wireless handsets, but not for voice calls and texting, at least not yet. Sprint and T-Mobile are talking up the potential for 5G technology to further blur the lines between traditional markets, but widespread use of 5G is still years in the future.Courts and antitrust regulators \u201cdon\u2019t usually consider merger defenses that depend on the existence of undeployed technology,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. \u201cOur crystal balls aren\u2019t that good. We don\u2019t have the power to gaze five years down the road, especially when it comes to fast-changing technology.\u201dWhile Professor Hovenkamp said he understood the argument AT&T and Time Warner were making about Amazon, \u201cthis whole generic idea that companies need to merge to go up against Amazon may play to a general audience, but if you take it to its logical conclusion, it could be used to validate nearly every merger.\u201dPerhaps T-Mobile and Sprint could hold off a few years, and return with evidence that they\u2019re actually competing with the big tech companies rather than merely anticipating that competition.Then again, given the vagaries of the Trump administration\u2019s antitrust policies, \u201cthey may feel there\u2019s no reason not to roll the dice now,\u201d Mr. Hovenkamp said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "PayPal Agrees to $2.2 Billion Deal for European Payments Start-Up iZettle", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Seeking to extend its global reach, PayPal has reached a deal to buy iZettle, Europe\u2019s answer to the mobile payments company Square, for about $2.2 billion.The deal would be the company\u2019s biggest takeover \u2014 and would underscore the arms race in the world of payments, especially as digital and mobile transactions are increasingly being adopted across the world. The agreement was confirmed Thursday by Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for PayPal.\u201cSmall businesses are the engine of the global economy and we are continuing to expand our platform to help them compete and win online, in-store and via mobile,\u201d said PayPal\u2019s chief executive, Dan Schulman.The agreement is the latest example of a promising European start-up selling itself to a larger American company. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft have all used acquisitions in the region to gobble up promising technology and sought-after engineers. Past deals include Google\u2019s purchase of the London-based artificial intelligence start-up DeepMind; Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Mojang, the Swedish maker of popular video game \u201cMinecraft\u201d; and Apple\u2019s deal for the music-recognition company Shazam and digital-assistant maker VocalIQ, both of which started in Europe.The trend is troubling for European policymakers who have been eager to develop a homegrown tech sector that has lagged the United States and China.Founded eight years ago and based in Stockholm, iZettle began as a maker of products like credit card readers. But it has expanded its offerings to analytics software and even small business loans, giving it a strong foothold among such companies in Europe and Latin America.Last week, it filed to go public, announcing plans to list itself on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange, with ambitions for a $1.1 billion valuation. Among its existing investors are Mastercard and American Express, as well as the venture capital firm Index Ventures.The purchase would boost PayPal\u2019s international expansion, and help it compete with Square, which has focused on processing payments for small businesses. Both companies are trying to capitalize on the growing volume of purchases being made on mobile phones and the internet.Michael J. de la Merced reported from London and Nathaniel Popper from New York.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Wants to Fill Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Moat\u2019 With Candy, but It Still Holds Water", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOMAHA \u2014 Elon Musk is taking on Warren Buffett, and their differences run deeper than jokes about candy and medieval fortifications.At Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting over the weekend, I relayed a question from a shareholder to Mr. Buffett about a comment Mr. Musk had made a couple days earlier.\u201cI think \u2018moats\u2019 are lame,\u201d Mr. Musk had said during a Tesla earnings call. It was a criticism of an economic principle that Mr. Buffett had coined in 1999 and that has become something of a mantra for his faithful: Invest in businesses \u201cthat have wide, sustainable moats around them.\u201dSuch moats, Mr. Buffett has said, are made of the competitive advantages that benefit major brands and companies, like distribution networks, pricing power and brand reputation.But to Mr. Musk, they are a metaphor for being stuck in the past. \u201cIf your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is the pace of innovation \u2014 that is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness.\u201dAt a time when technology is upending even old-line industries that once seemed impenetrable to competition, might Mr. Musk be right?\u201cElon may turn things upside down in some areas,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d want to take us on in candy,\u201d suggesting Berkshire\u2019s See\u2019s Candies division enjoyed an unassailably wide moat. The quip elicited laughter from the 20,000 shareholders who packed the CenturyLink Center.Mr. Musk answered the challenge immediately, saying he was starting a candy company. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Not only that, Mr. Musk said, he planned \u201cto build a moat and fill it with candy\u201d \u2014 making it impossible for Mr. Buffett to resist sinking his money into the venture.The repartee was good for some chuckles and clickbait headlines, but the mini-spat masked a more serious and significant debate taking place across corporate America: Have the traditional moats shrunk?When direct-to-consumer brands like Dollar Shave Club have been able to take on consumer giants like Procter & Gamble\u2019s Gillette \u2014 so much so that Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion \u2014 are any businesses still safe? Mr. Buffett owns Kraft Heinz, for example, but could upstart food companies one day overtake it, breaking through the substantial network of distribution and marketing arrangements \u2014 and brand loyalty \u2014 that Kraft Heinz has built up over decades?Mr. Buffett acknowledged that times had changed. \u201cThere have been more moats that have become susceptible to invasion than seemed to be the case earlier,\u201d he said.To a large degree, Mr. Musk is a living embodiment of a gleeful invader. With Tesla, he is trying to prove that what was long thought of as a substantial moat around the automobile industry could be overcome. He has gone direct to consumer with Tesla vehicles, bypassing the traditional car dealers that were once considered a barrier to entering the automotive business. He even had what seemed like his own moat: a network of Supercharger stations around the country that he recently opened up to competitors. (His initial panning of the \u201cmoat\u201d idea followed a question about why he was willing to cede the advantage that the closed charging network provided.)But, in truth, Mr. Musk\u2019s experience \u2014 and challenges \u2014 at Tesla may demonstrate just how much a moat remains a powerful deterrent to competitors.In the case of the automobile industry, perhaps the biggest barrier is the huge amount of capital needed \u2014 Tesla has already raised more than $12 billion. But even with huge amounts of money, Tesla\u2019s recent production struggles \u2014 it has repeatedly missed its targets for making the new mass-market Model 3 \u2014 show the immense value of manufacturing experience.Mr. Musk\u2019s willingness to challenge convention has clearly pushed the automobile industry forward, but his progress has lately been bumpier than he initially expected. That\u2019s not to say he won\u2019t succeed, but if he does, he may be the exception, not the rule.There are still huge swaths of our economy that have dauntingly wide moats, many of them protected by regulatory walls. Banks, which have been speculated about as ripe for disruption by financial technology companies, seem more likely to buy start-ups than compete against them. Airlines \u2014 which Mr. Buffett once called \u201ca death trap for investors\u201d \u2014 have consolidated, and enormous corporations control virtually all the landing slots at airports around the globe. Before it could get off the ground, any insurgent hoping to challenge them would have to find a spot to come down.Even many digital businesses have a moat: Google and Facebook control so much of the advertising market that it is hard to see how a kid in a garage with an idea could usurp them anytime soon. Amazon has itself has become so powerful that virtually every seller feels it has to go through it. And Mr. Buffett has convinced himself that Apple\u2019s deep relationship with its customers through its ecosystem of products and iCloud mean the business has a defensible moat.\u201cThere are some pretty good moats around,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cBeing the low-cost producer, for example, is a terribly important moat,\u201d he said, citing Geico, the low-cost insurance company Berkshire owns.Saturday night, after the Berkshire meeting ended, Mr. Musk was still tweeting: \u201cSaying you like \u2018moats\u2019 is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies.\u201dFor better or worse, the limited competition that oligopolies face is usually good for investors \u2014 even if consumers might disagree.But whether they have been dug by a company\u2019s experienced hand, the good will of its customers or the heavy machinery of governmental regulation, moats remain a formidable form of protection, even from the most willing of raiders.Perhaps Charlie Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, put it best: \u201cElon says a conventional moat is quaint. And that\u2019s true of a puddle of water.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How well did Flipkart\u2019s investors do?\u2022 What did AT&T and Novartis want from Michael Cohen?\u2022 What the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal means for the business world.\u2022 The bottom line on Vodafone\u2019s big deal with Liberty Global.The story of Walmart\u2019s $16 billion deal for Flipkart began nearly two years ago and spanned secret negotiations in both Bentonville, Ark., and Bangalore, India. Here\u2019s an account of how it came together based on interviews by people involved in the transaction, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal.Walmart had initially approached Flipkart in 2016. But it quickly backed away to focus on its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, one of these people said.By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.Walmart could also provide a permanent base of capital, which would allow Flipkart to avoid raising money every few years. For its part, Walmart would feel more comfortable if it had majority control, even as it was prepared to give Flipkart\u2019s management some degree of independence.In December, Amazon entered the fray, these people said. The e-commerce titan sought to buy Flipkart outright. But Flipkart was wary. It worried regulators would block a deal that would have combined India\u2019s two biggest e-commerce services.Discussions with Walmart pressed forward. Over the next few months, the boards of Walmart and Flipkart refined what became Wednesday\u2019s deal: The size of the stake Walmart would buy and at what price. They also settled on which of Flipkart\u2019s investors would sell. Some, including the investment firm Tiger Global Management and the Chinese internet giant Tencent, wanted to stay on board, betting that Flipkart would continue to grow. Others, including the nearly $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, were happy to cash out.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s how well some of them did:Some investors who are keeping stakes in Flipkart \u2014 including Tiger Global, which will maintain a roughly 5 percent stake, Microsoft and the Chinese internet giant Tencent \u2014 could continue to reap returns should Flipkart eventually go public.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedWhat exactly were AT&T and Novartis after when they made payments to a firm set up Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer?- Peter EavisDetails\u2022 Walmart will buy an initial stake of 77 percent in Flipkart and invest $2 billion in fresh capital into the Indian firm.\u2022 The two companies said they are in continuing talks with other investors to purchase a stake, which might reduce Walmart\u2019s eventual shareholding in Flipkart.\u2022 Walmart said the purchase would reduce its net income by at least $750 million this year and by more than double that amount next year.It\u2019s a risky bet for Walmart\u2022 Although India\u2019s population is rapidly coming online, the number of people with enough income to shop online is still tiny.\u2022 Walmart is paying a hefty premium to buy its way into the pole position in India\u2019s e-commerce market, but it has not yet outlined any strategy that would keep it ahead of Amazon there.\u2022 While Flipkart is currently the market leader, Amazon\u2019s relatively new India site is quickly closing the gap.The big winners\u2022 Sachin Bansal. Flipkart's co-founder, is selling his entire 5.5 percent stake in the company, becoming an instant billionaire.\u2022 SoftBank Vision Fund, the investment vehicle run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart in August. That the stake will now be sold for about $4 billion.The advisers\u2022 Walmart was advised by JPMorgan and Barclays on the banking side and Hogan Lovells, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher on the legal side.\u2022 Flipkart was advised by Goldman Sachs and law firms Gunderson Dettmer LLP, Khaitan & Co., Allen & Gledhill LLP and Dentons Rodyk & DavidsonCritic\u2019s CornerUna Galani of Breakingviews writes: \u201cAfter buying Jet.com for $3 billion a couple years ago, Walmart\u2019s efforts to compete online in the United States have hit some bumps. Earlier misadventures in China prompted it to join forces with local rival JD.com in return for a small stake. India will test the U.S. company\u2019s ability to keep pace halfway around the world with Amazon, whose investors are as patient as boss Jeff Bezos. This will be a make-or-break overseas deal for Walmart.\u201dSturm Ruger had urged shareholders for weeks to reject a proposal from a group of Roman Catholic nuns demanding more transparency from the company on whether it planned to develop safer products and monitor the ones already in circulation.The vote was a rebuke to the company\u2019s leaders and a victory for gun control activists.Ruger must now produce a report by February on how it tracks violence associated with its firearms, what kind of research it is conducting related to so-called smart gun technology and its assessment of the risks that gun-related crimes pose to the company\u2019s reputation and finances.\u2014 Tiffany HsuSears said it will provide customers who purchase any brand of tire on Amazon, including the Sears DieHard brand and full-service tire installation and balancing.The service initially will available at 47 Sears Auto Centers in eight metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.This the second partnership that Sears has struck with Amazon in the past year. Last July, Sears said it would sell its Kenmore appliances of Amazon. The announcement pushed Sears\u2019s shares up 24 percent. The stock is down more than 70 percent over the past 12 months.AT&T said Essential was \u201cone of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\u201d and that its contract ended in December. Novartis said that its contract ran for a year, through February.\u201cRight around [when the] inauguration is happening, we need somebody who knows the administration,\u201d the person said. \u201cHow does he think?

{"Headline": "Costume Secrets From \u2018Picnic at Hanging Rock\u2019 ", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe show\u2019s costume designer explains the genesis of the most influential looks from Amazon\u2019s new series.Traveling in a horse-drawn buggy, a group of schoolgirls dressed in white pass through a small Australian town and pull off their gloves, their expressions giddy and relieved. They are headed to a picnic \u2014 and a tragedy \u2014 in the Australian countryside, and their headmistress, Mrs. Appleyard, had instructed them to wear their gloves until they escape the townspeople\u2019s watchful glares.They were all taken by the dark-edged innocence of the original designs, and now the remake is set to do the same for a new generation. Starring Natalie Dormer as Mrs. Appleyard, a headmistress hiding a secret about her past, \u201cthe whole thing is about repression,\u201d said Larysa Kondracki, one of the show\u2019s directors and its showrunner. The costumes are not decoration, Ms. Kondracki said, but an extended symbol of the societal oppression women faced during the Victorian era. \u201cThese girls have to dress themselves up to constrain themselves into a form that was expected of them,\u201d Ms. Kondracki said. Here, Edie Kurzer, the show\u2019s costume designer, describes the genesis of what may be the most influential looks in the series. \u201cWe always knew that opening shot had to have an impact to immediately establish what the Appleyard character was about. It\u2019s often quite difficult wearing black in film or TV. I don\u2019t usually use a lot of black because it disappears. So we did a lot of beadwork. It was about finding things that would reflect the light. Our costume attachment spent two weeks sewing all of those beads onto the back and the front. The beading shows her wealth, all that detail, but from a practical point of view, it gives a lot more definition to the outfit. I bought the bones of that coat that she\u2019s wearing as a starting point. Then we completely pulled it apart.\u201d\u201cThat braid that goes around the edge of that dress around the bodice for me was a key to her character. It was quite bold and strong, but it wasn\u2019t busy in the way a lace or something floral would be. I bought the braid in Sydney from a woman who had the most incredible shop when I was a teenager. In Australia there isn\u2019t a lot of stuff as old as the 1900s. She had undergarments and bloomers and bits of lace. One of the things she was also selling was vintage sari trim, for Indian saris. I bought a number of them from this woman without knowing necessarily what I was going to do with them. You stockpile stuff that feels right and start putting those things together. I built the costume around that trim. It was a real eureka moment.\u201d\u201cLumley was very much a religious person, a simple kind of woman from a quite lowly background. Her outfits weren\u2019t matched very well and were quite busy in that Victorian way, in exact opposition to what we were trying to do with Appleyard. For Lumley, it was cotton and it was dark colors, and it wasn\u2019t particularly flattering in any way.\u201d\u201cIrma was an international traveler and had to be distinctively different. She goes through the development of becoming a young woman. We were trying to reflect that in the costume. When she goes to the fete, her outfit has a lot more netting and lace and things you can see through. There\u2019s a lot more skin revealed than on anybody else. By the end, when she\u2019s leaving to go back to England, she wears a mushroom-y kind of silk, and has quite dark red gloves on and a hat and a gold sort of cape. She\u2019s still very expensive in what she\u2019s wearing, but it\u2019s a little more demure in how much skin gets revealed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Air France Dispute Threatens to Escalate Macron\u2019s Battle With Labor", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 In the first year of his presidency, Emmanuel Macron has pushed business-friendly labor laws through Parliament, made it easier for companies to hire and fire, cut the wealth tax and decentralized collective bargaining. Through it all, France\u2019s most militant unions have resisted.His changes, which set out to reshape the way France\u2019s economy and society work, are now facing increasing pushback from labor groups. For weeks, unions have staged a series of strikes to oppose efforts to make the nation\u2019s main railway system, the SNCF, more competitive. And unions representing Air France-KLM staff on Monday called for new strikes after rejecting a pay proposal.While Mr. Macron\u2019s economic changes do not take aim at the nation\u2019s flagship air carrier, his administration has inserted itself directly into the fight, warning labor leaders that they risked driving Air France to the brink of calamity.France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the company might \u201cdisappear\u201d if unions persisted in their demands for an immediate 5 percent wage increase and continued rolling strikes that have already affected tens of thousands of fliers worldwide. The French government, which owns a minority stake in Air France, would not ride to the rescue with a taxpayer bailout if the airline faltered, Mr. Le Maire said.The standoff, which has already cost the airline an estimated 300 million euros, or $360 million, in lost revenue, prompted the abrupt resignation of the airline\u2019s chief executive. Shares of the company were down 13 percent on Monday.\u201cI am not taking the money of the French and putting it in a company that isn\u2019t at the required competitive level,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said.The battle is an outgrowth of Mr. Macron\u2019s effort to remake the French economy.Mr. Macron\u2019s moves have been cheered by businesses and investors. It has encouraged drawn companies like Facebook and Amazon to step up their presence in France.In many ways, that has been Mr. Macron\u2019s point. Although only around 8 percent of the nation\u2019s workers are unionized, organized labor has long held outsize clout at the negotiating table with employers. In France, even small changes tend to agitate unions, which have historically sought to secure workplace protections through protests and strikes.Before pushing through changes to the labor laws, Mr. Macron held more than 50 meetings with unions shortly after his election in an effort to get them onboard with his program.The General Confederation of Labor, known as the C.G.T., has largely resisted, seeing an effort to repeal hard-won labor rights. The union has been at the forefront of mobilizing actions that in recent weeks have led hundreds of thousands of people into the streets, and encouraged regular strikes at the nation\u2019s railway system that are scheduled to last until July.At Air France, the government pushed back against labor groups over the weekend after the chief executive, Jean-Marc Janaillac, resigned abruptly on Friday. Mr. Janaillac had failed to win workers over in a contentious internal referendum that proposed a 7 percent pay increase for pilots and staff over four years.Air France\u2019s hard-line pilots\u2019 union had demanded an immediate 5 percent raise to make up for wages that have been frozen for nearly five years. The company has recorded record profits thanks to lower oil prices since 2016, prompting the union to insist that Air France could afford the pay increase.Still, it has set up a dangerous game of brinkmanship between unions and the French government, which has hinted that it is willing to let Air France go under.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t make the necessary efforts to be at the same competitive level of Lufthansa and other major airlines, it will disappear,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said on the French television station BFM on Sunday. He added that the union\u2019s salary demands were \u201cunjustified\u201d and urged employees to show \u201cresponsibility.\u201dSuch talk is reminiscent of Mr. Macron\u2019s broader approach to overhauling the economy. Some analysts have criticized the way he has pushed through changes to the labor laws, most of which have been done by the equivalent of executive order, raising questions about how democratic \u2014 or not \u2014 his methods have been.\u201cEmmanuel Macron is walking a fine line between the rehabilitation of a certain presidential authority and authoritarianism,\u201d Jean-Claude Monod, a specialist in political philosophy, said in an interview published Monday in the French daily Le Monde. \u201cOne has the impression of a deafness in front of forms of protest or political experimentations, of a will to use force for his reforms.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Banks Tried to Curb Gun Sales. Now Republicans Are Trying to Stop Them.", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Congress decided not to take significant action after a spate of mass shootings this year and last, some big banks opted to take matters into their own hands by restricting financing for gun sellers.Now, Republican lawmakers are pressing regulators to stop banks from doing so, over concerns they are veering too far into social activism.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to turn us into a nation of red banks and blue banks, you\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican and member of the banking committee, said in a recent interview before the latest shooting. \u201cDon\u2019t come crying to us when you screw up and you want the American taxpayer to bail you out.\u201dMr. Kennedy said he planned to file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau against banks that are effectively restricting gun sales by setting their own rules on legal products and refusing to do business with gun makers and retailers that do not comply. He is also working to get Republican colleagues to join him in writing legislation to stop banks from discriminating against gun buyers.BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, said it would begin offering a new line of investment funds that do not include producers of firearms or retailers that sell them, cutting off a potential avenue of financing for gun makers and retailers.Gun advocates have viewed the moves as a direct assault on the industry.Senator Michael D. Crapo, the Idaho Republican who heads the banking committee, sent blistering letters in late April to the top executives at Citigroup and Bank of America, accusing them of using their market power to manage social policy. He told them not to go any further and warned them against developing ways to monitor gun transactions through their payments systems, a move that gun advocates view as a dangerous step toward using data to block law-abiding customers from buying guns.\u201cI am concerned when government agencies use their power to try to cut off financial services for lawful businesses they may disfavor,\u201d Mr. Crapo wrote to Michael Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s chief executive. \u201cI am also concerned when large national banks use their market power for similar purposes.\u201dMr. Crapo reminded the banks that he had fought against Operation Choke Point, an Obama-era initiative in which the Department of Justice and bank regulators worked to discourage banks from doing business with companies such as payday lenders and gun sellers. The Trump Justice Department decided to end the policy last year.At a meeting with the Securities and Exchange Commission this month, a departing Republican commissioner, Michael Piwowar, assailed Citigroup executives over the bank\u2019s gun policies. Mr. Piwowar, according to Bloomberg News, warned that the bank could struggle to get Republican support on the commission for easing derivatives regulations. He declined to comment on the exchange.\u201cWe tried to balance respect for law-abiding gun owners and respect for the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Skyler said, explaining that the bank\u2019s goal was just to keep firearms out of the wrong hands. \u201cThe sense was nothing was really changing in our society.\u201dGun lobbyists that usually direct their resources at attacking Democrats have now jumped into the fray to take on banks, pressing Republican lawmakers to use their influence to make the banks back down.The website of the National Rifle Association\u2019s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, has been accusing bankers of infringing on constitutional rights from the comfort of New York City skyscrapers.Lawrence Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said his organization had been lobbying lawmakers in hopes they would take action against banks. He said businesses should not be able to tell consumers what legal products they could and could not buy.\u201cWe are very concerned that banks enter into this hotly contested political issue,\u201d Mr. Keane said. \u201cThese are matters for the policy arena. Banks shouldn\u2019t be interjecting themselves into this issue.\u201d\u201cPlease do not support the Dodd-Frank reform legislation without the inclusion of an amendment that stops federally funded banks from discriminating against the lawful exercise of the Second Amendment,\u201d said John Velleco, director of government operations at Gun Owners of America. No such amendment was included, and President Trump signed the bill into law on Thursday.Mr. Trump, who has not hesitated to publicly attack companies such as Amazon for policies that he opposes, has not yet weighed in on the banking industry\u2019s efforts to curb gun sales. However, members of his administration have expressed doubt that there is much their regulatory agencies could do.During congressional hearings this spring, Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Randal K. Quarles, vice chairman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, faced questions from Republican lawmakers about whether regulators could intervene.Mr. Quarles indicated that the issue was outside of the scope of the Fed\u2019s mandate. Mr. Mulvaney said that what the banks were doing to the gun industry was \u201ctroubling,\u201d but that he did not think it was his agency\u2019s role to intercede.While lawmakers have been mulling how to respond, legislation, at the moment, appears unlikely.The gun restrictions are one of the few areas where Democratic lawmakers have been supportive of the banks, and Republican leaders in the House have expressed reluctance about interfering in the financial sector despite their strong belief in gun rights.Thus far, other banks have remained quiet about their intentions, but more action against the gun industry could bring reluctant Republican lawmakers off the sidelines.\u201cI\u2019m still thinking through this, because I generally don\u2019t like to tell businesses how to conduct their business,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. \u201cBut it is certainly problematic if it were to be the case that the major banks that provide the infrastructure for so much of our financial services decided that they were going to practically shut down a perfectly legal industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Shari Redstone\u2019s response to the CBS lawsuit.\u2022 A tough road ahead for the Trump administration on trade.\u2022 Who doesn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s lifeline to ZTE?Less than an hour before hearing, Ms. Redstone issued a change to the CBS bylaws that would grant her more control of the network\u2019s board. Under the new rules, decisions on dividends would need to be approved by a \u201csupermajority\u201d of CBS\u2019s board. That likely would have blocked a potential move by most of CBS\u2019s board to issue a special dividend to water down the Redstones\u2019 voting stake to 17 percent from 79 percent.The change to bylaws is now on hold: The judge said on Wednesday that he would issue his legal opinion on Ms. Redstone\u2019s change to the bylaws in his decision on Thursday.Ahead of the hearing, Ms. Redstone\u2019s National Amusements filed its legal response to a CBS lawsuit, seeking to prevent her from blocking a special meeting of its board on whether to water down her controlling stake.Here are some of the notable parts of the filing by lawyers for National Amusements:\u2022 On CBS\u2019s contention that Ms. Redstone intends to replace its board because of its resistance to a deal: \u201cN.A.I. does not have, and has never had, any intention of replacing the CBS board or taking other action to force a merger.\u201d\u2022 Why Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery should reject a CBS board move to dilute the Redstones\u2019 voting power to 17 percent from 79 percent: \u201cThis is an unprecedented usurpation of a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting power.\u201d Later, Ms. Redstone\u2019s lawyers add, \u201cThis court has held that, absent a compelling justification (which is non-existent here), a board of directors breaches its fiduciary duty of loyalty by acting for the primary purpose of diluting a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting rights.\u201d\u2022 The revelation of which CBS director National Amusements had suggested was involved in questionable activity. The filing includes an affidavit by Robert Klieger, a CBS board member and lawyer for the Redstones (whom other directors have argued is working on behalf of Ms. Redstone), regarding a call he had had last week with Bruce Gordon, the head of the CBS board\u2019s special committee:Specifically, I noted National Amusement Inc.\u2019s discomfort with the continued CBS board position of Charles K. Gifford given certain incidents that took place in 2016 and 2017. I also discussed the possibility of facilitating Mr. Gifford\u2019s exit from the CBS board with minimal disruption and public attention, including, in the event of a merger of CBS and Viacom, through his potential non-appointment to the board of a combined company.\u2022 A lament for what Ms. Redstone is her current predicament:\u201cPlaintiffs have forced CBS\u2019s controlling stockholder into a position of having to make a Hobson\u2019s choice\u2014of either accepting massive dilution of its voting power (thereby losing control of the company and suffering the economic detriment to its stake that entails), or acting as a stockholder to prevent such dilution and protect its voting power, knowing that doing so might trigger the departure of (and payment of massive parachute payments to) key management and directors of the company.CBS filed a response to National Amusements saying that Ms. Redstone\u2019s opposition to the special meeting is proof that CBS need a temporary restraining order.\u201cUnless restrained, defendants will use the consent process to replace directors or amend bylaws in advance of Thursday\u2019s board meeting.\u201dThe context\u2014 Michael de la MercedSenate Democrats narrowly won a vote on Wednesday to save so-called net neutrality rules.Cecilia Kang of the NYT reports:The Senate passed a resolution in a 52-47 vote to overturn a decision last December by the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle Obama-era rules that prevented broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast from blocking or speeding up streams and downloads of web content in exchange for extra fees. The commission\u2019s repeal of net neutrality is set to take effect in a few weeks.The rare victory for Democrats is sure to be short-lived, with a similar resolution expected to die in the House, where Republicans have a larger majority. Only three Republican senators voted in support of the resolution.Apple has quietly explored the idea of opening a campus for 20,000 employees in Northern Virginia, further advancing the possibility that the Washington area could evolve into an East Coast outpost for Silicon Valley.His planned appearance in Brussels highlights the breadth of the international concern over how Facebook failed to prevent political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica from obtaining and using the data of many as 87 million of its users.His visit will involve a closed-door session with leaders of the European Parliament\u2019s various blocs and the head of the body\u2019s civil liberties committee, which is holding hearings on Facebook\u2019s practices, as well as a stop in Paris, where Mr. Zuckerberg is set to have lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss a range of issues.\u2014 Prashant S.

The key assumption of that era was that markets work best when the government focuses exclusively on enforcing contract and property rights.This sort of agreement is now illegal, but businesses have nevertheless found new and creative ways to achieve monopoly profits, while antitrust enforcers have fallen behind.According to one study, the power of firms to raise prices above the competitive level or cut wages below it increased more than threefold from 1980 to 2014.To revive economic growth and restore equality, we need to update the solutions first developed a century ago. Then, the focus was on breaking up monopolies, prohibiting cartels and blocking mergers. These laws helped advance broadly shared prosperity, but owners of capital devised strategies to evade them. These strategies must be addressed with new regulatory approaches.We also need a renewed public awareness of the dangers of monopolies to ensure that in the future antitrust enforcers feel the pressure to keep up with the ever-changing faces of monopoly power.Advertisement"}

In the late \u201990s, companies like AltaVista and Razorfish received the most extraordinary valuations in the history of the stock market, and their foosball-table-filled offices were the subject of breathless coverage. Their employees were rich \u2014 congenital dorkiness having become phenomenally lucrative \u2014 and a \u201cnew economy\u201d was on the horizon. The proof? In some parts of the country, you could log onto America Online through a dial-up modem, sign into Kozmo.com and order a Coca-Cola to be delivered in about an hour. Ah, liberty! In 2001, the bubble burst, but the dream of a genuinely profitable, internet-fueled economy remained.That economy is now here, most visibly in the form of a sleek slab of phone on which you might be reading (or, really, scrolling) this, and the bloom is off the digital rose. You can still get a Coke delivered, but it will be handed to you by an independent contractor for Caviar, cycling around town with a humiliating giant orange box on his back, as he makes well under minimum wage. Or it will eventually come in the back seat of a robot UberEats car, which might well have slammed into a few pedestrians on the way \u2014 the price of progress. Now, or soon, anything you want can be paid for and delivered, virtually at any time, at nearly any speed. For this great convenience, Amazon can now pretty much gull every mayor in America into selling their schools, transportation systems, birthrights, etc., in order to draw 50,000 tech employees \u2014 among the least beloved specimens of humanity \u2014 to invade and comprehensively ruin their city, block by blessed block. Those employees will be mostly white, mostly men, and mostly known for upholding an industry whose sexism is towering, peerless and, according to charmers like James Damore, not even as sexist as it should be.The effects of this bargain on all of us have been well documented \u2014 even if some of its political consequences, as with the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal, are continually ramifying \u2014 but the lives of the people who work in the industry and have foisted it on us are less well known, and this is where Corey Pein\u2019s \u201cLive Work Work Work Die\u201d attempts to fill in the picture. Pein, a staff writer for the caustic and essential little magazine The Baffler, is a former newspaper reporter, who experienced the depredations of tech \u201cdisruption\u201d firsthand. Thinking he was following the money, in 2012 he joined a Seattle-based \u201cavant-garde online news service\u201d called Demotix as its editor in chief. Soon into his tenure, Demotix was bought by Corbis, an online photography database, which proceeded to reassign photographers from war zones to \u201cchase reality TV stars around red-carpet events\u201d; not long after, Pein learned that Corbis also planned to lay off half of Demotix\u2019s employees.So, in the spirit of gonzo journalism, he decides to high-tail it to the Bay Area to sell a start-up and document the horrors of his temporarily adopted home along the way. The idea he comes up with is called \u201cLaborize,\u201d a company that would hire itself out to one organization to unionize a rival \u2014 it would, say, contract with Uber to unionize Lyft \u2014 and therefore ruin the competitive advantage that comes from denying health care, steady wages and other benefits of unionization. It is a clever ploy that cuts to the heart of what makes Silicon Valley a very pure example of capitalism: the fact that it screws over, or tries to automate into the digital ether, a vast proportion of the American work force, in order to enrich, artificially and enormously, a small proportion of investors and owners, whose companies are \u2014 more often than not \u2014 profoundly unprofitable.It probably doesn\u2019t ruin the surprise to point out that Pein\u2019s efforts are a failure: His start-up plans stall out. Nor does his exhaustive, scathing description of what Silicon Valley companies do make for a serious contribution to journalism about the tech industry. More than gonzo, an aura of laziness pervades the exercise. In an emblematic passage, Pein visits the Googleplex in Mountain View, but doesn\u2019t manage to get inside any of the buildings, which in my experience is not so hard to do. Instead he wanders around outside, telling us that it \u201clooks like pretty much any other dismal suburban office park\u201d and that \u201cthe real story hid behind the blackened windows of the squat office buildings.\u201d The real story \u2014 digitizing, data mining, etc. \u2014 turns out to be what is already widely available in reporting elsewhere, in any case uncited in Pein\u2019s book.Still, despite and perhaps a little because of its lackadaisical approach to its subject, \u201cLive Work Work Work Die\u201d manages to capture something essential about Silicon Valley that has eluded other authors. This is because Pein starts from the grimy underbelly of tech and never makes it out, which accurately reflects the experience of many tech workers. We only learn of those who make it big \u2014 Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. We rarely hear of the people who fail, or work uselessly and endlessly hard, without much in the way of reward.Struggling to find an apartment in San Francisco\u2019s stratospherically overheated rental market, Pein settles for an Airbnb in which he has to share a room with four people and, because of what appears to be its uncertain legal status, has only one key. Calling it the Hacker Condo, he notes that all four residents are \u201cimmigrants or the children of immigrants, and therefore accustomed to getting jerked around,\u201d and that the foreign-born residents are on H-1B visas, an arrangement that requires them to stay employed. But the lure of making it big keeps everyone working insane hours. Many of the people he meets \u201chad a mysterious \u2018side project\u2019 \u2014 a start-up in the making \u2014 that was inevitably too ill formed to talk about, or far too technically complicated to remember.\u201d Pein realizes that most of these \u201ctech bros\u201d were \u201cdoomed to be desk jockeys for life, forever dreaming of their star turn as Job Creators.\u201dThis is an exhausting, one-note book, but the tinny, grating note Pein repeatedly strikes may nonetheless be one the world needs to hear more often. As Pein migrates from the Hacker Condo to, eventually, a literal tent ($35 a day on Airbnb), he passes through lurid publicity parties for companies like Nerdwallet, which raised $64 million in its first round of fund-raising and makes money from advertising and referral fees earned when it steers users toward certain loans or insurance policies. Its employees describe their executives (on the review site GlassDoor) as \u201ctreacherous, languishing souls who want to claw as much money as possible\u201d from their investors and clients, and claim not even to know \u201cwhat the product is.\u201d He pays $29.70 to join a start-up pitch competition \u2014 a kind of live \u201cShark Tank\u201d \u2014 whose theme is captured in the downer of a phrase \u201cHack immigration.\u201dHis failed journey around the depressing periphery of the tech industry, its warrens suffused with the distinct scent of unadulterated bull, is a preview of the bleak, airless future it aims to deliver, by driverless car or drone, to all of us.Nikil Saval is the author of \u201cCubed: The Secret History of the Workplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the President Takes On Amazon, Nobody Wins", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIf President Trump resumes his fight with Amazon, the ultimate loser is clear: It will be the American economy.Economists are a disputatious bunch, but across the political spectrum we agree on one thing: Politicians shouldn\u2019t be attacking specific companies based on their own whims or preferences.But putting the factual basis of these claims aside, there is another problem that may even be even bigger: The president was unnecessarily specific about a single company.Some economic interventions necessarily pinpoint particular companies. When talking about the major credit rating agencies, for example, it\u2019s hard to avoid talking about the big three: Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch.That isn\u2019t the case here. The issues the president raised about Amazon actually apply to large parts of the economy. For example, every retail transaction on the web raises the thorny issue of how to handle local sales taxes. But Amazon itself collects taxes for 45 states and the District of Columbia.Political interference in markets is always dangerous. But when it is narrowly targeted, it is particularly so.First, such interference creates unclear rules.Any sports fan knows the frustration of watching a game with arbitrary and unpredictable refereeing. Consistency is equally important for a well-functioning economy.Capricious refereeing complicates managerial decision-making. It distorts cost-benefit calculations, delaying decisions and wasting resources.Second, political targeting opens the door to various forms of corruption. When politicians play an outsized role in the economy, companies must curry their favor.This is obvious in many countries, particularly poor ones, where politicians interfere heavily in local economies by deciding such matters as which companies will get a license to operate and which will be audited by the tax authority. Managers must focus as much effort on catering to politicians as to customers, not just through campaign contributions but through bribes, both subtle and overt.These incentives don\u2019t merely warp the economy. They alter the political sphere, too.Companies have many tools at their disposal when they seek to influence politicians. A few weeks before an election, a company seeking to help a candidate can announce a major plant opening. Or it can cut prices in response to a politician\u2019s entreaties.Professor Fisman found that when Suharto\u2019s health was reported to be poor, the shares of companies most closely linked to the ultimate leader declined the most sharply. As Professor Fisman put it, \u201cA large percentage of a well connected firm\u2019s value may be derived from political connections.\u201dStock prices of such companies did not budge when his political fortunes rose \u2014 as when he was first chosen as the vice-presidential candidate \u2014 or when his health was impaired while in office.The heartening truth is that until now, the United States has, by and large, done a good job of insulating the economy from political interference. Should that insulation wear down, though, we will find ourselves in a troubling world. That\u2019s why President Trump\u2019s campaign against Amazon is worthy of continuing scrutiny.Any possible interference with freedom of the press endangers the economy \u2014 and much more. An efficient economy \u2014 and a democracy \u2014 requires uniform application of the law.We live in partisan times. But we all can root for the rule of law. It\u2019s not a particularly exciting cause, but it is in dire need of supporters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Hit This Small Town Hard. Now, Locals Hope It Will Fuel a Revival.", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "Holywell, a town in Wales with dozens of local retailers, has struggled with the impacts of online shopping. It is applying technology to try and keep its shops open.Supported byHOLYWELL, Wales \u2014 Officials in this Welsh town will soon install free Wi-Fi along their lone shopping street. They are erecting the first electric car chargers in the area. And this past winter, small businesses began partnering with an American mobile payments system in the hope of getting more people in their stores.This is small-town tech \u2014 the scattershot response as communities try in any way possible to draw shoppers back to their High Streets and Main Streets.Many places like Holywell are experimenting with new technologies and digital services, in a defensive crouch against the dominance of e-commerce and the lure of bigger cities. Along with the car chargers and free Wi-Fi, officials here have added digital \u201cbeacons\u201d that describe local attractions to aid smartphone-toting tourists.Although such efforts will hardly insulate their economies, the alternative amounts to giving up. Shop owners are hopeful the moves will help them survive, and improve the mood of an area that has seen decades of decline.\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re a little town in the middle of nowhere,\u201d said Ted Palmer, whose barbershop lies just off Holywell\u2019s main shopping area, the High Street. \u201cUnless you\u2019re open to change, you will drown.\u201dHolywell lies close to a Christian religious site popular with tourists and is a short drive from the Welsh coast, but it has always relied on its shops to fuel the local economy. In recent years, though, many have closed, including a stationery store, a drugstore and an appliance retailer. Then, in a matter of months, three of the town\u2019s four bank branches closed.Its High Street is a shell of its former self. Shopping is increasingly being done over the internet, and major retailers are able to drive down prices while offering premium services like next-day delivery on hard-to-find items.Customers in Holywell can have their groceries brought straight to their front doors from online supermarkets like Ocado, and much else from the shopping behemoth Amazon. Instead of local grocery stores, residents can drive up to a mammoth Tesco supermarket a short distance from the High Street, or take the short walk to Home Bargains, a nationwide discount retailer.Indeed, in much of Britain and the world, people can use smartphones and the internet to get restaurants to dispatch food to their homes, arrange an appointment with a repair person or cleaner, and have their laundry picked up. (Mr. Palmer joked that, for now at least, haircuts could not be delivered online.)The closings have forced stores to keep large amounts of cash on site, leaving some shop owners fearful of burglaries or thefts. People who would have gone into the town to do their banking are going elsewhere. And foot traffic into the center of Holywell, a town with a population of 9,000, has dropped off drastically.When Helen Ryles-Owen opened her stationery store in the middle of Holywell, her only local competitor had recently shut down, and her sister promised to help run the new business. But their timing \u2014 opening just weeks before the bank closings began \u2014 was bad.\u201cWould I have opened here\u201d knowing the branches were closing, Ms. Ryles-Owen asked. \u201cI would have thought twice.\u201dThe efforts by Holywell to transform itself and its town center belie its long history. In the British vernacular, Holywell is a market town. Edward I granted monks a charter to establish a weekly market here in the 13th century, and they used it to sell ale and collect taxes from farmers and traders who came to hawk their wares. By the beginning of the 19th century, there were dozens of shops, inns and beer houses.While the weekly market still continues, it now varies between around 25 stalls during the Christmas period, down to half a dozen during the cold and wet days of winter. Offices of the local council, which is responsible for issues like garbage collection as well as services like libraries, moved to another town long ago, taking jobs with them. Workers at a nearby quarry and asphalt plant rarely venture into Holywell, staying instead at a hotel on the town\u2019s outskirts.The High Street, which runs less than 300 yards, is today an assortment of cafes, barber shops and stores selling items ranging from e-cigarettes to shoes. The lone surviving bank branch, of the Spanish lender Santander, has a single ATM. Holywell residents complain there is always a queue, and the machine frequently runs out of cash.The town\u2019s embrace of tech was happenstance.In recent years, the monthly meetings of a local government committee featured regular discussion of the difficulties faced by the town\u2019s High Street and potential solutions. The High Street, which was fully pedestrianized decades ago, would be reopened to vehicle traffic. Electric vehicle chargers would be installed to lure wealthier car owners. Free Wi-Fi would be added to help ensure those customers stuck around.Then at the Labour Party\u2019s annual conference in September, David Hanson, Holywell\u2019s member of Parliament, ran into Sarah Harvey, who heads the British operations of Square, the American mobile payments company. A trial was hatched.Square would offer its card readers \u2014 small white boxes that connect to a smartphone \u2014 free to businesses in Holywell. And the Silicon Valley company would use the experience to learn about companies in Britain, a market it had entered only months earlier.For small businesses, Square and others like it can be a cheaper alternative to the companies that currently dominate card processing. Square typically sells its card readers for a one-off charge, and then levies a flat 1.75 percent fee on all card transactions carried out in-store. Traditional services that are usually found in stores usually charge a monthly rental for readers, and often require longer-term contracts.Retailers in Holywell say another benefit is the portability of Square\u2019s readers, which connect easily to smartphones and can be carried to trade fairs and shows. This month, Ms. Ryles-Owen took her card reader to the Llandudno Extravaganza, a Victorian-themed fair about 30 miles from Holywell.Business owners here are cleareyed about the impact so far. The service has not suddenly driven a significant increase in trade, nor do they expect it to. But many say it has stanched a fall, and allowed them to appeal to a wider array of customers, particularly younger ones, who use cash less than previous generations.At a recent reception held near Parliament in London, Mr. Hanson, representatives from Square and Holywell business owners related their experience to more than a dozen lawmakers. Questions ranged from how the system worked (trial units were on hand) to how fast entrepreneurs received payments (the next working day).Russ Warburton, 56, was one of more than 60 business owners in Holywell who signed up for Square. Revenue for his lighting business had fallen by almost 30 percent after the branch closings. Using Square helped flatten that out. He acknowledged that was a small victory, but one that nevertheless encouraged him \u2014 and other fellow business owners \u2014 to consider new investments. Mr. Warburton is now expanding from lighting to antiques and refurbishing furniture.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem,\u201d Mr. Warburton, the chairman of the town\u2019s business council, said. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get the High Street back to what it was 30, 40 years ago, because people\u2019s shopping habits have changed.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just trying everything we can to bring people back into the town.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018In Praise of Wasting Time\u2019 Speaks Ominously of a Digital \u2018Grid\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe M.I.T. professor Alan Lightman has produced a highly personal polemic targeting the subversive impact on civilization of the increasingly frenetic pace of life. His book, \u201cIn Praise of Wasting Time,\u201d proposes \u201cthat half our waking minds be designated and saved for quiet reflection.\u201d Failure to heed his recommendation, Professor Lightman warns, will result in the collective destruction of \u201cour inner selves and our creative capacities.\u201dIn reaching this conclusion, Professor Lightman, an eclectic physicist, novelist and essayist, draws on personal experience and historical anecdotes as well as research on a variety of topics like creativity and loneliness, productivity and meditation. The common culprit behind \u201ctoday\u2019s time-driven, wired existence\u201d that threatens our very humanity is identified ominously as something called \u201cthe grid.\u201d The grid is described as \u201cthe vast and all-consuming network\u201d whose digital tentacles have already transformed \u201cour entire way of thinking\u201d and \u201cour way of being in the world, our social and psychological ethos.\u201dProfessor Lightman documented a variety of disturbing social phenomena to back up his views. These include an increase in teenage depression, a study in which college students preferred to self-administer a painful electric shock rather than sit quietly with their thoughts for 12 minutes, and a decline in creativity among children. As provocative and often entertaining as these and his more personal observations are, their connection to the emergence of \u201cthe grid\u201d is often tenuous at best.For instance, the research on child creativity notes a decline beginning in 1990, which Professor Lightman asserts \u201capproximately coincides with the public emergence of the internet.\u201d In fact, the first web page wasn\u2019t created until 1991 and wasn\u2019t fully commercialized until 1995 when Amazon and eBay\u2019s predecessor began operations.More problematically, it is never fully clear what is meant by \u201cwasting time.\u201d At certain points in the book this appears synonymous with \u201cnon-goal oriented uses of time,\u201d but the chapter extolling the virtue of all forms of \u201cplay\u201d is chock-full of goal-oriented activities. What\u2019s more, one study he highlights used playing the 1990s video games Minesweeper or Solitaire as examples of time wasting that fostered creativity. It is hard to distinguish this activity from much of what is undertaken by those who have become \u201cintravenously connected to the grid.\u201dIn his chapter on creativity, Professor Lightman instead emphasizes the value of \u201cletting the mind wander and spin.\u201d His own previous study found the great scientific discoveries of the 20th century were often achieved after first getting \u201cstuck\u201d on what seemed to be an insoluble problem. The breakthrough came after finding a relaxed environment in which the scientists\u2019 minds \u201ccan roam and explore and invent in unfettered freedom.\u201dThe vast majority of knowledge is acquired the old-fashioned way: hard, focused acquisition of increasing expertise. Although there is clearly value to unfocused activity \u2014 what Professor Lightman calls the free-grazing mind \u2014 to get unstuck, there is no evidence that for most people it makes sense to dedicate anything like half our waking hours to such musing. In his flurry of wide-ranging anecdotes, he mixes the examples of the work habits of pure creatives like Gertrude Stein and Federico Fellini with those of research scientists. Just as he fails to adequately distinguish between very different forms of wasting time, Professor Lightman fails to consider the relative applicability of his proposals to different use cases.Like the provocative title, the hostility to \u201cthe grid\u201d that underpins \u201cIn Praise of Wasting Time\u201d sometimes feels more like a narrative hook than a genuine, deeply held view. During a flattering description of a 10-day Tibetan Buddhism retreat, Professor Lightman was careful to note that he didn\u2019t \u201crecall seeing any laptops or smartphones.\u201d Yet his own \u201cfree-grazing\u201d mental activities included remembering \u201ca high school friend who had abruptly stopped answering my letters.\u201d The professor mentions in passing that with \u201csome sleuthing, I confirmed that he was alive and well.\u201d Sounds like someone sneaked a smartphone into the retreat to do a little Googling!\u201cIn Praise of Wasting Time\u201d is published by TED Books, one of the many spinoff businesses of the wildly popular conferences described by the author Nassim Nicholas Taleb as a \u201cmonstrosity that turns scientists and thinkers into low-level entertainers, like circus performers.\u201d The ubiquity of TED Talks is both a symptom of the grid against which Professor Lightman rails and a source of its popularity. Like the internet itself, they can be neither easily dismissed nor fully embraced. The witches\u2019 brew of interesting ideas, exaggerated claims and unsatisfying generalizations that make up this volume both reflects and reveals some of the conundrums of our wired age.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What to Watch For at Cannes", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are some films people will be talking about this year at Cannes.The opening film of Directors\u2019 Fortnight is being advertised as \u201cthe origin story of the drug trade.\u201d The filmmakers Ciro Guerra and Cristina Gallego of Colombia portray a family crime dynasty that faces a clash between tradition and the brutal demands of its illicit business. In 2015, Mr. Guerra mesmerized audiences with the trancelike Amazon River drama \u201cEmbrace of the Serpent,\u201d and he is already at work on his next film with Robert Pattinson.Spike Lee is in the competition for the first time since \u201cJungle Fever\u201d in 1991. Mr. Lee\u2019s Cannes comeback seems likely to fry the brain circuits of viewers: It\u2019s the true story of Ron Stallworth, a black Colorado police detective who went undercover in the Ku Klux Klan in the late 1970s with the help of a white fellow officer. John David Washington, who played a conflicted cop in the Sundance award-winner \u201cMonsters and Men,\u201d stars as Mr. Stallworth with Adam Driver as his partner.Fans of Haruki Murakami will be curious about this adaptation of his short story \u201cBarn Burning.\u201d The director Lee Chang-dong of South Korea has spun a feature out of the tale\u2019s chance encounters between a writer and a freewheeling couple (an arsonist and a model). Mr. Lee\u2019s take may not follow all the particulars of the original, but Mr. Murakami\u2019s text is in good hands: The filmmaker\u2019s last feature, \u201cPoetry,\u201d won Best Screenplay at Cannes. Steven Yuen, a \u201cWalking Dead\u201d alumnus, plays the fire-starter.The third feature from Nadine Labaki, a Lebanese director and actor, puts a new twist on the enduring theme of children finding their own place in the world. The story concerns a 12-year-old boy who sues his parents for bringing him into the world. Ms. Labaki, who directed the warm and wise beauty parlor drama \u201cCaramel,\u201d again taps nonprofessional actors for much of her cast and uses a Middle Eastern fishing village for a setting.Much like Terry Gilliam\u2019s long-gestating \u201cThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote,\u201d Lars Von Trier\u2019s latest feature was nearly going to be famous for not showing at Cannes. The uncertainty arose because Mr. Von Trier had been banned from the festival for comments he made in 2011 about Hitler. His film will screen out of competition. Mr. Von Trier\u2019s newest provocation evokes pure, twisted id: A serial killer (Matt Dillon) undertakes five murders as if they were art. Uma Thurman, Bruno Ganz and Riley Keough also star.A few years ago at Cannes, Jean-Luc Godard drew wild applause midfilm for the 3-D experiments of \u201cGoodbye to Language.\u201d The feat proved that a new film by the 87-year-old Mr. Godard remains an event, and after he missed the last edition, the 2018 lineup at last features his latest venture into the poetics of pure cinema. The film reportedly addresses the present and past of the Middle East, but as ever, the real draw is Mr. Godard.Lazzaro, a good-hearted farm boy, befriends a nobleman named Tancredi in Alice Rohrwacher\u2019s long-awaited feature after \u201cThe Wonders,\u201d a winner in the 2014 competition. Strange adventures in modernity ensue after Tancredi enlists Lazzaro in a kidnapping scheme involving \u2026 Tancredi. Ms. Rohrwacher\u2019s feel for secluded communities and the wisdom of innocents looks to be on display in the story, which has a time-travel component that the director compares to the story of Rip Van Winkle.Bi Gan may not be as well known as his compatriot Jia Zhangke (who is also appearing in this year\u2019s edition), but his prior feature, \u201cKaili Blues,\u201d announced a spectacular new voice in Chinese cinema. In his next film, starring Sylvia Chang and Tang Wei, a man goes on a quest to track down a woman from his past. It\u2019s film noir, but infused with dazzling color. At the press conference announcing this year\u2019s lineup, the feature was described as a mix of David Lynch and Hou Hsiao-hsien.Andrew Garfield stars as a lost soul in what sounds like a classic trip into a Pynchon-esque California bizarro-world. Mr. Garfield\u2019s character begins by trying to track down a beguiling woman who has disappeared, but who knows where it goes from there.

{"Headline": "A Boom in Filming Gives Atlanta Stage Actors Room to Maneuver", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 Danielle Deadwyler dreamed of being an actress, but in 2008 when she was a teaching assistant at a charter school, it seemed like an impossibility. Yes, the theater scene here was budding, but film and television opportunities were few and far between.Fast forward a decade, and Ms. Deadwyler is juggling roles and auditions for both stage and screen, while developing her passion projects. Like many of her fellow performers, she can thank the huge increase in movie and television filming in Georgia.\u201cAtlanta\u2019s film and television swell has enabled me to practice my craft in multiple mediums right at home,\u201d said Ms. Deadwyler, who also has appeared in \u201cGreenleaf\u201d on the Oprah Winfrey Network.It was practically impossible to make a full-time living as an actor in Atlanta, and performers often had to travel to New York for regional theater, television and film auditions. But in 2008, everything changed. The governor signed a new tax law, allowing for up to 30 percent of Georgia production spending to be transferred into tax credits.Everything from recording a film score to catering on a set can qualify for a credit, with no dollar amount limit, as long as a Georgia vendor is used. Yellow production signs started appearing all over the city, and beloved theater actors started appearing on the silver screen.\u201cMy OGs tell me stories of the days you had to drive two-plus hours for an audition every time, callbacks included,\u201d Ms. Deadwyler said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m able to take my son to school, go prep for my audition, do the audition and pick him up to be home to make dinner.\u201dAccording to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, the film and television industry made a $9.5 billion impact on the state in fiscal year 2017, making the state the top filming location in the world.Some 40 major movies and network television shows are now shooting in the state, and countless more independent projects. Among those recently filmed: \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d and, of course, the Emmy-winning FX comedy \u201cAtlanta.\u201dThe flood started with a trickle, thanks to movies like \u201cDrumline\u201d and \u201cATL,\u201d which showcased the city\u2019s cultural landscape. The emergence of Tyler Perry Studios in 2008 marked a colossal turning point. The original studio was located in southwest Atlanta; in 2016 Mr. Perry completed construction on a facility that sits on more than 300 acres of an old army base near the airport. Mr. Perry has three shows on the Oprah Winfrey Network right now; and in the past year, 33 different productions have filmed at the studios.As opportunities expanded, actors in surrounding states took notice.Last year, she appeared on five episodes of \u201cOzark,\u201d the Netflix series with Jason Bateman and Laura Linney. She recently filmed \u201cLore\u201d for Amazon Prime, and this spring is working on two independent films.She also found time to star as Viola (the Gwyneth Paltrow role) in Alliance Theater\u2019s stage version of \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d\u201cNo one can earn their living doing theater in Atlanta, because there\u2019s not enough work,\u201d Ms. Lind said bluntly. \u201cSo if you\u2019re going to make a living as an actor, you have to be on camera.\u201d\u201cI think I got here at just the right time,\u201d she added. \u201cThree or four years ago, all of the agencies in town were swamped and couldn\u2019t keep up, but they\u2019re figuring it out now.\u201d\u201cI thought that my talent only translated in Atlanta, but film and television has shown me that I can do this anywhere,\u201d said Mr. King. \u201cIt\u2019s really invigorating.\u201dAlthough there are two dozen professional theater companies in metropolitan Atlanta, the 520 union members in the Atlanta area average 5.6 weeks of stage work per year. That leaves a lot of room for work in non-Equity stage productions, as well as film, television, commercials and industrials.Some actors try to balance it all by negotiating a \u201chard out\u201d that allows them to be released from the set of a TV shoot at a certain time.\u201cI was on set for 12 hours filming that day, left at 5:30 p.m., picked up some Chick-fil-A, cleared my head and did opening night of \u2018Crossing Delancey,\u2019\u201d he recalled.Even with the long hours, Mr. Benator, like most actors, enjoys the variety.\u201cIf I was doing a lot of TV, I\u2019d want to do a play and if I was doing a lot of theater, I\u2019d want to do film and TV,\u201d he said. \u201cI just like to do good writing.\u201dMs. Deadwyler is optimistic as well.\u201cI can do theater, film and TV in this city,\u201d she said. \u201cI can do indie, experimental and commercial film projects in this city. Atlanta has its limitations and challenges. However, with work and ingenuity, an artist can craft a creative life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Moonlighting at The New York Times", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore Paul Moon worked at The New York Times, he played a journalist on TV.The role was on the soap opera \u201cAll My Children,\u201d in 2013, and Mr. Moon was cast as a local news reporter.Looking back, he said there were parts of his portrayal he nailed: \u201cBeing able to speak forcefully but remain sort of emotionally detached,\u201d for instance.But now, after three years working in the newsroom at The Times\u2019s headquarters in New York, he said he would approach the part differently.\u201cIt\u2019s honestly very similar to being around a bunch of artists because journalists are so particular and they\u2019re so eccentric,\u201d he said.Mr. Moon, 28, is one of many employees whose interests \u2014 and dreams \u2014 infuse the daily news report. Over the years, news assistants have doubled as actors, painters, fashion designers and musicians.Steven McElroy, The Times\u2019s director of newsroom operations and Mr. Moon\u2019s boss, also has a background as a theater actor and director. Although many Times employees are journalism-school graduates who have always wanted to report, produce or edit, \u201cthere\u2019s certainly a subset of people that have come from theater and the restaurant industry,\u201d Mr. McElroy said.Mr. Moon, frequently referred to as the \u201cnewsroom ham,\u201d is known for his knack for bringing absurdity to the mundane.Mr. Moon approaches daily tasks \u2014 like ordering ergonomic equipment or making signs for conference rooms \u2014 with levity. The self-proclaimed Times \u201cHead of Eating,\u201d he\u2019s the guy who always manages to find, and help himself to, any snacks that appear in the office. (\u201cI can sniff out free food like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d he said.)\u201cHe\u2019s built up quite a fan base,\u201d said The Times\u2019s senior night editor, Steve Kenny. \u201cHe knows names, habits, whereabouts and interests of so many of his colleagues, and he plays to his audience.\u201d\u201cHe has a whole other agenda in his life and career, but he still doesn\u2019t phone it in here. He is very present,\u201d Mr. McElroy said. \u201cSomehow I think it makes all of us feel a little less stressed out.\u201dAccording to his parents, Mr. Moon has always had his own vision. When he was in elementary school, his mother encouraged him to play baseball. But one day, he walked off the field during the middle of the game, tired of being stuck out in right field. \u201cThe coach and I were trying to convince him to go back out and he just said: \u2018It\u2019s boring. I don\u2019t want to do this,\u2019 \u201d his mother, Angela Moon, remembered.Mr. Moon said his inspiration to be an actor came when he was 10 and watched a commercial for \u201cFight Club\u201d starring Brad Pitt. In high school he became a champion fencer; he planned to fence at Ohio State, but once he was enrolled, he decided to pursue theater instead.After graduating, Mr. Moon moved to New York and got a job selling merchandise \u2014 programs, T-shirts, fridge magnets \u2014 for Broadway shows. While appearing in a play, he met an actor who was married to a Times employee, and Mr. Moon applied for a job at The Times.Recently promoted to supervisor on The Times\u2019s newsroom operations team, he now oversees a group of news assistants who help with building operations. But his schedule is flexible and allows for some acting commitments. \u201cMost of the time I\u2019m just going for an audition, which is usually like 15 minutes, and then I\u2019ll come back,\u201d Mr. Moon said. (He also uses his lunch breaks.)He recently appeared in Season 1 of \u201cThe Tick,\u201d a comic-book-inspired series on Amazon, in a recurring role as one of the bad guys, Khufu. He\u2019s now also writing a television series called \u201cThem\u201d which deals with gender issues in rural America.Still, his parents would like to see him commit to the stability of a job at The Times.His father, Jim Moon, said he told Paul, \u201cIf you get cast in a role, don\u2019t just say, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ve made it and I\u2019m resigning.\u2019 \u201dMr. Moon says that\u2019s the plan for now \u2014 until, of course, \u201cI book something huge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tariff Impact Colors a Key House Race in Boeing Country", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUBURN, Wash. \u2014 President Trump likes to keep negotiating partners on their toes. But workers like Charles Cesmat have been just as unnerved by the president\u2019s recent moves on trade.Mr. Cesmat is a parts manager at a Boeing plant in Renton, Wash., just south of Seattle. One of every four planes Boeing assembles is sent to China. Each time Mr. Trump attacks Beijing on Twitter, or announces a new set of tariffs, Mr. Cesmat winces.\u201cI\u2019m concerned a potential trade war could affect work for our members and work for me,\u201d Mr. Cesmat said. \u201cThousands of people\u2019s jobs rely on a working relationship with China.\u201dThe spat with Beijing has rattled the state\u2019s juggernaut aerospace industry, as workers and business owners reckon with the possibility that their livelihood could be at risk. Boeing shares economic dominance with giants like Amazon and Microsoft, but trade still supports 40 percent of all jobs in Washington, according to a Seattle consulting firm.\u201cTrade issues are high on people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Chris Mefford, president of Community Attributes Inc., the firm that produced the estimate. \u201cThey are wondering and worrying how it\u2019s going to play out.\u201dThat anxiety is particularly acute in the Eighth Congressional District, a comma-shaped expanse that will hold one of the most closely watched midterm races in November as the Democrats battle to win back the House. Several political handicappers rate the race as a tossup.The district\u2019s quirky boundary, which encompasses the vast airplane-making ecosystem to the west and thousands of acres of cherry and apple farms on the other side of the Cascade Mountains, makes the territory uniquely vulnerable to the president\u2019s actions on trade. Boeing is probably the American company with the most riding on a healthy relationship with Beijing.China is projected to buy more than 7,000 planes worth around $1 trillion in the next 20 years, more than Boeing\u2019s current backlog for the entire world. Most commercial aircraft in China are made by Boeing, the company says, but if the trade pressures escalate, China could choose to award more work to Europe\u2019s Airbus.For now, Beijing has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on some airplanes, including older 737 models made in the Renton factory where Mr. Cesmat works, which is just outside the district.\u201cChina knew exactly where to target,\u201d said Kim Schrier, the Democratic candidate who has built the biggest campaign war chest ahead of the Aug. 7 primary. \u201cThey\u2019re targeting districts where this could be problematic for Republicans.\u201dMs. Schrier is among half a dozen or so Democrats gunning for a seat that became catnip for the party the moment that the seven-term Republican incumbent, Dave Reichert, announced his retirement in September. Despite Mr. Reichert\u2019s success, the district favored Hillary Clinton by three percentage points over Mr. Trump, and it went twice for Barack Obama. Ms. Schrier, a pediatrician and first-time candidate, has been hammering Dino Rossi, the likely Republican nominee, on the tariff issue.\u201cThese tariffs are a direct response to the policies of a president you helped elect. Don\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d she tweeted to Mr. Rossi last month.Mr. Rossi, a former state senator, is careful to note that the bluster could be part of Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiating style. But he said he understood why everyone was so worried. \u201cYou really can\u2019t get down to a trade war. In the end it will be very disruptive,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHopefully this is more posturing than anything.\u201dBut voters in the district say the escalating trade drama has already begun to complicate their daily lives. Companies that supply construction materials have suspended orders, waiting to see what happens to metal prices. Employees at a builder of truck components say managers have been hastily reassessing supply chains that run through China and Mexico. A local hard-cider brewer is reconsidering an expansion after the steel and aluminum tariffs made new tanks and cans more expensive.And at Boeing, a company that employs grandfathers next to granddaughters and has introduced generations of Washingtonians to their spouses, the unease has been evident from the executive suite to the factory floor.Mr. Trump\u2019s hard line on trade didn\u2019t used to inspire so much teeth-grinding among Boeing workers. A lot of union mechanics were happy last year when he pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have reinforced the nation\u2019s embrace of free trade. And the president earned a lot of fans in Washington when he criticized the company on the campaign trail in 2015 for setting up a new plant outside Shanghai, saying it would \u201cend up taking a tremendous number of jobs away from the United States.\u201dJim McKenzie, a union machinery repairman, remembered that comment when, several months ago, he came across a package of dorsal-fin parts at the Boeing plant in Auburn where he works. Mr. McKenzie pulled back the Bubble Wrap and saw a label that made him feel as if he were sinking into quicksand: Boeing China.\u201cWe drill it and assemble it, but they ship the parts in from China,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said. \u201cThere are people who have worked here for 25 years making those parts, and they\u2019re proud of that.\u201dBut Mr. McKenzie, 56, isn\u2019t eager to blow up the Beijing relationship. \u201cChina will just buy all their planes from Airbus,\u201d he said, leaning his chair back against a wall in the machinists\u2019 union hall in Auburn.He doesn\u2019t have much hope that Mr. Trump will do anything to stop Boeing from setting up shop in China \u2014 he saw how Carrier shipped work from Indianapolis to Mexico even though the president had railed against the move. In Boeing\u2019s case, Mr. McKenzie said, hiring some Chinese workers might be unavoidable. \u201cYou have to provide them jobs to sell them airplanes,\u201d he said.Ms. Schrier recently won the endorsement of the machinists\u2019 union, which represents more than 26,000 Boeing workers. Mr. Cesmat, 27, plans to volunteer for her campaign. \u201cShe pledged to support our jobs,\u201d he said.Boeing\u2019s political action committee donated $2,000 to Mr. Reichert\u2019s campaign, but hasn\u2019t contributed to any candidates vying to succeed him, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. It did donate $8,000 to Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is facing a strong Democratic challenge in her quest for re-election in Washington\u2019s Fifth District.The fear over trade tensions has spread beyond Boeing\u2019s hulking factories, all the way to Schilling Cider, a hard-cider company founded here five years ago by two friends, Mark Kornei and Colin Schilling. The business grew quickly, thanks in part to the state\u2019s abundant apple orchards, but now it\u2019s staring down an uncomfortable new reality.The company that sells Mr. Kornei stainless-steel tanks told him recently that prices for its raw materials might rise by 20 percent. A single tank costs around $50,000. He has also heard from the manufacturer of his aluminum cans that prices could increase by 10 percent. Mr. Kornei will buy 11 million of them this year, so that uptick alone could cost him more than $100,000, he said.\u201cStirring the pot unnecessarily doesn\u2019t help business whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Kornei said. \u201cGive us a steady set of rules so we can figure out what we are going to do.\u201dMr. Rossi acknowledged that some of what the president says and does \u201ccan at times\u201d make it harder for him on the campaign trail. But he has raised more than $2 million, about twice as much as Ms. Schrier.The Republican tax cuts are a big selling point for Mr. Rossi, who has a ready figure for exactly how much a typical household will save because of the law (\u201c$3,357 \u2014 that\u2019s real money\u201d). He\u2019s also counting on a personal bond with Republican voters east of the Cascades.Kirk Johnson contributed reporting from Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans Can\u2019t Even Cut Red Tape Correctly", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Republicans look at what they\u2019ve gotten out of their current moment of unified government, they can point to cutting corporate taxes, some judicial appointments and \u2026 not much else. Beyond that, they claim that they\u2019ve teed up the economy for explosive growth through the magic of \u201cderegulation.\u201d But deregulation is a term that should be banned from the nation\u2019s policy lexicon, mixing as it does equal parts wholesome and foul \u2014 in this administration, almost exclusively foul.The wholesome justification for deregulation arises when government uses its power in ways that gum up the dynamic power of markets. In the long run, our nation\u2019s wealth and the opportunity it provides for improving quality of life depend on the forces of creative destruction. In competitive, open markets, incumbent actors cannot prevent challenges from more nimble competitors, armed with new products or more efficient ways of organizing the production process.This process can be stifled when government acts in ways that stymie or distort competition. Our economy is, increasingly, plagued by these kinds of constraints. The growth of patent and copyright protection over the past few decades has made it harder for new companies to recombine existing technologies in new ways, thus shielding the entertainment industry, tech companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers from challenges. Byzantine regulation of housing construction at the local level has made the cost of living prohibitively expensive in many high-growth areas and blocked millions of workers from moving to high-paying jobs. The growth of company-specific tax subsidies (like those offered by places in competition for Amazon\u2019s HQ2) has shoveled resources toward large businesses that can effectively lobby for government largess.The list could go on, but the point is simple \u2014 in all these areas, there are huge opportunities for growth that are being hamstrung by rules that protect existing companies at the expense of new ones. A bonfire of regulations like this would be entirely wholesome for the American economy and also help to eat away at some of the hyper-inequality that is generated by these forms of crony capitalism.Unfortunately, this is not the kind of regulation that the Trump administration has been attacking. Instead, it has been sharpening its knives for precisely the kinds of regulation that, far from distorting markets, help to improve them. In particular, regulation is often necessary to a properly functioning market when, in its absence, businesses can make a profit by pushing costs onto others, in effect forcing others to subsidize their bottom line. In two areas, the environment and finance, these are exactly the sorts of market-improving regulation that the administration has put in its cross hairs, with the effect of increasing profits via freeloading.The classical justification for environmental regulation is that without properly designed rules, businesses do not have to pay the true costs of their economic activity (what economists call \u201cexternalities\u201d). If a company was making money by parking vehicles in all our driveways without paying, it would be obvious, and individuals would have a remedy in the form of trespass laws. But the costs that companies generate through pollution are widespread and hard to trace. Environmental regulations, by making companies absorb the costs they would otherwise impose on the rest of us, reduce market-distorting subsidies to polluters.Finance is another area where supposed deregulation can be a scheme for allowing a favored few to profit by pushing costs onto others. The challenge in financial regulation is to protect the public from market meltdowns while not also allowing businesses to take excessive risks with the knowledge that the government will pick up the tab if they fail. The Dodd-Frank legislation passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis has numerous flaws and shortcomings, but it did impose more stringent rules on the largest banks. The administration and its allies in Congress have proposed dramatically reducing the number of banks covered by these rules, without (as a large number of economists have recommended) creating other, more effective ways of reducing excessive risk-taking. The consequence of this species of deregulation is to move back toward the world of \u201cHeads I win, tails you lose\u201d that brought us the financial crisis in the first place.Even in the realm of market-improving regulation, there are still many rules that are misconceived or out of date and whose main effect is to protect today\u2019s economic winners from competitive challenge. In these areas, regulatory reform could do a lot of good. For instance, rather than just scrapping the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, as the Trump administration wants to do, we could replace it with a much less distortive and more effective alternative, like a broad-based carbon tax. Instead of just cutting Dodd-Frank rules on the largest banks, we could require that they increase their reliance on equity rather than debt, so that the costs of failure fall on investors rather than taxpayers.But there is a critical difference between areas where regulation\u2019s main effect is to protect incumbents and those where government is legitimately, if imperfectly, solving real problems of market failure. If Republicans are really serious about encouraging growth through pro-market policies, they should focus their red-tape-cutting zeal on the former, market-distorting kind of regulation \u2014 not on the rules needed to make markets function properly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Uncle Drew\u2019: Branding Vehicle or Feature Film? Yes", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first glance, the movie looks like another inoffensive summer road-trip comedy. In the trailer, there are stars like Nick Kroll and Tiffany Haddish ping-ponging punch lines with Lil Rel Howery. There\u2019s a sense of escapism along with a healthy dose of slapstick.\u201cUncle Drew\u201d may be all of that. It is also the continuation of a corporate marketing campaign for a soda company.An unusual integration of branded content and film, the movie is built around the N.B.A. star Kyrie Irving and is based entirely on a series of Pepsi commercials that went viral beginning in 2012. A heavily made-up Mr. Irving plays Uncle Drew, a septuagenarian driven to show up younger basketball players on the playground. He sets out to reunite with his teammates from decades ago for one more run at the Rucker Park tournament in Harlem.Moviegoers might not realize or care that they are watching what is essentially a Pepsi commercial when they turn out for the June 29 release. Academics, meanwhile, believe \u201cUncle Drew\u201d is the first feature film of its kind, taking product placement one step further in a new avenue for branding and signaling the film industry\u2019s willingness to \u2014 ahem \u2014 play ball.In short, Pepsi needs to tap new audiences for its product, and \u201cUncle Drew\u201d is, as Rohit Deshpande, a marketing professor at Harvard Business School, put it, \u201canother salvo in the cola wars.\u201dThe \u201cUncle Drew\u201d story begins in 2011, when Mr. Irving, then a 19-year-old newcomer to the N.B.A., agreed to appear in a Super Bowl promotion for Pepsi. The collaboration went well and Pepsi signed him to a deal. Afterward, Pepsi\u2019s agency partner, Davie Brown Entertainment, and Mr. Irving conceived the idea of a geriatric character who would show young players what real basketball looked like. Pepsi executives were intrigued. They wanted to shift away from traditional advertising and toward storytelling.With Mr. Irving\u2019s character, Pepsi hopes to extend its brand while entertaining viewers at the same time.\u201cEveryone has so many marketing methods coming at them so often that it\u2019s tough to break through,\u201d said Lou Arbetter, the general manager of Pepsi Productions. He helped develop the original shorts. \u201cYou want to create things that people actually want to see.\u201dThis is in line with recent research showing that consumers have grown increasingly wary of traditional advertising.\u201cIt\u2019s not that people don\u2019t like ads; it\u2019s that people don\u2019t like being sold to,\u201d said Beth Egan, an associate advertising professor at Syracuse University. \u201cMillennials especially are really keen to have a relationship with brands, but that has to be a true, authentic and two-way relationship.\u201dIn preliminary findings from a recent study led by Ms. Egan, when subjects were exposed to branded content, prominent mention of the brand increased viewers\u2019 suspicion of the messaging.So how do you mostly remove the brand but keep the association?Pepsi filmed several videos, written and directed by Mr. Irving, featuring cameos from other N.B.A. names, including Mr. Irving\u2019s then-teammate, Kevin Love, and the retired Hall of Fame center Bill Russell. The Pepsi logo wasn\u2019t conspicuous other than a \u201cPepsi Max presents\u201d at the beginning and some shots of spectators drinking Pepsi.\u201cThere\u2019s a strong association now between Irving, \u2018Uncle Drew\u2019 and the Pepsi brand,\u201d Mr. Deshpande said.\u201cThis was just another chapter in how to bring the brand\u2019s story to life,\u201d Mr. Arbetter said. \u201cNobody has done it before, but I would venture to take a guess that this won\u2019t be the last time.\u201dPrincipals involved with the movie insist that while the film may have originated with a company best known for its soda, the integrity of \u201cUncle Drew\u201d as a film is genuine.\u201cI would say that you \u2014 we \u2014 would be pretty foolish to view this as a two-hour-long commercial,\u201d Mr. Arbetter said. \u201cI think that would not do the brand any good.\u201dJim Miller, an executive vice president of Lionsgate, said: \u201cHonestly, aside from they\u2019re our partners, it has nothing to do with Pepsi. If there wasn\u2019t a great story in there, we wouldn\u2019t have engaged.\u201dThe feature film version is an extended, fleshed-out version of the original commercials. The cast includes the retired N.B.A. players Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Reggie Miller and Chris Webber, along with appearances by a who\u2019s who of basketball. The movie was shot in a little over a month last year, mostly in Atlanta, with about a week spent in Rucker Park.If the original shorts went out of their way not to blast the Pepsi brand, the movie takes a different tack. The opening credits say the film was made \u201cin association with Pepsi.\u201d The Rucker Park scenes show various iterations of the brand logo surrounding the court. Mr. Kroll\u2019s character, the villainous coach of a rival team, gives a shout-out to Pepsi during an interview with ESPN.Pepsi and Lionsgate declined to reveal the film\u2019s budget or the financial terms of their partnership. Mr. Arbetter would only acknowledge Pepsi\u2019s role in funding the screenplay.As for the film industry, will this unexpected partnership lead to more such deals? Paula Kupfer, a senior vice president at Lionsgate, said to ask her in July \u2014 after the \u201cUncle Drew\u201d premiere. But she did acknowledge an emerging reality: In an era when Netflix and Amazon have become prominent players in content creation, and Facebook and Apple are taking steps to get involved, \u201ca good idea can come from anywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disability and Civil Rights Groups Sue DeVos Over Investigation Rollbacks", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBALTIMORE \u2014 Three national civil rights organizations sued the Education Department on Thursday over new procedures that allow its Office for Civil Rights to dismiss complaints that it determines to be burdensome or a drain on the department\u2019s resources.The National Federation of the Blind, the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said that the department was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in making substantive revisions to its case-processing manual, which guides its handling of civil rights complaints, without giving the public notice, an explanation or a chance to comment.The organizations, which all have headquarters in Baltimore, also charged that the changes were unlawful and undermined the agency\u2019s statutory obligation to investigate any complaint when there was reason to believe a civil rights violation had occurred.The suit, filed in United States District Court in Maryland, accused Education Secretary Betsy DeVos of violating the federal Administrative Procedure Act, and the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Candice Jackson, of breaking the law by enacting the new manual. The groups asked a judge to stop the department from enforcing the new provisions.\u201cThis is one way, sometimes the only way, for vulnerable people who can\u2019t afford to litigate, to get their cases heard, and that\u2019s being taken away,\u201d said Eve Hill of Baltimore-based Brown Goldstein & Levy, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs.Education Department officials said the revisions targeted \u201cfrequent fliers,\u201d a handful of individuals who had generated thousands of complaints that were straining the department\u2019s resources. Officials said the changes were partly a result of feedback from career investigators who were not able to respond to other complaints because they had amassed such a backlog. They said that in some cases, issues prompting mass filings warranted \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d rather than exhaustive investigations.The changes, according to Liz Hill, a department spokeswoman, reflected the office\u2019s \u201ccommitment to robustly investigating and correcting civil rights issues\u201d and \u201cimproving O.C.R.\u2019s management of its docket, investigations and case resolutions.\u201dMs. Hill declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing pending litigation.The department said the revisions would not apply to broad complaints filed by groups, but the lawsuit said the provisions, as written, gave no such assurances. The manual does not define what constitutes a \u201cpattern,\u201d and the organizations argue that the provisions, as written, are not limited to those complaints that would place an \u201cunreasonable burden\u201d on the civil rights office. Unlike the previous manual, the current one leaves no room for discretion, stating that such cases will be dismissed.The changes have already resulted in the dismissal of more than 500 cases filed by a Michigan-based disability rights advocate, Marcie Lipsitt, who had opened more than 2,400 web-accessibility complaints against various educational institutions in the last two years.Her complaints resulted in more than 1,000 resolution agreements with institutions such as colleges and universities, which vowed to make their websites accessible to people who are deaf or blind or who struggle with fine motor skills. The department has started revising some of those agreements in light of the new case-processing manual, Ms. Lipsitt said.Last week, House and Senate Democrats wrote to Ms. DeVos denouncing the manual\u2019s changes. They noted that \u201cfrequent fliers\u201d are usually advocacy groups or individual advocates who have either expertise or resources that allow them to identify systematic violations.\u201cSelectively choosing which students will be protected and which complaints will be investigated is a violation of the law and will result in serious civil rights violations going unchallenged,\u201d said the letter, organized by Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania.For the last decade, the National Federation of the Blind has helped its members navigate technology in schools and on college campuses, said Mark Riccobono, the organization\u2019s president. But progress has been slow, particularly in higher education, where the organization has seen members drop out of school because they could not gain access to the registration system or classes that were available only online.\u201cThis is going to have an effect on the class of blind people who really need the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights to continue to enforce the avenues of access that really aren\u2019t being met,\u201d he said.In 2009, the organization filed several complaints with the civil rights office and the Justice Department against colleges and universities that were deploying inaccessible Amazon Kindle devices in classes. The complaints resulted in resolution agreements with several colleges and universities.The Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates represents lawyers, advocates and parents who file complaints frequently and repeatedly on a range of issues related to special education services. Denise Marshall, the organization\u2019s executive director, said that the department\u2019s effort to curb mass filings was like \u201cusing a sledgehammer to open a nut.\u201d\u201cWhether a person is aware of one violation, or ends up needing to file hundreds of complaints, should not matter,\u201d Ms. Marshall said. \u201cThe question is are the complaints valid.\u201dBrad Berry, general counsel for the N.A.A.C.P., said he was concerned that the new case-processing manual was part of a larger goal of the Trump administration to curb civil rights enforcement. The new manual could close the organization\u2019s last avenue to pursue relief when policies disproportionately affect students of color because that kind of discrimination can be combated only by the federal government.The N.A.A.C.P. is one of several groups that have filed complaints on behalf of students and against schools over disciplinary and special education policies that may unduly affect black children.Mr. Berry said the lawsuit represented one of the most important moments in the organization\u2019s history since Brown v. Board of Education.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen what it looks like when civil rights are under attack,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we see it, we fight it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An American Alternative to Europe\u2019s Privacy Law", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in telecommunications.Imagine that you\u2019ve been struggling with a serious and fairly embarrassing personal problem. Putting aside a longstanding reluctance to address it, you finally consult a therapist. The therapist is friendly and welcoming and promises to protect your privacy. Gaining a sense of trust, you bare your soul, describing the issue you are struggling with in all of its painful detail.Only later do you realize, to your horror, that your confessions were being recorded and retained by the therapist. It turns out that your therapist, to supplement his income, has gotten into the advertising business: He takes data gleaned from his patients and offers it to advertisers (or any other interested party) for a fee.Everyone would be outraged by this; it is professionally unethical and a serious breach of trust. Yet what I\u2019ve described is not so different from our relationship with businesses like Google, Facebook, Quora and Amazon. They hold themselves out as trustworthy, enticing us to share our information with them \u2014 from the banal details of our lives to our most intimate secrets \u2014 without making it very clear that everything is being recorded, kept and used for advertising.The Europeans find this kind of thing distasteful, which is why last Friday they instituted a strict online privacy law \u2014 the General Data Protection Regulation. The law\u2019s approach is, for want of a better word, European: broad, rule-driven and administered by regulators. Under the G.D.P.R., any company that gathers or processes personal data is defined as a \u201cdata controller\u201d and is subject to a raft of new rights and duties that are enforced by Europe\u2019s member states.For all these reasons, the United States may need to try something different and more American: namely, to rely on judges and state law to establish that the legal concept of \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d can apply to technology companies.To understand what fiduciary duties are, return to the example of the unfaithful therapist. Given that he used a position of trust and expertise to gain sensitive information from you, medical ethics and the law hold that he has a special obligation to be loyal and careful with your data. He is a fiduciary. (The word derives from the Latin for \u201ctrust.\u201d) The idea of a fiduciary duty is intuitive and familiar to American law: Your lawyer, your doctor, your therapist and your accountant are all fiduciaries.So why not your search engine, your digital assistant and your social media platform? These entities present themselves as trustworthy, have a special expertise and usually require you to reveal information about yourself to be useful. As Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, himself put it: \u201cWe have a responsibility to protect your data.\u201d These companies should be considered, to borrow a term coined by the law professor Jack Balkin, \u201cinformation fiduciaries\u201d \u2014 or perhaps \u201cdata fiduciaries.\u201dHow would this work in practice? Once these fiduciary duties were established by state legislation or a court ruling, questions about the breach of such duties would be addressed case by case, by courts and judges, in the American common-law manner. Instead of asking what responsibilities all \u201cdata controllers\u201d have, as the Europeans must now do, courts in the United States could ask more specific questions.For example: Did Equifax, the credit reporting agency, fail to adequately protect user data? (Obviously.) Should a firm like Quora, the question-and-answer website, require that users \u201copt in\u201d before allowing other people to find out what you are asking about? (Almost certainly.) Should Alexa, Amazon\u2019s digital assistant, require users to \u201copt in\u201d before it listens to their conversations? (It depends on how it would be carried out.)A defining fact of our existence today is that we share more of ourselves with Silicon Valley than with our accountants, lawyers and doctors. It is about time the law caught up with that.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Entire Economy Is MoviePass Now. Enjoy It While You Can.", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIt\u2019s called the 75 Cent Dollar Store. We\u2019re going to sell dollar bills for 75 cents \u2014 no service charges, no hidden fees, just crisp $1 bills for the price of three quarters. It\u2019ll be huge.You\u2019re probably thinking: Wait, won\u2019t your store go out of business? Nope. I\u2019ve got that part figured out, too. The plan is to get tons of people addicted to buying 75-cent dollars so that, in a year or two, we can jack up the price to $1.50 or $2 without losing any customers. Or maybe we\u2019ll get so big that the Treasury Department will start selling us dollar bills at a discount. We could also collect data about our customers and sell it to the highest bidder. Honestly, we\u2019ve got plenty of options.If you\u2019re still skeptical, I don\u2019t blame you. It used to be that in order to survive, businesses had to sell goods or services above cost. But that model is so 20th century. The new way to make it in business is to spend big, grow fast and use Kilimanjaro-size piles of investor cash to subsidize your losses, with a plan to become profitable somewhere down the road.\u201cThe fact that Google and Facebook were able to generate such enormous profits and growth does give hope to some companies,\u201d Mr. Ritter said. If start-ups can figure out to convert a large user base into paying customers, he added, \u201cit can be enormously profitable.\u201dBut investors aren\u2019t convinced. Shares of MoviePass\u2019s parent company, Helios and Matheson Analytics, have fallen more than 90 percent since October, and the company recently reported that it has been burning through its cash reserves, spending an average of $21.7 million per month with just $15.5 million left in the bank at the end of April. On Tuesday, Helios reported that MoviePass lost $98.3 million in the first quarter, despite adding more than a million net subscribers.Mitch Lowe, the chief executive of MoviePass, told me in a phone interview this week that the company\u2019s financial troubles have been exaggerated. The company has access to a $300 million equity line of credit that will keep it solvent, he said, and blamed the company\u2019s competitors, such as large theater chains, for sowing the seeds of doubt.\u201cThey smell blood in the water, so they\u2019re spreading rumors and hypotheses,\u201d he said.Ultimately, companies like MoviePass illustrate the perilous tightrope many growing businesses must walk. Spend too little on acquiring new customers and drawing business away from your competitors, and you won\u2019t make it off the ground. Give too many freebies away, and you risk running out of cash before you\u2019re big enough to cash in.\u201cPricing can be strategic,\u201d said Kara Nortman, a partner at Upfront Ventures, which invests in technology companies. \u201cIf you can attract a lot of consumers to your product or service, it gives you a lot more power with incumbents who are limiting your growth.\u201dThe king of money-losers, of course, is Amazon, which went years without turning a profit. Instead, it plowed billions of dollars back into its business, building out its e-commerce infrastructure and jump-starting side efforts like Amazon Web Services and Amazon Prime Video. Those years of investments paid off, and Amazon is now the second most valuable company in the world, with $1.6 billion in profit last quarter alone.An economy full of unprofitable companies has risks, of course. Along with the danger of investor wipeouts \u2014 which are unavoidable in early stage investing \u2014 customers of these companies have come to expect a kind of whiplash that can involve sudden price hikes, disappearing benefits, and useless subscriptions and meaningless warranties. It\u2019s also difficult for small businesses without access to huge amounts of capital to compete with the Googles and Amazons of the world, which further distorts economic growth in favor of corporations that can afford to spend billions of dollars undercutting the competition.For consumers who are willing to do their research, though, this can be a golden age of deals. We can get our \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d tickets and pecan-crusted salmon meal kits, reaping the benefits of artificially cheap goods and services while investors soak up the losses. The current crop of money-losing companies may not survive forever, but as long as someone is willing to keep funding these types of gambles, there\u2019s no reason to stop enjoying the fruits of their optimism.So, back to the 75 Cent Dollar Store.

{"Headline": "The Ancient Myth of \u2018Good Fences\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneDo they?It is clear that Frost\u2019s narrator views this bit of folk wisdom with skepticism, but by refraining from providing a firm answer to our question, the poem manages to increase our curiosity: Besides the most obvious, delineating private property, what do \u201cfences\u201d truly represent?The danger that such a separation between the self and the other can cause is evident throughout history. In Ancient Greece, where a profound appreciation of human reason produced a brilliant civilization, pernicious biases were also established. Women were assumed to be guided by passions rather than rationality, and so they were considered inferior to men and excluded from the cultural and political life of the city-state. As the word \u201cvirtue\u201d \u2014 from the Latin \u201cvir,\u201d meaning \u201cman\u201d \u2014 so clearly expresses, the ethos that Greek as well as Roman culture fostered derived from a military and patriarchal mentality. The \u201cfence\u201d of bigotry and prejudice that prevent the flourishing in public life of half the population certainly hobbled the development of Greek and Roman society.The Greeks held similarly disparaging views toward foreigners, called \u201cbarbarians\u201d because they seemed to say \u201cbar-bar-bar\u201d when they spoke. The Greek word \u201clogos,\u201d which simultaneously indicated \u201clanguage\u201d and \u201crationality,\u201d gave further validation to that premise: Those who did not share the Greek idiom were viewed as inferior Others who lacked the intellectual talents that had made possible the free and self-ruled society that the Greek polis represented. (This was in fact a unique achievement; in all other civilizations at that time absolute monarchs reigned uncontested over legions of subjects.)The sharp division between Greek and non-Greek was vividly represented in the sculptures that were placed on the Parthenon in Athens to celebrate the victory that, against all odds, the small Greek city-states had obtained against the immense Persian Empire. To suggest that the Eastern enemy possessed none of the extraordinary qualities belonging to the Greeks, the Athenian artists used mythological comparisons that described the Persians as monstrous creatures \u2014 giants, centaurs and Amazons, female warriors that the Greeks evoked to ridicule the weak and decadent femininity of all Eastern peoples.This was also expressed in pottery, especially, by the colorful and whimsical attire the Persians donned for war, which was contrasted with the noble nudity of the brave citizen-soldiers who fought in defense of the Greek polis.When the Macedonian king Alexander the Great absorbed the Balkan Peninsula as the start of an empire that soon stretched as far as India, the experiment of the polis came to an end. Despite the fear of their eastern neighbors that the early Greeks had so diligently cultivated, the rapprochement between East and West that the unity of empire made possible proved enormously fruitful for both sides: While the rich culture of Greece reached further into Asia, the heritage of the East, which, besides art and science also included religions such as Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism, replenished with all sorts of new perspectives the cultural reservoir of the West.A new chapter began when Rome established itself as the leader of yet another enormous empire. A major gain for the Romans was the encounter with the Hellenistic heritage that the poet Horace described with these famous words: \u201cWhen Greece was taken she enslaved her rough conquerors.\u201d Despite the enormous cultural debt they owed to the Greeks, the Romans, driven by feelings of envy and competition, promoted a mythical narrative that, echoing old prejudices, portrayed the Greeks as a decadent and effeminate people while the Romans were models of masculine virtue and uprightness.Thanks to such greatness, the myth suggested, the gods had elected the Romans (rather than the Greeks) to spread civilization over the entire world. Those who failed to swear allegiance to Rome\u2019s sacred mission were labeled dangerous Others deserving annihilation.To foster the righteous spirit of the Crusaders, Christian art depicted Muslims with monstrous traits suggesting they were closer to animals than human beings. But the humiliating defeat that the \u201cinfidels\u201d dealt to the Crusaders turned out to be an unexpected gift: the Christian world, having come into contact with the Muslim intelligentsia, rediscovered its own cultural roots \u2014 the classical heritage that eventually led to the blooming of the Renaissance.What that seems to prove is that, just as Frost\u2019s narrator suggests when he recalls how the winter sabotages walls, the regeneration that culture always needs can occur only when the fences of prejudice are breached to allow encounters between different people, traditions and ideas.Advertisement"}

And So On.", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Trade clashes with Europe are brewing. Border tensions with Mexico are boiling. Negotiations with North Korea and Iran are murky as ever. What can Americans expect in these uncertain times?We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d when a reporter asked Mr. Trump on Tuesday whether he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to arrange peace talks between North and South Korea.\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens, I often say,\u201d the president said a day earlier about relations with North Korea, apparently aware of his tendency to take an indefinite view on timely negotiations.\u201cSo the end result is, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week, again broaching the summit meeting with North Korea.At least two dozen times in the past month, the president appears to have shifted into full-on verbal tic mode, deploying some variation of \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d as a cast of world leaders from France, the Baltic States, Japan and Nigeria rotated in and out of the White House or his Florida estate. Mr. Trump\u2019s one-person guessing game came into play as he addressed topics including Mexico, Nafta, Russia, Amazon, North Korea, Mike Pompeo, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, Iran and the special counsel\u2019s investigation into his presidential campaign.Republican and Democratic speechwriters and others who study the president\u2019s speech patterns say \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d may be a way to signal a veiled threat to unpredictable adversaries, like the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, amid delicate negotiations. But many who watch closely say Mr. Trump is using the phrase to avoid accountability.\u201cThe occasions in which he\u2019s made specific promises, like \u2018we\u2019ll build a wall and Mexico would pay for it,\u2019 he has had trouble delivering,\u201d Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cInstead of forecasting and being accountable for the forecast, he\u2019s opening the possibility that there are a range of possibilities not anticipated for which he does not want to be held accountable.\u201d\u201cThe more people heard it, the less effective it became,\u201d one of Mr. Obama\u2019s speechwriters, David Litt, said in an interview, \u201cwhich is one reason there were fewer \u2018Let me be clears\u2019 in the second term.\u201dMr. Trump is different from other presidents because he seems to enjoy speaking extemporaneously on matters of consequence, said Ms. Jamieson, who has written extensively about Mr. Trump\u2019s talent for using blunt language to subvert political norms. That approach has lent itself to a collection of presidential favorites: In Trumpese, she said, \u201cmany people are saying\u201d means \u201cI wish many people were saying this because I want you to believe they are.\u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, likely means \u201cI just found out,\u201d and \u201cbelieve me,\u201d on some level, may signal \u201cI have real doubts.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s modern predecessors, she said, tended to adhere to a tightly scripted approach. For example, she had a hard time imagining President John F. Kennedy saying \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d while negotiating his way through the Cuban missile crisis.\u201cThe presidents wanted to ensure that they knew what outcomes could be achieved and that their rhetoric could help them achieve the outcome,\u201d she said. With Mr. Trump, \u201cthe signaling function is being eroded,\u201d meaning that even words uttered by a commander-in-chief have a way of losing their power if they\u2019re said often enough.Speechwriters have often sought to hammer out such crutches, aware that an audience\u2019s eyes and ears begin to glaze over if subjected to a rhetorical overdose. (Easier said than done, of course, when a president delights in veering off script.)\u201cIf you keep forcing the same phrases into people\u2019s ears all the time, people start to wonder what you\u2019re actually meaning,\u201d Matt Latimer, a literary agent and former speechwriter for Mr. Bush, said in an interview. He said the danger in Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency could be, \u201cafter a while it\u2019s like, \u2018He really doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, does he?\u2019\u201dMr. Latimer said that while Mr. Trump enjoys a strong economy and policy victories, like tax cuts, aimed at his base, it\u2019s probably easier for him to speak extemporaneously. For instance, of the impending deadline on negotiations with Iran, Mr. Trump twisted the phrase to suit his penchant for showmanship: \u201cNobody knows what I\u2019m going to do on the 12th, although, Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea \u2014 but we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said during a meeting last week with President Emmanuel Macron of France.But Mr. Latimer, who scripted a president through the Iraq war and a looming recession, said Mr. Trump\u2019s laissez-faire attitude probably would not last as consequential negotiations advance: \u201cFree styling only works when things are going pretty well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Certain products she\u2019d been told to buy were utterly useless; a specific breastfeeding pillow she\u2019d found to be a godsend.This is how the first six months of my own pregnancy have gone so far: I\u2019ve been the recipient of 10-paragraph emails, Google spreadsheets, filled-up Amazon carts, group texts \u2014 all themed around babies and the mental and physical tools required to prepare for them. As more friends have kids, this stream of information gets steadily replaced by reports from the other side: women who have made it through the gantlet and reported back.This information exchange has left me both enormously grateful and utterly panicked. I feel as though I\u2019m back in school, cramming for a final \u2014 only to learn that the one chapter I haven\u2019t studied is the focus of the test. In all of this, I\u2019ve learned only one thing to be universally true: For all the Google docs you share, baby books you buy and delivery plans you make, childbirth is an experience for which you will never be truly prepared.When O\u2019Connell, a writer living in Brooklyn, learns she is pregnant, she instinctively wants a child but, given the circumstances of her life and work, feels unready. After a long discussion with her boyfriend, Dustin, that begins as they\u2019re picking up their weekly farm share and continues into the night, the couple finally, definitively decides to keep the baby.The author quickly learns the difference between pregnancy and the way it is performed for the world. \u201cThere should be Polaroids our son finds in a shoe box 30 years from now and feels sentimental about,\u201d she writes. \u201cI want this baby to think his mom was radiant, effortlessly so, hugging her massive, miraculous body in floral prints. I want him to post them to the 2045 version of Instagram. I want his friends to leave comments about my fashion sense.\u201dMuch of her pregnancy is spent planning for a natural birth until the particularly harrowing scene in which she receives an epidural and then an emergency cesarean section. Once her baby is born, when friends come to visit, she envisions herself as \u201cthe matriarch welcoming everyone in with French-press coffee and banana bread that I had somehow baked during early labor,\u201d even though in reality she is bleary-eyed and rattled from the surgery. Eventually, after conquering her constant fear of SIDS, she gets the hang of it \u2014 and finds in motherhood an unexpected peace.Isabel Wilkinson is the digital director at T Magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Much Is That Sneaker in the Window?", "Date": "2018-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo walk into the 3,000-square-foot Stadium Goods store in SoHo is to be confronted by rows and rows of pristine, shrink-wrapped athletic footwear. Look closely and you might be a little stunned by the price tags.This is clearly not Foot Locker.Sneaker fanatics have been around for decades, with swaps and buys largely happening on eBay or as personal transactions. But it\u2019s only in the last few years that the reseller market has accelerated and gone sharply upscale. John McPheters, who co-founded Stadium Goods with Jed Stiller, says the shift has been driven by \u201cmen who are now learning from childhood how to treat fashion as a sport \u2014 the way that women have always treated fashion.\u201dThe point is not utility, but rather about expressing identity. \u201cSneakers are the single most flexible and acceptable way to communicate personality for these new shopping-obsessed men,\u201d Mr. McPheters said.\u201cWith its advanced technology platform that is highly regarded in the luxury industry, we believe Farfetch is a terrific partner to help us expand our global reach,\u201d Mr. McPheters said in a statement when that deal was announced.Before starting Stadium Goods, Mr. McPheters did marketing and business development for Flight Club, a sneaker consignment shop, and later ran social media accounts for Nike while employed at the creative marketing agency Team Epiphany. Mr. Stiller had been an investor in various New York nightclubs. The two had previously done another start-up, Swarm Mobile, a retailing app, that was sold to Groupon in 2014.The demand for collectible sneakers and streetwear is particularly fervent in China, Mr. McPheters said, adding that he got his first taste of that market\u2019s potential when a Chinese customer dropped $10,000 in a single spree at the Stadium Goods store. \u201cOften, the shoes they want were never available in their country,\u201d he said.He and Mr. Stiller seized an opportunity to enter the market early, launching a brand page on Alibaba\u2019s TMall platform in 2016 just a year into its business.The partners believe the future of sneaker retail will be a hybrid model combining traditional channels and aftermarket selling. \u201cWe\u2019re a microcosm of what\u2019s hot,\u201d Mr. Stiller said, noting that in the sneaker world what\u2019s trending is not necessarily the newest item. \u201cWhere a lot of retailers are dependent on what brands are releasing at the moment, we\u2019re not. Ninety-five percent of our stock are styles that are no longer on the market.\u201dStadium Goods is hardly the only player in this fast-growing field, of course.With hot sneaker styles costing $300 and up, \u201cthe last thing you want to be spending your money on is fakes,\u201d said Eddy Lu, a co-founder and chief executive officer. \u201cFor us, it was let\u2019s build something that solves the growing problem of counterfeits and fakes.\u201dIt\u2019s built for the casual sneaker enthusiast looking for a good strike price on coveted Yeezys \u2014 like getting the Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Cream White when it is selling for $380 (original price $220) and not, say, $560 \u2014 but also for those who think of sneakers as a portfolio investment. \u201cWe\u2019re an evolution of eBay,\u201d Mr. Luber said. He added that StockX is now bringing in about $2 million a day in gross merchandise volume.\u201cAfter that, we allowed seven people who bought the shoes to resell without even touching the product,\u201d Mr. Luber said. \u201cThat\u2019s like true day trading.\u201dThese companies are shaking up how the resale market but they suffer from constraints, said Matt Powell, NPD Group\u2019s sports industry analyst.One issue is just how big this market is. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to tell what the true size is because there are always going to be transactions between two private individuals,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a $1 billion market like many are saying it is.\u201d He points to the math: \u201cWhen I look at the sneakers that are resold and then add a factor of three because of the higher resale value, I\u2019m getting closer to $300-$500 million.\u201dWith total sneaker sales in the United States around $38 billion last year, the resale market is still relatively minor, he said.The other obstacle to major growth is inventory; the major resellers specialize in limited-release styles. \u201cIf the manufacturer starts to get greedier,\u201d by increasing the product, \u201ca flood of inventory would crash the market,\u201d Mr. Powell said. Indeed, a glut of Jordans in early 2016 drove that resell market down.The resellers seem largely aware that sneakers can only take them so far. \u201cYes, our main business is sneakers right now but we\u2019re a stock market for things,\u201d Mr. Luber, said. StockX already sells watches, and streetwear from Supreme and Kith. The company has plans to roll out more product from streetwear designers like Fear of God. (Mr. Powell noted that streetwear has the same constraint: \u201cWhat really drives the streetwear market is most of those items are, again, limited in quantity.\u201d)But where the slick new resellers may have a leg up is their combination of product, content and convenience, said Joe La Puma, senior vice president of content strategy at Complex who hosts \u201cSneaker Shopping,\u201d a sneaker program on YouTube.\u201cThe industry is becoming more professionalized but also I\u2019m seeing that the customer is getting choosier about what sneaker he or she wants,\u201d Mr. La Puma said. \u201cSo instead of buying sneakers, say, every week, they\u2019re saving up to buy one shoe they really want.\u201dThat kind of cachet matters in this world and the top resellers all have it, Mr. La Puma emphasized. Sneakerhead consumers pay attention to what celebrities are wearing, he said.\u201cSpecifically, Kanye West, Travis Scott, ASAP Rocky, Virgil Abloh and Jared Leto are influential in their own circles,\u201d he said. \u201cNot every shoe starts out super special. There\u2019s the chance that if one of these celebrities wears it, it may then become super hot.\u201dAn earlier version of this article omitted the given name of the co-founder and chief executive of GOAT. He is Eddy Lu.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Behind Comcast\u2019s Fox Announcement: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Comcast throws down the gauntlet.\u2022 What Congress could achieve with a ZTE deal revolt\u2022 How Mark Zuckerberg gamed his E.U. hearing\u2022 Why would Barclays acquire Standard Chartered?While Rupert Murdoch and his family are nearly synonymous with the media empire that they have created, they won\u2019t have the final say on 21st Century Fox\u2019s plan to sell most of its assets to Walt Disney.The Murdochs have so far preferred Disney\u2019s all-stock bid in part because it would help them avoid an enormous tax bill. But if Comcast offers a significantly higher bid than the $52.4 billion that Disney has put forward, as it has hinted that it would do, other shareholders could scuttle Murdochs\u2019 deal with Disney.Here\u2019s how\u2022 how deeply the family was involved in negotiating the Disney deal, and\u2022 how disproportionately the Murdochs may benefit from a lower-priced but all-stock Disney bidThe stockholders have also agreed not to facilitate any effort or attempt by another entity to make an acquisition proposal for 21CF, including by refraining from discussing or providing information to any person in connection with such a proposal.A spokesman for Fox declined to comment on Comcast\u2019s announcement on Wednesday. But this is what Lachlan Murdoch, one of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sons and the company\u2019s executive co-chairman, said on an earnings call earlier this month:\u201cWe\u2019re not going to kind of engage in a lot of speculation around this, but I can say that we are committed to our agreement with Disney and are working through the conditions to bring it to a closing. In addition, our directors, though, of course are aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.\u201dThe cable giant said on Wednesday what we and others have reported: that it is in the \u201cadvanced stages of preparing\u201d a counter bid for the 21st Century Fox assets that Walt Disney has agreed to buy for $52.4 billion.Any offer for Fox would be all-cash and at a premium to the value of the current all-share offer from Disney. The structure and terms of any offer by Comcast, including with respect to both the spinoff of \u201cNew Fox\u201d and the regulatory risk provisions and the related termination fee, would be at least as favorable to Fox shareholders as the Disney offer.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe lawsuit comes in the wake of a tense meeting during which its board voted to dilute Ms. Redstone\u2019s influence over the company. Immediately after the vote, National Amusements called it invalid. In the amended complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, CBS asserted the independence of its board and asked the court to rule on which side\u2019s interpretation of the recent vote is lawful.ContextOn the day before the CBS board was scheduled to meet last week, National Amusements made a sudden and significant change to the CBS bylaws: From now on, the company said, any vote would require a supermajority \u2014 90 percent of the 14 CBS board members \u2014 for approval.The board voted 11 to 3 to significantly diminish Ms. Redstone\u2019s voting power. But that result fell shy of 90 percent.The WSJ reported that Mr. Ackman supports Mr. Ellison.D.E. Shaw & Co. already has about a 1 percent stake in Lowe\u2019s, and earlier this year, it got three directors on the retailer\u2019s board.Under the terms of the deal\u2022 Paddy Power Betfair will contribute $158 million in cash to the combined company.\u2022 Paddy Power Betfair\u2019s shareholders will own 61 percent of the combined company, while FanDuel\u2019s investors will control 39 percent.\u2022 Paddy Power Betfair will be able to increase its ownership to 80 percent after three years and 100 percent after five years.About FanDuelThe company said it had 1.3 million active users last year and generated $124 million in revenue.ContextIn the deal announcement, Peter Jackson, chief executive of Paddy Power Betfair, said: \u201cTogether with our substantial financial firepower, we believe we are now well placed to target the prospective U.S. sports betting opportunity.\u201dBackgroundKroger will pay $200 million initially and that could rise to $700 million if Home Chef hits certain targets, the WSJ reports.The deal comes a week after Kroger took a $250 million in British online grocery operator Ocado Group.The WSJ said that the new plan could take many months to execute, with redundancies spilling into 2019.Revenue jumps 70 percent at UberOne big investor question as Uber prepares for an initial public offering next year: Can the ride-hailing company deliver the growth to justify its rich valuation?\u2022 Uber earned $2.46 billion in the quarter, up from a loss of $847 million last year. The sales of its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia helped lift Uber\u2019s bottom line. Exclude those transactions and Uber would have reported a loss of roughly $550 million.\u2022 Revenue jumped 70 percent from the prior year to $2.59 billion.\u2022 Gross bookings climbed 55 percent.The ride-hailer has long resisted the financial burden of providing its drivers and couriers with health care benefits. But under the leadership of Dara Khosrowshahi, that appears to be slowly changing.The figures aren\u2019t huge. Uber will pay just \u00a31,000 for maternity and paternity leave. Sick pay only stretches to a maximum of \u00a3450 for couriers, or \u00a31,125 for drivers.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeIt\u2019s not just investors in Bitcoin that might be at risk from the mania surrounding cryptocurrencies. People who have sunk money into the companies that provide the hardware underpinning the entire movement could be exposed to a crash, too.Demand for the processors to do the mining has bolstered the toplines of chip-makers AMD and Nvidia and lifted their shares.If Tandberg-Johansen is right about the overvaluation of crypto-related hardware firms, and the bottom does fall out of cryptocurrencies, investors could have taken on more risk than they bargained for.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeBoth agreed such legislation would be worth doing, even though the strategy would leave behind other GOP priorities. They didn\u2019t, for instance, try to reorganize the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a move backed by Republicans but opposed by Democrats.Facebook will provide many answers to officials\u2019 questions in writing, giving the company plenty of time to carefully craft its responses.\u201cWhat would you put on page one of the deal announcement?\u201d asked one City of London veteran. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there are many synergies.\u201dElsewhere in dealsOur take: Don\u2019t expect that kind of regulation anytime soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Skeleton in My Closet", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesMy husband, Mark, was a pack rat. So clearing out his belongings after he died suddenly at 57 was a challenge even for a rabid organizer like me. To complicate matters, my two kids and I were moving from a four-bedroom house in the suburbs to a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. Most of what we owned wasn\u2019t coming along.I spent every spare minute making piles: keep, sell, donate, toss. Tucked under the attic eaves were several milk crates of Mark\u2019s old Playboys, Sports Illustrateds and National Geographics, dating back to the 1960s. I sold a few at our moving sale, but the rest sit untouched in a cramped storage unit. I\u2019m guessing the unenviable job of selling them will one day fall to my kids.But one discovery eclipsed them all. Digging through a rarely used closet one night, I opened a Nike shoe box and came face-to-face with a real human skull.My first word was \u201choly\u201d followed by an expletive. Then a hazy memory floated back: My husband, a dentist, was showing me a research skull, the kind dental students use in anatomy class, with metal hinges attaching the lower jaw to each side and two clasps securing the cranium in place. It was the same one I now held. Stamped on the left was a company name \u2014 Clay Adams, Parsippany, N.J. \u2014 an importer of medical supplies.Of all the things I inherited after Mark\u2019s death, the skull topped a long list I call \u201cI Never Wanted This.\u201d It included cabinets crammed with ancient financial documents, a garage and shed bursting with all manner of cobweb-covered gadgets, and shelves of sweaters not worn since the Reagan administration.After we separated, I had imagined that eventually I\u2019d move out and he\u2019d move back in, sparing me this overwhelming job. It was even more fraught because I felt an obligation to my kids, who were just teenagers when he died, to preserve his memory. Would they want his old cameras and slides? His favorite faded blue sweatshirt? If they said no, would they wish they had said yes years from now?Now I felt uneasy. Was it even legal to have this skull in my home? Didn\u2019t it belong in a school or museum?I was angry at Mark for leaving me with it and I wanted to make the skull disappear. I considered burying it in the backyard, the final resting place of my kids\u2019 four gerbils. But I pictured the future homeowners discovering it while gardening one fine spring day. \u201cHoney, what\u2019s this?\u201d the husband would say to his wife, and in a flash a cop from \u201cCSI: Crime Scene Investigation\u201d would be grilling me about where I buried the rest of the body.Once we\u2019d moved into our apartment, I hid it in yet another closet, doing my best Scarlett O\u2019Hara: I\u2019ll think about it tomorrow. Tomorrow turned into three years and last summer I finally decided that, unlike those old magazines, I didn\u2019t want my kids to have to deal with this someday. Keeping it in a closet felt wrong and I wasn\u2019t about to display it in my curio cabinet. This skull needed a new home.I also found several reputable companies that trade in human bones. Want a male skull with 25 teeth? How about a Caucasian female with 28 teeth, one broken? Those were two of dozens of skulls \u2014 male and female, old and young \u2014 I found online, available if you\u2019re willing to part with about $2,000.\u201cTypically someone\u2019s parents passed away and they\u2019re cleaning out their belongings and they find the skeleton in the closet or the skull in the attic,\u201d he said, adding that skulls were required for many dental students. \u201cYour husband may have had to purchase it in school for $200, which was quite affordable at the time.\u201dThe skull I had looked smaller than the adult ones online. I went to a mirror and held it next to my head. They were close in size. I sent photos and measurements to Skulls Unlimited. They estimated it was from a 12-year-old, possibly female, likely from India.India? Why would a young girl there donate her body to American science? My question was well meaning but na\u00efve. Turns out that in the 1970s when my husband was in dental school, most skulls came from India, from families too poor to bury or cremate their dead, or because grave robbers dug up bones for profit. India banned the export of human bones in the mid-1980s and China later followed. The skull market soon dried up and prices skyrocketed.I was horrified that this skull might have belonged to a child who suffered such a fate. Questions swirled: Who was her family? How did she die? It was entirely possible she and I were born around the same year. I began to feel an odd mix of maternal tenderness and sisterly kinship for this skull, laced with a hefty dose of \u201cthere but for the grace of God go I.\u201dAlthough I couldn\u2019t return it to its original resting place \u2014 if it ever had one \u2014 maybe it would find peace among other bones that, for whatever reason, had landed far from home.I sold it to Skulls Unlimited and donated the proceeds to a program at Mark\u2019s dental school that provides free dental care to low-income kids. It seemed fitting: A child in India reaches across decades to give a disadvantaged child in New York a reason to smile.I liked knowing that Mark helped make it happen, not because he was a dentist, but because he was a pack rat. Something good emerged from all his clutter. It also feels pretty good to finally have closets in which, as far as I know, there are no more hidden skeletons.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Pitch for Progressivism Finds an Ally Across the River", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom at least three trips to Iowa and several trips to the nation\u2019s capital, Mr. de Blasio has crisscrossed America during his four and a half years as mayor talking about the wave of progressivism that he sees sweeping the country.Two months earlier, during a recent trip to the United States Conference of Mayors, Ras. J. Baraka, the mayor of Newark, N.J., said he asked Mr. de Blasio about New York City\u2019s right to counsel law, which provides free lawyers in housing court for tenants who make less than $50,000 per year for a family of four.That discussion led to Tuesday, as Mr. de Blasio took the 10-mile drive across the Hudson River from City Hall to Newark to help Mr. Baraka announce a tenant initiative modeled after New York City\u2019s, which was believed to be the first in the nation.\u201cWe obviously took the lead from Mayor de Blasio and the great work that he\u2019s doing in New York City,\u201d Mr. Baraka said during a news conference at Newark City Hall, as Mr. de Blasio stood behind him wearing a big smile.\u201cAt the U.S. Conference of Mayors, I got a chance to corner him and sit down and have a conversation about a few things \u2014 Amazon, second term and right to counsel,\u201d Mr. Baraka said, referring to his city\u2019s efforts to become home to Amazon\u2019s second headquarters and his bid for a second term.Mr. de Blasio was equally effusive.\u201cSo, this is going to be a game-changer for Newark,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cAnd I want to say, thanks to Mayor Baraka, a lot of people are going to be able to stay in their home, a lot of illegal evictions are going to be stopped, that\u2019s a new day for Newark.\u201d\u201cAt the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Mayor de Blasio has a huge footprint,\u201d Mr. Baraka said in an interview. \u201cPeople look to him. As one of the larger cities in the country, he\u2019s very vocal about the pushback against Donald Trump.\u201dChristina M. Greer, a political-science professor who is a McSilver Institute Fellow at New York University, said she was not surprised to see Mr. de Blasio promoting his brand outside of the city.\u201cIf he wants to maintain the idea that he is a progressive mayor, he has to consistently reiterate the ways in which he supports progressive ideas,\u201d Professor Greer said.The danger is that highlighting these proposals also highlights some of the difficulties the city has had, Professor Greer said. For example, the IDNYC program caused the administration to go to court to be allowed to destroy the information of undocumented residents. Others have questioned the effectiveness of ThriveNYC in light of recent fatal police shootings of mentally ill individuals.\u201cWe have a lot of progressive values and ideas that appear to have been a success, but you scratch the surface and there\u2019s a lot more to be done on those issues,\u201d Professor Greer said.Newark, where 78 percent of the residents are renters, still has to work through several issues, including funding.Mr. Baraka said that Mr. de Blasio isn\u2019t the only mayor he looks to for ideas, citing two other Democrats, Eric M. Garcetti in Los Angeles and Mitchell J. Landrieu in New Orleans. He\u2019s considering implementing a proposal from Stockton, Calif., whose mayor, Michael Tubbs, has suggested that homeless people clean the streets.\u201cMayors, we encourage each other, we support each other, if one\u2019s got a good idea they tell the next one,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cIf one\u2019s got a problem, we talk it through and help each other out.\u201dMr. de Blasio then concluded his remarks and ducked out of Newark City Hall, refusing to take questions.Mr. Baraka did not follow the mayor\u2019s lead, inviting the press to ask questions.\u201cThe mayor has to head on back to New York,\u201d Mr. Baraka said moments after a hug and a handshake from Mr. de Blasio.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Pentagon Contract Became an Identity Crisis for Google", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Fei-Fei Li is among the brightest stars in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, somehow managing to hold down two demanding jobs simultaneously: head of Stanford University\u2019s A.I. lab and chief scientist for A.I. at Google Cloud, one of the search giant\u2019s most promising enterprises.Yet last September, when nervous company officials discussed how to speak publicly about Google\u2019s first major A.I. contract with the Pentagon, Dr. Li strongly advised shunning those two potent letters.\u201cAvoid at ALL COSTS any mention or implication of AI,\u201d she wrote in an email to colleagues reviewed by The New York Times. \u201cWeaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI \u2014 if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google.\u201dDr. Li\u2019s concern about the implications of military contracts for Google has proved prescient. The company\u2019s relationship with the Defense Department since it won a share of the contract for the Maven program, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes, has touched off an existential crisis, according to emails and documents reviewed by The Times as well as interviews with about a dozen current and former Google employees.It has fractured Google\u2019s work force, fueled heated staff meetings and internal exchanges, and prompted some employees to resign. The dispute has caused grief for some senior Google officials, including Dr. Li, as they try to straddle the gap between scientists with deep moral objections and salespeople salivating over defense contracts.The advertising model behind Google\u2019s spectacular growth has provoked criticism that it invades web users\u2019 privacy and supports dubious websites, including those peddling false news. Now the company\u2019s path to future growth, via cloud-computing services, has divided the company over its stand on weaponry. To proceed with big defense contracts could drive away brainy experts in artificial intelligence; to reject such work would deprive it of a potentially huge business.Executives at DeepMind, an A.I. pioneer based in London that Google acquired in 2014, have said they are completely opposed to military and surveillance work, and employees at the lab have protested the contract. The acquisition agreement between the two companies said DeepMind technology would never be used for military or surveillance purposes.Those emails and other internal documents, shared by an employee who opposes Pentagon contracts, show that at least some Google executives anticipated the dissent and negative publicity. But other employees, noting that rivals like Microsoft and Amazon were enthusiastically pursuing lucrative Pentagon work, concluded that such projects were crucial to the company\u2019s growth and nothing to be ashamed of.Many tech companies have sought military business without roiling their work forces. But Google\u2019s roots and self-image are different.\u201cWe have kind of a mantra of \u2018don\u2019t be evil,\u2019 which is to do the best things that we know how for our users, for our customers and for everyone,\u201d Larry Page told Peter Jennings in 2004, when ABC News named Mr. Page and his Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, \u201cPeople of the Year.\u201dThe clash inside Google was sparked by the possibility that the Maven work might be used for lethal drone targeting. And the discussion is made more urgent by the fact that artificial intelligence, one of Google\u2019s strengths, is expected to play an increasingly central role in warfare.Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, made a much-publicized visit to Google in August \u2014 shortly after stopping in at Amazon \u2014 and called for closer cooperation with tech companies.\u201cI see many of the greatest advances out here on the West Coast in private industry,\u201d he said.A number of colleagues weighed in, but generally they deferred to Dr. Li, who was born in China, immigrated to New Jersey with her parents as a 16-year-old who spoke no English and has climbed to the top of the tech world.Dr. Li said in the email that the final decision would be made by her boss, Diane Greene, the chief executive of Google Cloud. But Dr. Li thought the company should publicize its share of the Maven contract as \u201ca big win for GCP,\u201d Google Cloud Platform.\u201cI don\u2019t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry,\u201d she wrote in the email.Asked about her September email, Dr. Li issued a statement: \u201cI believe in human-centered AI to benefit people in positive and benevolent ways. It is deeply against my principles to work on any project that I think is to weaponize AI.\u201dAs it turned out, the company did not publicize Maven. The company\u2019s work as a subcontractor came to public attention only when employees opposed to it began protesting on Google\u2019s robust internal communications platforms.The company promised employees that it would produce a set of principles to guide its choices in the ethical minefield of defense and intelligence contracting. Google told The Times on Tuesday that the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of A.I. in weaponry. But it was unclear how such a prohibition would be applied in practice.At a companywide meeting last Thursday, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, said Google wanted to come up with guidelines that \u201cstood the test of time,\u201d employees said. Employees say they expect the principles to be announced inside Google in the next few weeks.The polarized debate about Google and the military may leave out some nuances. Better analysis of drone imagery could reduce civilian casualties by improving operators\u2019 ability to find and recognize terrorists. The Defense Department will hardly abandon its advance into artificial intelligence if Google bows out. And military experts say China and other developed countries are already investing heavily in A.I. for defense.But skilled technologists who chose Google for its embrace of benign and altruistic goals are appalled that their employer could eventually be associated with more efficient ways to kill.Google\u2019s unusual culture is reflected in its company message boards and internal social media platforms, which encourage employees to speak out on everything from Google\u2019s cafeteria food to its diversity initiatives. But even within this free-expression workplace, longtime employees said, the Maven project has roiled Google beyond anything in recent memory.When news of the deal leaked out internally, Ms. Greene spoke at the weekly companywide T.G.I.F. meeting. She explained that the system was not for lethal purposes and that it was a relatively small deal worth \u201conly\u201d $9 million, according to two people familiar with the meeting.That did little to tamp down the anger, and Google, according to the invitation email, decided to hold a discussion on April 11 representing a \u201cspectrum of viewpoints\u201d involving Ms. Greene; Meredith Whittaker, a Google A.I. researcher who is a leader in the anti-Maven movement; and Vint Cerf, a Google vice president who is considered one of the fathers of the internet for his pioneering technology work at the Defense Department.Because there was so much interest, the group debated the topic three times over one day for Google employees watching on video in different regions around the world.According to employees who watched the discussion, Ms. Greene held firm that Maven was not using A.I. for offensive purposes, while Ms. Whittaker argued that it was hard to draw a line on how the technology would be used.Last Thursday, Mr. Brin, the company\u2019s co-founder, responded to a question at a companywide meeting about Google\u2019s work on Maven. According to two Google employees, Mr. Brin said he understood the controversy and had discussed the matter extensively with Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai. However, he said he thought that it was better for peace if the world\u2019s militaries were intertwined with international organizations like Google rather than working solely with nationalistic defense contractors.Google and its parent company, Alphabet, employ many of the world\u2019s top artificial intelligence researchers. Some researchers work inside an A.I. lab called Google Brain in Mountain View, Calif., and others are spread across separate groups, including the cloud computing business overseen by Ms. Greene, who is also an Alphabet board member.Many of these researchers have recently arrived from the world of academia, and some retain professorships. They include Geoff Hinton, a Briton who helps oversee the Brain lab in Toronto and has been open about his reluctance to work for the United States government. In the late 1980s, Mr. Hinton left the United States for Canada in part because he was reluctant to take funding from the Department of Defense.Jeff Dean, one of Google\u2019s longest-serving and most revered employees, who now oversees all A.I. work at the company, said at a conference for developers this month that he had signed a letter opposing the use of so-called machine learning for autonomous weapons, which would identify targets and fire without a human pulling the trigger.DeepMind, the London A.I. lab, is widely considered to be the most important collection of A.I. talent in the world. It now operates as a separate Alphabet company, though the lines between Google and DeepMind are blurred.DeepMind\u2019s founders have long warned about the dangers of A.I. systems. At least one of the lab\u2019s founders, Mustafa Suleyman, has been involved in policy discussions involving Project Maven with the Google leadership, including Mr. Pichai, according to a person familiar with the discussions.Certainly, any chance that Google could move quietly into defense work with no public attention is gone. Nor has Dr. Li\u2019s hope to keep A.I. out of the debate proved realistic.\u201cWe can steer the conversation about cloud,\u201d Aileen Black, a Google executive in Washington, cautioned Dr. Li in the September exchange, \u201cbut this is an AI specific award.\u201d She added, \u201cI think we need to get ahead of this before it gets framed for us.\u201dScott Shane reported from Washington, Cade Metz from London, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cory Booker on His Side, Newark\u2019s Mayor Charts a Pragmatic Second Term", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 Mayor Ras J. Baraka strode through the room with confidence as he took the stage in a hotel in downtown Newark, which is booming with development that four years ago some feared Mr. Baraka might forestall.\u201cThe city is finished with the past,\u201d he said on Tuesday night, after his overwhelming re-election to a second term. \u201cToday marks the day that you either go forward with all of us or you stay back with the few.\u201dThis time, Mr. Baraka promoted himself as a unifier who seeks to transform a city that has been mired in decay for decades, a leader intent on building relationships with business leaders and others with whom he has had frosty relationships, perhaps most notably his onetime political foe, Mr. Booker.\u201cEveryone knows we used to go at it like cats and dogs,\u201d Mr. Baraka said in his victory speech. \u201cBut things change based on time and conditions. And let me tell you this: With this government that we have in the White House, Senator Booker is our No. 1 ally.\u201dTheir partnership is based in part on mutual need. Mr. Baraka needed Mr. Booker\u2019s counsel as he embarked on a challenging first term; Mr. Booker wants his former critic on his side as Newark experiences a rebirth, particularly when his record while mayor of the city could become a subject of scrutiny if he runs for president in 2020.There is no doubt that Newark is a better place than it was when Mr. Baraka inherited it from Mr. Booker four years ago.Unemployment in the city has dropped to 8 percent, down from 13 percent, when Mr. Baraka took office, though that is still double the national average. Crime has also fallen, and the city has regained control of its schools from the state as the graduation rate has steadily risen.Mr. Baraka said that was always a misperception. \u201cRunning for mayor and governing is two different things, right?\u201d said Mr. Baraka, explaining that his role was to find a middle ground between development and residents\u2019 fear of gentrification.\u201cYou have developers pushing back, saying finally the city is taking off,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAnd you have residents who say, \u2018Oh the city is moving too fast.\u2019\u201d This is why he said he has initiated policies to protect Newark\u2019s affordable housing, including restructuring rent-control guidelines and expanding protections from illegal evictions.\u201cWe want to continue to build, and build in our city,\u201d Mr. Baraka said on Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of growth. We\u2019re not afraid of development. We deserve nice things in our city, too.\u201dIt is a delicate balance that, so far, has won him praise.\u201cWe\u2019re probably in the best place we\u2019ve ever been in terms of welcoming development, but development that is appropriate to the city and provides inclusion and opportunity for residents across income levels,\u201d said Richard Cammarieri, the longtime chairman of the Newark Community Development Network, a nonprofit that promotes neighborhood development.His shift from a campaign populist to a pragmatist mayor has been reflected in his relationship with Mr. Booker. In 2014, the two men and their top aides met for lunch at Andros Diner to discuss a transition plan that had been drawn up by the Booker team. What some aides feared could be a contentious discussion was fairly peaceful and productive.Running against Mr. Booker\u2019s record might have helped him win the mayor\u2019s office, but Mr. Baraka realized he needed allies if he was going to succeed in office.\u201cI\u2019m about collaboration,\u201d Mr. Baraka said. \u201cWhatever we need to do to fix it, pragmatically, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dSoon the two men were working together on projects across Newark. When Mars Wrigley called Mr. Booker about coming to Newark, he directed them to Mr. Baraka, and the two made the sales pitch together. When Mr. Baraka was battling Gov. Chris Christie over control of the city\u2019s schools, seeking to fulfill a core campaign promise, Mr. Booker called him and urged him to go to Trenton and advocate in person despite Mr. Baraka\u2019s misgivings.With Mr. Booker\u2019s name regularly mentioned as a top potential Democratic presidential candidate, his efforts to help Mr. Baraka could be seen as motivated, in part, by a desire to burnish his own image. Mr. Booker, who was not immediately available for an interview, could make the case that Mr. Baraka is building on a foundation that he put in place during his seven years in office.For his part, Mr. Baraka now says that Mr. Booker was particularly effective at changing the city\u2019s narrative.\u201cBooker began to get people to look at Newark differently,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Baraka said. \u201cHe put us in the game, got us to the coliseum. And I give him credit for that.\u201d\u201cSo my job,\u2019\u2019 he added, \u201cwhen I got in the game, was to win.\u201d\u201cI know he\u2019s going to come up here and speak, but he really doesn\u2019t need to,\u201d Mr. Booker said, referring to the mayor. \u201cYou could drive around this whole city, and from the parks and schools, small businesses, you could drive around the whole city to see the kind of work our city workers are doing.\u201dThe two men were in the courtyard of an apartment complex that provides low-income housing for older people for about an hour, as supporters snacked on hamburgers and hot dogs. (Some were cooked by Mr. Booker, who also peddled slightly charred veggie burgers while reminding the crowd, \u201cI\u2019m a vegan.\u201d)Flavia Mercado, who has lived in Newark for 45 years, watched as Mr. Booker posed for photographs on a bocce court.\u201cHe was a mayor once, now he\u2019s a senator \u2014 the best that we had,\u201d she said in Spanish.When asked what she thought about Mr. Baraka, she said he was impressive, too, but that it was difficult to pick \u201cthe best.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re clones,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Save Barnes & Noble!", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAt first glance, this seems like a classic story of business disruption.

These giants are popular, because they provide good products and service. But they have also become mighty enough to vanquish their competitors and create problems for society.For most of American history, the government viewed giant corporations of any kind as inherently problematic. Their size gave them too much power \u2014 to eliminate competition, raise prices, hold down wages and influence politics. So the government passed laws to restrain businesses and occasionally broke up the largest, like Standard Oil and AT&T.The book business is looking like a case study. Amazon is taking over, yet has never run into antitrust scrutiny. It has reduced prices, after all. It sells many e-books for $9.99 and hardcover best sellers at a big discount. So what\u2019s the problem?Plenty. Amazon has been happy to lose money on books to build a loyal customer base, to which it can then sell everything else. \u201cAmazon isn\u2019t primarily concerned about books these days,\u201d Oren Teicher, who runs an association of independent bookstores, told me. \u201cThey are far more focused on getting consumers into their ecosystem so they can sell them every other product under the sun.\u201dOh, and now prices may be rising.

Despite the fact that the company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 beat analysts expectations of $1.12, Walmart\u2019s stock price was down by more than 1.8 percent in early afternoon trading on Thursday.The company is trying to offer all things to all shoppers as it tries to counter Amazon\u2019s online dominance \u2014 a nice physical store to shop in, an easy-to-use website and fast home delivery.\u201cThis whole converged experience we think is really important,\u201d said Greg Foran, the head of Walmart\u2019s operations in the United States.It is an expensive proposition. For a company with a long history of squeezing expenses from its stores, Walmart\u2019s operating profit is now under pressure, as it makes investments in both e-commerce and in improving its big boxes. Earlier this year, the company raised its starting wage to $11 an hour to better compete for workers in the tightening labor market.Walmart\u2019s deal for Flipkart, one of the largest and riskiest in its history, follows a pattern of purchases over the past 18 months as it expands its footprint beyond box stores.A big question facing Walmart \u2014 and other brick-and-mortar retailers scrambling to build out their online capabilities \u2014 is how much e-commerce sales are cannibalizing transactions that would have otherwise been made in its stores. The extra cost of home delivery cuts into the margins on each sale.With more than 300 million tech-savvy millennials, India is an enticing market for Walmart. But the push into India is also fraught with risks, given the country\u2019s problematic infrastructure and the reality that much of the population can barely afford basic necessities.Closer to home, Walmart is also trying to reach younger, urban and more affluent online shoppers, who have long been more of Amazon\u2019s core customer base than Walmart\u2019s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Troye Sivan Is a New Kind of Pop Star: Here, Queer and Used to It", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "The 22-year-old singer is climbing the charts while demonstrating how his sexual orientation is both part of his art and beside the point.Supported byHip-swinging pretty boys in eye makeup are nothing new; they\u2019ve been singing on television since Elvis on Ed Sullivan. But Mr. Sivan is a creature of our time: a self-possessed, on-his-own-terms heartthrob, gay and untroubled, with the commercial sheen of a Disney star and the charisma of a boy prince.\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d represents a new frontier for Mr. Sivan, and the audience he has to win over with his forthcoming second album, \u201cBloom.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been following Troye from the beginning,\u201d said Brian Siedlecki, a producer of the show, who oversees the musical bookings, \u201cwatching his evolution through his early career and realizing this kid has the goods.\u201d His second album release had not yet been confirmed when \u201cS.N.L.\u201d reached out. \u201cWe thought let\u2019s get him early, so we don\u2019t miss him this time around.\u201dWhat Mr. Sivan has to reassure him \u2014 besides the healthy push of Capitol Records, a major label that is also home to Katy Perry, Paul McCartney and Sam Smith \u2014 is the die-hard fans to whom, to judge from the comments left on each of his Instagram posts, he is \u201cGod\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d and whose greatness leaves them de-wigged. (In drag slang, gentrified into gay slang, gentrified into everyone\u2019s slang, \u201cWig\u201d is one-word shorthand for \u201cI am shocked, I am overwhelmed, my wig has been snatched off\u201d \u2014 no actual wig necessary.)Such online bravado covers up the more tender, nervous side of his teenage fan base: the young gay boys who come to his meet-and-greets and signings and cry. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re shaky when they come up and say hello,\u201d Mr. Sivan said. \u201cWith this album, I\u2019m trying to reach a wider audience than I have before. But then when I do a meet-and-greet like that, it makes me realize that\u2019s not that important. No matter what, for whatever reason, this person standing in front of me who\u2019s shaking and crying and I have connected. I see myself in them.\u201dMr. Sivan is not the first gay pop star, by a long measure. Gay men have been making, managing and influencing popular music and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll since its birth, in ways both implicit and explicit. But whereas the mainstream gay pop stars of a generation ago, like Boy George and George Michael, began their careers closeted, Mr. Sivan has been out since before the beginning of his.\u201cThe music industry in my eyes is still pretty homophobic,\u201d said Mr. Smith, who came out publicly just before the release of his first album. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult place for any L.G.B.T.Q. artist to come out and be supported.\u201d\u201cIt was just fearless,\u201d said Brett McLaughlin, known professionally as Leland, and who is one of Mr. Sivan\u2019s closest friends and songwriting collaborators. \u201cThere was not a question of \u2018should we do this or shouldn\u2019t we.\u2019 It was more a question of \u2018why wouldn\u2019t we?\u2019\u201d\u201cWe knew exactly who he was from the moment we signed him,\u201d said Michelle Jubelirer, the chief operating officer of Capitol Music Group.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have been more supportive and thrilled. He certainly wasn\u2019t one of those artists who waited for success to be who he is.\u201d His demographic, she added, is young and diverse (and not short on young women who have crushes on him, in addition to young men).But \u201cMy My My!,\u201d an ecstatic love song and especially its music video, is a celebration of the tell. Mr. Sivan does his spring-jointed runway walk \u2014 his throbbing flail \u2014 throughout. (\u201cI\u2019ve never had the guts to call it dancing or work on it really,\u201d he said.) It is, to a certain kind of boy, immediately recognizable: The private dance of a would-be diva alone in his bedroom. Which is, Mr. Sivan said, more or less exactly what it was.That was then.The night he filmed \u201cMy My My!,\u201d he said, \u201cI might as well have been Naomi Campbell.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s moving in that video like every single gay boy,\u201d said Mr. Smith. \u201cI identify with that video so much.\u201dFrom there, he traveled Australia\u2019s equivalent of the borscht belt circuit, singing at High Holy Days services. At 12 he began making videos online, parlaying fame and comfort in front of a camera into intimacy and brand-building as well as film roles. He started writing songs, just a boy and a laptop. A self-produced EP got him signed to EMI in Australia at 16, which then put out two more, the second of which was later incorporated into \u201cBlue Neighbourhood.\u201dMr. Sivan\u2019s is not a show business family, per se. His parents are from South Africa, where Mr. Sivan was born. His mother, a former model, worked at a modeling agency, and his father, a plumber by trade, cycled through a host of jobs: real estate agent, garage storage installer, motivational speaker. \u201cHe did it all,\u201d Mr. Sivan said. \u201cNow he has an Airbnb business. And drives Uber.\u201dMr. Sivan has three siblings and said he had a happy and supportive childhood, albeit with a familiar lacuna. \u201cI didn\u2019t know any gay people growing up,\u201d he said. \u201cI just had no idea what life was supposed to look like.\u201d He absorbed what he could from secret viewings of \u201cQueer as Folk,\u201d looking over his shoulder as he watched.For his young gay fans who mob his meet-and-greets, it\u2019s a dream life, and a message, especially to those in imperfect circumstances, that it can and does get better.\u201cI can\u2019t squeeze them hard enough,\u201d Mr. Sivan said. \u201cSometimes you hug someone and you can just feel too much weight in their chest for a 14-year-old. You\u2019re like, I see you. I get what\u2019s going on.\u201dThe pressure of writing and recording a second album can be intense, especially if a plaque celebrating your first hit single\u2019s sales is leaning up against the wall. \u201cThe only difference between writing the first album and the second album,\u201d Mr. Sivan said, \u201cwas the second album we had that staring at us the whole time.\u201dBut \u201cBloom\u201d doesn\u2019t sound fearful or timid. It\u2019s darker, more guitar-driven and at times sexier than what\u2019s come before. Sitting in the studio in Los Angeles, Mr. Sivan pulled up a Spotify playlist on his phone, a sonic mood board: Sky Ferreira, Drake and the Replacements. Mr. McLaughlin recalled arriving for one of the first album sessions with a bag of wigs to lighten the mood. (Wig!)\u201cTroye is somebody who\u2019s very good at showing up and understanding the pitch with him, the thing that sets him apart, is his outspokenness about his identity,\u201d said Ms. Nef. \u201cBut I think his new work transcends that.\u201dIn person, Mr. Sivan is cheerful and obliging but, in the way of many young people who have broadcast themselves early and often to fame, a little remote: an uncrackable carapace, the onscreen projection of a (former) teen dream. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of mysterious, in a way,\u201d said Ms. Nef. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s his background or just him, but I\u2019m used to socializing with Americans and they say things like \u2018I love you\u2019 really quickly and they\u2019re super wet as people. I wouldn\u2019t say Troye\u2019s a dry person, but there\u2019s something a little more reserved about him.\u201dI had the sense, as the Tesla sped us back toward Hollywood, that that reserve only fully leaves him onstage, where Troye the person meets Troye the star and the world is the show. He is planning the world tour for \u201cBloom,\u201d which kicks off in the fall, excited for the new Troye \u2014 louder, freer, Troyer \u2014 to meet the world.\u201cI would be doing myself a disservice if I didn\u2019t just go for it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo as scary as that is, I\u2019m getting a little bit more comfortable with the idea that if you do something confidently enough, I think people have no choice but to accept it.\u201dThat will require a wind machine, he decided, having gotten his first taste at his largest show to date, for 6,000 people in Australia, outdoors, with the actual wind in his face.\u201cI was like \u2018Oh my God, this is something else,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow I can\u2019t kick it. By the end my mouth is so dry and I\u2019m trying to sing, and that gets tough. So, I\u2019m going to figure out how to do it on tour. How does Beyonc\u00e9 do it?\u201dAdvertisement"}

In keeping with the theme, there were gowns crusted in pearls and embroidered so elaborately, so painstakingly, it was easy to imagine a quorum of stitchers somewhere, all gone stone blind. There were trains by the yard obstructing traffic, and a full complement of halos, wimples, tiaras and crowns.In fashion, luckily, everyone is basically a diva already, and even the divas know the Met Gala is the occasion to go all in.There were veiled princesses, like Kate Bosworth in Oscar de la Renta, who seemed delivered straight from the Renaissance, and tougher emissaries from Middle Ages, like Olivia Munn, in a gold chain mail H&M dress inspired by the Crusades. \u201cIt\u2019s actually very comfortable,\u201d she said.\u201cImagining you on a horse is everything right now,\u201d said Lily Collins, whose own Givenchy Haute Couture vibe was, as she put it, \u201cchic nun.\u201d\u201cI heard Katy Perry\u2019s coming in on a horse,\u201d Ms. Munn said.But no, when Ms. Perry arrived, it was merely in a top-down Rolls-Royce, wearing a pair of angel wings so enormous that Salma Hayek dropped to her knees in front of the singer. \u201cTouched by an angel!\u201d Ms. Hayek cried, while her husband, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, snapped photos.\u201cJust a little understated thing,\u201d Ms. Perry said. \u201cJust a small, simple, understated thing.\u201dThere was a hint of heresy in the air. (\u201cI\u2019m giving you Jewish Givenchy cardinal!\u201d said the theater producer Jordan Roth, swinging the beaded fringe of his cardinal-red Givenchy Haute Couture.) But the exhibition mostly skirted controversy. Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute, said he had reviewed his plans with Father James Martin, a consultor to the Vatican\u2019s Secretariat for Communications, who had found little cause for alarm.He himself had worn black, with nary a cross or rosary in sight. \u201cI should\u2019ve worn red socks, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d he said, but then, it\u2019s hard to get fashion types out of basic black.\u201cWell, it\u2019s monastic,\u201d protested Dr. Lisa Airan, standing nearby.For the rest, there were cocktails, gala-circuit conversation (\u201cDon\u2019t I know you from\u2026?\u201d \u201c \u2026 Sloane\u2019s house in the Hamptons!\u201d) and lounging by the Temple of Dendur.

{"Headline": "Spike Lee\u2019s \u2018Pass Over,\u2019 an Offbeat Melding of Cinema and Theater", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingThe latest picture by the prolific and ever-stimulating filmmaker Spike Lee, \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d is in competition at the Cannes Film Festival. His other 2018 movie, \u201cPass Over,\u201d is on Amazon Video and free to Prime members. It\u2019s a superb film, one that, as the saying goes, finds the director working at the height of his powers. (It\u2019s also a rare instance of an Amazon production debuting on the video site with no theatrical release.)\u201cPass Over\u201d is an adaptation of a play by Antoinette Nwandu, produced at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago, where it was directed by Danya Taymor. I call it an adaptation even though it is, in large part, a film of the play, shot during a stage performance, and featuring glimpses of audience members laughing or gasping during crucial scenes.Mr. Lee\u2019s movie begins with a group boarding a bus bound for the Steppenwolf. A shot of the corner of Martin Luther King Drive and 64th Street in Chicago, in daylight, changes in a match cut to the prop street sign on the stage. At the foot of the sign, Kitch (Julian Parker) frets while Moses (Jon Michael Hill) sleeps. When Moses wakes, these two young African-American men contemplate, with a lot of profanity, the aimlessness of their lives while trying to dodge stray bullets.\u201cI got plans, you hear me? Big ole plans,\u201d one of them boasts. While their dialogue is stocked with allusions to redemption, their despair is such that the place they wish to \u201cpass over\u201d is revealed as the valley of death. The question becomes how to break the death spiral the characters feel trapped in.Mr. Lee shoots the stage from various intimate angles. His techniques here explode the notion of a \u201cfilmed play.\u201d He puts you with the characters, but also puts you with the audience; it\u2019s a multidimensional experience, with emotional resonances that once seemed unique to either theatrical or cinematic form. It is a remarkable and remarkably pertinent movie.This version of the film is a new one; when the picture was shown at the 2017 South by Southwest film festival, it contained previously unreleased surveillance camera footage of the convenience store that Mr. Brown visited the day before his shooting. The director\u2019s interpretation of the newly released footage caused some controversy, eliciting pushback from Ferguson officials and some media commentators. Mr. Pollock has expanded the film to take that controversy into account.Finally, in his 2012 film \u201cAmity,\u201d Mr. Adams plumbs the depths of toxic masculinity. The movie is about Greg, an aggressive Navy vet who attempts to reconnect with his teenage daughter by meeting her in a limo on the night of her high-school graduation. She rebuffs him, and Greg\u2019s evening turns into one of abrasive frustration as he verbally jousts with his driver and a group of women he picks up with the limo later that evening.It\u2019s a tense and uncomfortable experience, in all the right ways. Mr. Adams has a deceptive style; initially his films seem loosely shot, but the aggregation of seemingly tossed-off scenes tightens like a noose. The director has informed me that he\u2019s working on some new projects; I do hope they come to fruition. In the meantime, this is a distinctive and provocative body of work.Advertisement"}

Moody\u2019s currently gives Italy a Baa2 rating, its second lowest \u201cinvestment grade\u201d rating.Just the threat of a downgrade is likely to increase pressure on Italy\u2019s government.Moody\u2019s said two main concerns drove its decision. The ratings agency said there was a \u201csignificant risk of a material weakening in Italy\u2019s fiscal strength, given the fiscal plans of the new coalition government.\u201d Moody\u2019s also said there was a risk that overhauls aimed at making Italy\u2019s economy more efficient might now stall.- Peter EavisThe governing coalition\u2019s majority in the upper one \u2014 the Senate \u2014 is slim: six votes. In the course of a sharp increase in borrowing costs triggered by an irresponsible budget (or its anticipation), that majority may well erode quickly.But even if Italy\u2019s government backed away from its policies, the country\u2019s problems \u2014 a high debt load and a sluggish economy \u2013 would remain. It might thus only be a matter of time before Italy again attempts to stand up to the E.U. Some analysts might contend that Italy should soldier on with orthodox, fiscally responsible policies and become more like Spain, whose economy has done well in recent years. But, as Ben Chu, economics editor of The Independent, asserted on Twitter, Italy\u2019s governments in recent years have not been profligate.- Peter EavisUltimately, the incident wasn\u2019t as awkward as it might\u2019ve been \u2014 the couple was discussing hardwood flooring. But it raises questions about the accuracy of the A.I. assistants on these devices, what they do with your data, and how that might be regulated.Misidentification of a wake word by a device \u2014 on Amazon\u2019s, that\u2019s \u201cAlexa\u201d by default \u2014 automatically sends data to the company\u2019s servers. Why? Because the small speakers don\u2019t have the computing power required to make sense of entire sentences, so that must be done on the cloud.You can\u2019t turn off the always-listening feature of these devices, because, if you could, they wouldn\u2019t be able to respond to your voice, rendering them useless. But misidentification of words can, according to Amazon, set in motion a chain of events that are troubling from a privacy perspective.The question: What happens to that data? And what should these devices be able to do with it?Did you know all that? Maybe not. While companies like Amazon do explain in their terms of service that user data will be stored on servers and used to improve their products, it\u2019s perfectly possible to start using such a device in your home without being alerted to the fact. Data privacy is weakly regulated in the U.S., and there\u2019s no rule that demands Alexa tell you through its speaker what it will do with your data. So many people remain unaware of how their data is being used.Responding to a request for details about the ways in which Amazon is making its Echo devices G.D.P.R.-compliant, a spokesperson told DealBook:\u201cProtecting the privacy of customers has always been a top priority for Amazon. The Alexa privacy settings give customers insight and control over their data; they can use it to easily manage and delete their audio recordings, configure third-party skill permissions, and opt-out of having their voice data used to develop new Alexa features.\u201dSo, that\u2019s Europe. What about the U.S.? Big tech firms \u2014 in particular, Facebook \u2014 say they are responding to those new European rules with policies that will also apply in America. The same is likely to be true of smart speakers.But for now, the best way to control what\u2019s done with your data is to regularly delete the audio recorded by the devices, and opt out of any arrangement that allows the companies to use it to improve their services.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeIt\u2019s not surprising to hear that many C.E.O.s are handsomely paid \u2014 Doug McMillon of Walmart, for example, earned $22 million last year. (That said, the $102 million collected by Frank Bisignano of the credit card processor First Data is still eye-popping.)As part of a bail package negotiated in advance, Mr. Weinstein will have to put up $1 million in cash, surrender his passport and agree to wear an ankle-monitoring device. But the charges may not be the last against him, according to the NYT:An investigative grand jury, still convened, will look into other sexual assault allegations against Mr. Weinstein as well as possible financial crimes relating to how he paid women to stay silent, people familiar with the proceedings said.The auto maker warned owners not to use cruise control until the cars, S.U.V.s and trucks can be fixed with a software update.

{"Headline": "Worried About Big Tech? Chinese Giants Make America\u2019s Look Tame", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Forget Google versus Facebook. Forget Uber versus Lyft. Forget Amazon versus \u2026 well, everybody.The technology world\u2019s most bruising battle for supremacy is taking place in China. And it could point to Big Tech\u2019s future everywhere else, too.Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group are ratcheting up their no-holds-barred contest to dominate the ways 770 million internet users communicate, shop, get around, entertain themselves and even invest their savings and visit the doctor.The two titans long ago branched out from their core businesses \u2014 games and social media for Tencent, e-commerce for Alibaba \u2014 to duke it out in ever more realms of Chinese life. They have competed in messaging, microblogging and delivering takeout. They go head-to-head in video streaming and cloud computing.But in the internet realm, China still offers a spooky potential vision of the future, one in which online behemoths like Tencent and Alibaba become the gatekeepers to the entire economy, wielding immense power over traditional industries and becoming very, very rich in the process.\u201cSometimes I think, \u2018Ah, we\u2019re competing in this now, too? All right then,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ma said, chuckling. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201d\u201cAs profitability reduces, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Now I need to monetize my customer base,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rajgopal said. \u201cThe innovation we\u2019re seeing in China could be seen in the U.S. in the next three to five years,\u201d he added. \u201cCustomers are demanding that.\u201d\u201cIf you can become so big, and so successful in so many areas, this in itself shows that you must have maintained very good, very friendly relations with the government,\u201d Mr. Hu said.Neither giant is done getting bigger.Each has a market capitalization of close to $500 billion, making them among the most highly valued technology firms on the planet. Google and Facebook still claim more users, but the Chinese heavyweights arguably do more \u2014 and more, and more \u2014 for theirs.They have both funded ventures that offer online education, make electric cars and rent out bicycles. For the giants, such initiatives represent new opportunities for people to use their digital wallets \u2014 Ant Financial\u2019s Alipay and Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay \u2014 and new ways to collect data on consumer behavior. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein counted 247 investment deals by Tencent in recent years and 156 by Alibaba, though given the pace of the companies\u2019 deal-making, they said their database was \u201clikely to be perennially incomplete.\u201dOnce the companies have locked people into their payment systems, they can become the enablers of commerce and financial services of even more kinds. In a sign of investors\u2019 excitement about the possibilities, Ant Financial is making plans to go public, in a blockbuster stock offering that could give the company a market value larger than Goldman Sachs\u2019s.China has become a model for tech\u2019s world-swallowing tendencies partly out of circumstance.With the country\u2019s high-speed churn of well-funded start-ups, planting flags on new turf is often the only way for large players not to be constantly losing ground.\u201cThe whole China internet market is way more competitive than the U.S. market,\u201d said Xiaoyan Wang, an analyst at 86Research in Shanghai. \u201cEveryone is trying to expand their presence in every sector.\u201dAlso, both Alibaba and Tencent have struggled to make much money outside their home market. That means their surest way to keep growing is to get more deeply involved in more areas of their Chinese users\u2019 lives.In a report this week, Morgan Stanley predicted that by 2027, the total market in China in which Alibaba could be making money will be worth $19 trillion \u2014 more than Amazon\u2019s potential market worldwide.At the moment, both Chinese giants are hustling to find more ways for people to transact using their wallet and not the other\u2019s. Alibaba\u2019s shopping sites and physical stores do not allow users to pay for stuff with WeChat. Tencent-backed companies, such as the retailer JD.com or the service platform Meituan-Dianping, either downplay Alipay as a payment option in their apps or do not accept it at all.Whether any of this will give either camp an enduring lead in payments is unclear. Eric Wen, the founder of Blue Lotus Research Institute, expects them to end up at roughly 50-50.The payments contest will at least propel both companies to keep expanding their kingdoms, including overseas. Alibaba is pouring billions of dollars into online shopping ventures in India and Southeast Asia. Tencent is backing start-ups around the world that have even a distant chance of enriching its ecosystem.George Favvas did not know too much about Tencent before it invested in his company in San Francisco, Circle Medical, whose app lets users summon doctors on demand. He also had no specific plans to take his business to China in the near future, if ever.\u201cMy first question was, \u2018Why are you interested in us?\u2019\u201d Mr. Favvas said.He gets it now, he says. \u201cThey\u2019re just such a big player, and health care is so broken,\u201d Mr. Favvas said. Tencent, he added, is interested in health care for the same reasons companies like Amazon and Apple are.\u201cIf anything, they\u2019re a couple of years ahead.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Visionaries With the Courage to Change the World", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "Over centuries, these people have shared some important attributes: courage, daring, confidence and a stubborn devotion to an idea.Supported byCall them what you will: change makers, innovators, thought leaders, visionaries.In ways large and small, they fight. They disrupt. They take risks. They push boundaries to change the way we see the world, or live in it. Some create new enterprises, while others develop their groundbreaking ideas within an existing one.Although centuries stretch between them, experts who have studied the nature of innovators across all areas of expertise largely agree that they have important attributes in common, from innovative thinking to an ability to build trust among those who follow them to utter confidence and a stubborn devotion to their dream.Despite the shared characteristics with their predecessors, however, today\u2019s innovators face their own set of challenges. The world around them is changing at warp speed and they need to be able to move with it.\u201cThe one characteristic that I\u2019m very comfortable saying that all remarkable leaders in big business, small business, not-for-profit, military, government and the arts, have to have is courage,\u201d Mr. Sinek said.\u201cThese people are driven by some cause that compels them to find the courage and take certain risks and work damn hard at it,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the choice is lonely, which is another reason it takes courage. You have to have the courage to do the right thing. Elon Musk is the perfect example of someone with tremendous courage and conviction. He invested nearly everything he had in SpaceX and Tesla.\u201d\u201cHe has a devotion to a vision that very few people do,\u201d Mr. Sinek said.\u201cThings aren\u2019t linear anymore. We are living in an ecosystem world. It is more complex.\u201d\u201cThe mechanical model of organizations in the past has produced hierarchies, static positions and rigid organizational charts, and has produced leaders who, however charismatic they may be, rule from the top and rule unequivocally. They control and direct and others follow. That model doesn\u2019t really work anymore.\u201dThe emerging game-changers appreciate that creating fundamental change is a process, a marathon, not a sprint, and they are comfortable operating at the edge of chaos and ambiguity. They also have an ability to ask questions, rather than feeling they must know the answers and to think in nonlinear and nonbinary ways, according to Ms. Blandin. These attributes stand in stark contrast to the attributes typically associated with strong leaders in the past.They must also be tough enough to bear up under intense public scrutiny on social media and to withstand or adhere to an underlying peer pressure for social do-gooderism.Travis Kalanick, 41, founder of the ride-share app, Uber, introduced a pioneering concept, but was unable to navigate a sequence of scandals surrounding a macho company culture and allegations of sexual harassment that presumably stemmed from his leadership style, forcing him to resign.And time will tell how well Mr. Zuckerberg, 34, who founded Facebook in his college dorm room, will withstand the hot seat that has resulted from revelations that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica gathered data of millions of the social network\u2019s users and might have influenced the 2016 election. It has brought the question of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s societal stewardship front and center.Acting as a guardian for not only people but also the planet is a concern that\u2019s inextricably woven into the fabric of this new generation of leaders. It\u2019s nonnegotiable. \u201cThey are deeply aware of the context in which their organization is operating, and it is beyond the marketplace \u2014 politics, globally, society. It\u2019s a long game and one where doing good is good business,\u201d Ms. Siang said.In the past, leaders had to think almost exclusively about what was good for their organization. \u201cToday, they also have to bear the responsibility of societal stewardship.\u201d Ms. Siang said. \u201cThe society has ramifications for what is happening in our organization, and our organization has ramifications for what is happening in society. There is this interdependence.\u201dThose who become successful leaders today also must deliver a sense of \u201cpsychological safety\u201d to those who follow them, Mr. Pink said. They create an environment \u201cwhere people are safe to express themselves, to take risks, safe to be who they really are \u2014 whether it\u2019s a business, museum, dance troupe, whether it\u2019s a high school newspaper. That quality gives people the freedom to connect and innovate.\u201dLin-Manuel Miranda, creator of \u201cHamilton,\u201d re-envisioned the Broadway musical to tell a slice of American history via his passion for rapid-fire hip-hop lyrics, a language that bridges generations. It took Mr. Miranda seven years after reading Ron Chernow\u2019s biography \u201cAlexander Hamilton\u201d to bring his masterpiece to Broadway. And for a year, Mr. Miranda starred in his creation.For today\u2019s influencers, what\u2019s different is that, like Mr. Miranda, \u201cyou have to continually show motivation yourself,\u201d Ms. Siang said. \u201cYour followers have to see it in you on a day-to-day basis. You have to demonstrate an emotional investment.\u201dIn fact, they might take a page from the playbook of Mr. Krzyzewski, 71. \u201cNext play\u201d is his mantra.\u201cWhether it is a success, or a failure, it is next play,\u201d Ms. Siang said. \u201cWhat Coach K. means by that is, don\u2019t rest on your laurels, but also don\u2019t be dragged down by your failures. Learn from both of them. Keep going forward, keep learning.\u201dSounds like the perfect prep for the next swell of change makers poised to mastermind a world that is moving like greased lightning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sailing Around the World, in His Father\u2019s Footsteps", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTeam AkzoNobel during the third leg of the Volvo Ocean Race from Cape Town to Melbourne, Australia.NEWPORT, R.I. \u2014 Long before Peter Blake was killed by a Brazilian pirate in the Amazon in 2001, he talked at the dinner table with his young son James about the privileges that came with successfully sailing around the world.\u201cHe always told me that you couldn\u2019t put your elbows on the table until you\u2019ve gone around Cape Horn,\u201d James Blake said.Blake, now 31, has joined the club at last: rounding \u201cthe Horn\u201d this year during the Volvo Ocean Race, the grueling round-the-world event that his father competed in five times \u2014 and won once \u2014 when it was called the Whitbread.The Volvo started Oct. 22 with seven teams sailing from Alicante, Spain, to Lisbon. The race has 11 legs total with the ninth starting Sunday and the teams sailing from Newport to Cardiff, Wales. The race is scheduled to finish in The Hague in late June.Blake is in the midst of his first participation, and he is playing a very different role than his father, who was a skipper and central figure worldwide in yachting until his death at age 53.Blake is an onboard reporter, or OBR \u2014 one of 10 men and women hired by the race to deliver video, photography and written material from the boats. The OBRs are, by job definition, fly-on-the-deck observers and are not permitted to help with the performance of the yachts (although they can do lots of cooking).But impartiality can prove elusive when you share very cramped quarters and the perils of ocean racing during legs that can stretch to 7,600 nautical miles and last more than 20 days.\u201cThe most important thing is telling the story, but it\u2019s a fine line we all have to dance between telling the good, the bad and the ugly,\u201d Corinna Halloran, a former onboard reporter, once said.That dance, never straightforward since embedded reporting became part of the Volvo in 2008, has been particularly challenging during this edition of the race, which has twice turned tragic.In January, a fisherman was killed after the Danish-American team, Vestas 11th Hour Racing, collided with a Chinese fishing boat. Then in March, John Fisher, a British sailor with the Hong Kong-based team Sun Hung Kai/Scallywag, was lost at sea and presumed dead after being swept overboard about 1,400 nautical miles west of Cape Horn.Largely for legal reasons, the race released little detailed information from on board Vestas after the January incident. Konrad Frost, the OBR on Scallywag during the fatal leg in March, stopped reporting after it became clear that Fisher had been lost.\u201cKonrad is a very experienced cameraman, and it was his judgment on what should and should not be captured,\u201d said Brian Carlin, the OBR team leader. \u201cKonrad stood down and did not continue, and I think that was only right.\u201dFisher\u2019s loss was an emotional blow.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a big shock to everyone,\u201d Blake said. \u201cMy initial thoughts were just with his family, because I have a little bit of experience with what they are going through.\u201dBlake was 14 when his father was killed during an environmental research mission.The society\u2019s yacht, Seamaster, was anchored in Macapa near the mouth of the Amazon delta when a small band of masked river pirates came aboard with guns drawn and balaclavas in place. Peter Blake, in an attempt to protect his crew, fired a rifle and was shot twice in the back by Ricardo Colares Tavares, who was later sentenced to 36 years in prison in Brazil for the murder.Peter Blake became an icon in New Zealand, where sailing is an intermittent national obsession. He was imposing with a bushy mustache, and though plenty of Kiwi sailors won more regattas, he had a rumpled charisma and persistence. He finally won the Whitbread on his fifth attempt, sweeping all six legs during the 1989-90 edition as skipper of Steinlager 2.After managing an unsuccessful challenge for the 1992 America\u2019s Cup, he was the syndicate head in 1995 when Team New Zealand won yachting\u2019s most prestigious trophy for the first time. He played the same role off the water again in 2000 when the team successfully defended the Cup at home in Auckland.During those campaigns, his lucky red socks became a national symbol (and fund-raising vehicle), worn by Prime Minister Jim Bolger and other New Zealanders in honor of a small nation\u2019s ability to punch above its weight.He holds dual British-New Zealand citizenship but was raised and educated mainly in the United Kingdom, where he remains based when he is not being buffeted by winds and doused by seawater with a camera or drone control in hand.\u201cThese boats are very, very wet,\u201d James said. \u201cSometimes it just feels like you are underwater.\u201dBlake might not be an offshore racer, but he shares his father\u2019s adventurous streak. In 2012 he rowed from Australia to New Zealand with three companions, losing about 40 pounds during the 51 days it took to complete the crossing. He and a friend are attempting to develop a foiling kite boat to make a trans-Atlantic crossing.A cameraman by trade, he has focused, until now, on wildlife and historical documentaries, including work on the British polar explorer Ernest Shackleton.\u201cI\u2019ve never really covered sport before,\u201d Blake said. \u201cLots of sharks and whales, but this popped up, and it\u2019s a bit of a challenge really. I like filming expeditions and people going through a bit of hardship, so for me this has been a chance to look into that basically, and it\u2019s also been quite nice from a personal point of view seeing what Dad went through.\u201dHe was encouraged to apply for the Volvo OBR role by Leon Sefton, head of television and video for the race. Sefton is the son of Alan Sefton, a former journalist who became Peter Blake\u2019s biographer and aide-de-camp.The family connection surely did not hurt in making the final cut among the 140 candidates who made it through the initial vetting process.\u201cThe Blake family is always an important part of this race, but James got here on his merits as a cameraman,\u201d Carlin said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an added bonus that he happens to be Sir Peter Blake\u2019s son.\u201dThe OBRs rotate from crew to crew in this edition, and Blake has sailed with three different teams during the first eight legs of this race.He was aboard Dutch entrant Team AkzoNobel for the third leg from Cape Town to Melbourne, Australia, when the boat\u2019s mast track broke in December amid 50-knot squalls.\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of absolutely nowhere and you see this dip in how everyone is feeling, like we\u2019re screwed basically,\u201d Blake said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say within five minutes everyone was back up and running. There was a game plan, the humor was back and everyone got on with it, so that will really stick with me.\u201dBut the highlight so far for Blake was rounding the Horn: documenting the huge seas and seeing the albatrosses his father spoke about so often.\u201cYou see these birds that put no apparent effort into being down there, and we\u2019re 10 men and women in a boat struggling just to stay afloat,\u201d Blake said. \u201cAnd you see them flying around up there, and you wonder what they\u2019re thinking of you. It\u2019s quite amusing.\u201dBlake and the rest of the crew did manage to stay afloat, and when they arrived in Itajai, Brazil, in March they made their way to a restaurant to celebrate the return to terra firma.\u201cIt was a nice meal out,\u201d Blake said. \u201cAnd everyone was putting their elbows on the table.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Berkshire\u2019s Annual Meeting: Buffett Approves of Apple\u2019s Buyback Plan", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Saturday. Welcome to a special DealBook Briefing of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting.\u2022 What is Berkshire doing to promote gender equality?\u2022 Apple\u2019s buyback plan gets a thumbs up.\u2022 Warren Buffett isn\u2019t backing off his comments about guns and is sticking by Wells Fargo despite the scandals.\u2022 Where does Berkshire\u2019s health care venture with JPMorgan and Amazon stand?\u2022 Is Mr. Buffett now semi-retired?\u2022 Trade \u2018is a win-win situation.\u2019Asked what Berkshire Hathaway was doing to promote gender equality, Warren Buffett said Berkshire\u2019s recent choices of chief executives to run its businesses reflected fairness. \u201cBefore we made this management change, I probably named only six or seven C.E.O.s in the last five or six years. I would say that half of them that I\u2019ve named have been women,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.\u201cI feel very good about the decisions we\u2019ve made about our C.E.O.s,\u201d he added.He did not answer whether Berkshire would push for gender equality on the boards of the companies that Berkshire is invested in.Mr. Buffett also said it was clear that women had been treated unfairly in the past.\u201cI have two sisters who are absolutely as smart as I am, and they have better personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t remotely have the same opportunities as I had.\u201dMr. Buffett said there was still a \u201cpipeline problem\u201d in corporate America, making it hard to find as many qualified women to lead companies.But, he added, \u201cyou can\u2019t use that excuse forever.\u201d\u2014 Emily FlitterBerkshire is quickly building its stake in Apple.Since Berkshire first invested in the iPhone maker about two years ago, the stake has grown into Berkshire\u2019s largest holding. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire owned $40.7 billion of Apple\u2019s shares, up from $28.2 billion at the end of 2017.So what does Warren Buffett think about Apple\u2019s announcement that it plans to buy back $100 billion of its shares?\u201cI\u2019m delighted to see them repurchasing shares,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cWe own 5 percent of it. With the passage of a little time, we may own 6 or 7 percent because they repurchase shares.\u201dCharles Munger added that he and Mr. Buffett don\u2019t approve of every buyback plan, but he doubted Apple would find an acquisition target at a good price.\u201cThe reason companies are buying their stocks is that they are smart enough to know it\u2019s better for them than anything else,\u201d Mr. Munger said.Given Berkshire\u2019s investment in Apple, one shareholder wanted to know why Berkshire never invested in Microsoft. The question came with Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and a director at Berkshire, sitting in the audience.\u201cIn the earlier years, the answer is stupidity,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied. But then Mr. Buffett added that his friendship with Mr. Gates has grown over the years, and he has stayed away from investing \u201cbecause of the inference\u201d that could be drawn.Mr. Buffett has famously avoided investing in tech companies because he didn\u2019t understand them. But one investor wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s stance is evolving. Beyond Apple, the questioner pointed out that Amazon and Google parent Alphabet have the characteristics of companies Mr. Buffett typically likes to invest in: strong brand names and little competition.Here\u2019s the reason Mr. Buffett gave for not investing in Amazon:\u201cThe truth is that I\u2019ve watched Amazon from the start, and I think what Jeff Bezos has done is something close to a miracle. The problem is if I think something will be a miracle, I tend not to bet on it.\u201dAs for Alphabet, Mr. Buffett said that he had \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d He said he was unable to conclude that at Alphabet\u2019s present prices, its \u201cprospects were far better than the prices indicated.\u201dHe then explained that he didn\u2019t invest in Apple because it was a tech stock. \u201cI went into Apple because I came to certain conclusions about the value with which the capital was being deployed and about the ecosystem,\u201d he said.The discussion did lead to one of the more humorous exchanges of the meeting:Warren Buffett and Charles Munger saved their harshest words for cryptocurrencies.\u201cCryptocurrencies will come to bad endings.\u201d Mr. Buffett said, responding to an attendee from Ukraine.Mr. Buffett\u2019s main argument against cryptocurrencies is the same one he has made about gold: They are not a \u201cproductive asset.\u201d That means the value of cryptocurrencies is determined solely by what someone is willing to pay for it.\u201cIf you had bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it, it\u2019s a couple tenths of a percent,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.But his criticism didn\u2019t stop there. He said cryptocurrencies attract a lot of \u201ccharlatans\u201d and \u201cpeople of less than stellar character.\u201dThat comment came up at Saturday\u2019s meeting, and one shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett had misspoken.Mr. Buffett answered by largely repeating what he had said earlier this year:\u201cI do not believe on imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses.\u201cIf you get into which of our companies are pure and which ones aren\u2019t pure, I think it will be very difficult. I don\u2019t think that we should question on the Geico policy form: Are you an N.R.A. member? And if you are, you just aren\u2019t good enough for us.\u201dMr. Munger then added:\u201dCertainly we\u2019re not going to ban all guns surrounded by wild turkeys in Omaha.\u201dOver the past two years, regulators and whistle-blowers have revealed Wells Fargo employees were creating fake accounts using customers\u2019 identities, forcing borrowers to buy unnecessary auto insurance, and overcharging on mortgage fees.Berkshire first invested in Wells Fargo nearly three decades ago and is currently the bank\u2019s biggest holder with a nearly 10 percent stake.In response to a question about whether it was time to abandon the bank, which has already seen turnover in its executive suite and boardroom, Mr. Buffett said he thought Wells Fargo\u2019s problems would only make it stronger in the long run.\u201cAll the big banks have had troubles of one sort or another and I see no reason why Wells Fargo as a company, from both an investment standpoint and a moral standpoint going forward, is in any way inferior to the other big banks with which it competes,\u201d he said.\u201cI like Tim Sloan as a manager,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cHe is correcting mistakes made by other people.\u201dMr. Buffett went further: What happened at Wells Fargo could\u2019ve happened anywhere, he said.\u201cWe know people are doing something wrong as we sit here at Berkshire. You can\u2019t have 370,000 employees and expect that everyone is behaving like Ben Franklin.\u201d On the fake account scandal specifically, which the bank has said resulted from intense pressure on its branch managers to increase sales, Buffett said: \u201cWells Fargo is a company that proved the efficacy of incentives and it\u2019s just that they had the wrong incentives.\u201d\u2014 Emily FlitterThe question of who will succeed Warren Buffett has been a thread through many of the exchanges with shareholders.\u201cI\u2019ve been semiretired for decades,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied with a chuckle, but then he got serious.\u201cTed and Todd each manage about 12 or 13 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether that\u2019s $25 billion. They\u2019re managing $25 billion and doing a very good job.\u201dHe then quickly reminded the questioner of the size of the company\u2019s assets: \u201cI still have the responsibility for the other $300 billion.\u201dCharles T. Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, added: \u201cI watch Warren. He spends most of his time reading and thinking and occasionally he\u2019ll make a phone call or talk to somebody. Not much has changed.\u201dAnother shareholder asked whether Berkshire will have trouble doing deals once Mr. Buffett is no longer with the company. Companies have regularly approached Berkshire over the years about being bought. That has allowed Berkshire to avoid bidding wars and to make acquisitions at lower prices.The shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s successor would continue to have access to those deals and whether Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger should aggressively publicize the work of their successors to help pass on thei \u201chometown advantage.\u201d\u201cI think the reputation of Berkshire as being a very good home for companies, particularly a very good private home for a company, I don\u2019t think that reputation is dependent on me or Charlie,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cIt may take a little \u2014 there may be a little testing period for whoever takes over.\u201d\u201dThe truth is that I think some of the other executives are getting better known,\u201d he added.\u2014 Emily Flitter and Stephen GrocerThe three firms said in January that they were teaming up to try to find a better, cheaper way to provide health care to their own workers, a combined one million people. And they said if their idea worked, they would seek to share it with other companies.Warren Buffett on Saturday again called the cost of health care \u201ca tapeworm in terms of American business.\u201d He lamented the success other countries \u2014 he did not name any \u2014 have had keeping their own health care costs at a lower proportion of their gross domestic product.But just how Berkshire\u2019s partnership will address the problem remains a big question.Mr. Buffett had no more details to offer on Saturday. He said the people leading the effort are still searching for a chief executive. They could announce a hire \u201cwithin a couple of months,\u201d he added.\u201cWhether we can bring the resources, bring the person, that C.E.O., is terribly important. Bring the person, support that person and somehow figure out a better way for people to continue to receive better medical care in the United States,\u201d he mused \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that will happen.\u201dBut Mr. Buffett seemed uncertain, though hopeful, about the effort as a whole.\u201cWe are attacking an industry moat,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge moat. We\u2019ll do our best. If we fail, I hope somebody else succeeds.\u201dCharles Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, weighed in: \u201cI suspect that eventually when the Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House, I suspect that we will get a single payer system, and I suspect it won\u2019t be very friendly to the existing\u201d pharmacy benefit managers.\u2014 Emily FlitterThe Trump administration has taken a more combative stance on trade, particularly with China.So it comes as little surprise then that one of the first questions put to Warren Buffett and Charles Munger was about trade. Here\u2019s Mr. Buffett\u2019s response:\u201cThe United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long, long time. We have a lot of common interests, and like any two big economic entities, there are times when there will be tensions. But it is a win-win situation when the world trades, and China and the United States are the two big factors in that.\u201d\u201cIt is a win-win situation. The only problem is when one side or the other wants to win a little bit too much.\u201dSaturday morning Berkshire reported a net loss for the first quarter because of those accounting changes. The new rules require Berkshire to include in its earnings the gains and losses on the stocks it holds but has not sold.In the first quarter, Berkshire\u2019s net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with net income of $4.06 billion a year earlier.Given the new accounting rule, Mr. Buffett suggested Saturday that shareholders should look at Berkshire\u2019s operating income, which excludes gains and losses for Berkshire\u2019s investments, for a more accurate picture of the company\u2019s performance.Berkshire reported its operating income rose 49 percent to $5.29 billion from a year ago.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe main event every year at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting is the question and answer session. Elisa Mala, a reporter working for The New York Times asked those attending Berkshire events on Friday what they would ask Mr. Buffett. Here is a sampling:\u2022 What is the single greatest important investment in your lifetime? Is it a company? Is it a relationship? \u2014 Conner Van Fossen, Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Mass.\u2022 What are your thoughts about the future/sustainability of health care and Medicare, and how is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Amazon going to address this?Timothy Liu, San Francisco Bay Area.\u2022 What does he see in the cryptocurrency market? Is it going to be the future? Is it going to replace the way we exchange value? Is it worth the hype? \u2014 Jason Lu, Shanghai\u2022 Where do you see the job market going, given the rise of Artificial Intelligence? \u2014 Ralph Humphrey, Hillside, N.J.\u2022 He\u2019s been technology averse in the past. What makes him so bullish on Apple? \u2014 Brian Hanks, Salt Lake City, Utah\u2022 How long he plans on doing this. \u2014Bill Skidmore, Omaha, Neb.\u2014 Elisa Mala(As Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting has grown over the years, it has become a three-day event. Friday is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shopping day, where shareholders can buy products from many Berkshire-owned companies.)Shareholders moseyed around CenturyLink Center, where the annual meeting takes place, perusing dozens of booths displaying goods \u2014 many created specifically for the event \u2014 from brands like Geico, NetJets and Coca-Cola.What was really on sale? All things Warren Buffett.Investors could snack on a Dilly Bar, the long-favored Popsicle of the Oracle of Omaha, for $1 or snag \u201cWarren and Charlie\u201d rubber ducks ($5 for the pair at the Oriental Trading Company booth).

{"Headline": "A Radical Artist Takes a Startling Turn Toward Love", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMSTERDAM \u2014 A painting by Marlene Dumas of her pregnant daughter Helena \u2014 her belly wide and full, her hands raised at the elbow, her feet splayed \u2014 stood nearly 10 feet tall in the South African artist\u2019s studio here two weeks ago.It was the night before a few dozen of Ms. Dumas\u2019s new paintings would be shipped to New York for her first solo exhibition there in eight years, and the artist was drinking white wine and still contemplating which works would ultimately end up in the show.Several other monumental nudes, both male and female, were propped against the walls in two light-filled studio spaces, representing what she calls \u201cstrange, mixed-up figures, not quite human.\u201d Interspersed among them were smaller oil paintings of bodily fragments: a lipstick-smeared mouth, a single breast and several renditions of two faces entwined in a kiss.Ms. Dumas, 64, walked through the space, its floor littered with half-squeezed paint tubes and its tables topped with art history books, museum postcards and photocopied images. \u201cThey are, in a sense, individual works,\u201d she said of the paintings, but they all have something to do with \u201cattraction, sensuality and desires.\u201dMs. Dumas is known for politically charged social art, often based on Polaroid snapshots, disturbing images clipped out of newspapers, or film stills appropriated from pornography. She has taken a radically new direction in this body of work: painting on significantly larger canvasses; using a more vibrant, chromatic palette; and stepping into mythological terrain.\u201cThese works are really about the human condition, about people in their most basic state: They\u2019re naked, they\u2019re pregnant, they\u2019re getting married, they\u2019re kissing, they\u2019re loving, they are erotic,\u201d Mr. Zwirner said a week later, as the works were being uncrated in New York. \u201cMaybe for me the most shocking reality around this new body of work is that they\u2019re extremely political by not being overtly political. To make it about us, about love, desire and eroticism \u2014 the themes that will maybe help us to get out of the political mess we got ourselves into \u2014 I find extremely powerful.\u201dThe Zwirner show is Ms. Dumas\u2019s first major solo presentation since her critically acclaimed 2014-15 retrospective, \u201cThe Image as Burden,\u201d presented at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, the Tate Modern in London and the Beyeler Foundation in Basel, Switzerland. She said it took months to shake off the psychological and emotional reverberations of co-curating the retrospective, which opened just after she\u2019d turned 60 and included artworks from the mid-1970s.For the retrospective, she had hoped to produce new artworks but found it utterly impossible. But then the Moroccan-Dutch writer Hafid Bouazza asked Ms. Dumas to contribute illustrations for a book of Dutch translations of \u201cVenus and Adonis,\u201d one of the Shakespeare\u2019s earliest works. It tells the tragic, sometimes funny, often erotic story of Venus\u2019 attempts to seduce Adonis, a handsome young mortal. He chooses instead to hunt and is killed.Ms. Dumas approached the project by reading Shakespeare in the English original and in Dutch translation (her native tongue is Afrikaans) as well as Ovid\u2019s version from \u201cThe Metamorphoses.\u201d She also explored historical depictions of Venus and Adonis from antiquity to the present.\u201cIt was difficult to decide how to go about it, because you had to think, \u2018what type of figure, what type of woman am I going to choose for this Venus?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIn the old paintings, she was mostly painted as these blonde, voluptuous women, and Shakespeare was writing about a kind of Mediterranean type.\u201dThe resulting images are black ink wash on various types of paper reduced to essential elements of form. In one image, Venus is voluptuous with long, possibly blonde hair. In another, she might be an African woman with dark curly hair. In yet another, she appears like a vampire, with hollowed out eyes, inspired by an Edvard Munch drawing.Ms. Dumas felt that the \u201cVenus and Adonis\u201d book illustrations could be an entry point into a new series of paintings, though she was at first uncertain. \u201cThen my daughter said, \u2018You always make your best paintings of me.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to paint you, I\u2019m scared, and a pregnant lady doesn\u2019t fit into this exhibition.\u2019 \u201dHelena, now 29, is one of the few models Ms. Dumas has ever allowed in the studio. \u201cI\u2019m not really interested in real people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sounds strange, I know, but it\u2019s because then I can\u2019t do with my figure what I want. It\u2019s more about states and emotions.\u201dNevertheless, she did begin a portrait of Helena from behind, standing tall in a strong, self-assured stance, which she named \u201cAmazon.\u201dLater, Ms. Dumas found an image of Inanna \u2014 the goddess of love, fertility and war from Sumerian mythology, who was associated with the planet Venus \u2014 depicted with wings and bird talons for feet. This was a starting point for another monumental nude, but because Helena was now pregnant and very much on the artist\u2019s mind, Ms. Dumas began to work her daughter\u2019s likeness into the image.Taking a sip of wine, Ms. Dumas mused, \u201cMy time is up, and I still haven\u2019t painted a Venus. Well, I have indeed, but she\u2019s pregnant, and she looks like my daughter.\u201dThe two quasi-portraits of Helena, \u201cAmazon\u201d and \u201cBirth,\u201d appear in the same room of the Zwirner exhibition.It is all very fitting, since Ms. Dumas\u2019s first grandchild, Eden, was born on April 28, the day the show opened. Luckily, Ms. Dumas had flown to New York to install the exhibit and returned to Amsterdam in time to be there with Helena for the birth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Market\u2019s Trump Test Is About to Get Real: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Will Trump\u2019s moves on Iran and trade push markets over the edge?\u2022 What\u2019s next for business after Eric Schneiderman?\u2022 D.E. Shaw grapples with an ousted executive who\u2019s fighting back.\u2022 What Rupert Murdoch will weigh if Comcast makes another bid for Fox assets.President Trump\u2019s antagonistic foreign policies have yet to cause serious losses in the stock market.But investors\u2019 stoicism could face greater tests in the coming weeks. They have to contend with the repercussions of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran and the increasing likelihood of a trade war with China and the European Union. And all this is happening at a time when a boom in corporate earnings, the chief driver of the stock market, appears to be cooling.Up until January, investors were willing to pay high valuations for stocks because they expected corporate earnings to accelerate this year. But the best may already be behind us. Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, on Monday wrote that analysts now believe that earnings growth for this year likely peaked in the first quarter (at 23 percent over last year\u2019s first quarter.) After such peaks, the stock market tends to remain weak for a while, she added.Investors likely won\u2019t have a big new jump in profits to look forward to. Earnings are expected to grow 10 percent next year, according to estimates compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s. Without sustained support from corporate earnings, investors may be more willing to sell stocks in response to geopolitical events.And in the coming weeks, there will be plenty of potential trade war triggers. The Trump administration could decide to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from a number of countries, including those in the European Union, when exemptions expire at the end of this month. Proposed tariffs on $50 billion of goods from China could also be imposed this month, and the White House could release details on a second batch of tariffs on $100 billion of Chinese products.Since neither the European Union nor China looks close to caving to Mr. Trump\u2019s threats, global trade tensions look set to escalate and a full-blown trade war is possible.Investors may continue to hang tight, of course. The stock market is flat for the year, not a bad performance for a period in which the underpinnings of the international economic order are under assault.But that support will most likely convince him that he is on the right track \u2013 and he will press on with his hard-edged international policies. But more than at any time in his presidency, he should not expect the stock market to tag along.\u2014 Peter EavisDisney reported its strongest quarterly results in two years. It beat Wall Street expectations for profit and revenue growth. But even that strong performance was shadowed by analyst concerns over maneuvering by Comcast to upend Disney\u2019s pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets.Robert Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, never mentioned Comcast and presented the Fox deal as a fait accompli. \u201cWe are confident that the assets that we are in the process of acquiring easily fit within our new structure once the deal is approved.\u201dMany analysts have recoiled at such a bid, which could leave Comcast with more than $170 billion in debt \u2014 a sum that would make it one of the largest corporate debtholders in American history. \u201cWe do not believe Comcast needs another media asset,\u201d Gregory Williams, a Cowen and Company analyst, wrote in a research note.Recently, he pushed himself to the forefront of the #MeToo movement, announcing a lawsuit against the company once run by the former filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of decades of sexual misconduct. \u201cWe have never seen anything as despicable as what we\u2019ve seen right here,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said at the time.Mr. Schneiderman has denied the women\u2019s allegations.The NYT\u2019s Mark Landler reports:\u201cPresident Trump told President Emmanuel Macron of France on Tuesday morning that he plans to announce the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, according to a person briefed on the conversation.\u201d\u201cThe United States is preparing to reinstate all sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord \u2014 and impose additional economic penalties as well, the person said.\u201dHere\u2019s what Joe Papa, the company\u2019s C.E.O., said:\u201cThe Bausch name embodies the rich history of innovation, fortitude and dedication to patient health dating back to when J.J. Bausch opened his first optical goods shop more than 165 years ago. These qualities form the foundation of who we are today as we continue to build an innovative company striving to improve the health of patients globally.\u201d \u2014 Michael de la MercedSo where does the deal stack up among big acquisitions? Here\u2019s a breakdown courtesy of Dealogic:\u2022 It is the biggest deal announced this year, beating Cigna\u2019s $55 billion acquisition of Express Scripts.\u2022 It is not just the largest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company, but the biggest by a Japanese company. The $63 billion price tag just barely tops the $62.88 billion Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group paid for UFJ Holdings in 2005.The former acting attorney general has returned to King & Spalding as a partner in its special matters team and will head up in the firm\u2019s investigations group, according to a news release.Ms. Yates began her career at King & Spalding before spending 27 years at the Justice Department. She served as deputy attorney general under President Barack Obama. The Trump administration asked her to stay on as acting attorney general until Jeff Sessions was confirmed to be attorney general.Ms. Yates worked at King & Spalding as a civil litigation associate from 1986 to 1989.The firm\u2019s bullying and threats against me over the last week, however, have revealed that the firm is so concerned with creating the appearance of supporting women that it is willing to cast false aspersions on me (and perpetuate false aspersions cast by others) and make me a scapegoat with a proverbial hanging in the town square.\u2022 Mr. Murdoch already spurned a Comcast offer 16 percent higher than what Disney\u2019s, saying regulators were more likely to block it. (Comcast would move again only if AT&T gets its Time Warner deal.)\u2022 He prefers receiving stock, as he would from Disney, because that\u2019s a tax-free transaction.The context: Comcast is also making life difficult for Mr. Murdoch and Disney by challenging Fox\u2019s bid for full ownership of Sky, the British satellite broadcaster.\u201cA number of people also requested that I distill it down to its essential concepts in a 30-minute animation, like I did with my Economic Principles in How the Economic Machine Works. So I\u2019ve done that in an 8 episode ultra mini-series adventure called \u2018Principles for Success,\u2019 which I\u2019m releasing today\u201dMore from Andrew:Whether they have been dug by a company\u2019s experienced hand, the good will of its customers or the heavy machinery of governmental regulation, moats remain a formidable form of protection, even from the most willing of raiders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Alex Strangelove\u2019: Boy Meets Boy. Awkwardness Ensues.", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingThe writer-director Craig Johnson first came to my attention with \u201cThe Skeleton Twins\u201d (2014), his empathetic dramedy about dysfunctional siblings played by the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alums Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader. Mr. Johnson followed the well-received \u201cSkeleton Twins\u201d with \u201cWilson,\u201d an acerbic 2017 comedy adapted from a graphic novel by Daniel Clowes. His latest picture, \u201cAlex Strangelove,\u201d debuts on Netflix on June 8.\u201cAlex Strangelove\u201d was written by Mr. Johnson, and like \u201cSkeleton Twins,\u201d seems to have an autobiographical element. The title character, Alex Truelove, is a popular high schooler contending with great confusion about his sexual orientation. (He\u2019s played by Daniel Doheny, who bears a resemblance to Mr. Hader \u2014 I got the feeling that Mr. Johnson was temporally retrofitting his screen surrogates.) Alex has a wonderful friend, and eventually girlfriend, in Claire (Madeline Weinstein), with whom he makes internet videos and enlists in light cosplay for school social events. But he can\u2019t bring himself to close any kind of sexual deal with Claire. And once he meets a curly haired teenage Adonis, Elliott (Antonio Marziale), he starts to figure out why.While Mr. Johnson\u2019s movie is not nearly as Hollywood-slick as \u201cLove, Simon,\u201d the kids in \u201cAlex Strangelove\u201d inhabit a comfortable, bright, almost candy-colored world. From the inventive costumes Alex and Claire concoct for their party appearances to the Brooklyn nightclub with a behind-the-stage window looking out on an elevated train track, their environment and its trappings are practically idyllic, which is nice, generally, and especially when you\u2019re working out your sexuality.But \u201cAlex\u201d is an altogether more raucous picture than the decorous \u201cSimon.\u201d It\u2019s upfront in its treatment of teenage sexuality, with a lot of frank dialogue (although the picture sometimes suffers from the common misconception that all high schoolers talk like Algonquin Round Table quipsters). There are a few gross-out jokes that are actually funny, like the one involving projectile-vomited gummy candies.\u201cAlex Strangelove\u201d is witty, compassionate and enjoyable throughout; a charming movie and in many respects an enlightened one. There\u2019s something a little disquieting about it, though. This is the third film I\u2019ve seen in less than a year in which a young white male protagonist struggling with his sexuality walks all over a young woman\u2019s feelings on his way to self-definition. I don\u2019t blame the individual filmmakers for creating narratives of their own choosing, but I do think the constant repetition of this theme could do with some shaking up.The other film, \u201cBeach Rats,\u201d an independent picture written and directed by Eliza Hittman and now available for rental on Amazon Video, is not a comedy. Its main character, Frankie, is a working-class kid in Brooklyn who likes to hang out, smoke weed, and do other young mook stuff with his young mook friends.In the late hours, he sits in front of his computer and tentatively arranges sexual liaisons with men, almost always older ones. He\u2019s desperate both to hide these liaisons from his friends and deny to himself what they mean. One of his tactics is to take up with Simone, a girl who, on meeting Frankie, immediately challenges him: \u201cSo what\u2019s your idea of romance?\u201d He cruelly rebuffs her after taking her to his home, but later, trying to save face, pursues her again.\u201cBeach Rats\u201d takes place in a world very far from \u201cAlex\u201d and \u201cSimon.\u201d It is a movie about perpetual uneasiness. The threat of physical or emotional violence is nearly constant.In \u201cManhunt,\u201d a lawyer framed for a woman\u2019s murder seeks to clear his name and uncovers a byzantine network of crime. It harks back in its themes to Mr. Woo\u2019s groundbreaking 1990s Hong Kong films. (The movie itself is a loose remake of a 1976 Japanese picture of the same name.)Shot with a RED camera (the cinematographer is Takuro Ishizaka), \u201cManhunt\u201d lends digital sheen to the classic Woo fist-and-gun battles that so thrilled us in the likes of \u201cThe Killer\u201d and \u201cHard Boiled.\u201d The outlandish plot is a ridiculous pleasure, particularly once the protagonist comes into the sights of a couple of female assassins (one of whom is played by Angeles Woo, the director\u2019s daughter).One hesitates to sound like Jeff Daniels\u2019s pompous character in \u201cThe Squid and the Whale\u201d and categorize \u201cManhunt\u201d as \u201cminor Woo,\u201d but it\u2019s undeniable that \u201cManhunt\u201d delivers first-rate cinematic technique while skimping on substantial emotional investment. It\u2019s still a great deal of fun. It\u2019s a shame that Netflix did not see fit to promote it more aggressively than it did (that is, promote it at all), but we\u2019re all here now and everyone\u2019s O.K.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.D.P.R., a New Privacy Law, Makes Europe World\u2019s Leading Tech Watchdog", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll are acting because the European Union on Friday enacts the world\u2019s toughest rules to protect people\u2019s online data. And with the internet\u2019s borderless nature, the regulations are set to have an outsize impact far beyond Europe.Brazil, Japan and South Korea are set to follow Europe\u2019s lead, with some having already passed similar data protection laws. European officials are encouraging copycats by tying data protection to some trade deals and arguing that a unified global approach is the only way to crimp Silicon Valley\u2019s power.\u201cWe want to achieve the same level of restrictions that you have in Europe,\u201d said Luiz Fernando Martins Castro, a lawyer based in S\u00e3o Paulo who advises the Brazilian government on internet policy. Mr. Castro said Europe was \u201cpushing the matter and making people realize that we have to go forward.\u201dEurope is determined to cement its role as the world\u2019s foremost tech watchdog \u2014 and the region is only getting started. Authorities in Brussels and in the European Union\u2019s 28 member countries are also setting the bar for stricter enforcement of antitrust laws against tech behemoths and are paving the way for tougher tax policies on the companies.\u201cThe E.U. is more advanced than the U.S. in protecting consumer privacy, and what happens there could be a harbinger of the future,\u201d said Michael Kearns, a computer science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who has studied the data collection techniques of companies including Facebook and Google.Businesses must also more clearly detail how someone\u2019s data is being handled, while clearing a higher bar to target advertising using personal information. Companies face fines if they do not comply, with tech giants risking penalties greater than $1 billion. Privacy groups preparing class action-style complaints under the new law may put even more legal pressure on companies.European authorities have actively encouraged other countries to adopt similar laws to G.D.P.R. Officials have been dispatched around the world to preach the tougher rules. Data protections are becoming part of trade deals, with the region ready to limit access to its market of 500 million consumers if countries do not rise to meet Europe\u2019s standards.\u201cIf we can export this to the world, I will be happy,\u201d said Vera Jourova, the European commissioner in charge of consumer protection and privacy who helped draft G.D.P.R. She said she planned to travel to Japan and South Korea in the next few weeks for talks about data protection. Regulating technology, she added, is a \u201cglobal challenge.\u201dBrazil has an incentive to draft tougher privacy laws: One provision of G.D.P.R. limits the data that companies can transfer outside the European Union unless that data goes to a country that meets Europe\u2019s standards.\u201cMany countries are interested in signing a trade agreement with the European Union, and then privacy becomes an important precondition,\u201d said Mr. Buttarelli.Europe\u2019s fingerprints can be seen elsewhere in the world, too. Japan last year passed a data protection law creating a new independent online privacy board, and Tokyo and Brussels are finalizing the details of a data transfer deal. South Korea is considering new privacy rules, while Israel has adopted updated requirements for disclosures of data breaches \u2014 both share elements with the European rules.Europe\u2019s influence is not going unnoticed by America\u2019s tech giants, which have long complained that Brussels unfairly focuses on them.The new privacy rules are part of a \u201cstrong European tradition\u201d of policing industries to protect the environment or public health, even if it does \u201cconstrain business,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top antitrust official.To meet G.D.P.R.\u2019s requirements, Facebook and Google have deployed large teams to overhaul how they give users access to their own privacy settings and to redesign certain products that may have sucked up too much user data. Facebook said it had roughly 1,000 people working on the initiative globally, including engineers, product managers and lawyers.\u201cIn the absence of another approach, it\u2019s easier for other markets to follow what Europe has done,\u201d said Mr. Garfield.Whether Europe\u2019s tough approach is actually crimping the global tech giants is unclear. The region\u2019s regulators have hit American companies with hefty fines over antitrust violations, the mishandling of user data and the payment of taxes, but Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook have continued to grow and add customers.Challenges remain over how G.D.P.R. will be enforced. National regulators across Europe will be charged with policing the regulations, but many have woefully fewer resources than the companies they will be overseeing.Even if Europe persuades other countries to adopt its policies, it will be hard to ensure the laws work, said Omer Tene, a vice president at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a trade group that tracks global privacy regulation.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have rules on the books,\u201d said Mr. Tene. \u201cIt\u2019s quite another thing to implement these rules on the ground.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s a likable memoir of how Jay and Mark Duplass blazed their idiosyncratic trail, and an inspiring how-to guide for anyone who might wish to follow it.Sure, there are also parts that seem extraneous or simply don\u2019t work, but the Duplasses never pretend to be masters of their craft. As they write in the book: \u201cIt seems that people like the Coen brothers have a specific vision of what their movies will look like from the moment they begin writing them, and then somehow are able to realize that vision and make those movies, for the most part, inspired and impeccably amazing. We, however, are not the Coen brothers.\u201dIn episodic chapters, the Duplasses recount their upbringing in Metairie, La., and boyhood rites of passage like getting cable TV and a video camera to shoot their first movies. There\u2019s a refreshing unpretentiousness to these sections: The brothers are unabashed fans of kitsch like \u201cThe Karate Kid Part II\u201d and the soft-rock duo Air Supply, and their close-knit kinship turns poignant when Jay has an emotional breakdown as a student at the University of Texas at Austin and Mark, still in high school, travels there to take care of him.Though their early, self-financed foray into grown-up moviemaking is a mediocre \u201cRocky\u201d knockoff called \u201cVince Del Rio,\u201d the brothers eventually earn acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival: first, in 2003, with a $3 short film called \u201cThis Is John,\u201d and then, in 2005, with \u201cThe Puffy Chair,\u201d a relationship road-trip feature.Initially, the Duplasses seem to be living the fantasy of every indie filmmaker: \u201cBuyers, agents, managers, producers and studio executives were all swarming us,\u201d they write. But they quickly realize that these industry big shots are interested in developing other ideas with them, not in acquiring the movie the Duplasses made using $10,000 borrowed from their parents. \u201cIn short,\u201d they write, \u201cwe seemed to be in demand, but we couldn\u2019t figure out how to actually make money.\u201dIt takes many months for the brothers to receive a legitimate offer for \u201cThe Puffy Chair,\u201d and while they are eager to accept it, for the amount of money alone, they somehow find the fortitude to resist, and end up agreeing to a different deal \u2014 one that provides no money up front but includes distribution from an upstart DVD-by-mail company called Netflix. It\u2019s a valuable lesson in patience that has continued to pay dividends for the Duplasses, who signed a four-picture deal with Netflix earlier this year.While I appreciated the brothers\u2019 honest tales of dealing with anxiety, filial conflict and failing equipment during their collaborations, I was less taken with a chapter in which they reproduce an early draft of one of their unfilmed story ideas, along with Jay\u2019s handwritten notes, though readers\u2019 interest in this sort of paraphernalia may vary.Other sections, in which they compile and consolidate lists of their Top 10 films of all time, or imagine elaborate back stories for strangers they see at airports, may seem charming to devoted fans but felt like filler to me.More worrisome were passages in which the brothers, for all of their enthusiasm and desire to get others to participate in cinema, seem unaware of their inherent privilege as white men from a comfortable background, and who, as siblings working together, have an irresistible gimmick.It\u2019s probably not especially helpful for struggling, financially strapped young filmmakers at the start of their careers to be told to buy a house as soon as possible and pay off the mortgage by renting out bedrooms to creative pals. And the brothers\u2019 advice to invest in the stock market \u2014 the Duplasses say they bought \u201ca slew of shares\u201d of Netflix in 2005 \u2014 isn\u2019t practical unless you possess a trust fund or a time machine.Still, it\u2019s hard not to root for the Duplasses in moments like the one when their sales agent tells them they\u2019re not allowed to attend the Sundance after-party for their film \u201cBaghead,\u201d lest it appear that they\u2019re not engaged in heated efforts to get the movie sold.In another passage, they find themselves fighting with studio executives who want them to reshoot a scene from \u201cCyrus,\u201d because they feel the apartment of its lead character \u2014 a depressed divorc\u00e9 \u2014 needs more throw pillows. After getting uncharacteristically loud and standing their ground, the brothers win the day. \u201cFrom that moment forward,\u201d the Duplasses write, \u201cthey pretty much let us do our thing. Which was a wonderful and terrible thing in the end.\u201dDave Itzkoff is a culture reporter at The Times.

{"Headline": "As Disney Moves Forward With Fox, Comcast Continues Plotting", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 As empires hang in the balance, two hardened commanders engage in tug of war on an epic scale.It could be the plot of a summer blockbuster \u2014 the latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie, perhaps. Instead, it may soon play out in real life, with Comcast, led by Brian L. Roberts, trying to pry the bulk of 21st Century Fox away from Disney and its chief executive, Robert A. Iger. \u201cIt will be a bloody battle,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst.But Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, thinks it has a new opening.Cue the battle royale.Here is what you need to know as the tension mounts.How serious is Comcast about a potential hostile bid?At the same time, it\u2019s possible nothing comes of that maneuvering. Comcast, which declined to comment, is waiting for the outcome of the AT&T case to make up its mind.Exactly what are the Fox assets?Why does Comcast want the Fox assets so badly?It boils down to this: Comcast, like Disney, wants to add bulk as a counterattack against Netflix and other tech giants that have aggressively moved into the entertainment business.\u201cThere will only be a handful of global, scale players,\u201d Todd Juenger, an analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a research report on May 9. \u201cWe think Disney and Comcast increasingly view Fox as the seminal defining point, and this the moment in time, in determining which company ascends to that role.\u201dNBCUniversal has been white hot \u2014 revenue soared 21 percent in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier \u2014 and its portfolio includes the fastest-growing cable network (MSNBC) and the No. 1 cable entertainment network (USA). In the longer term, however, NBCUniversal likely needs a bigger content war chest to compete against Netflix, Amazon, Apple and their ilk.How is Disney likely to respond to a Comcast bid?Comcast has some deal baggage. A 2015 attempt to buy Time Warner Cable collapsed under pressure from regulators, who found that the combined company would have had the power and incentive to inhibit the future of streaming video.If the AT&T deal goes through, does that mean easy regulatory sailing for a potential Comcast-Fox union?No. Timothy Horan, an analyst at Oppenheimer who has expressed support for a Comcast move on Fox, wrote in a May 9 research note that approval for the AT&T deal would help open a regulatory path but that Comcast would still face a \u201cdifficult\u201d road.Antitrust experts note that Comcast-Fox would have more overlapping businesses than AT&T-Time Warner. Comcast-Fox would also control more of the overall entertainment supply chain \u2014 \u201ca content and distribution superpower like we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d as Mr. Nathanson put it in a phone interview.Comcast has a bigger broadband business than AT&T, which could raise government concerns that Comcast could use that power to hurt competitors, especially as the internet grows in importance as a video pipe, some analysts say.Comcast shares have dropped 24 percent since late January. Does the apparent lack of shareholder support for a Fox bid mean Comcast will back off?No. Comcast does not need shareholder approval for a cash offer. Moreover, Comcast executives probably see the decline as temporary and not entirely related to the hostile bid rumblings. Comcast\u2019s cable competitor Charter has seen its shares decline about 28 percent over the same period.Does Comcast have the money to make a hostile bid?The company would borrow to make a cash offer, and banks are willing. Comcast has healthy financials.It would, however, mean taking on an amount of debt \u2014 at least $164 billion \u2014 that Moody\u2019s last week called \u201cstaggering\u201d and said would probably imperil Comcast\u2019s A3 credit rating.\u201cThat sounds like a nearly impossible level of debt to sustain,\u201d Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research, wrote in a recent report. But he argued that it was not as scary upon a closer look. Given Fox synergies and cash flow, \u201cNet debt by the end of 2020 would drop to below $130 billion \u2014 essentially in line with a combined AT&T Time Warner.\u201dWhere does this leave Fox shareholders?In the catbird seat. Even if Disney ultimately wins \u2014 as Mr. Nathanson predicts \u2014 Comcast can drive up the price.He added, \u201cOur directors, though, of course, are aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sure, you might not trip on the charging cable every time you get up but it happens \u2014 and it\u2019s worth investing in a product that\u2019s up to the task.\u201cAlmost every device we use on a daily basis needs a cable to charge, so investing in a cable that\u2019ll last is a good idea,\u201d said Nick Guy, a senior staff writer at Wirecutter. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that you don\u2019t have to go overboard and spend too much money though.\u201dAnother reason to buy one? Your friends and anyone who comes into your home will thank you (seriously)! No one will need to crouch in a corner or sit on the floor while waiting for their phone to charge with the shortest cable alive (we\u2019re looking at you standard charging cables). It\u2019s a big people-pleaser and life-enhancer, and for whatever reason, relays to your friends that you\u2019re somewhat of a capable adult who buys long-lasting and durable tech products (at least that\u2019s what I tell myself).Time and time again, Mr. Guy finds that Anker makes winning charging cables. His reasoning for choosing Anker is clear: The company makes solid, lasting products that work well \u2014 both inside and out. (Wirecutter even had an electrical engineer tear apart lightning and micro-USB cables to make sure they were up to par.) While we stand by the recommendation, we\u2019ll also include other products that Wirecutter called out as the best to choose from.The prices for these cables are budget-friendly and worth it, if you\u2019re looking for something based on utility and not looks.\u201cAnker\u2019s standard PowerLine cables are more or less identical on the inside to its more expensive premium cables,\u201d said Mr. Guy. \u201cThose are only worth it if you want a nylon-braided exterior or lifetime warranty.\u201dDo yourself a favor and don\u2019t opt for a more super-expensive or fancy branded cable. It won\u2019t be worth it when it eventually falls apart. Walk the line between budget-friendly and durability, and you\u2019ll be just fine.Advertisement"}

It did warn that its financial results may be affected, depending on the outcome of the investigation.The announcement helped drive Symantec\u2019s shares down by a third in Friday\u2019s trading.The fact that the audit committee is involved and that Symantec said its annual financial filing might now be delayed, suggests the company\u2019s book-keeping is under the spotlight.

{"Headline": "Where Did Ireland Go? Abortion Vote Stuns Those on Both Sides", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBLIN \u2014 Some were joyous. Others were devastated. But most of all, in the hours after Irish voters swept away a ban on abortion, many were simply astonished.However they felt about the result of the referendum, they were witnessing, they knew, the culmination of a fundamental shift in Irish society \u2014 and one that has come about with stunning speed.In a remarkably compact span of time, the country has gone from being a bastion of social conservatism in the West to a place that wholeheartedly embraces positions that would have been unthinkable just a generation ago.The culture of silence and deference to religious authority that long dominated Ireland is gone. The country that has emerged is an unlikely leader of liberal values.\u201cIreland has changed 180 degrees on everything,\u201d said Adam Tyrrell, 24, struggling to take it all in as he smoked a cigarette outside a pub and watched the street fill up with crowds of cheering yes supporters after the results were announced.The nation of 4.8 million people has experienced some of the fastest social and economic change in the world. In a matter of 30 years, Ireland has gone from being a poor and deeply Roman Catholic country to one that is seeing high growth rates and has installed a gay man as prime minister.Long associated with exporting cheap labor, it has accepted a sizable number of immigrants and is home to foreign tech companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook.In 2015, in another popular vote, Ireland approved same-sex marriage by a landslide.\u201cIreland has gone from criminalizing gays, having just one television channel and priests running the show, to now a liberal, European society,\u201d said Mark Neiland, a business owner in his 60s.When he was growing up, Mr. Neiland recalled, Irish families had to decide between cooking dinner on the stove or watching television because electricity was scarce. \u201cIreland was a really poor country,\u201d he said.When Mr. Neiland graduated from high school, he said, every classmate, including him, left for the United States, Canada or Australia.\u201cI would never think of leaving this place for America now,\u201d he said.While the landslide result of the abortion referendum may have surprised much of the world, many Irish were less shocked. They have seen the changes in the country building over time.Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who is half Indian, spoke of a \u201cquiet revolution that has been taking place in Ireland over the last couple of decades.\u201dIreland\u2019s impoverished past, as well as the outsize role of the Catholic Church, had set it apart from much of the rest of Europe. Many saw the referendum as the final step in aligning the country with the rest of the continent.The vote, said Mr. Tyrrell, \u201ccements us as a progressive nation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to change the optics of how people view us after these two landslide victories,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of Ireland.\u201dAlan Barrett, director of the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin, said the results of the abortion referendum indicated a \u201cconvergence with European norms.\u201d\u201cIf you take the standard mainstream views in continental Europe, Ireland was the outlier, and it was always economically behind Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the Catholic Church being moved aside, you\u2019ve got the Irish accumulating their values and views the same way that the French, the Germans or the British get theirs.\u201dThere are many factors behind Ireland\u2019s dramatic makeover. The most dominant reason is the collapse of the Catholic Church\u2019s influence in most spheres of Irish life. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to know that Ireland has been secularizing for a long time,\u201d said Diane Negra, a professor of cultural studies at University College Dublin.The credibility of the church has been battered by a string of scandals, some involving pedophile priests and the cover-up of their crimes.Another major factor driving the change: an economic transformation.As recently as the 1980s, Ireland was a very different place.With a weak economy in that decade, many young Irish left the country to look for jobs abroad, leaving behind an older, more conservative population that was loyal to the church. It was during this period that Ireland voted for restrictive rules on abortion and marriage.In 1983, Ireland voted in favor of the Eighth Amendment in the Constitution, which effectively banned abortion \u2014 the amendment that the Irish voted to repeal on Friday. Three years later, the Irish rejected a proposed amendment to remove a ban on divorce.Attitudes shifted notably in the 1990s with the first revelations of the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, and the beginning of an economic boom.From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, Ireland was proclaimed the \u201cCeltic Tiger.\u201d The decade of prosperity attracted multinationals, increased living standards and brought back Irish expatriates who carried with them new ideas and values.The economy soured for a few years, but then recovered. Last year, Ireland posted a 7.8 percent growth rate, the highest in the European Union \u2014 though many Irish say that inequality has also risen.Ireland\u2019s decision to make secondary schools free improved education, and the introduction of contraception significantly reduced the number of children per family. That helped more women enter the paid work force.Anthony Fannin, 70, a retired engineer, said the economic boom \u201cgave self-confidence to the Irish that they had lacked.\u201d\u201cThey felt equal to the rest of the world, that they could get a share of the luxuries of life,\u201d he said.Pointing to the church sex abuse scandals, he said, Ireland\u2019s changing fortunes also meant that \u201cinstead of people bowing their heads whenever a priest passed by, they could actually stand up and say, \u2018Hang on, Father, what happened back then?\u2019\u201dLuke Hussey, 25, who comes from a working-class family, said his family had jumped into the middle class almost overnight during the boom, buying a car and going on vacations to Spain.\u201cIt was weird, almost perverse that we were now a middle-class family,\u201d he said.It was during the boom years, in 1993, that Ireland decriminalized homosexuality. Two years later, the country finally voted to allow divorce.The referendum on abortion, many Irish said, was the final crack in the foundation of the old Ireland.The debate in the days and months before the referendum released, for some, decades of pent-up emotions and anger against the church. Mr. Barrett described it as \u201cnational therapy.\u201d The referendum also forced a national debate on subjects that were long taboo, especially around sex.\u201cIreland had a culture of silence and that\u2019s broken now,\u201d Mr. Tyrrell said.\u201cTo be Irish now means to be open,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re sick of being quiet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That capped a remarkable 10-month run for the cryptocurrency, which traded below $1,150 on Feb. 22, 2017.Since mid-December, the price of bitcoin has retreated. It bottomed out below $6,000 in early February and is currently down more 50 percent from its high.The researchers write:\u201cThe advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics.\u201d\u201cThis one-sided speculative demand came to an end when the futures for bitcoin started trading on the CME on December 17. Although the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) had opened a futures market a week earlier on December 10, trading was thin until the CME joined the market. Indeed, the average daily trading volume the month after the CME issued futures was approximately six times larger than when only the CBOE offered these derivatives.\u201dShares of Apple have risen nearly 16 percent, including a 1.9 percent gain on Monday, the past six sessions. That rally has pushed the iPhone maker\u2019s market value back above $900 billion and just $80 billion shy of $1 trillion.Apple\u2019s shares had stumbled late last month as investors grew increasingly concerned that sales of iPhone\u2019s would disappoint. But revenue from the iPhone proved stronger than feared, and the company announced a $100 billion buyback plan.Elliott Management offered on Monday to buy Athenahealth for $160 a share, or $6.5 billion.The offer was made in a letter Elliott sent to the board of the health care software company. The activist hedge fund led by Paul Singer also said it may be \u201cable to substantially improve the proposed price with additional, private diligence.\u201dIn Monday\u2019s letter, Elliott said: \u201cAthenahealth\u2019s potential will never be realized without the kind of operational change that the company seems unable to deliver.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, we are faced now with the stark reality that Athenahealth as a public-company investment, despite all of its promise, has not worked for many years, is not working today and will not work in the future. Given Athenahealth\u2019s potential, this reality is deeply frustrating, but the fact remains that Athenahealth as a public company has not made the changes necessary to enable it to grow as it should and to create the kind of value its shareholders deserve.\u201dElliott said it approached Athenahealth about the company going private in November.Citigroup has a market value of $175 billion, so ValueAct owns about 0.7 percent of Citigroup.\u201cThe letter doesn\u2019t call for any significant strategic changes, though it does suggest the bank could increase its plan to return cash to shareholders to about $50 billion from $40 billion,\u201d The WSJ reports, citing ValueAct\u2019s letter to its investors.Saturday was the day for the \u201cWoodstock of capitalism\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting, and a celebration of Warren Buffett \u2014 and Andrew joined shareholders, analysts and other journalists seeking to ask the Oracle of Omaha about virtually anything.Andrew has more from the meeting: Shareholders applauded a question \u2014 which they rarely do \u2014 that was critical of Berkshire\u2019s ownership of Wells Fargo. And Mr. Buffett\u2019s response to a gun question and a critique of Elon Musk caused lots of chatter.\u2022 Mr. Buffett is sticking with Wells Fargo despite its current troubles, and said that its current C.E.O., Tim Sloan, \u201cis correcting mistakes made by other people.\u201d\u2022 He loves Apple \u2014 but wants the company, of which Berkshire owns about 5 percent, to keep buying back shares.

The investment company of Europe\u2019s billionaire Reimann family has spent more than $30 billion building a coffee empire by acquiring assets such as Keurig Green Mountain and Peet\u2019s.Then there was this, from the NYT:In 2016, Mr. Cohen went so far as to dabble in financial engineering. He spoke to investors about pooling distressed loans that financed taxi medallion purchases, repackaging them and selling them to investors, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions.

{"Headline": "Industrial Revolutions Are Political Wrecking Balls", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before.Compared with previous industrial revolutions, Schwab continued,the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.First Schwab looked at the bright side:The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.Schwab then turned his attention to the downside. Many \u201cworkers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate,\u201d he said, and the \u201cmiddle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.\u201dIn this modern migration, smartphone maps, global positioning apps, social media and WhatsApp have become essential tools. Migrants depend on them to post real-time updates about routes, arrests, border guard movements and transport, as well as places to stay and prices, all the while keeping in touch with family and friends.Long before this, Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, described the link between immigration and technology in a 2003 paper, \u201cPatterns and Processes of International Migration in the 21st Century\u201d:The same processes of economic globalization that create mobile populations in developing regions, and which generate a demand for their services in global cities, also create links of transportation, communication, as well as politics and culture, to make the international movement of people cheaper, quicker, and easier.There are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses. In politics, however, the emphasis has often been on the negative.With remarkable understatement, Schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences:As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor.The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second. The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations \u2014 a factor of about 200,000 difference \u2014 and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second.In point of fact, the use of robots \u2014 and of other methods of replacing workers with machines \u2014 has been growing in every advanced economy, particularly in Europe.The authors note that \u201cboth technology and trade seem to drive structural changes which are consequential for voting behavior.\u201d\u201cJob losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., said by email:In fact, some of the places where Trump made the biggest gains relative to McCain or Romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs.Hostile voter reaction to automation, according to three scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University \u2014 Carl Benedikt Frey, Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen \u2014 was crucial to Trump\u2019s victory.Support for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. Other things equal, a counterfactual analysis shows that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the Hillary Clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College.Along similar lines, Frank Levy, also an economist at M.I.T., wrote in a December 2017 paper:AI (artificial intelligence) is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical (\u2018mid-skilled\u2019) jobs into lower wage work. The result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off-shored services.On balance, near-term AI will have the greatest effect on blue collar work, clerical work and other mid-skilled occupations. Given globalization\u2019s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term AI and globalization replace many of the same jobs.Take the case of truck drivers. Driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines, and, according to Levy, \u201cthere should be a sizable number of fully automated U.S. port facilities, mines and other industrial facilities\u201d by 2024. With these developments, he estimated, there will be 76,000 fewer truck driving jobs in 2024 than the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently projects.Assessing the full range of employment, West observes thatRobots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drones and the Internet of Things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods. For millions who work in occupations like food service, retail sales and truck driving, machines are replacing their jobs.Levy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace,the stock of robots in the U.S. would be 105,000 higher in 2024 than in 2014. If I conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators, the 105,000 additional robots would result in 210,000 fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in 2024 than otherwise would have been the case.Where do these displaced workers look for a way to make a living? Levy\u2019s answer is: farther down the ladder:AI\u2019s near-term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in a slowly growing number of persons moving from mid-skilled jobs into lower wage workinto such fields as food preparation and serving, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services.For many men, moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to a job in a fast-food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow. (Not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women\u2019s and reproductive rights movements.)Levy points out that the cuts resulting from A.I. and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term, but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers:Job losses will appear as accelerating trends. Over time, trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories. Increased numbers of people will be working side-by-side with robots. When a media story describes an AI-induced layoff in occupation, other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk. These developments will occur against a backdrop of monopoly-like firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook.What is the political significance of the A.I.-driven changes in the work force? They are the grist for the populist mill.Levy writes:A populist politician who campaigned on AI-induced job loss would start with ready-made definitions of the \"people\u201d and the \u201celite\u201d based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the 2016 presidential election. This politician also would have a ready-made example of disrespect: the set of highly educated coastal \u201celites\u201d who make a very good living developing robots to put \u201cthe people\u201d out of work.IT-driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising. Because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth, IT advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial.The favorable view, according to Kurz, masks thedark side: by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power, IT innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth.While operating legally \u2014 indeed with the full support of the legal system \u2014 contemporary corporate technology leaders, including Brin, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs (who died in 2011) and Mark Zuckerberg, accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth. According to Kurz:Once an IT monopoly is established, it endows the company with the advantage of first mover. A combination of associated factors \u2014 additional patents, intellectual-property rights, trade secrets, falling computing and storage costs, and decreasing network user costs \u2014 then enable the company to consolidate market power, raise barriers to competition, and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power. IT networks endow a market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly. Using their market power, such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position, often by purchasing competing firms.According to Kurz, the concentration of economic power, and with it political power, in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences:Monopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades, from near zero in the early 1980s to $2.1 trillion \u2014 equivalent to 23 percent of total US corporate income \u2014 in 2015. During the same period, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by 23 percentage points.The result is a cascading effect causedboth by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor. It has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers, workers, and suppliers. And it has had a profoundly negative impact on lower-skill workers, in particular.The history of automation \u2014 and how the U.S. economy has handled it over the last several decades \u2014 suggests that even if AI is similar to previous waves of automation, that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation.Furman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs:The concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable. The traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience.Instead, Furman contends that the problem lies in \u201cthe process of turnover,\u201d which \u201ccould lead to sustained periods of time with a large fraction of people not working.\u201d In the short run,not all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by AI. Moreover, this \u201cshort run\u201d could last for decades and, in fact, the economy could be in a series of \u201cshort runs\u201d for even longer.A short run that lasts for decades \u2014 or a series of short runs that last even longer \u2014 would seem to warrant grave alarm.Of all the jobs in the UK, a greater proportion of those held by women compared to men are likely to be technically automatable, and women make up a smaller proportion of people in high-skill occupations that are resilient to automation or complemented by technology.Among liberal-leaning economists and public policy experts, there is a loose consensus on what should be done to manage the adverse consequences of both automation and trade.Furman lists some initiatives:expanding education and training so more people have skills that complement and benefit from innovations, increasing the progressivity of the tax system to make sure that everyone shares in the overall benefits of the economy, and expanding institutional support for higher wages, including a higher minimum wage and stronger collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice.Other related proposals include a major increase in the earned-income tax credit, a focus on job-specific training at community colleges, portable pensions, liberalization of occupational licensing and, more controversially, the creation of a universal basic income.These proposals \u2014 some underwhelming or undoable \u2014 find strong support among Democratic elected officials.Still, opposition from Republicans is adamant \u2014 not only do they oppose increased domestic spending, but it appears to be in the political interests of the party to exacerbate the negative consequences of automation and free trade.David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., examined the political consequences in congressional districts hurt by increased trade with China and found a significant increase in the election of very conservative Republicans.Using the same techniques to examine the 2016 election, Autor calculated that if the post-2000 increase in China trade had been half as large as it in fact was, Hillary Clinton would have won majorities in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That would have been enough to make her the victor in the Electoral College, as the accompanying graphic shows. There is also a dose effect.Rather than directly opposing free trade policies, individuals in import-exposed communities tend to target scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities. This drives support for right-wing candidates, as they compete electorally by targeting out-groups.The authors conclude that in areas affected by trade, the scapegoating of immigrants \u201ctakes place across the board and is not limited to manufacturing workers.\u201dIn other words, job losses and plant closings are a political gold mine for the Republican Party, crucial to their victories in House and presidential races and almost certainly in Senate, gubernatorial and state legislative races as well.The determination of the Trump wing of the Republican Party to profiteer on technologically driven economic and cultural upheaval \u2014 and the success of this strategy to date \u2014 suggests that the party will continue on its path. For this reason and many others, it is critically important that Democrats develop a more far-reaching understanding of the disruptive, technologically fueled economic and cultural forces that are now shaping American politics \u2014 if they intend to steer the country in a more constructive direction, that is.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 What will Apple do with all that cash?\u2022 What happens after the imported metal tariff delay?\u2022 Why C.E.O.s might need to be more outspoken on social issues.\u2022 How the T-Mobile C.E.O.\u2019s success might be a mixed blessing.That\u2019s the sum Apple intends to spend on buying back its own stock. It sounds like a lot, but Apple has a huge stock market value and investors have grown accustomed to it repurchasing a large portion of its stock.Here\u2019s how it stacks up.If Apple spent $100 billion on its shares at the current stock price, it would buy back 571 million shares, equivalent to 11 percent of the company\u2019s total shares outstanding.Would investors be impressed with an 11 percent reduction? It depends on how quickly Apple carries it out. In the last five years, Apple\u2019s shares outstanding have fallen by 24 percent. In theory, then, if Apple completed the latest program in two years, it would be more or less on track with that five-year period.But Apple may move more quickly. In the three months through the end of March, Apple bought back $23.5 billion of shares, an unusually large sum by the company\u2019s standards. Executives are sometimes reluctant to repurchase shares if they look overvalued. And Apple\u2019s C.F.O., Luca Maestri, said on a conference call Tuesday that Apple wanted its buybacks to be \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201cefficient.\u201d But he also said he wanted them to be \u201cfast.\u201d- Peter EavisInvestors expected Apple to announce a large share repurchase program heading into this quarter\u2019s earnings, and the iPhone maker didn\u2019t disappoint. Apple announced a new $100 billion buyback program.The coffers of corporate America are straining under the weight of spare cash. And none more than Apple. Apple was forced to pay taxes on more than $250 billion held overseas as part of the tax overhaul President Trump signed into law late last year.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Apple reported a net income of $13.82 billion for its fiscal second quarter, up 25 percent from a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $2.73, above analysts expectations of $2.67 per share.\u2022 Revenue increased 16 percent to $61.1 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected sales of 60.82 billion.\u2022 Revenue from its services business hit a record of $9.2 billion.\u2022 Apple sold 52.2 million iPhones in the quarter, up 2.9 percent from a year ago.\u2022 Revenue from iPhone sales increased 14 percent from a year ago to $38.03 billion.\u2022 Apple\u2019s cash pile shrank to $267.2 billion from $285.1 billion at the end of its fiscal first quarter.Snap\u2019s recent redesign of its Snapchat app didn\u2019t go over well with its users. Now it is impacting its results.Nellie Bowles of the NYT writes:Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, cited Snapchat\u2019s redesign as a major factor for the disappointing performance.\u201cA change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,\u201d he said, referring later to \u201cheadwinds from the redesign.\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s decision on Monday to hold off on imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on a number of countries came as the United States is engaged in a separate trade battle with China and is negotiating changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.From the time the tariffs on steel and aluminum were announced in late February, they seemed the least promising part of Mr. Trump\u2019s combative trade policy. Not only were the measures directed in part at allies, the European Union and Canada among them, the administration convinced few with their argument that imports of the two metals were threatening national security.And when announcing the tariffs, the Trump administration immediately granted temporary exemptions to certain countries. The move suggested loopholes and concessions might be available, an impression that will likely persist after Mr. Trump on Monday extended negotiations with Mexico, Canada and the European Union for 30 days.The new deadline may help push along Nafta negotiations with Mexico and Canada, but the European Union is becoming a big problem for Mr. Trump\u2019s trade agenda. The bloc has gained another reprieve from the steel and aluminum tariffs and apparently has given up nothing.And the European Union\u2019s stance has hurt Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs strategy in another crucial way. The tariffs were said to be a cudgel to persuade allies to back the United States in its trade actions against China. The European Union, which shares some of the United States\u2019 frustrations with China\u2019s trade practices, may eventually back Mr. Trump against China. But the longer the tensions between the European Union and the United States persist, the less likely it is that they align.\u2014 Peter EavisAnd the delay poses a risk, per Ana Swanson of the NYT:It could fuel criticism that Mr. Trump is more bark than bite and increase the pressure on the White House to squeeze concessions from other nations.\u201cThis is an example of the kind of control we think you should have,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s something privacy advocates have been asking for \u2014 and we will work with them to make sure we get it right.\u201dWaiting to be interviewed for the British channel ITV News, Mr. Coupe, presumably unaware that the cameras were rolling, undercut the official line with an impromptu performance.\u201cWe\u2019re in the money. The sky is sunny. Let\u2019s lend it, spend it, send it rolling along.\u201dThe reaction on Twitter was predictably acerbic.Company chiefs increasingly wade into political issues like gun control and climate change. But a poll suggests they may not be moving fast enough.\u2022 64 percent say C.E.O.s should lead change rather than waiting for government action.\u2022 56 percent \u201chave no respect for C.E.O.s who remain silent on important issues.\u201d\u2022 All age groups expect C.E.O. to be personally visible in explaining a company\u2019s purpose and vision.The independence and protection of its users\u2019 data is a core tenet of WhatsApp that Koum and his co-founder, Brian Acton, promised to preserve when they sold their tiny start-up to Facebook. It doubled down on its pledge by adding encryption in 2016.Before joining the Trump administration as communications director, he quit the investment firm, having struck a deal to sell it to HNA of China. But the White House job lasted 10 days, and now the deal with HNA is off, too, so he\u2019ll come back as co-managing partner.More from Brooks Barnes of the NYT:Jeannie Suk Gersen, a professor at Harvard Law School who specializes in gender and sexual harassment issues, said Ms. Judd\u2019s complaint is notable because it \u201cspeaks to the fact that this is not just a sexual issue \u2014 that, beyond physical and emotional harm, it also involves economic harm.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stop Enslavement of Venezuelan Refugees in Brazil", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Arnold is\u00a0a freelance journalist.RORAIMA, Brazil \u2014 For thousands of Venezuelan refugees in Brazil, the road to relief runs through an isolated state where ranchers, miners and traffickers exploit desperate migrants in conditions akin to slavery. Brazilian officials who look the other way can make no claim to be battling corruption and impunity.During a pivotal election season, the chaos in the borderlands mirrors turmoil nationwide. After years of economic malaise, corruption investigations and security breakdowns, many Brazilians crave stability, law and order. Welcoming thousands of Venezuelans checks none of those boxes. At least 10 Venezuelans have been rescued from slavery in the past year. Yet the abuse of refugees at the hands of powerful businessmen and landowners is but another stunning example of how crime pays in Brazil.The country deserves leaders who will act swiftly to protect the vulnerable from exploitation and restore Brazil\u2019s credibility in the region \u2014 not use the crisis to stoke xenophobia and nationalism.On a recent day, Alvaro Jose Cerven Morales, a 35-year-old electrical engineer from Ciudad Bol\u00edvar, stood in the shade of a tree near the border with his wife, Eyl\u00edn, an industrial engineer, holding their 1-year-old son.\u201cI have confidence we\u2019ll find work,\u201d Mr. Morales said, patting his son\u2019s arm. \u201cIt will be hard, but we have to make a better life for him.\u201dThe Brazilian armed forces are racing to open shelters and fly refugees to other states in concert with the United Nations Refugee Agency, ushering pregnant women and children off the streets while helping others secure residency and working papers. Yet as quickly as new shelters open, new waves of migrants flood public spaces where hundreds of teachers, engineers, mechanics, ex-soldiers and their children have been camping for weeks in unsanitary conditions, waiting to relocate.Yet many of those new provisions were rolled back even as the economic collapse in Venezuela quickened. The current migration and asylum systems in Brazil are tangled with bureaucratic knots and complicated by poor record-keeping.\u201cI see men leave here at six in the morning, work 12 hours and come back with nothing,\u201d said Donaldo Ch\u00e1vez, 50, a teacher who had been sleeping in Simon Bol\u00edvar Plaza for weeks.\u201cIt is extremely worrying,\u201d said Isabel Marquez, a representative of the United Nations Refugee Agency. \u201cSome come back at the end of the week. Some come back at the end of the month. Some of them are paid. Some of them not paid.\u201dA man rescued in February reported having water and electricity costs deducted from his wages. When he asked to leave, the employer said his work wasn\u2019t finished. The police discovered him when the boss was arrested on a manslaughter charge.Brazil\u2019s National Task Force for the Eradication of Slave Labor promises more inspection and rescue efforts, but the flow of migrants is only swelling in anticipation of Mr. Maduro\u2019s snap election on May 20.The Brazilian government and its international partners must take three immediate steps to tackle the crisis head-on.First, escalate the multiagency effort on the border at Pacaraima by dispatching more immigration brigades and social workers to process permits and educate incoming Venezuelans about their labor rights in Brazil. Migrants must be warned against employers offering food or shelter.Second, mobilize additional highway patrol units and labor inspectors to monitor traffic and working conditions along BR-174.Last, federal, state and local governments must coordinate to hasten the \u201cinteriorization\u201d of refugees from under-resourced Roraima to other Brazilian regions. This will be politically toxic when other strapped communities are loath to welcome their Venezuelan neighbors. But given Brazil\u2019s recent stumble from the world spotlight, the largest migration event in Latin American history is an opportunity for the country to reaffirm its regional leadership and its commitment to improving its human rights record.Chris Feliciano Arnold is the author of \u201cThe Third Bank of the River: Power and Survival in the Twenty-First-Century Amazon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Walmart Goes Upscale, Offering Lord & Taylor Brands", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, Lord & Taylor has unveiled another milestone, although one that speaks less to the retailer\u2019s glory days and more to the challenges of modern retailing.Lord & Taylor is teaming up with Walmart to create an online store on Walmart.com that will offer about 125 fashion brands, including Tommy Bahama, La La Anthony, H Halston and Effy.Billed by both companies as a \u201cpremium\u201d shopping destination, the new online store reflects Lord & Taylor\u2019s desire to reach a wider audience and Walmart\u2019s hope to attract a different type of customer.In April, the Lord & Taylor website attracted roughly 2.2 million unique visitors, a tiny fraction of the 101 million visitors to Walmart.com, according to comScore, a media measurement company. But its brands are typically more upscale than many of those found at Walmart.Other struggling retailers have found similar outlets for their products on Amazon. J.Crew sells clothes on the site and Sears has recently started selling its DieHard tires.\u201cThis is a tremendous growth opportunity,\u201d R.J. Cilley, a senior vice president of digital at Lord & Taylor said in a conference call on Tuesday. \u201cWe are growing our footprint to reach exponentially more customers.\u201dWalmart has also recently redesigned its website, giving it a more sleek and modern look. Navy blues and grays have replaced the bright blue and yellow sunshine logos that decorate the company\u2019s hulking stores.The Lord & Taylor online store on Walmart.com is expected to open in the coming weeks. Lord & Taylor will be responsible for shipping the clothing to customer\u2019s homes. It will continue to sell the same brands in its stores and on its own website at the same prices as it does on Walmart.com.The two companies declined to disclose financial details of their partnership, like how the revenue would be shared for each piece of Lord & Taylor clothing sold on Walmart.com.For decades, Walmart built a retail empire as the store offering the lowest prices on staples like toothpaste, milk and cat litter.But today, the company has higher aspirations \u2014 including making its website a \u201cdestination for fashion,\u201d said Denise Incandela, head of fashion for Walmart\u2019s e-commerce operations in the United States.Like many retailers, Walmart is looking to increase its sales beyond its brick-and-mortar stores and find ways to slow Amazon\u2019s steady march toward global e-commerce domination. Last week, Walmart announced it was spending $16 billion to purchase a controlling stake in Flipkart, the leading eCommerce provider in India.Lord & Taylor, which is part of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, which also owns Saks Fifth Avenue, has also been making big moves to survive. It just hired a new president, Vanessa LeFebvre, an executive from the online clothing subscription Stitch Fix, to rethink its strategy for a digital age.On Tuesday, Lord & Taylor executives referred to their site on the Walmart website as a new kind of \u201cflagship\u201d store.\u201cThis innovative flagship on Walmart.com is an entirely new model for us and demonstrates the evolution of Lord & Taylor,\u201d Mr. Cilley said in the statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Taking Another Spooky Hike Up \u2018Hanging Rock\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySet in 1900 in the Australian countryside, where provincial gentility rubbed up against indigenous culture and wild nature, the story centered on a series of disappearances and deaths of girls and women \u2014 symbolically done in by, or perhaps mystically transcending, their repressive environment. It was not a story of empowerment.Even worse, by current standards, the instigating mystery \u2014 the disappearance of three boarding-school girls and one of their teachers during a hike up Hanging Rock, an actual geological feature near Melbourne \u2014 was left unsolved. Did they jump, did they run, were they killed, were they transported? No definitive answer was provided. In the peak-TV era, there is no greater heresy.The writers, Beatrix Christian (who did the screenplay for the excellent Ray Lawrence movie \u201cJindabyne,\u201d based on a Raymond Carver story) and Alice Addison, have stuck with the basic framework already set forth in the Joan Lindsay novel and the Peter Weir film.But within and around that structure, they\u2019ve been busy. In addition to the historical-supernatural spook fest of the original, there are a number of narratives fighting for space in this new \u201cPicnic.\u201dThere\u2019s a Moll Flanders-style back story for the school\u2019s headmistress, Mrs. Appleyard (Natalie Dormer of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d), which helps explain her desperate desire to maintain respectability and to exert control over the girls. The tale of the orphaned student Sara (Inez Curro) has been expanded and made even more Dickensian.There\u2019s now some solemnly overheated melodrama involving sexual exploration and jealousy, and every once in a while a modern mean-girl comedy takes over. And in case we forget that the whole thing started life as a Victorian ghost story, some screen time is devoted to reading \u201cThe Turn of the Screw\u201d out loud.All this embellishment comes with a commensurate multiplication of tones and styles, sometimes within a scene. (The directors are Larysa Kondracki, Michael Rymer and Amanda Brotchie.) Fairly straightforward period drama mixes, uneasily, with thoroughly contemporary flourishes of satirical comedy and theatrical self-consciousness. Ms. Dormer, who narrates flashbacks to her unsavory past, occasionally punctuates a scene by turning her feline gaze straight into the camera.The actors mostly acquit themselves well, taking things as straightforwardly as possible, though Ms. Dormer\u2019s coy seductiveness isn\u2019t a good fit for the headmistress (and Yael Stone of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d goes way over the top as the most pious of the school\u2019s governesses).The vaudevillian, throw-everything-at-the-wall approach may reflect the creators\u2019 sensibilities, or the need to fill a little over five hours of running time. But it also feels as if it might be a direct, somewhat panicked reaction to the ambiguities of the story.Ms. Christian and Ms. Addison have taken every latent idea, every veiled suggestion, in the material and made it explicit. Every piece of subtext has been dredged up so that it can be turned into banal commentary on the benighted attitudes of the provincial patriarchy toward gender, race, class and sexuality. (In that sense, this \u201cPicnic\u201d is reminiscent of Jane Campion projects like \u201cThe Piano\u201d and, in a more contemporary vein, \u201cTop of the Lake.\u201d) It\u2019s as if they fear that anything left unexplained could, in the current climate of political and cultural correctness, be used against them.Without that kind of control and pictorial fluency, the story loses its sensuality, and all that\u2019s left is a fairly threadbare, clich\u00e9d melodrama. In the end, the more we know about why the girls disappeared, the less we feel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Risk to the Economy \u2014 A Slowdown in Lending: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A slowdown in lending could pose a threat to the economy.\u2022 Could oil prices return to $100 a barrel next year?\u2022 Walmart\u2019s journey to its biggest deal.\u2022 How Michael Cohen made $2 million as a gatekeeper.\u2022 The latest fallout from Trump\u2019s foreign policy.With tax cuts done and deregulation proceeding, some expect the United States economy to grow more quickly than it has in recent years.Borrowing allows companies and individuals to finance purchases that they might not otherwise be able to afford. When borrowing surges, new money circulates through the economy, creating demand that needs to be met with higher production.Lending has certainly not fallen off a cliff like it did during the Great Recession, but it is growing quite a bit slower than it has in recent years. If it doesn\u2019t pick up, that could dampen growth some expect.In March, bank loans to companies (commercial and industrial loans, in the Federal Reserve\u2019s statistics) rose 2.5 percent from a year ago. That is well below the 7 percent average monthly growth rate of the past three years. Real estate and consumer loans also grew below their three-year average rates.Tough comparisons are in part to blame for the lackluster growth. This year\u2019s borrowing is being compared with totals notched up during a surge in lending. And since that boom petered out in early 2017, growth rates in credit may soon look better.But something else may hinder a strong revival in borrowing. Companies may have taken on so much debt that they may not want to borrow much more, or their creditors may not be as willing to lend. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Wednesday noted that the \u201cnet leverage\u201d of investment-grade corporations is now at its highest level since 2002. Debt, after subtracting cash holdings, is 1.82 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the companies, excluding financial firms and corporations in the energy, utilities and metals sectors.Of course, we may now just be in a lending lull that will soon give way to a rebound. But the longer credit growth remains subpar, the less likely a Trump boom becomes.- Peter EavisAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch argue that there is a risk of that happening.They cite collapsing production in Venezuela, continued production restraint by OPEC and Russia, and the rising tensions in the Middle East, which seem set to worsen in the wake of President Trump\u2019s decision to walk away from Iran nuclear deal.The analysts raised their forecast for Brent, the global benchmark for oil, to $70 a barrel this year and to $75 a barrel next year and that there was a possibility of oil going to $100 a barrel.Why the risk of $100 a barrel? There could be a greater than expected drop in Iranian oil exports and OPEC and Russia could continue to curb production. The BofA analysts write:\u201cIf a new Iran deal is not reached in the next six months or OPEC/Russia extend production cuts into 2019, global oil markets would likely tighten further.\u201dAnd United States shale likely will not make up for the falloff in productionBrent last saw $100 a barrel in September 2014.On the earnings call for his Third Point Reinsurance, Mr. Loeb said:Over the past two years, markets were boosted by positive surprises in growth and benign inflation, but during the first quarter, uncertainty returned in each of these areas. Investors have become increasingly concerned about multiples, particularly since after many years of low rates, there\u2019s finally an alternative to equities in the form of relatively riskless 2-year money.We\u2019ve also seen manufacturing indices start to decline from elevated levels.As the markets today grapple with multiples and which inning of the late cycle we\u2019re in, we\u2019re watching closely to see if a recession, which we don\u2019t think is close, might be getting closer.Historically low yields have push investors into increasingly risky assets since the financial crisis and provided crucial support for the stocks. Now that two-year Treasuries yield is more than 2.50 percent, that critical pillar of the nine-year bull market has been weakened somewhat.By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.Down the road: Flipkart and its remaining investors still hope the company will go public someday. Walmart is on board.He didn\u2019t join the White House. But President Trump\u2019s fixer brought in huge payouts from Squire Patton Boggs, AT&T, Novartis and others with the prospect of access to power.\u2022 AT&T told employees that it paid $600,000 for antitrust insight into antitrust matters as it sought backing for its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner.\u2022 Novartis was worried about Mr. Trump moving against the Affordable Care Act and promising to cut drug prices.Here are the details from the WSJ:\u2022 It will carry the Apple Pay brand.\u2022 It will replace rewards-card partnership with Barclays.\u2022 It could be issued next year.ContextThe move comes as Apple has become more focused on bolstering revenue from its services business. Apple Pay is a key part of that strategy but adoption has fallen short of expectations since it was started four years ago, The WSJ reports. For Goldman\u2019s part, the Wall Street firm has pushed increasingly into consumer banking to offset slowing revenue from trading and investment banking. The Apple Pay card will be the first credit card issued by Goldman.Sturm Ruger\u2019s C.E.O., Christopher Kilroy, played down the significance of the move, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s it, a report.\u201d And a former N.R.A. executive, Sandra Froman, won re-election to the board.Advertisement"}

Louis C.K.Supported byShe spoke with me this week by phone from her home in Los Angeles, which she shares with her wife, Stephanie Allynne, and their twin boys, who are nearly 2. Here are edited excerpts from our conversation.There\u2019s a real sweetness to this special. I was struck that there was no mention of #MeToo, which was very fresh when the special was filmed. Was that a conscious choice? We would have very gladly done another season if given a chance. There\u2019s also something really nice about moving on from a show that had been tied to such a negative person who was producing it, even though before the pilot was shot, I was trying to distance myself from him. It was certainly like, \u201cOh that\u2019s a bummer,\u201d but it was also a relief.Any chances of doing another show?I just want to do things that come naturally and feel good. I don\u2019t want to be, \u201cUgh, I want to get another show out there.\u201d I don\u2019t feel that way at all. My wife, Stephanie, and I really love working together; we\u2019ve been developing and writing other projects. We have one particular very, very big project that should be announced any second. [The project they are writing, \u201cHail to the Chief,\u201d a forthcoming Netflix film starring Jennifer Aniston as the president and Ms. Notaro as her wife, the first lady, was announced Friday.]Regarding that negative person \u2014 Louis C.K. \u2014 how did it affect things at Amazon?He wasn\u2019t involved, but his name was on it. That brought a lot of power, even if he wasn\u2019t working on it day to day. His people were involved day to day. I do want to give credit to Amazon. Amazon let us make exactly the show we wanted to make.Any examples of how that power was exerted?I don\u2019t want to go much into it. But one of the most powerful people in comedy was executive producer on the show, and the networks and studios were excited to have him. I meanwhile had found out he\u2019s not who I thought he was, and so I wanted that separation.We were in production on a TV show that was trying to crack that open and have that discussion and have the light shining on this behavior. Nobody in the \u201cOne Mississippi\u201d writers\u2019 room thought for a second that this was being teed up at the same time as this huge movement was about to rear its head. We were shocked, and we were elated. I hope it continues. There are different signs that this is not stopping. I don\u2019t think that anger and frustration and those feelings can go away. I hope they don\u2019t. The attention and support for the victims needs to be continued, more than people worried about these abusers and what\u2019s next for them, how are they going to move on \u2014 shut up.What do you make of talk about if or how these disgraced men should come back?You know what? If any of these people come back, I would say, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see who is actually going to support them.\u201d That is going to be the glaring horror. Who is going to be, like, \u201cThis is a pressing issue, and we need to get them back?\u201d If a janitor was so great at cleaning the building but also tended to masturbate in front of people, would the people at that building be like, \u201cYes, he masturbated, but I\u2019ve never seen anyone clean so thoroughly, and I was just wondering when he\u2019s going to get his job back, he\u2019s so good at it.\u201d No, it would be, \u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d It\u2019s fame and power that people are blinded by.Do you see yourself as having played a significant role in bringing his misdeeds to light? Did you get support afterward?No, I think it\u2019s just having knowledge that there\u2019s an abusive person, and I knew several people in that article. They\u2019re friends of mine, and I know the utter hell \u2014 utter hell \u2014 they\u2019ve been put through. I don\u2019t need public support and I\u2019m not doing it for that, but I did get private texts and emails from people.How, from your point of view, has the comedy scene embraced or pushed back against #MeToo? One of the things we have heard from some of the women who came forth about what happened to them with Louis C.K. was how little the comedy world supported them, with you being a notable exception. Why do you think that was?I think people are friends with him and know he might be back. I think that\u2019s an unfortunate thing that controls people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Takes Control of India\u2019s Flipkart in E-Commerce Gamble", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI \u2014 Walmart said on Wednesday it reached a $16 billion deal to buy a majority stake in Flipkart, India\u2019s leading e-commerce platform, in a sizable bet on a vibrant but risky new market.The benefits to Walmart are less certain. Although India\u2019s population is rapidly coming online, the number of people with enough income to shop online is still tiny. In announcing the deal, Walmart warned its shareholders that the purchase would reduce its net income by at least $750 million this year and by more than double that amount next year.Flipkart, a pioneer in services like accepting cash on delivery for online purchases, has faced its own challenges. Amazon\u2019s entry into India in 2013, backed by more than $5.5 billion in capital from the parent company, pummeled Flipkart with fast delivery, low prices and extra features such as Prime video streaming.Indeed, when Walmart first began discussions to invest in Flipkart, the Indian company was desperate for capital and willing to sell shares at a much lower price. Now, Walmart is paying a hefty premium to buy its way into the pole position in India\u2019s e-commerce market, but it has not yet outlined any strategy that would keep it ahead of Amazon there.Walmart also operates 21 wholesale stores in India that sell discounted goods to the mom-and-pop shops that dominate the retail landscape. Regulations prevent the company from opening retail stores in India like it has in the United States, but Walmart may expand its wholesale operations to ease government concerns that it wants to put the small stores out of business.Flipkart\u2019s investors and many of its employees will reap huge profits from the deal with Wal-Mart. Flipkart\u2019s co-founder, Sachin Bansal, is selling his entire 5.5 percent stake in the company, becoming an instant billionaire. Other early investors like Tiger Global and Accel will also be well rewarded for their early support.Even the SoftBank Vision Fund, the investment vehicle run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, will book a tidy gain despite its short time as an investor. It invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart in August, and Mr. Son told investors Wednesday that the stake will now be sold for about $4 billion.Advertisement"}

(I am, to be clear, a man in my 30s. I got my first driver\u2019s license a few months ago and do not own a car.)The Quantcast spokesman added that the company responded to data access requests under European law. So sending me any data at all had been an error \u2014 because consumers in the United States do not have a comprehensive right to obtain copies of the data held by American companies.Order history.Amazon sent lists of the items my wife and I had bought through the site, the credit cards we used to buy them, the addresses the items were shipped to and the devices we had used to access Amazon services.But we had expected to receive a more substantial data trove from Amazon. So I wrote back to Amazon asking again for all of the details the company had on me, including our household\u2019s video-viewing data.The company said it was \u201cinvestigating\u201d and would send the missing data when it was ready. There is still no sign of it. An Amazon spokesman added that the company was committed to complying with the new European privacy law.But I wanted the complete history of my account, such as my Amazon searches.Amazon responded to my email request by telling me to call the company \u2014 because it was \u201cnot safe to get account details via email due to security reasons.\u201d Then I called Amazon customer service and was put on hold for 15 minutes while an agent scrambled to figure out a response.Finally, the agent came back on the line only to tell me that Amazon was keeping records on me for business purposes \u2014 but would not share them with me. \u201cIt\u2019s all private,\u201d the agent said. \u201cI don\u2019t have access to that information to provide you, unfortunately.\u201dThe standard public information, but not everything I asked for.The standard public information, but not everything I asked for.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, recently testified in a Senate hearing that his company\u2019s download tool contains \u201call of the information\u201d that users have \u201cput into Facebook or that Facebook knows about them.\u201dWe were unable to obtain that kind of information, however.None provided us with copies of that raw information.Instead, from LinkedIn, we each received emails directing us to use the company\u2019s self-service tool. Among other things, our LinkedIn downloads included the email addresses of our connections.Facebook told Natasha that its self-service data download tool \u201chas been reviewed by our data protection regulator\u201d and would allow her \u201cto access all of your Facebook data.\u201d The company told Prashant that the self-service tool would allow him to access only \u201cthe Facebook information available to you\u201d and that the company \u201cisn\u2019t able to provide additional information.\u201dAfter we contacted LinkedIn\u2019s press department, we received emails the next day saying that the company was working on our requests. A LinkedIn spokeswoman said that users could automatically download \u201cthe most commonly requested data\u201d and that the company did not currently plan to change its data request process.As we all become more aware of fraudulent news and online voter influence campaigns, researchers, journalists and consumers have been seeking their personal details from companies to try to understand how we might be manipulated. The incomplete responses from tech companies do not bode well for such research efforts.Nor does it seem to bode well for the companies, which will soon be facing the new European privacy regulations.After we wrote to our cellphone carriers to ask for our records, for instance, Natasha at least heard back from T-Mobile, who told her that it would release her phone records only if the company received a subpoena compelling it to do so.Prashant did not hear back at all from Three, his mobile phone service. When he contacted the company as a reporter, Three said it could not give details on the particular case for privacy reasons, but added that it would typically send a letter asking for proof of identity before proceeding with a data request. Prashant and his wife, whose name is on the phone contract, never received such a letter.A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in Britain told us that companies that failed to respond to data subject access requests could be in breach of the country\u2019s data protection law.Even for a tech giant, that could get expensive.Advertisement"}

In a time of legalized segregation, this school was establishing math and biology departments and training a generation of black women scientists. At a time when many workplaces were filled with not just glass ceilings but brick walls, this school was urging black women to become doctors and lawyers, engineers and ambassadors.\u201cNow that is the story of Spelman College, that unyielding presumption of promise, that presumption of brilliance, that presumption that every woman who enrolls at the school has something infinitely valuable to offer this world.\u201cLadies, that is now your story.\u201d\u2018Be True to Yourself\u2019\u201cWhen I finished school, I was completely lost \u2014 and by school, I mean middle school, but I went ahead and finished high school anyway. And I really, I had no ambition; I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do. I did everything from: I shucked oysters, I was a hostess, I was a bartender, I was a waitress, I painted houses, I sold vacuum cleaners; I had no idea and I thought I\u2019d just finally settle in some job and I would make enough money to pay my rent, maybe have basic cable, maybe not, I didn\u2019t really have a plan.\u201cMy point is that, by the time I was your age, I really thought I knew who I was but I had no idea. Like for example, when I was your age, I was dating men. So what I\u2019m saying is, when you\u2019re older, most of you will be gay. Is anybody writing this stuff down? Parents?\u201d\u2018How Do I Fix That?\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re all smart and sophisticated people. You know the world in a way that my generation never did. Because of that, I realize I don\u2019t have much advice to give to you. In many ways, I learned from you. I don\u2019t have many answers, just questions. Specifically, when I use FaceTime on my iPad and I\u2019m talking to someone and I take a picture, sometimes the screen freezes. How do I fix that?\u201d\u2018Look at the View\u2019\u201cNo man ever said on his deathbed, \u2018I wish I had spent more time at the office.\u2019 I found one of my best teachers on the boardwalk at Coney Island maybe 15 years ago. It was December, and I was doing a story about how the homeless survive in the winter months.\u201cHe and I sat on the edge of the wooden supports, dangling our feet over the side, and he told me about his schedule; panhandling the boulevard when the summer crowds were gone, sleeping in a church when the temperature went below freezing, hiding from the police amidst the Tilt-a-Whirl and the Cyclone and some of the other seasonal rides. But he told me that most of the time he stayed on the boardwalk, facing the water, just the way we were sitting now, even when it got cold and he had to wear his newspapers after he read them.\u201cAnd I asked him why. Why didn\u2019t he go to one of the shelters? Why didn\u2019t he check himself into the hospital for detox? And he just stared out at the ocean and said, \u2018Look at the view, young lady. Look at the view.\u2019\u201cAnd every day, in some little way, I try to do what he said. I try to look at the view. And that\u2019s the last thing I have to tell you today, words of wisdom from a man with not a dime in his pocket, no place to go, nowhere to be. Look at the view. You\u2019ll never be disappointed.\u201d\u2018Be a Doer, Not a Dreamer\u2019\u201cDreams are lovely. But they are just dreams. Fleeting, ephemeral, pretty. But dreams do not come true just because you dream them. It\u2019s hard work that makes things happen. It\u2019s hard work that creates change.\u201cSo, Lesson One, I guess is: Ditch the dream and be a doer, not a dreamer.\u201d\u2018We Go to the Polls\u2019\u201cVote, vote, vote. Pay attention to what the people who claim to represent you are doing and saying in your name and on your behalf. They represent you, and if they have not done right by you, if their policies are at odds with your core beliefs, then you have a responsibility to send them packing. If they go low \u2014 thank you Michelle Obama \u2014 if they go low, we go to the polls. People died for that right. They died for that right. I think about it every time I cast a vote, so don\u2019t let their sacrifice be in vain.\u201d\u2018Failure is Inevitable\u2019\u201cSome failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all \u2014 in which case, you fail by default.\u201d\u2018Seize the Moment\u2019\u201cI\u2019m not telling you to make the world better, because I don\u2019t think that progress is necessarily part of the package. I\u2019m just telling you to live in it. Not just to endure it, not just to suffer it, not just to pass through it, but to live in it. To look at it. To try to get the picture.\u201cTo live recklessly. To take chances. To make your own work and take pride in it. To seize the moment.\u201cAnd if you ask me why you should bother to do that, I could tell you that the grave\u2019s a fine and private place, but none I think do there embrace. Nor do they sing there, or write, or argue, or see the tidal bore on the Amazon, or touch their children. And that\u2019s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Solomon would step in shortly after that.That said, there are some ways to assess whether the current mortgage rate might be a bit high or low for the current conditions in the markets and the economy. One way to put the nominal mortgage rate in context is to adjust for inflation. Subtracting April\u2019s inflation rate of 2.5 percent from the current mortgage rate gives a \u201creal\u201d mortgage rate of around 2.1 percent. That compares with the average real rate of 2.25 percent for the past seven years. The mortgage rate would need to rise 0.15 percentage point to reach that level.Another exercise is to compare the current mortgage with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The difference between the two interest rates on Thursday was 1.5 percentage points, which is smaller than the seven-year average of 1.72 percentage points. Trading at that \u201cspread\u201d would push the current mortgage rate 0.22 percentage point higher to 4.83 percent.Economists expect the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to keep rising, to 3.24 percent in December, according to estimates compiled by The Wall Street Journal.Adding the average seven-year spread of 1.72 percentage points to that forecast gets the mortgage rate within spitting distance of 5 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisBoth sides claimed a victory of sorts, but only one thing was clear: They will all be spending a lot of time in court.Ms. Brennan has resisted doing so, pointing out that the rate the Postal Service charges Amazon and others is bound by contracts, the Washington Post writes.ContextMany have pushed back against Mr. Trump\u2019s comments. They point out that Amazon, the largest single shipper of packages, has been a boon for the agency at a time when it has experienced a steady decline in the amount of mail it ships.Denise M. Morrison, the chief executive of Campbell Soup Co., retired abruptly on Friday after nearly seven years in the job. Keith R. McLoughlin, a member of the Campbell board since 2016, was named to succeed Ms. Morrison on an interim basis.\u2022 Campbell has struggled on Ms. Morrison\u2019s watch to reverse a slide in sales tied to shifting food trends. Campbell reported $393 million loss for the third quarter on Friday, compared with a $176 million profit in the same period a year earlier. The company also expects its earnings per share for the year to slump 5 to 6 percent after previously projecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent.\u2022 With Ms. Morrison\u2019s departure, there are now 23 women leading Fortune 500 companies, or 4.6 percent of the total. They include Mary Barra at General Motors, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo and Marillyn Hewson at Lockheed Martin.\u2022 Campbell\u2019s share price dropped more than 12 percent, to $34.50, after the company\u2019s morning announcement that Ms. Morrison had resigned. It had bounced back a bit by midday. From the start of her tenure as chief executive in August 2011 through Thursday, Campbell\u2019s share price was up 19 percent, although it had tumbled around 30 percent in the past year.\u2014 Tiffany HsuContext\u2022 Chinese antitrust regulators had long delayed Qualcomm\u2019s $44 billion deal for NXP as well as Bain Capital\u2019s $18 billion purchase of Toshiba.\u2022 On Thursday, China approved Bain Capital's acquisitions of Toshiba.Even if the Chinese stopped buying other foreign products, like Airbus airplanes from the European Union or soybeans from Brazil, and purchased solely American products, it would add up to only a small fraction of the $200 billion total they are promising to purchase.Representatives for Brookfield and Qatar said the emirate wasn\u2019t involved, and Brookfield is an established real-estate name in its own right.

{"Headline": "On That \u2018Barry\u2019 Finale and Why Some Shows Are So Good, They Need to End", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe end of the first season of \u201cBarry\u201d was so good it made me never want to watch the show again.Over the course of HBO\u2019s dark comedy \u2014 beat it if you don\u2019t want to know what happened \u2014 Barry (Bill Hader), a hit man in Los Angeles, fell out of love with his profession and in love with a woman from his acting class, who was unaware of his day job.By the last episode, which aired Sunday night, he\u2019d won her over and sworn off murder \u2014 or so he told himself until, on a weekend getaway, he was confronted by a police detective who connected him with his crimes. Trapped, he apparently swallowed his qualms and killed her. In the final scene, he crawled into bed next to his girlfriend, grimaced and said to himself: \u201cStarting n\u2014\u201d Cut to black.\u201cBarry\u201d will likely be one of the best new series I see all year, so I should be happy. And I am, mostly, I guess.At the same time, this doesn\u2019t feel like a series that should stretch on more than a few seasons. \u201cBarry\u201d commits to a bold premise, but could you sustain it for six years, seven, more?Either Barry is capable of change or he\u2019s not. If he is, that seems like material for one more very good season or two. If he\u2019s not, and the series brings him back into the criminal life, then the character\u2019s drive (you, and Barry, want him to redeem himself) is at odds with the needs of the plot (you, and the network, want the story to keep going).But there\u2019s a hitch. June (Elisabeth Moss) ended the first season as she ended the novel, headed either for rescue or punishment. The series decided to make it both: First, she was brought to a horrific mock execution, then was liberated by the resistance, then was recaptured. There is only so long, in a series about bondage and rape, that you can string out the cycle of raising and dashing hopes without numbing or traumatizing your audience.Wanting a good series not to last too long is a high-class problem, and a fairly recent one. In the early decades of TV, series were endless, until they ended. This was fine, since most shows essentially returned every episode to the status quo ante. (Or, in the case of a soap like \u201cDallas,\u201d the absurdity of endless plot twists was taken for granted.) A story might get tired but it wouldn\u2019t really get old, because TV took place in a time warp where time didn\u2019t pass.In the cable era, TV got more ambitious and more serial. Things changed by the end of an episode. Characters would be in very different circumstances a few years after we met them. Once TV was telling stories that changed, it suggested that the stories needed to end, properly, rather than just stop.And when it passed that date \u2014 whew, could you smell it. Take \u201cDexter.\u201d Like \u201cBarry,\u201d it was about a murderer for whom we had mixed sympathies (a serial killer who tried to follow a code to whack only deserving victims). The first season was excellent, and popular. So it had another, and another, and another, stringing itself out for eight seasons of implausible dilemmas until its final mercy-killing.\u201cThe Office\u201d should have departed when Michael Scott did. You may be a bigger fan of the later seasons of \u201cHomeland\u201d than I am, but had it ended after its first, it would have been a legend.In part, this situation is the side effect of a good thing: With more TV outlets serving more-targeted audiences, a daring, unconventional show has a decent chance of surviving. With dozens of cable outlets and the seemingly bottomless pockets of Netflix and Amazon (soon to be joined by Apple), TV is becoming a \u201cmore\u201d machine. TV series are becoming like athletes going on a season or three past when they should have retired.Beyond that, it feels like we\u2019re losing the idea that you should leave people wanting more, that you can love something without needing twice as much of it.All this has given me a strange appreciation for the disappointments of TV past. \u201cFreaks and Geeks\u201d broke my heart when it was canceled in 2000, and not a few times have I wondered whether, had it come along a dozen years later, it might have lasted for years.On the other hand, like most high school shows, it probably shouldn\u2019t have had more than three seasons or so. There\u2019s a reason we feel sad for the former prom king who keeps hanging around after graduation.I realize that complaining about too much of a good thing makes me sound like a crank. No one\u2019s forcing me to watch this revival or that sequel, to stick with a show that\u2019s lasted too long.But we lose something when we lose a sense of finality. It gives meaning to art the way that the knowledge of death gives meaning to life. When no ending is permanent \u2014 even if it means resurrecting dead characters \u2014 the power of endings is compromised. And often an ending that comes before we want it to comes exactly at the right time.So I hope the second season of \u201cBarry\u201d wows me as much as the first. But I also hope that, when it knows the time has come, it will not hesitate to pull the trigger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I Don\u2019t Feel Superhuman. I Feel Like a Mom Who Has a Career.\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rebecca Slaughter\u2019s recent Monday morning started out in a pretty typical way for a working mother of a newborn. She woke at 2 a.m. to feed, burp and change the diaper on her then-7-week-old daughter, Pippa. She repeated the routine three hours later.By 6:30 a.m., Ms. Slaughter checked her email and schedule while fixing breakfast for her two older children, ages 3 and 5. Her commute started at 8, driving her Honda minivan from her home in Bethesda, Md., a Washington suburb, while hooked up to a hands-free electric breast pump.It was when she arrived at the office about a half-hour later that her day took an unusual turn. She checked into the neoclassical Federal Trade Commission Building in the nation\u2019s capital, with Pippa in tow, as one of the country\u2019s top business regulators \u2014 and the first to do the job with a baby in the office.For the next several weeks, until Pippa goes to day care as a slightly older baby, she will join Ms. Slaughter on the fifth floor, either in a gray bouncy seat behind a desk or nestled in a wrap attached to her mother\u2019s chest. It was the imperfect but best solution for Ms. Slaughter, whose appointment in March to serve as an F.T.C. commissioner just happened to coincide with the birth of her third child.\u201cI am tired,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said as she put on a nursing cover for a late morning feeding. \u201cI don\u2019t feel superhuman. I feel like a mom who has a career about which she cares very much and a family about which she cares very much. And I\u2019m trying to navigate the two.\u201dMs. Slaughter, a longtime legal adviser to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, didn\u2019t think about turning down the job offer. She did have some doubts about how she could pull off the schedule of raising three children and taking a senior position in government, but the opportunity was too good to pass up.The work culture for families has been stubbornly slow to change in Washington. To take a position of leadership in federal agencies, on Capitol Hill or in the White House requires long and unpredictable hours. Modest pay, demanding travel and meager family leave benefits also deter many women from rising in the government ranks.Such considerations have held back female representation in every corner of government. Women comprise 20 percent of Congress. They hold a quarter of the cabinet posts in the Trump administration.But recently, there have been signs of change. The federal government has slowly reconfigured buildings to accommodate new moms, with lactation rooms at most agencies and in Congress. In April, Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, became the first member of the Senate to deliver a baby during her tenure. Shortly after, lawmakers changed the rules to allow children on the Senate floor.But Ms. Slaughter does have an office that allows her to nurse the baby and pump in private, and for Pippa to nap in quiet. She divides most household duties with her husband, Justin Slaughter, a political and business consultant.\u201cBringing a baby to work is not the right choice for every mom or dad, nor do many have that option,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said.Three months ago, Ms. Slaughter, who goes by Becca, was working as the top lawyer for Mr. Schumer. After a decade working in his office, she was asked to consider filling an empty Democratic slot at the trade commission.Pippa was born on April 2. Ideally, Ms. Slaughter would have had a longer maternity leave, like she did with her two older children when working for Mr. Schumer. Each day since her nomination in April has felt like a \u201cconfluence of high-intensity events\u201d that she approaches day by day, she said.As part of her nomination, she testified before senators nine days after giving birth to Pippa. She made sure to feed the baby minutes before the hearing in case it ran extra long. Her husband held Pippa in the carrier during the hearing.\u201cI kept telling myself the only way out is through. I have to get through it if I want to be on the other side of this,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said of the two-hour hearing. \u201cIf I want to have this amazing baby and job then I need to put my head down and get through it.\u201dBefore her first day, she informed the four other F.T.C. commissioners about her plan to bring Pippa to the office and received their unanimous support. She organizes her days accordingly, only accepting meetings and speaking engagements where she can take the baby. Two weeks ago, she appeared onstage at a privacy conference hosted by the Future of Privacy Forum for a question-and-answer session. Pippa shared the stage, asleep in her carrier.\u201cBoth Becca and Pippa are wonderful additions to the F.T.C. family,\u201d the agency\u2019s chairman, Joe Simons, a Republican, said in an email. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that Becca made the decision to begin her tenure as a commissioner so soon after the birth of her daughter.\u201dThe work itself is right in her sweet spot. Ms. Slaughter spent much of her time in Mr. Schumer\u2019s office working on consumer protection and antitrust issues, and is now on the F.T.C. amid an uproar of the practices of Silicon Valley giants. The agency is investigating Facebook\u2019s privacy practices and Equifax\u2019s massive data breach. Consumer groups and smaller tech rivals have called on the F.T.C. to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon amid growing antitrust concerns.It is unclear whether Ms. Slaughter\u2019s decision to bring Pippa to the F.T.C. will pave the way for other high-level government officials to combine work and motherhood. Some \u2014 but not all \u2014 agencies have day care on-site, and government employees aren\u2019t guaranteed spots for their children.But Ms. Slaughter\u2019s male colleagues say her decision helps all working parents. Noah Phillips, a Republican commissioner and parent of young children, said it was important for the F.T.C. staff to know that Pippa would be a daily fixture.\u201cIt sends good signals in a lot of different ways,\u201d he said.Three weeks into the job at the F.T.C., some of the adrenaline has begun to wear off. Sleep deprivation was setting in.Ms. Slaughter is trying to spend more time with her older children as they adjust to her job change and their new younger sibling. She\u2019s determined to attend a baby and me yoga class at least once a week during the lunch hour.

And you need to conquer your doubts.\u201dOn the recent Monday morning, Ms. Slaughter walked with Pippa in the carrier to a nearby restaurant for a business lunch. Then mother and baby were back in the office for several meetings and a block of time to go over papers on cases pending before the F.T.C. She kept her promise to leave the office by 5 p.m. to have dinner with family at home. But she was online again after the two older children were asleep around 8 p.m.By 10 p.m., she was in bed.\u201cIt\u2019s like a marathon,\u201d she said of her day. The race would begin again in about four hours.An earlier version of this article misidentified Senator Tammy Duckworth as the first member of Congress to deliver a baby during her tenure.

{"Headline": "Why Traditional TV Is in Trouble", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTelevision networks will draw hordes of advertisers to New York City this week for their annual bonanza of presentations and parties, a decades-old tradition known as the upfronts that is meant to dazzle marketers and loosen their purse strings.But beneath the sparkle and the canap\u00e9s, the networks are also navigating a serious advertising upheaval. Ratings are on the decline, especially among young people, some of whom don\u2019t even own televisions. It\u2019s hard to keep up with the many devices and apps people now use to watch shows. And there is a host of material from Silicon Valley that is competing for viewers\u2019 attention, including Google\u2019s YouTube, Facebook and Netflix. It all adds up to a precarious situation for broadcast TV.Advertising on TV has long been the best way for marketers to reach a large number of people at one time. And it is still a formidable medium. But cracks are showing.National TV ad sales peaked in 2016, when they exceeded $43 billion, according to data from Magna, the ad-buying and media intelligence arm of IPG Mediabrands. Sales fell 2.2 percent last year, and the firm estimates that they will fall at least 2 percent each year through 2022.Some of the decline could be mitigated through new business with platforms like Hulu, but \u201cit\u2019s not yet enough to upset the decrease of traditional sales,\u201d said Vincent Letang, Magna\u2019s executive vice president of global market intelligence. At the same time, he said, while networks have raised the cost of advertising on their airwaves in recent years, ratings have declined sharply, including some in unexpected areas like the National Football League.TV is still a good value for plenty of advertisers. Mr. Letang said pharmaceuticals and personal care products were increasing their presences on TV. But the combination of rising prices and falling viewership is giving some big brands pause.As TV ad spending has begun to drop, marketers have been diverting more money to tech giants like Google and Facebook, which have increasingly focused on expanding their video \u2014 and video ad \u2014 business.Old Navy has long been a prominent TV advertiser, and television remains crucial to the company\u2019s marketing. But the way Old Navy defines TV advertising has evolved, said Jamie Gersch, its chief marketing officer.Those opting out of traditional TV packages are watching Netflix and videos on Amazon Prime, and to a lesser extent, paying for services like Dish Network\u2019s Sling TV, according to Kagan, a media research group within S&P Global Market Intelligence.As networks navigate these changes, they are moving to reduce the number of ads they show. Ads, after all, make money, but they also annoy viewers. Last year, the average number of commercial minutes during an hour of broadcast TV was 13.6, according to Nielsen data.So if there are fewer commercials, how do companies market their products?Ralph Heim, vice president of media and sponsorships at Sonic Drive-In, said he was intrigued by several of the new data targeting products for television ads. But he remains concerned about how the announcements on limited ads fit with a declining audience.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to create a more premium advertising experience for advertisers, and they\u2019re hoping that people will pay more,\u201d even though the audience is smaller, Mr. Heim said.He added, \u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re following the eyeballs, right?\u201dAdvertisement"}

One reason may be to assuage lawmakers who do not favor making concessions on ZTE to China. As Shawn Donnan of the FT wrote:Another possible reason for re-introducing the $50 billion of tariffs: China is not giving as much ground as the Trump administration wants on a wide range of trade issues. By rolling out the threat again, the U.S. may hope to extract more concessions in negotiations before they wrap up.This appears to be the first time the administration has set itself some sort of deadline for imposing the tariffs against China.Imagine it is the second half of June and China has not agreed to significant, concrete concessions. Mr. Trump could choose to impose the tariffs, an unmistakably hostile act that would mark the beginnings of a trade war with China, which has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs.So far, the public has not been able to tell what the Trump administration really wants. In two weeks, that may be possible.\u2014 Peter EavisThe $66 billion union of the two can move forward, after the department imposed what it called the biggest-ever divestiture of assets for a merger approval.What\u2019s notable about the announcements is that they fall in line with the antitrust philosophy of Makan Delrahim, the department\u2019s antitrust chief. They emphasize \u201cstructural\u201d changes to the company \u2014 as in sales of businesses \u2014 rather than \u201cbehavioral\u201d remedies, in which companies agree to change their conduct.To Mr. Delrahim\u2019s mind, the behavioral approach, which was used in Comcast\u2019s takeover of NBCUniversal, makes the Justice Department an ongoing regulator. That\u2019s something that he has said the department would not do.What Mr. Delrahim said of Tuesday\u2019s agreement:\u201cThis comprehensive structural solution to significant horizontal and vertical competition concerns\u2014the largest merger divestiture ever required by the United States\u2014preserves competition in the sale of these critical agricultural products and protects American farmers and consumers,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. \u201cWe commend the parties for working with the Antitrust Division to resolve our concerns on behalf of American consumers.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedHis suggested fix for the refugee crisis: no defined quotas for the numbers of immigrants that nations should accept, and an E.U.-led \u201cMarshall Plan for Africa\u201d that would help African governments to provide education and employment for citizens so as to reduce emigration.But that runs counter to the E.U.\u2019s current austerity drive, so Mr. Soros also suggests a way to help it spend more:Without going into the details, I want to point out that the proposal contains an ingenious device, a special-purpose vehicle, that would enable the E.U. to tap financial markets at a very advantageous rate without incurring a direct obligation for itself or for its member states; it also offers considerable accounting benefits. Moreover, although it is an innovative idea, it has already been used successfully in other contexts, namely general-revenue municipal bonds in the US and so-called surge funding to combat infectious diseases.Finally, to keep nations like Britain from leaving the E.U., Soros argues that the bloc must restyle itself as a club that it\u2019s attractive to belong to:Such a Europe would differ from the current arrangements in two key respects. First, it would clearly distinguish between the EU and the eurozone. Second, it would recognize that the euro has many unsolved problems, which must not be allowed to destroy the European project.All this, Mr. Soros argues, could create a union where countries are both able to assert their sovereignty while also collaborating on joint goals more effectively.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation\u2019s government says it may ban the social network for an entire month, and authorities around the world will be watching to see how the experiment plays out.But with governments in America, Europe, and the rest of the world all struggling to work out how to police the social network, the results could prove fascinating \u2014 and postnatally influential \u2014 around the world.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeMaking smartphones that do more might not necessarily encourage people to buy a new one. But it could nevertheless help Apple become the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar company.People already use their iPhone to download new apps, pay for things, subscribe to music and video services, and more \u2014 and Apple takes a small but important slice of those software purchases, payments and subscriptions (though, in the final case, only if they're bought through the app store.)The company also makes a healthy revenue from its own services, such as Apple Music and iCloud. In total, the FT notes, Apple\u2019s revenue from these kinds of services has doubled in four years, and Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, hopes that the company will generate $50 billion per year from them by the end of 2020.Fast forward to the next iPhone, due out later this year. We don\u2019t yet know what it will do, but it sounds like it could help you swipe your way into the office. It might have extra augmented reality features, which could, for instance, power new kinds of online shopping. Improved processors could help it perform more complicated artificial intelligence tasks that new apps could make use of to automate your workday tasks. Some of those advances would likely also give rise to new software features that might trickle down into current top-of-the-range iPhones.Would those features make people head out to upgrade their phone? Perhaps. Would they allow both in-house and third-party developers to build new services that Apple can skim money off of? Certainly.\u2014 Jamie Condliffe\u201cWith more than 10,000 customers and 6,000 employees, BMC is a global leader in managing digital and I.T. infrastructure with a broad portfolio of software solutions,\u201d Herald Chen, the head of KKR\u2019s technology, media and telecom team, and John Park, another KKR executive, said in a statement.In this case, KKR is buying BMC from Bain Capital, Golden Gate Capital, Singapore\u2019s G.I.C. sovereign wealth fund, Insight Venture Partners and Elliott Management.The advisers on the deal: For BMC: Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.For KKR: Macquarie Capital and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.Financing will come from Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, Macquarie and Mizuho.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedCTRL-Labs, a three-year-old start-up whose co-founders include the creator of Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer browser, has a vision of how humans could one day interact with computers: It\u2019s making an armband that reads electrical impulses sent from users\u2019 brains to their fingers.\u201cIf we can recreate virtually what the hand is doing, then we\u2019ve captured all the information that\u2019s coming out of the muscles themselves,\u201d Thomas Reardon, a CTRL-Labs co-founder and the Internet Explorer creator, told me in an interview. (Mr. Reardon argued that smartphones actually represented a step backward, introducing an imperfect way to control computers even as it let consumers gobble up more information.)And the start-up has signed up some heavyweight investors. In this round: Lux Capital and Google\u2019s GV venture arm, as well as Paul Allen\u2019s Vulcan Capital, Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, and Amazon\u2019s Alexa Fund.Josh Wolfe of Lux Capital told me, \u201cThe gap between sci-fi and sci-fact keeps shrinking.\u201dThe big questionI saw a demo of the device, where Patrick Kaifosh, another CTRL-Labs co-founder played Asteroids by just thinking. And another employee sent a somewhat creepy-looking spider robot across a table without moving a finger.But brain-computer interfaces are notoriously hard to push out of prototype. Can CTRL-Labs do it? And will developers and consumers buy in if they can?\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe coffee shop giant will close 8,000 stores for four hours this afternoon. Why? To put employees through racial bias training. The move has drawn jeers, but Andrew argues it\u2019s a laudable effort \u2014 if only because so few American corporations have been willing to tackle race issues.Having spoken with senior executives at many large American companies, I found it hard to find one that has taken on the issue of race so directly, with so many employees. Other corporations have programs to improve race relations and have spent money on diversity programs, especially for those in the senior ranks. Some, including Facebook and Google, have included implicit bias training. But few, if any, have taken as sweeping an approach as Starbucks will on Tuesday.All eyes have been on the E.U.\u2019s sweeping new digital privacy rules. But an even stricter set of laws known as ePrivacy \u2014 meant to come in at the same time as the General Data Protection Regulation, but slowed down by disagreements among officials \u2014 could give tech companies still larger headaches.The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users\u2019 electronic communications: obtaining consumers\u2019 explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.Unsurprisingly, companies and trade associations are trying to derail those rules.C.E.O. Adam Neumann, who has 65 percent voting control, is one of two members of his board\u2019s compensation committee, along with longtime company investor Benchmark, according to WeWork\u2019s recent bond-offering documents.Venture capitalists have surrendered some oversight of many companies they\u2019ve invested in just to maintain relationships with them.\u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018The Color of Pomegranates,\u2019 the Cinema of the Cryptic", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVDCompleted in 1968 but not seen abroad for more than a decade thereafter, the film is newly available in a 4K digital restoration on Blu-ray from Criterion that can also be streamed on FilmStruck. The color is richer and the gradation considerably subtler, and, since the restoration is Parajanov\u2019s original cut, the running time is 10 minutes shorter than the Kino version released in 2001.In \u201cThe Color of Pomegranates,\u201d Sayat Nova\u2019s poems are seen rather than heard. There is some voice-over but little dialogue in an ebb-and-flow soundtrack that alternates wailing folk melodies with choral chanting. The film draws on Sayat Nova\u2019s imagery: angels with flat halos and wooden wings, a pasteboard cloud descending as a vision, the constant repetition of key props including books, silver balls and ornate rugs. Fruits seem to bleed and books to weep. Animals, particularly goats and sheep, are ubiquitous. Impassive actors engage in dancelike gestures while staring straight into the camera.Still, \u201cThe Color of Pomegranates\u201d was not without its antecedents in Soviet cinema. Parajanov\u2019s immersion in folk culture recalls that of his teacher, the Ukrainian director Aleksandr Dovzhenko, and his stylized performances suggest those in Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s \u201cIvan the Terrible.\u201d Parajanov\u2019s choice of subject matter might have been a response to Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s \u201cAndrei Rublev,\u201d about the Russian religious iconographer; more startling is his kinship to American avant-garde filmmakers like Kenneth Anger, Maya Deren, Gregory Markopoulos and Jack Smith, or the theater artists Robert Wilson and Richard Foreman.While these affinities testify to Parajanov\u2019s centrality as a 20th-century visual artist, \u201cThe Color of Pomegranates\u201d is in no way derivative. The movie is one of a kind \u2014 an exotic pageant executed with grace, gravity and a breathtaking modesty of means.Mr. Birri, who has been called the founder of the New Latin American Cinema, was influenced by Italian neorealism and British social documentaries, and made hybrid, politically charged movies that employed nonactors in actual circumstances. After establishing Argentina\u2019s first film school, he went into exile first in Brazil, then Italy and, finally, after completing \u201cORG,\u201d in Cuba.According to Mr. Birri, \u201cORG\u201d is composed of 26,625 separate shots. The cascade of flickering, sometimes unreadable images is so unremitting, despite long stretches of an utterly blank screen, as to be nearly ungraspable. The visual material is culled from comic strips, street demonstrations, Cuban movie posters and filmed be-ins; the technique encompasses collages, stick figure animations, shadow plays and kaleidoscopic special effects. The soundtrack is a m\u00e9lange of grunted sound poems, inexplicable beeps, muttered New Left slogans, (\u201cour homeland is the whole world; our law is liberty\u201d), opera, free-form jazz, \u201cThe Internationale,\u201d and what the subtitles term \u201cuntranslatable Neapolitan cursing.\u201d The spaghetti western star Terence Hill is a principal actor (and the film\u2019s producer); Gautama Buddha and Salvador Allende are among several historical figures who make cameo appearances.According to Mr. Birri, who described \u201cORG\u201d as \u201ca nightmare with closed eyes,\u201d the film was originally intended as an installation. It is crude, relentless and combative \u2014 less \u201ca slap in the face of public taste,\u201d as the Russian Futurists would say, than everything but the kitchen sink hurled at viewers\u2019 heads.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Metrics Are Everywhere in Media. Here\u2019s How They Help.", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Kathy Zhang, a newsroom and product analytics manager, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.Your team helps Times reporters analyze data about stories and readers. What kind of tech do you use to do that, and what information do you review? The Times uses a few different technologies to measure readership and behavior within our website and apps. The primary tool we use is an internal analytics system that powers the bulk of our analysis and dashboards. This system also underpins a newsroom tool called Stela, which provides story- and department-level analytics snapshots.We also use tools like Chartbeat and Google Analytics for the same purposes, because they have user interfaces that non-analysts can also use to inform their work. Editors use Chartbeat to understand real-time readership of our stories and Google Analytics to pull trends and reports over a longer period of time.What do you like about the tools, and what could be better?All of these tools hold essentially the same information, so it really comes down to personal preference and familiarity with the data and functions. Some of these tools may be better to use, depending on the questions I\u2019m trying to answer.I run Google Analytics training sessions for the newsroom, and something I try to make clear is that learning how to use the tool \u2014 in terms of which buttons to click and which settings to modify \u2014 is going to get us only so far. Understanding the underlying data and which pieces of it will answer your question will always be more important. Simply figuring out the number of pageviews any story received is easy. Trying to place that metric in context of what we might expect for that story is more difficult, because many factors play into the pageviews and reach of what any one story achieves.We need to consider the promotion strategy behind the story. Did we give the story prominent placement on the home screen? Did our social media team post it to Facebook? Did we share it in any newsletters? We also need to consider the kind of story it is. Is it breaking news? Is it an investigative story? Is it a movie review? The timeliness of the story is another consideration. Is the story pegged to a news event where we would expect nearly all of the traffic to come in on the first day? Or is it a story we would expect more of a long tail for because it\u2019s service journalism or a piece that would sustain steady search traffic?The tools we use all have their pros and cons. As frustrated as I sometimes get navigating suboptimal user interfaces, they\u2019re all solid tools for the work we do and serve different (although often overlapping) purposes.Do analytics help the Times better serve readers, or do they just make us obsessed with pageviews?Several of the masthead editors like to say that The Times strives to be data informed rather than data driven, which I think is an important distinction. We don\u2019t let pageviews dictate our coverage or approach, but we do use data to understand reader engagement and the reach of our stories. Our reporters\u2019 and editors\u2019 news judgment remains the driving force behind the decisions we make for story promotion and distribution. If the story is important, we get it out in front of our readers through prominent home screen placement, push alerts, social media posts and more.But analytics allow us to serve our audience better. Seeing our online readership shift from a predominantly desktop audience to a much larger smartphone audience underscored the need for our product and technology teams to prioritize mobile-first story forms. Looking at page speed allows us to prioritize making our pages load faster so people don\u2019t need to wait to read our stories.Editors are some of our best analytics consumers. They constantly monitor our dashboards to make real-time judgments about how best to engage our readers. News desk editors modify headlines and packaging to draw attention to stories. Search specialists take advantage of trending search terms to expose our stories to a wider audience. Social media editors follow the conversation and find the best moments to showcase our journalism. Analytics are crucial to the full life cycle of our coverage.Though many lament that access to analytics can make a publication hyper-focused on pageview volume to the detriment of reader engagement, at The Times we\u2019re cognizant of those pitfalls, and we structure our analyses to avoid them. The close partnership our newsroom editors have with the analytics team makes both our editors and our analysts think smarter about what our data tells us and how we can best deliver our journalism.Outside of work, what tech product are you using a lot?I was very late to the e-reader wave, but I purchased a Kindle at the beginning of the year and I absolutely love it. After a bit of research, I settled on the Paperwhite and find it incredibly convenient. I can use it one-handed, so it\u2019s easier to read on the train than a physical book. It\u2019s small enough to fit in my coat pocket, so I can get a bit of reading in when I\u2019m standing in line at the grocery store.One of the best things about the Kindle and e-readers in general is their integration with public libraries. Nearly all libraries give their patrons the ability to borrow e-books through an app like Overdrive, Libby or Hoopla. Before I bought my Kindle, I would borrow books from the New York Public Library\u2019s digital library to read on my phone. It\u2019s even better with a dedicated e-reader, because the screen is easier on my eyes and I don\u2019t have other apps to distract me.I credit the Kindle for getting me to read more than I used to. For pre-Kindle me, selecting the next book seemed like such a commitment. If I chose something heavy and serious but I wasn\u2019t in the mood for it, I would carry the book around in my bag for weeks, avoiding it like an email from an ex I had assured we\u2019d stay friends. But now I can carry several books at once and choose something lighthearted or somber or anywhere in between.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Blockchain Building in Bushwick", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom the outside, 304 Troutman Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, looks fairly ordinary. In most ways, it is. But this nondescript three-story, five-unit rental building is part of an experiment in using the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin to transform the New York housing market.\u201cThis is going to be a paradigm shift,\u201d said Mo Shaikh, a founder of Meridio, a Brooklyn-based company looking to introduce blockchain technology to real estate.As a secure, decentralized way to register and store payments and transactions online through \u201csmart contracts,\u201d blockchain technology will give each of the eight investors who currently own the building cryptocurrency tokens that can be traded and secure access to a crypto-protected database that stores individual transaction data. In theory, the technology will make it nearly impossible for hackers to do widespread damage and will protect against the kind of identity theft that conventional investors might be vulnerable to.\u201cBlockchain is just an efficient way of asset exchange: The assets can be cryptocurrency, stocks, bonds, art or real estate,\u201d said Corbin Page, Mr. Shaikh\u2019s partner in Meridio, an offshoot of a larger company called Consensys.Blockchain is best known as the technology behind Bitcoin, but instead of tracking who owns a digital currency, Meridio\u2019s Troutman Street pilot project aims to demonstrate that blockchain can enable online sales of fractional shares of residential or commercial real estate properties.The experiment at Troutman Street is one of many across the country attempting to move real estate records onto blockchain, and it is part of a larger movement in corporate America to transfer all kinds of records onto blockchain. Many of these experiments promise to fundamentally change industries, but many have also been plagued by delays and questions about whether and how they will actually be an improvement on the existing systems.If words like cryptocurrency and blockchain make your eyes glaze over, blockchain boosters point out that a user-friendly system can mean you don\u2019t need to fully understand the technology any more than you understand the programming code that allows you to order from Amazon or follow politics on Facebook. You can buy or sell \u201ctokens\u201d \u2014 which, in this case, represent shares of a building in cryptocurrency \u2014 the same way you would trade online stocks.Meridio\u2019s website will be as easy to use as eTrade and Zillow, Mr. Page said: \u201cWe want it to be for everybody. We will have blockchain in the background, giving the efficiency without it being in your face.\u201dIn real estate deals, he said, blockchain can reduce paperwork and the need for lawyers and other third parties by allowing people to buy and sell portions of buildings more efficiently than by crowdfunding or creating LLCs.Blockchain proselytizers also say that the technology can reduce fraud, speed transactions, lower costs and help democratize real estate.\u201cReal estate has been slow to adopt new technology, and this is bringing energy and excitement, which is welcome in a staid industry,\u201d said Jamie Wiseman, a founder of Cayuga Capital Management, a developer and property manager in Brooklyn and Queens whose holdings include 304 Troutman Street.Doubters, however, point out that fraud cannot be eliminated so easily and that the primitive title recording system in the United States will thwart modernization efforts. They also raise questions about the effect on neighborhood development and gentrification.\u201cI am skeptical of some of the claims about the impact of blockchain\u201d on real estate, said Aaron Wright, a professor who created the Blockchain Project at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and coauthored \u201cBlockchain and the Law: The Rule of Code.\u201dMr. Wright said that the lack of regulation could lead to volatility in trading and cause rapid changes in neighborhoods. And claims that blockchain can dramatically reduce the hundreds of millions of dollars in annual real estate fraud, he added, may be overblown. While blockchain will make information much less vulnerable to hacks and its instantaneous transaction confirmation could cut down on scams, he said, if fraudulent information enters the system, blockchain is not designed to stop it.The revolution, if it comes, will likely be gradual.Mr. Shaikh said they are still teaching Blockchain 101 to most in the real estate industry, through conferences, blog posts and marketing campaigns. And after partnering with the brokerage Cushman & Wakefield, Mr. Page said, it took \u201c20 different conversations to find Cayuga, with executives who understood blockchain\u2019s potential and were willing to act.\u201dCayuga bought 304 Troutman in 2005, and the eight initial investors in the building are now getting cryptocurrency tokens. Starting this summer, they will be able to trade with one another and sell to the tenants there. Meridio is already prepping more properties in New York and beyond, and expects to have them available for trading among accredited investors on their website this summer as well.\u201cWe think blockchain gives us the killer app to make that model work,\u201d Mr. Page said. There are no minimums and trading can be done immediately, with lower costs and possibly without a lawyer.Mr. Shaikh and Mr. Page believe that blockchain will gain traction by allowing people to invest relatively small amounts of money in real estate \u2014 unlike crowdfunding and LLCs, which often require a large minimum investment and have \u201clockup periods\u201d before a property can be flipped. A long with large transfer costs, that has created a high bar for entry to the real estate investment market.Natalia Karayaneva, the chief executive and founder of Propy, another blockchain company, said this fractionalization of properties could allow investors to buy a piece of high-end homes in Manhattan that are often owned by ultra-wealthy foreign oligarchs.But Mr. Wright, the Cardozo professor, offered another perspective: The lack of regulation, he said, could mean that foreigners looking to move money out of their home countries and people with \u201cill-gotten gains\u201d could use the technology to spread their dollars around multiple properties.Ms. Karayaneva and Meridio\u2019s founders, however, believe the fractionalization will bring a bigger and broader pool of capital into real estate. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the money to buy your house or apartment, you can buy a piece of it, allowing you to build wealth,\u201d Mr. Shaikh said. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting for middle-class Americans.\u201dThere are potential pitfalls, of course \u2014 among them, that cryptocurrency has proved quite volatile, and if the value of a home, apartment or retail building were to skyrocket or plummet the way Bitcoin has, the impact could ripple out through an entire neighborhood.\u201cIt depends on how the law plays out with the product, but if there\u2019s massive trading without sensible guardrails there\u2019ll be potential problems with volatility,\u201d Mr. Wright said.Mr. Page argued that the large scale and tangible nature of real estate should make it less volatile than Bitcoin, and Mr. Shaikh said they would consider implementing rules, like one that allows only a certain number of trades on a property per day, to ease concerns.But Mr. Wright pointed out that while more capital pouring in from around the world sounded good, if all those people decided New York was the place to invest and that helped drive prices up for local residents, it would \u201clead to issues on the ground and change the character of a neighborhood.\u201dMr. Wiseman agreed. \u201cBlockchain may bring costs down,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it will accelerate gentrification.\u201dThere is also the possibility that fractionalization could allow communities to band together to battle gentrification, Mr. Page suggested. Community groups or immigrant-centered organizations, he said, could help coordinate neighbors\u2019 efforts to buy up small chunks of apartments or houses, or even commercial real estate.\u201cMaybe that is a solution,\u201d Mr. Wright said, noting that this would have multiple benefits in strengthening a sense of community, although it would take years before it could be widespread.The effects on individual transactions, however, would be more immediate. Mr. Wright recently ran a demonstration in Australia that showed how smart contracts on blockchain could reduce the \u201ccumbersome half-day process\u201d of a transaction to a matter of minutes.\u201cIt was super exciting,\u201d he said, although it would be difficult to implement these changes in the United States, he added, because real estate records here are \u201cvery, very fractured\u201d and governed on a county-by-county basis. \u201cEfforts to even digitize records that started in the 1980s haven\u2019t fully happened yet.\u201dThat is sadly true, said John Mirkovic, deputy recorder of deeds for Cook County, Ill., which ran a pilot program in Chicago that successfully demonstrated how blockchain technology could be used to more safely and efficiently record real estate transactions.But many counties around the country still use paper for record-keeping, Mr. Mirkovic said, while more technologically advanced ones may have upgraded to Windows 95.\u201cGetting people to do something new is not easy,\u201d he said. Still, he added, citizens and politicians should push for blockchain as a \u201cgood government\u201d issue, making it \u201ca populist technology.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

Seconds later, a scene shows a yellow Lamborghini in the middle of a neon star of David. Jets of flame from a massive gold menorah punctuate rapid-fire rhymes about guns, drugs and money.And while videos mixing menorahs and yellow stars of David with guns, sports cars and bikini-clad women pushing wheelbarrows full of cocaine would raise eyebrows anywhere, in today\u2019s Germany they are particularly notable: Elements of the country\u2019s booming rap and hip-hop scene have been criticized as anti-Semitic in recent weeks.Sun Diego\u2019s popularity shows that \u201cYou can\u2019t pigeonhole German rap fans,\u201d a Berlin-based hip-hop critic, Viola Funk, said in an interview. \u201cFans aren\u2019t just interested in the art, but in the person behind it \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s such a great thing when there is an unbelievably popular Jewish rapper.\u201dThe night after the Echo award ceremony, Mr. Chpakov held court in a dimly lit hookah bar in an Essen neighborhood known for its predominantly Arab immigrant population. Perched on the edge of a deep, brocaded couch in the back, the slender, bearded 29-year-old fingered a diamond-encrusted star of David hanging around his neck, glancing up every now and then at scenes replayed from the ceremony on a big-screen TV.To his right was his best friend and unofficial head of security, a hulking Lebanese ex-bouncer named Salah Saado. To his left was a waist-high water pipe, its coals burning low. Wearing \u201cBikini Bottom Mafia\u201d T-shirts (the name of his production company), other members of Mr. Chpakov\u2019s crew lounged on nearby couches.Drawing on the water pipe, Mr. Chpakov (pronounced SHPA-kov) explained that he is not, technically, a German rapper. Born in the Soviet city of Chernovtsy \u2014 once a center of Yiddish culture and now the Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi \u2014 in 1989, he came to Germany at 3 with his mother and grandmother. Being Soviet Jews, they were given refugee status as members of a persecuted religious minority.Twenty-five years later, Mr. Chpakov remains a Ukrainian citizen. He grew up speaking Russian at home and attended synagogue regularly as a child. His early years were marked by poverty, and his stepfather was an abusive, drug-dealing Ukrainian army veteran who spent years in a German prison after convictions for assault and murder, Mr. Chpakov said.Though he is not particularly religious, he said his Jewish identity has always played a role in his life. \u201cI came to Germany with a whole community of people, all of whom knew who I was and where I came from,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re observant or not. I learned as a kid my mother is Jewish, my grandmother is Jewish, my great-grandmother was Jewish \u2014 I\u2019m Jewish by blood. I have no choice.\u201dAs a teenager, Mr. Chpakov ran with a rough crowd, dealing marijuana and running petty scams on the streets of Osnabr\u00fcck, his hometown north of the Ruhr Valley, where he still lives. After an arrest at 15 for theft and fraud, he was sentenced to 400 hours of community service at the city zoo. He dropped out of school not long afterward, working on construction crews while self-producing rap music under the jokey childhood nickname Sun Diego.By 2011, he had built up a modest career as a rapper and producer \u2014 until fans turned on him for being too dance-club friendly. In 2013, he decided to reinvent himself. He donned a SpongeBob SquarePants costume he ordered on Amazon and entered rap battle competitions under the pseudonym SpongeBOZZ.\u201cHe was trying to troll the whole game,\u201d said Konstantin Novotny, a journalist who has written about Sun Diego\u2019s recent popularity for the J\u00fcdische Allgemeine, Germany\u2019s Jewish newspaper. \u201cA skinny guy in a costume, surrounded by insanely expensive cars, rapping about guns and drugs? It was a huge success with younger fans.\u201dMr. Chpakov said his time as SpongeBOZZ was formative. He came to enjoy the anonymity of a cartoon character costume, and still insists on covering his face in videos and photographs.But the costume was also stifling. Mr. Chpakov started thinking about the next act, one that would allow him to scrap the sponge suit. Surveying the German rap scene, he started thinking about a part of his identity he had not engaged with since his childhood.\u201cKids have lots of Muslim, Christian, German, Turkish, American, Lebanese or Kurdish role models,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cBut so far there hasn\u2019t been a Jew people could identify with in the German rap scene. I thought it was time to make an intentional statement.\u201dIn some ways, it was a daring move. German gangsta rap is dominated by Arab and Turkish artists, and reports of anti-Semitism have been on the rise among both immigrant groups and young Germans generations removed from the lessons of World War II. Some of the country\u2019s most popular rappers have put out videos featuring Jewish stereotypes and lyrics drawing on anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.Yet incorporating his Jewish identity into his new persona seemed to intrigue fans, rather than repel them. \u201cWhen I put out the book and the videos, it was like I had been resurrected,\u201d he says. \u201cFinally, I have an identity of my own and can do something with it.\u201dJakob Baier, a political scientist who studies anti-Semitism in German rap music, says Sun Diego\u2019s embrace of Judaism overturns stereotypes still common in German society. \u201cHe\u2019s turned the anti-Jewish resentments around \u2014 \u2018I\u2019m Jewish, but I\u2019m not weak. I wear a star of David not as a stigma, but as a symbol of self-empowerment,\u2019\u201d Mr. Baier said.Music critics have taken a dimmer view, panning the songs as clich\u00e9d, misogynistic and offensive. The German magazine Der Spiegel accused him of \u201cethno-marketing,\u201d calling the over-the-top Jewish imagery in Sun Diego\u2019s videos a tasteless attempt to capitalize on his background. (Jewish leaders, however, have not made a fuss.)Mr. Chpakov finds the criticism frustrating, mirroring taunts he heard at school as a child. \u201cNo one in Germany lets you forget: \u2018Jew, Jew, Jew,\u2019\u201d he said, jabbing at the smoke-filled air over the hookah for effect. \u201cFor the Muslim rappers it\u2019s the same: \u2018Muslim, Muslim, Muslim.\u2019 No wonder we all embrace our identities in our music. For me it\u2019s my experience as a child, as a Jew. The Muslims wrap themselves in Palestinian flags. I\u2019ve got a neon star of David.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the location of Osnabr\u00fcck. It is north of the Ruhr Valley; it is not in the valley itself.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "8 Cheap, Landlord-Friendly Ways to Upgrade Your Rental", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you rent your house or apartment, your home renovation options are limited. You probably don\u2019t want to spend thousands upgrading your kitchen, for example, only to move out in a few years \u2014 and risk losing your deposit. Your landlord might not want you tearing out that bathroom tile, even if it is terribly outdated.\u201cReplace and match the hardware on your cabinets, doors and furniture with unusual alternatives,\u201d she said. \u201c Try leather pulls, stone, glass pulls, or classy acrylic and metal combos for a unique alternative to the stainless steel everyone gets.\u201dFor an even easier project, simply swap out the light bulbs. Changing the brightness and temperature of your bulbs can completely change the look of a room, and you can find information about both brightness and temperature directly on the bulb box.While you\u2019re thinking about changing the bulbs, consider upgrading to smart lighting. You get the benefit of light bulbs you can change to different colors, control with an app on your phone or tablet, or even by voice control like Alexa on the Amazon Echo, or by saying \u201cHey, Google\u201d to your Google Home.He also explained that even if you use lamps, smart lights can be set up in groups that give you the ability to turn off all the lights in a room \u2014 or your whole home \u2014 before bed. Best of all, you can get all of those features and then take them with you when it\u2019s time to move.If your rental comes with old, outdated electrical and light switch plates, it\u2019s easy enough to replace those, and most plates will cost you less than $5 apiece.Keep the old outlets on hand and replace them when you move out. Along with the other fixtures you replace, you can take them with you to the next place you rent.Most kitchen and bathroom sink faucets are also relatively easy to replace. When replacing a faucet, first identify the mounting type:Once you find another faucet you like that fits that mounting type, the box should include instructions to replace your old one. You\u2019ll need to shut off the water flowing to the sink, remove the water lines, and connect them to the new sink.While you\u2019re upgrading your bathroom, shower heads are even easier to install. Using a pair of pliers, remove the old shower head and the Teflon tape around it, apply new tape, then use the pliers to thread on your new shower head fixture.Check with your landlord on this one, but if your rental doesn\u2019t come with crown molding or you just want to replace what you have, you can install this yourself and completely change the look of a room.\u201cAdding border trim as a baseboard, crown molding, or a chair rail (wall trim) can subtly add a refined look to any room without breaking the bank,\u201d Ms. Reiner said. \u201cEven adding trim and building out the frame and depth of your window frames or the face of your doors will instantly upgrade the look and feel of a space.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have to be a gaudy, Victorian style molding; a simple and single shape, single depth piece of molding will do the trick,\u201d Ms. Reiner added.\u201cThe renovation project is quick, mess-free and only takes a couple of minutes,\u201d Ms. Bowker said. \u201cThe stickers are easy to clean and can be efficiently removed by using some heat with a hair dryer and they peel off.\u201dYou can add some uniqueness to a cookie-cutter apartment with a feature wall: a wall that\u2019s decorated in such a way that it stands out and immediately catches your attention. You can achieve this with a simple coat of paint in a bold color or a gallery of photos, for example.For less than $50 and 60 minutes, you can replace your rental\u2019s well-worn toilet seat. That said, it\u2019s easier and more affordable than you might think to swap out the entire toilet, and it will instantly make your bathroom feel just a little less lived-in (always a good thing).Check with your landlord to make sure it\u2019s O.K., but chances are, they\u2019ll be happy to have you upgrade their rental. You might even try haggling this upgrade into your lease \u2014 save yourself some work and ask your landlord if the toilet can be replaced before you move in.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Battle for Control of CBS, With Far-Reaching Consequences", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIt\u2019s no secret that the proposed reunion of CBS and Viacom hasn\u2019t been a Hollywood romance. But simmering tensions erupted into open warfare this week, with far more at stake than control of two legendary entertainment companies.No matter who emerges the victor in what promises to be a prolonged series of courtroom showdowns, both companies will be profoundly affected, and the broader media landscape fundamentally transformed.The CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves and the company\u2019s board launched the opening salvo on Monday, filing suit to prevent Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of both CBS and Viacom, from firing CBS directors before they could dilute her voting rights and strip her of control \u2014 a step they plan to take Thursday, provided that a judge in Delaware allows it.Although the two sides had been negotiating over how much CBS should pay for Viacom, and who should be in charge after the merger, control is the real issue. The CBS board and management \u201chave simply become uncomfortable with the reality that CBS has a controlling stockholder,\u201d Ms. Redstone asserted in a response to the suit.For its part, CBS said it\u2019s simply adhering to the principle that the company \u201cshould be and would be governed for the benefit of the company and all its shareholders, not just the controlling stockholder.\u201d It is a principle CBS said had been endorsed by Sumner Redstone, Shari\u2019s 94-year-old father, who long controlled both CBS and Viacom.The interests of CBS shareholders other than Ms. Redstone might well include considering a takeover offer, especially in light of a rapidly consolidating media and communications landscape. Since talk of reuniting Viacom and CBS first surfaced two years ago, AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner (a deal awaiting a court ruling on an antitrust challenge), Disney has reached a deal to buy much of 21st Century Fox, and Netflix and Amazon have emerged as fully integrated distributors and content producers.CBS executives were incensed that Ms. Redstone rebuffed an approach from Lloyd C. McAdam, chairman and chief executive of Verizon Communications, roughly a year ago, thereby \u201cdepriving CBS stockholders of a potentially value-enhancing opportunity,\u201d CBS said in its complaint.While the exact nature of that conversation remains in dispute, the Redstone entity that controls CBS, National Amusements, has made clear its categorical opposition to any takeover. As said in a 2016 letter to the boards of both CBS and Viacom, \u201cTo avoid any doubt, National Amusements is not willing to accept or support (i) any acquisition by a third party of either company or (ii) any transaction that would result in National Amusements surrendering its controlling position in either company or not controlling the combined company.\u201dThe issue of control often looms large at companies with dual-class share systems. Controlling shareholders often want to maintain managerial control \u2014 that\u2019s often why they establish the dual-class structure in the first place \u2014 while public shareholders often hope to sell to the highest bidder.Although dual-class share structures are controversial and have long been opposed by shareholder-rights advocates, they have been growing in popularity, especially in Silicon Valley. Entrepreneurial founders are often reluctant to cede control; Facebook, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet and Snap are all dual-class share companies. But so are Berkshire Hathaway, Ford Motor, Comcast and The New York Times Company.Should CBS ultimately prevail in what would be a highly unusual attempt to dilute a controlling shareholder, a bevy of dual-class companies will no doubt be scrambling to rewrite their bylaws.The conflict is magnified in this instance because Ms. Redstone is the controlling shareholder in both parties to the proposed merger.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the Redstones have a clear conflict of interest in this situation,\u201d said Margaret Blair, a professor and expert in corporate governance at Vanderbilt University School of Law. \u201cThe law is very clear that the authority for running the corporation lies with the board. If the board feels the controlling shareholder is interfering with the best interest of the other shareholders, courts will defer to the board, and I think they should.\u201d(At a hearing on Wednesday, a judge in Delaware granted CBS\u2019s request for the temporary restraining order. The judge is expected to issue a more expansive ruling on Thursday concerning whether the result of the CBS board\u2019s planned vote will be allowed to go into effect.)Such cases are rare, because directors who dare to defy a controlling shareholder\u2019s wishes, as the CBS directors have done, can simply be replaced. There was widespread amazement on Wall Street this week that Ms. Redstone hadn\u2019t sensed the rebellion coming, and moved to replace the CBS directors or curtail their powers. Now her hands are tied, at least temporarily.Ms. Redstone has been at the center of a drawn-out soap opera over control of the media empire forged by her father, the ailing Mr. Redstone.After years of being estranged from her father and isolated from the family business, Ms. Redstone was thrust unexpectedly into the role of media mogul after she reconciled with her father, ousted his two girlfriends from his Beverly Hills mansion, and gained control of the family trust that controls National Amusements and, in turn, CBS and Viacom.Ms. Redstone has gone on a crash course in media management, lunching with other media executives and showing up at the Sun Valley conference and other media watering holes. By all accounts, she\u2019s taken on the task with a level of enthusiasm and determination that rivals her father. Still, there\u2019s nothing in her experience that would typically qualify her to run major media companies.The Harvard Law School professor Lucian A. Bebchuk used the Redstone example in an argument that dual-share class structures typically outlive their utility, and should be phased out by a company at some point. \u201cConcerns about the emergence of inferior leadership over time are further aggravated when the dual-class structure enables a transfer of the founder\u2019s lock on control to an heir who might be unfit to lead the company,\u201d he wrote last year in an article titled \u201cThe Untenable Case for Perpetual Dual-Class Stock\u201d in Virginia Law Review. He cited a \u201cwide range of distorted choices\u201d that are \u201caimed at increasing private benefits of control at the expense of the value received by other shareholders.\u201dCBS hasn\u2019t said exactly why the special committee formed to evaluate and negotiate the potential merger with Viacom finally decided this past weekend that such a deal wasn\u2019t in the best interest of CBS shareholders other than Ms. Redstone, but it isn\u2019t hard to see what their objections might be.Investors other than the Redstones have long opposed the idea \u2014 every time there were reports the deal was off, including this week, CBS shares jumped. A chorus of analysts has criticized the deal. One called the merger a potential \u201cdisaster\u201d for CBS.People close to CBS told me this week that the company was never enthusiastic about the potential combination, and agreed to consider it largely as a courtesy to Ms. Redstone. They said CBS alone is a very attractive company, either as a takeover candidate for a large telecom company like Verizon, or as a stand-alone content creator.Though CBS faces the same advertising challenges as the other broadcast networks, analysts have praised Mr. Moonves for positioning CBS for the digital era. He\u2019s not only kept CBS the No. 1 broadcast network in prime time for the past nine years, but also executed a successful direct-to-consumer streaming strategy.\u201cFrom CBS\u2019s perspective, you\u2019ve got to be pretty happy with your business,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst for Cowen & Co. \u201cWhy would you want to complicate it?\u201dFor its part, Viacom, after years of turmoil, seems to have stabilized under the leadership of its new chief executive, Robert M. Bakish, who has emerged as a favorite of Ms. Redstone\u2019s. (Ms. Redstone has pushed to have him play a meaningful role in the merged companies, either as a high-level executive or as a board member.) But so far this year, Viacom\u2019s Paramount movie studio accounted for less than 6 percent of the domestic box office. Disney, the market leader, had over 34 percent.Still, people at CBS told me that while they wouldn\u2019t mind gaining control of the Paramount studio, they have little or no interest in Viacom\u2019s traditional cable networks, including MTV, VH1 and Comedy Central. Those are suffering acutely from the cord cutting that is afflicting the entire cable industry. (Mr. Creutz, the analyst, described Viacom\u2019s cable assets as a \u201cmelting ice cube.\u201d)Given the level of acrimony that has erupted this week from CBS\u2019s move \u2014 National Amusements said it was \u201coutraged\u201d and Ms. Redstone was described as \u201cshocked, disappointed and upset\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine any amicable settlement. That leaves two potential outcomes: If Ms. Redstone prevails, Mr. Moonves and his team would be out, marking the end of an era at CBS. It would presumably fall to the relatively untested Mr. Bakish to merge the two companies and soldier on at a perilous time for cable and broadcasting operations.If CBS wins, and Ms. Redstone\u2019s control is diluted, the Redstone era will come to an end, and with it the likelihood that either CBS or Viacom will last long as independent companies. Viacom is so small and weak that it would need a rescuer, probably at a lower price than CBS was being asked to pay. And CBS would be free to pursue a merger with someone like Verizon, or go it alone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Advertising History Says About the Future of Fake News", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIt showed President Barack Obama giving a speech he never gave, and uttering sentences that he didn\u2019t actually say. The video demonstrated how easy it is to use current technology to create powerful and persuasive lies, now also known as fake news.When this video magic is coupled with the ability of companies like Facebook to micro-target each of us and select the news we see, the implications for the future of our democracy seem dire. Fake news and microtargeting can be combined to create a kind of advertising that\u2019s like an evil version of Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, and we are being exposed to more of these pernicious morsels every year.But two lessons from the history of advertising suggest that the fake news phenomenon is likely to change significantly in the years to come. Prospects are gloomy for the near future, as this kind of advertising extends beyond politics. History also suggests, though, that the danger will probably recede over time as people grow accustomed to the ads, which will cease to work as effectively.First, in all likelihood, fake news will spread, despite efforts to rein it in. So far, most attention has focused on efforts to meddle in American elections. That is no small threat.Yet, based on the historical record, far more effort goes into persuading Americans to buy things than to elect politicians.We are already seeing technology being used to shade the truth in advertising that targets consumers.I did a Google search for \u201cbest inflatable kayak\u201d and was confronted by a blend of results that can be hard for a consumer to decipher. As expected, the choices that popped up included paid ads for kayaks that were being sold and some real reviews of kayaks. But there were also as a series of seemingly objective product-review sites that, on closer inspection, mainly contained product descriptions and links to buy items like kayaks from Amazon and other vendors.Such blurring of the distinctions between expert reviews and explicit ads provides a ripe circumstance for the rise of advertising that is less than totally transparent.The fake expert recommended that students try to refinance their loans, which was helpful to the business of LendEDU. Drew Cloud has disappeared, and LendEDU has apologized for its deception, but the problem is certain to continue.Expect to hear from the Drew Clouds of kayaks, mutual funds, laundry detergent and anything you might spend money on. Fake celebrity endorsements, altered product videos, bogus reviews and testimonials can\u2019t be far off.We have relied on the law to protect us from advertising fraud but, as we learned after the last election cycle, the more numerous and micro-targeted the ads become, the harder they are to monitor. That\u2019s a recipe for more trouble.Voters get lots of robocalls around election time, but the volume is modest compared with the number of calls about credit cards, vacation deals and loans.Given the trends, the future looks grim. But before abandoning hope, remember that the history of advertising also teaches that when people get used to ads, the ads stop working.As with special effects in movies, consumers become desensitized to ads the more they see them. The scary creatures from 1950s films, the shark in \u201cJaws\u201d or the spaceships from science-fiction movies of the 1990s now often look like jokes.That\u2019s why political consultants say straightforward TV ads no longer work. People tune them out.As technology develops, the same wearout effect is likely to occur with advertising based on fake news. As we are inundated with new, targeted, deceptive ads, we may get sick of them and, perhaps, stop finding them persuasive. For now, it\u2019s the best hope we have.Austan Goolsbee, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, was an adviser to President Barack Obama.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall Street Gains Ground Under the New Volcker Rule: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump is imposing tariffs on China. Again.\u2022 What deal makers can learn from Bayer\u2019s new antitrust agreement.The public has two defenses against recklessness on Wall Street \u2013 regulations and the regulators themselves. Now, with the Trump administration\u2019s rule loosening in full swing, the public can only hope that the men and women who oversee the big banks are up to their jobs.Federal regulators on Wednesday proposed a sweeping set of changes that would relax the Volcker rule, a major regulation introduced after the financial crisis of 2008 to stop taxpayer-protected banks from speculating for their own profit.The rule, which came into effect in 2015, was always going to create some headaches. Banks trade regularly to meet the demands of customers and to hedge their own risks. The Volcker rule allows that sort of trading, but regulators had to have ways of making sure a bank wasn\u2019t speculating for its own gain under the guise of serving customers or hedging. To do that, the final rule included requirements that effectively forced banks to show that they were only doing the legitimate types of trading. Banks complained about the rule\u2019s complexity, and regulators said it was hard to enforce. The changes proposed on Wednesday give the banks considerable new leeway.Here are three ways in which traders gain ground.\u2022 Currently, a bank\u2019s short-term trading positions are at the outset presumed to be in violation of the rule, and banks must show that the positions were held to serve customers or hedge. The new Volcker rule presumes compliance. The balance of power will tip immediately to traders from regulators.\u2022 Under the Volcker rule now, banks have to show that trading positions held for customers are in line with what those customers\u2019 might actually demand in the near term. Assessing a legitimate level of demand can be difficult. Customers\u2019 appetites can change quickly \u2013 and the metrics used to predict demand were complex. To try and simplify this exercise, the new rule would allow banks to establish ahead of time the \u201crisk limits,\u201d or position sizes, they set for each trading desk. If a bank does not exceed those limits, they would be presumed to have a position that meets customer demand. Regulators on Wednesday said they would try to make sure that the banks\u2019 risk limits was in fact in line with customer demand, but the change clearly gives the initiative to the banks.In theory, as they relaxed the Volcker rule, regulators could have found simple new ways to increase the chances of compliance. For instance, they could have strengthened the part of the rule that requires C.E.O.s to attest that their banks are in compliance with the Volcker rule. But no changes appear to give it more bite.Some of the regulators argue that the Volcker rule was overly prescriptive and that the changes make it more like other banking rules, which, in their opinion, they enforce effectively. Indeed, on a conference call on Wednesday officials said the changes would make it easier to ensure banks comply.But the rank and file regulators can be expected to follow the lead of the political appointees who lead the agencies. If those people want to give the banks a break, the changes to the Volcker rule would clear the way for such a bonanza. \u201cThe proposed changes also put a lot of faith in banks\u2019 own internal risk models and put the onus on Trump-appointed regulators to vigorously police trading activities \u2014 a task I\u2019m not confident they are up for,\u201d Gregg Gelzinis, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said.- Peter EavisStorm clouds are gathering over the global economy, threatening a recovery that seemed to be gaining strength just a few months ago. The winners of Italy\u2019s election are at loggerheads with the E.U.; President Trump is stirring up trouble with America\u2019s biggest trading partners; and the markets and economies of developing countries once again look vulnerable.Blame the trilemma. The \u2026 what?He on Tuesday acknowledged that Italy is facing the trilemma:Here\u2019s how it works.For years, a country may have elected governments that accepted rules entwining it with other economies, reducing its national sovereignty. Italy accepted the fiscal and financial requirements of being part of the E.U., while the U.S. mostly embraced the free trade rules of the postwar era. But then governments came to power in Italy and the U.S. that questioned whether all that international integration was actually good for their respective countries.The United States is probably big enough that it can pull back from international trade agreements without causing itself severe near-term pain. But Italy is in a much weaker position, as the recent sell-off in Italian government bonds shows. Pressure from investors and leaders within the E.U. may well persuade Italy to back away from policies that diverge from the bloc\u2019s orthodoxy. But abiding by the E.U.\u2019s rules may not stimulate Italy\u2019s economy. That could, in turn, increase support for the populists.As Mr. Rodrik wrote:Finally, we can downgrade our ambitions with respect to how much international economic integration we can (or should) achieve. So we go for a limited version of globalization, which is what the postwar Bretton Woods regime was about (with its capital controls and limited trade liberalization). It has unfortunately become a victim of its own success. We have forgotten the compromise embedded in that system, and which was the source of its success.\u2014 Peter EavisHighly targeted research efforts and global collaboration are toward the top of the nation\u2019s checklist for dominating the world of technology.Nothing particularly new there, really. But he also explained some of his plans for making sure that China dominates the R.&D. underpinning those technologies.Part of that includes a focus on basic scientific research into carefully chosen areas with clear, real-world applications \u2014 a \u201cproblem-oriented\u201d approach, as he put it. Much of that might be done at a series of new national laboratories, which will focus on those themes.Also interesting was his insistence that seeking talent and collaborating with other nations would be a vital part of China\u2019s success. He said that solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems,from climate change to food security, would require a global effort. And he called out human talent as a precious resource, and an area in which, he feels China, still lags.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeBeyond scoring points on Twitter, Sanofi inserted itself into the broader issue of how companies should respond to social justice issues.Sanofi\u2019s tweet isn\u2019t nearly the same broad gesture as those. But it shows that the company is engaging in the debate on social issues all the same.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2014 Michael de la MercedOne day you\u2019re earning $1.5 million per year, the next the figure has $10.9 million. According to the WSJ, that\u2019s what happened to David King, the C.E.O. of the health care diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America.At least 16 companies in the S&P 500 have changed 2016 pay figures by more than 10 percent for one or more executives, while 17 did so for 2015 pay, a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from MyLogIQ LLC shows.Many changes, like LabCorp\u2019s, are errors caught after companies send proxies to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others can reflect changes in how the company decides to present the perks it has provided. In at least one case, the revised figure was the result of a retroactive pay cut.Microsoft\u2019s leapfrogging Alphabet in market value and new hardware from Nvidia are the latest signs that democratizing artificial intelligence tools is a lucrative business.The world is rapt by A.I. and the way it could be used to transform all kinds of industries. The problem: The technology requires stacks of computing power and significant expertise. So some companies have been creating A.I. software that\u2019s easier to use, then hosting it on their own cloud servers so people can pay for just the processing that they need to do, rather than shelling out for their own exotic hardware.That will allow other organizations to build more capable cloud A.I. systems and benefit from the wind filling Microsoft\u2019s sails.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeInvestors have suddenly shifted away from riskier investments like stocks and commodities and taken refuge in the relative safety of German and American government bonds, the United States dollar and the Japanese yen.Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone and has one of the largest piles of public debt in the world. A crisis there could endanger banks and investment portfolios everywhere.Elsewhere in tradeThe bottom line from the Justice Department\u2019s approval of Bayer\u2019s $66 billion deal for Monsanto: The department wants asset sales, not behavioral changes, in exchange for approving mergers.The question now: Will the cancellation lead to a big conservative backlash \u2014 perhaps led by President Trump, a supporter of Ms. Barr?\u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "America Last: Trump\u2019s Attack on the Amazon Job Machine", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterPresident Trump has declared war on Amazon, the nation\u2019s second most valuable company. Amazon is creating more jobs than all but a handful of entire states. And nearly every major city in the country is vying to land the second headquarters of this global retailer and the 50,000 high-paying positions it promises to bring.It is perhaps the biggest job engine in the United States, and the president is using the power of his office to hurt it. And he\u2019s doing this while going out of his way to help Chinese jobs, those at the rogue telecom giant ZTE.But let\u2019s back up and take a look at the Amazon assaults. For added perspective, just substitute \u201cObama\u201d for \u201cTrump\u201d and consider how it would look.Amazon is no saint, certainly, with low wages at some warehouses and a business strategy that has hurt many small retailers while helping others. All the major tech companies could use a clamp of regulation to restrain their intrusions into daily life and commerce. But Mr. Trump isn\u2019t the least bit concerned about any of that. Those issues are too complex for him.He sees the world as a brute with power. Everything goes through a love-me, hate-me prism. Sycophants are rewarded. Dissidents are crushed. Diplomacy, as he just showed with his laughable, incoherent dance with North Korea, is much harder.But the more likely reason Trump hates Bezos is that he owns The Washington Post, which has a much different way of covering the president than Fox News, where Trump gets most of his misinformation.\u201cHe\u2019s off the hook on this,\u201d Vanity Fair quoted one insider as saying. \u201cIt\u2019s war.\u201dThis is what unrestrained strongmen do: use the state to punish \u2014 or silence \u2014 their enemies. It\u2019s the same thing Trump is doing by demanding that the Justice Department investigate the people who are investigating him.Autocrats reward friends. In Trump\u2019s promising to lift restrictions on ZTE \u2014 which was punished for doing business with North Korea and Iran \u2014 the United States got completely rolled by China. But in turn, China put money on the table that would help the Trump family business. Country last, Trump first.When Trump was just a no-class developer who used his private fixers to go after his enemies, and lied five ways before breakfast, it was of no consequence to the rest of us. No more.\u201cIf our leaders seek to conceal the truth, or we as people become accepting of alternative realities that are no longer grounded in facts, then we as American citizens are on a path to relinquishing our freedom.\u201dSo said former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. It was too little, too late. But better than the complicity-by-silence of Republicans in Congress. Paul Ryan, your spine is calling you. Mitch McConnell, your past words are here for pickup and in need of some defense.Anyone who thought autocracy would arrive with back-room deals or sleight-of-hand machinations at midnight should think again. Trump crosses a new line every week, in plain sight. Democracy dies in sunlight.Advertisement"}

That tax currently only applies to items bought overseas costing more than 1,000 Australian dollars ($754).Rebecca Wong, a visually impaired Sydney resident, said she feared she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the talking MP3 player that helps her choose and listen to music.\u201cThe companies which produce these sorts of goods often don\u2019t ship directly to Australia, or shipping is prohibitively expensive,\u201d she said.

Countries around the world were \u201csimply facing the same challenges about how to raise this form of revenue in a global economy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been argued that this is like an import tariff, but for years in Australia we\u2019ve had something of a reverse: Local retailers paying a tax that foreign retailers haven\u2019t,\u201d he added.That view was echoed by Mark Rubbo, the managing director of Readings, a Melbourne bookshop chain.\u201cI\u2019ve been pushing for this for years,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cRetailers like Amazon and their subsidiary the Book Depository have been able to avoid collecting G.S.T. from Australian customers whereas we are legally bound to collect, so immediately we are at a disadvantage.\u201dMs. Wong, the visually impaired Amazon customer, said the company\u2019s main site offered products she just couldn\u2019t get from Australian retailers, including many designed to help visually impaired people like her.In a statement about the change, Amazon said it regretted \u201cany inconvenience this may cause customers.\u201d It also said that in addition to the 60 million items available on the Australian site, \u201cthe global store will allow Australian customers to shop on amazon.com.au for over four million items that were previously only accessible from amazon.com.\u201dDr. Minifie, the economist, said that Amazon would probably continue to build a healthy customer base in Australia despite the change.\u201cAmazon\u2019s huge scale leaves them in a far better position\u201d than other overseas-based retailers, he said. \u201cA lot of smaller online retailers overseas are going to find the new tax an additional layer of complexity.\u201d\u201cThe trade-off here is that the government can make the playing field totally neutral as to whether you are buying overseas or locally, though at some cost to the consumer,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s get to it.Instagram is threatening to block me and many others in Europe out of its app if I don\u2019t acknowledge new privacy settings. I had a similar dance with Facebook and Twitter recently. The notices are a result of a European data-privacy law called the General Data Protection Regulation, known as G.D.P.R., going into effect on May 25.The disclosures will provide an inside look at the dossiers companies compile about us. Privacy groups, seeing an opportunity, are planning to submit data requests on people\u2019s behalf and file class-action-style complaints when they spot wrongdoing.As we\u2019ve seen with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, shame can be a more efficient method for changing a company\u2019s behavior than any legal proceeding.A long-running sore spot in the European tech scene is the region\u2019s lack of large, globally-influential technology companies to match the likes of Alphabet, Uber, Alibaba or Tencent.People disagree on whether this is a good use of taxpayer money, but to keep up with the United States and China, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, many European policymakers don\u2019t think they have a choice.Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm that has been embroiled in a data-harvesting scandal, said on Wednesday that it would cease operations and file for bankruptcy.Cambridge Analytica said it was being punished for common practices in the online advertising industry. It\u2019s a deflection, sure, but also not entirely wrong.Facebook said it began an investigation to find other groups that used data-harvesting tactics similar to those employed by Cambridge Analytica. If Mark Zuckerberg wants to make good on his pledge to be more open and transparent, he\u2019ll make the findings public, even if it\u2019s not flattering for Facebook.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Philip Roth\u2019s Newark, the Hometown He Never Really Left", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 Roberta Harrington, a retired nurse of the same vintage as Philip Roth, remembers a visit a year ago by Mr. Roth to his clapboard boyhood home, which she now lives in, on Summit Avenue. He recalled with pleasure the many times that as a child \u201che\u2019d run up the stairs and come back down again\u201d just for the fun of it and how he prized a cherry tree that was no longer there.In his breakthrough debut novella, \u201cGoodbye, Columbus,\u201d his alter ego Neil Klugman, working at the Newark Public Library for a summer, is bewitched by the fetching and much better-heeled Brenda Patimkin. In \u201cAmerican Pastoral,\u201d another Roth stand-in, Nathan Zuckerman, idolizes Swede Levov, the star athlete of Weequahic High School, a character based on the school\u2019s real-life star athlete when Mr. Roth attended in the 1940s. His last novel, \u201cNemesis,\u201d recalls the panic that enveloped his tightly knit Jewish neighborhood in 1944 when a polio epidemic maimed and paralyzed some of its children.Mr. Roth was regarded with Saul Bellow, John Updike and one or two others as the titans of American literature of the second half of the 20th century. He earned that regard, in part, by milking the everyday people, buildings, streets and mores of the humble Weequahic neighborhood and other city landmarks, often with palpable and wistful affection.Nevertheless, on Wednesday there were no large turnouts of mourners or literary fans at the Rothian sites, no shrines of flowers. The Weequahic neighborhood and much of the city was transformed after Mr. Roth\u2019s youth by white flight to the suburbs, particularly after the riots of 1967 left more than two dozen people dead and scores of stores along the commercial spine of Springfield Avenue torched or looted. The riots are among several historic events described in \u201cAmerican Pastoral,\u201d which centers on how the 1960s\u2019 national cultural and political turbulence destroys Levov\u2019s family.For the last 50 years, most of the residents of the Weequahic neighborhood, which borders the suburbs of Hillside and Irvington, have been African-Americans, not Jews. Ms. Harrington\u2019s niece, Rhonda Hughes, says it is still a middle-class block of homeowning families trying to scratch out a living and enjoy a few comforts and pleasures. The block and surrounding streets are inhabited by postal workers, home health aides, nurses and teachers, many now retired.The city itself is in the midst of a renaissance with booming development, less crime and falling unemployment, and is on Amazon\u2019s list of possible sites for a second headquarters. Mayor Ras J. Baraka, buoyed by the resurgence, was easily re-elected this month.\u201cThis is one of the nicest quietest blocks,\u201d said Ms. Hughes (\u201cH like Howard but without the dollars\u201d), who before retiring was a coordinator of commercials at WCBS-TV in Manhattan. \u201cAfter dark you hear nothing but traffic. When it snows, kids will come over and shovel for free.\u201dOf course, children no longer play in the streets the way they did in Mr. Roth\u2019s day, preferring indoor activities like television and roaming the internet. But that is true everywhere in America, she said. Practically every house, including Mr. Roth\u2019s, seems to have a TV dish antenna.Ms. Hughes is an avid reader, but her bookshelves indicate her tastes for fiction run more to Ralph Ellison\u2019s \u201cInvisible Man\u201d and Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d than Mr. Roth\u2019s.The central library downtown plans a structure to house Mr. Roth\u2019s voluminous private book collection, which he willed to the library. The high school, built in 1932, is proud of its mocha-colored Art Deco facade, the same it had in Mr. Roth\u2019s day, and the kind of W.P.A. mural that graced the lobbies of many Depression-era public buildings.Myra Lawson, executive director of the school\u2019s alumni association, produced a yearbook from Mr. Roth\u2019s 1950 graduating class. Under his photograph of a young man with an exuberant smile, it reads, \u201cA boy of real intelligence, combined with wit and common sense,\u201d and lists activities he took part in like the school newspaper and prom committee.Andre Hollis, the principal, said Mr. Roth\u2019s name was invoked sometimes at a weekly convocation of the school\u2019s teachers, at which he might cheer them on by saying of Mr. Roth: \u201cBecause greatness came forth from the school, greatness can still come forth from the school. You can be that Philip Roth.\u201dFor two years the school has had a Philip Roth Book Club with 10 to 15 students. Ofelia Pancarician, an English teacher who belongs to a family that immigrated from the former Yugoslavia and the club\u2019s adviser, said the students liked the first year\u2019s book, \u201cGoodbye, Columbus\u201d because it was a love story, but attendance flagged this year when \u201cThe Plot Against America\u201d was featured. That novel imagines an America where an anti-Semitic, authoritarian Charles Lindbergh defeats Franklin D. Roosevelt for the presidency and begins persecuting Jews. Including the Roth family \u2014 their actual name in the book, and the narrator is their son Philip \u2014 of Newark.\u201cThey had difficulty with the historical context,\u201d Ms. Pancarician said.She brought in two teachers to debate the book. One argued that it had echoes of America under President Trump, with the administration\u2019s tendency to spout falsehoods and drum up \u201canimosity toward the other\u201d \u2014 like Mexican immigrants who don\u2019t reflect the majority of American society. The other teacher disputed that idea.In a city as brimming with minority residents as Newark, Ms. Pancarician said, many young people don\u2019t see themselves as outsiders.\u201cOur kids don\u2019t get that concept of the other because they are the other,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Went Naked to a Museum, and It Was \u2026 Revealing", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReporter\u2019s NotebookPARIS \u2014 The most uncomfortable thing about being naked in a museum, it turns out, is the temperature. A half-hour into the first nudist tour of the Palais de Tokyo, a contemporary art museum in Paris, I had gotten used to the feeling of exposure, but I hadn\u2019t acclimatized to the cold air circulating through the cavernous galleries.Standing in a politically themed exhibition by the French-Algerian artist Ne\u00efl Beloufa, I began shaking my arms for warmth. Museums, I was discovering, are not temperature-controlled for people wearing only sneakers.In drawing this conclusion, it seemed, I wasn\u2019t alone. Jacqueline Bohain, a 65-year-old retiree who had taken an eight-hour bus trip from the Alsace region of eastern France to attend the event on Saturday, tried to warm herself in a sliver of sunlight. Other members of the group jiggled around to heat up. \u201cMaybe we should walk around the corner, so we can stand in the sun,\u201d Marion Buchloh-Kollerbohm, the tour guide, suggested, and maneuvered us to another area of the exhibition.\u201cI was imagining about 100 or 200 people might want to come, not 30,000,\u201d he said in a telephone interview before the tour.At 10 a.m., I joined the 161 people who had managed to get one of the limited tickets, and we undressed in an ad hoc changing room on the second floor of the museum. For the next two hours, we took part in one of six tours by (clothed) museum guides of \u201cDiscord, Daughter of the Night,\u201d a series of exhibitions spread across the museum, which is the largest in France for the presentation of contemporary art. The shows consist of one large, suspended sculpture and five separately curated but thematically related exhibitions in different parts of the museum, dealing mostly with issues of political strife and resistance.Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm, who is also the museum\u2019s head of education, told me that she was mindful of the potential awkwardness of combining nudism with the exhibition\u2019s serious subject matter.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make this into a conference on the post-colonial subject, because that would really kill the atmosphere,\u201d she said. Nevertheless, she added, \u201cI am hoping the experience of leaving their clothes at the door will help them leave some part of their identity with it, and experience it with more openness.\u201dOther museums have organized similar tours for temporary shows thematically connected to nakedness, including a Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition in Montreal and a show of male nudes at the Leopold Museum in Vienna. Mr. Luft said that it was \u201cactually more pleasing to me to find something that had nothing to do with nudity.\u201dMr. Luft and I walked into a small room in one corner of the exhibition where Mr. Beloufa was exhibiting an Iranian propaganda video from the Holy Defense Museum in Tehran that showed a simulation of a bomb attack on a marketplace. It felt insensitive to be watching a video of an atrocity (albeit a staged one) while standing in nothing but my running shoes, but Mr. Luft saw it differently. In his view, the exhibition confirmed his belief that nudity was a great social and political equalizer. \u201cIf world leaders had their meetings naked,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019d stay a lot calmer.\u201dMr. Luft said that he had proposed the tour to the Palais de Tokyo at a meeting in December. The idea, he said, was to expand the activities of the nudist association beyond sports \u2014 the group, he pointed out, held the world record for the largest number of people participating in a nude tenpin bowling. He expressed hope that cultural events like the one at the museum would lead to an influx of more diverse members.In a one-time concession, the Palais de Tokyo closed its doors to non-nude visitors on Saturday morning. Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm said the museum saw the event as being part of its mandate of cultural and social outreach.The results seemed promising: The attendees were slightly more male than female, but there was a broad mix of ages, and there were many newcomers to public nudity \u2014 like Junyu Deng, a 29-year-old Parisian \u2014 who seemed thrilled by the tour. She said that being nude had allowed her to have a more \u201cintimate\u201d interaction with the art.Our group moved into a space created by the British artist George Henry Longly, where several suits of armor used by the daimyo, feudal lords who reigned over Japan from the 10th to the 19th centuries, were exhibited. It felt oddly poignant to stare at an exhibition of ornate battle armor while being so physically vulnerable. Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm explained that the suits of armor had been crafted to look like aggressive animals, such as wasps, and that they consisted of a kind of \u201cexoskeleton.\u201d\u201cPutting on clothing, or an armor, it\u2019s a statement,\u201d Vincent Simonet, a 42-year-old singing teacher who offers naked classes, told me as we left the room. \u201cToday, nudism is seen as a statement, but really it\u2019s the opposite, it should be seen as a pure state.\u201dAn installation at the Palais de Tokyo show. The attendees were slightly more male than female, but there was a broad mix of ages, and there were many newcomers to public nudity.The final section of the tour, by the French artists Kader Attia and Jean-Jacques Lebel, was described partly as an \u201carchaeology of fear,\u201d and included a room filled with newspaper and magazine coverage of grim historical events primarily connected with colonialism. Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm crowded the group into a small corner to show us some \u201csickness masks\u201d from Nigeria, with distorted features that gave them the appearance of someone who has suffered from leprosy or a stroke.\u201cThese are not about a concept of perfect and symmetrical beauty,\u201d she said, to the hushed group, \u201cbut about accepting difference and its worth and power.\u201d Ms. Bohain, the retiree from Alsace, said to another tour member that it was an emotional note to end on, especially for a group committed to accepting and celebrating their own bodies.A few minutes later, we were ushered onto a patio with a view of the Eiffel Tower, where Ms. Bohain warmed herself in the sun.

As the bank stumbles from one crisis to the next, investors blame him for the missteps that have brought the company to one of the most perilous moments in its nearly 150-year history.It is the latest blow to the reputation of a man who had been one of Germany\u2019s most renowned bankers since the fall of communism. Mr. Achleitner is increasingly viewed as responsible for a series of ill-fated mergers and questionable decisions over the past two decades that have left Germany, and indeed all of Europe, without a serious rival to the likes of Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase.Even today, Mr. Achleitner \u2014 who is not German, but Austrian \u2014 embodies corporate Germany. In addition to his role at Deutsche Bank, he sits on the oversight boards of three other blue-chip German companies, including the automaker Daimler. Friends and acquaintances describe him as a master networker who is quick to reply to text messages and has a knack for making people feel important.Mr. Achleitner\u2019s wife, Ann-Kristin Achleitner, a professor of business at the Technical University of Munich, also sits on the supervisory boards of several large German corporations. They are one of Germany\u2019s premier power couples.But Mr. Achleitner\u2019s grasp on power appears increasingly tenuous.When Deutsche Bank\u2019s shareholders gather for the company\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday, one of the items on the agenda will be a motion to oust Mr. Achleitner.Mr. Achleitner is expected to survive, at least for now, protected partly because the bank\u2019s chief executive, John Cryan, was ousted just last month. The departure of Mr. Achleitner could throw the bank into even greater turmoil.Mr. Achleitner, who declined to comment for this article, should be given \u201cone last chance,\u201d Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises investors on how to vote, said in a report this month. Removing Mr. Achleitner could distract the supervisory board from \u201cthe truly precarious situation at hand: the entire future strategy and survival of the bank.\u201dMr. Achleitner made a name for himself in the 1990s when the German government was selling assets like chemical factories that had belonged to the Communist government of East Germany.Other German bankers turned up their noses. But Mr. Achleitner, who was the first native German speaker to run Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, recognized an opportunity. He used the assignment to forge political and corporate ties and establish Goldman as a player in Germany.Goldman\u2019s lead role came as a rude awakening to the German banks, which had taken it for granted that they would share such transactions among themselves. That led Deutsche Bank in particular to hastily bulk up in investment banking to fend off foreign competitors.The Bankers Trust deal was troubled from the start. The price was considered steep for a bank that had recently suffered a series of scandals, including accusations of selling derivatives without warning customers about the risks.But Mr. Achleitner\u2019s reputation as a dealmaker continued to grow. In 2000, he left Goldman to become chief financial officer at Allianz, the German insurer. Back then, Allianz, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank owned stakes in one another as well as in many of the largest German companies and dominated their supervisory boards. The network was unofficially known as Germany Inc., and scared away foreign investors.Mr. Achleitner\u2019s job was to either unload Allianz\u2019s holdings or find a way to make them more valuable.Among Allianz\u2019s biggest stakes was 21 percent of Dresdner Bank, one of Germany\u2019s biggest banks. First Mr. Achleitner tried to orchestrate a merger between Dresdner and Deutsche Bank, in which Allianz also owned a stake. When that idea was torpedoed by investment bankers at Deutsche Bank, he took a different tack, engineering Allianz\u2019s 2001 acquisition of the majority of Dresdner.Still, Mr. Achleitner managed to emerge from the crisis as a hero.In 2003, he arrived late to a management board meeting in Munich. He looked weary and unshaven, according to Emilio Galli Zugaro, the former head of communications for Allianz who was present at the meeting.Mr. Achleitner had just come from an all-night negotiating session in Hamburg with potential buyers of Allianz\u2019s stake in Beiersdorf, a German company best known as the maker of Nivea face cream. Allianz badly needed the cash.A group of German investors had agreed to pay \u20ac4.4 billion for the Beiersdorf shares, Mr. Achleitner reported. The Allianz executives, normally a restrained group, gave Mr. Achleitner a standing ovation.The Dresdner Bank deal, however, remained a problem for Allianz. In August 2008, as a global financial crisis gathered force, Allianz sold Dresdner to Commerzbank. The price was \u20ac9.8 billion, less than half of Dresdner Bank\u2019s value when Allianz acquired its stake in 2001.Mr. Achleitner left Allianz in 2012 to become chairman of Deutsche Bank, overseeing the executives who run the company on a day-to-day basis.Deutsche Bank had grave problems. The culture was toxic. Large swaths of the business were poorly managed. Risks were not controlled. The bank had a tendency to needlessly antagonize regulators. It was caught up in just about all of the industry\u2019s worst scandals: rigging interest rates, selling toxic mortgages, laundering money, violating sanctions.Rivals like UBS and Credit Suisse scaled back their investment banks in the wake of the financial crisis. But Deutsche Bank, with Mr. Achleitner\u2019s backing, continued to try to play in the Wall Street big leagues.Weeks later, the bank\u2019s co-chief executive, Anshu Jain, one of the architects of the investment bank, resigned under pressure from shareholders and regulators unhappy with the way the bank had responded to government investigations.Mr. Achleitner chose Mr. Cryan, his colleague on the supervisory board, to succeed Mr. Jain. Mr. Cryan tried to refine Deutsche Bank\u2019s strategy and to instill a more ethical corporate culture.Less than three years into Mr. Cryan\u2019s tenure, Mr. Achleitner grew disenchanted. He contacted a number of executives at rival financial institutions to gauge their interest in taking over as chief executive.In late March, Mr. Achleitner was on an Amazon River cruise with his family when The Times of London reported that he had secretly been talking to possible replacements for Mr. Cryan. Mr. Achleitner rushed back to Frankfurt.Mr. Cryan was in limbo for more than a week. Mr. Achleitner remained silent. Finally, in early April, the board voted to replace him with Christian Sewing, a risk expert who has spent his entire career at the bank.Mr. Sewing quickly announced plans to scale back the investment bank. But Deutsche Bank is years behind European rivals in reorienting itself toward other lines of business that are less prone to scandal and losses.\u201cThere have been a series of missteps going back quite a while, and I do think Chairman Achleitner is part of the problem,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor of leadership at Yale School of Management. \u201cAt some point someone should be accountable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But today, there is a Walmart within 10 miles of 90 percent of the population of the United States, leaving little room for expansion.A historically frugal company that has done very few deals of significance, Walmart is now spending billions as it seeks new overseas markets, tries to capture different demographics and bolsters its grocery offerings.Scott Mushkin, a retail analyst at Wolfe Research, said he worried about the wisdom of Walmart\u2019s desire to attack Amazon\u2019s strongholds.\u201cThey seem to be somewhat Amazon obsessed,\u201d he said.July 2016JD.com PartnershipJan. 2018Rakuten PartnershipApril 2018ASDA SaleMay 2018Flipkart AcquisitionIndia is the golden frontier of digital retailing to Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon.

After the Flipkart deal, the company shares sank more than 3 percent.Walmart is begging for Wall Street\u2019s patience. The company has been reordering its international business to free up cash and resources so that it can focus on high-growth markets and leave those that are lagging.In China, Walmart is deepening its ties and taking a small stake in JD.com, which competes with Amazon and the country\u2019s own e-commerce giant, Alibaba.While such moves make sense on the grand chessboard of global retailing, Walmart will need to deliver. It is going to cost billions for Walmart to turn Flipkart into a profitable business.The deal will cut into Walmart\u2019s overall earnings by about 60 cents per share next year.Oct. 2017Parcel AcquisitionMarch 2018Grocery DeliveryEverybody has to eat, and that essential truth is embedded in Walmart\u2019s growth strategy.Walmart is the largest grocery store in the United States and when it comes to fresh food it has a major head start on Amazon, which has been ramping up its efforts after acquiring Whole Foods last June.But mastering food delivery is a steep challenge for Walmart.The company has experimented with partnerships with Uber, and store workers are making deliveries on their way home from work.\u201cThe grocery business is hard,\u201d said Bill Dreher, a retail analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group. \u201cOnline grocery is even harder.\u201dAug. 2016Jet AcquisitionMarch 2017Modcloth AcquisitionJune 2017Bonobos AcquisitionKelly green golf pants.

{"Headline": "A D.I.Y. Trip Through Alaska\u2019s Inside Passage", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "ExplorerFollowing in the footsteps of John Muir \u2014 and millions of modern cruise ship passengers \u2014 one marine ferry at a time.Supported byLong before his extravagantly bearded profile appeared on postage stamps and commemorative coins, John Muir was a struggling travel writer. Muir, revered today as the founder of the Sierra Club and an early advocate for national parks, was largely unknown to America\u2019s reading public in 1879 when he first departed San Francisco bound for Alaska\u2019s mysterious Inside Passage, a seafaring route through the densely islanded panhandle of America\u2019s northernmost territory.Muir, a spiritual rover who returned to Alaska again and again, would almost certainly not approve. More than a century before the first Instagram travel hashtag, he feared status-obsessed sightseers were content to check capital-N Nature\u2019s greatest hits off their to-do lists one by one, \u201cclinging to the battered highways like drowning sailors to a life-raft.\u201dAlaskans are a seafaring people. Most of the state\u2019s 740,000 residents live in towns and cities near the coast. The state\u2019s huge size and crazy topography make road construction impractical; even Juneau, the capital, can be reached only by sea or air. The marine ferries are used primarily by Alaskans as an inexpensive way to move themselves and their vehicles from place to place as they read, work or watch the miles go by. I bought a couple of waterproof notebooks and flew off to join them.Very early the next morning, after a quick shower down the hall and a chat with a friendly, if nude, halibut fisherman, I peeked out at the tent village \u2014 just three campers on this run \u2014 and walked downstairs. The cafeteria opened at 4 a.m. and was hopping by 6. The menu reminded me of my high school lunchroom \u2014 cold cereal and scrambled eggs; burgers for lunch \u2014 a sensation amplified once seats filled up and people circled holding orange plastic trays, searching for a welcoming table. I snagged a spot next to Beau Bailey, a retired hydrologist and inveterate global traveler. He knew all about Muir\u2019s visits north and had traveled up the Inside Passage multiple times. \u201cThis journey on the ferries is probably my favorite in the whole world,\u201d he told me.The trip from Bellingham to Ketchikan takes about 38 hours. Liberated briefly from cellular coverage, people completed crossword puzzles, read detective novels, played checkers, and, mostly, shot the breeze with anyone and everyone. Longtime Alaska residents, nicknamed Sourdoughs, expressed relief to be returning from Outside, as Alaskans call the world beyond their state borders. As the green shoreline of British Columbia scrolled slowly past behind a blue-gray screen of mist, I thought of Muir\u2019s last trip to Alaska, as a member of the Harriman Expedition in 1899. Muir and two-dozen other leading American naturalists had been invited as guests of the railroad magnate Edward Harriman. When the all-star team of scientists disembarked to stretch their legs amid this temperate rain forest, they encountered knee-deep mosses and nail-sized thorns, a land as impassable as the Amazon jungle.We docked in Ketchikan around noon. When Muir last sailed through in 1899, this spot held a salmon cannery and a few shacks. Today, it is a metropolis by Alaska standards: home to 8,000 residents, a Starbucks and, on most summer days, several gleaming white monoliths: the 10-story cruise ships that dwarf the downtown. As the Inside Passage\u2019s visitor numbers grow, so do its ships. This month, the first 4,000-passenger vessel entered service, to be eclipsed by a nearly 5,000-capacity one in 2019.Ketchikan\u2019s anarchic waterfront once hosted perhaps the greatest concentration of dive bars in America. It\u2019s now thick with shops pushing souvenir T-shirts and knickknacks. The forecast called for rain, as it usually does in Southeast Alaska. I returned early to the ferry terminal to wait for the midnight boarding of the northbound MV Matanuska. Inspired by Muir (and trying to save a few bucks), I attempted, unsuccessfully, to sleep on the extremely hard deck of the observation lounge, wrapped in a thin acrylic blanket with my backpack as a pillow. Each time I opened my eyes, a teenage girl sprawled out on an inflatable sleeping pad stared at me smugly from behind a row of seats.Mr. Matney told me to borrow his truck if I wanted to have a look around \u2014 he left the keys in the ignition, a common practice in Alaska. I decided to explore on foot. Much of Wrangell looked unchanged since 1899: false-front buildings and clapboard churches, including one where Muir had mooched a night sleeping on the floor his very first night on Alaska soil. The supermarkets are closed on Sunday and an Elks Lodge anchors the busiest intersection.\u201cI sometimes feel bad for kids who grow up on Wrangell Island,\u201d Mr. Matney shouted aboard his boat one afternoon. He and Lydia had invited me out to check their very full Dungeness crab pots. \u201cBut then I think about kids like that.\u201d He pointed at two boys, probably 10 and 12, out on the water unchaperoned and fishing from what looked like a motorized rowboat; they had recently hauled in a prize king salmon. Wrangell had felt familiar from the moment I arrived, and I finally realized why: It was one of those old western towns, like Aspen or Mendocino, that everyone says you should have seen before the money arrived.Haines and Skagway, both of which sit near the top of Lynn Canal, are two of Alaska\u2019s three Inside Passage towns connected to the road system. (The third road-accessible town, Hyder, population 87, uses a British Columbia area code and its bars accept Canadian dollars.) Skagway is unabashedly touristy, looks like somewhere Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam might argue about the meaning of \u201ccarats,\u201d and welcomes up to 10,000 cruise ship visitors on a summer day.Haines bills itself as the Adventure Capital of Alaska, which is a little like claiming the title Corn Capital of Iowa, though the town does boast world-class hiking trails and perhaps a third of the vehicles I saw had bikes or kayaks strapped to their roofs. To me, Haines\u2019s chief attractions were its near-laboratory conditions for idling: a pedestrian-friendly layout; an excellent coffee shop with picnic tables where dogs lounged at their owners\u2019 feet; a superb library and bookstore; and perhaps the prettiest setting in Southeast Alaska, snow-capped mountains that rise almost straight out of Lynn Canal, a topographic contrast Himalayan in scale.Gustavus, the tiny town that serves as the gateway to Glacier Bay National Park, is one of the fastest-growing municipalities in Alaska \u2014 by acreage, anyway. Over recent decades, average air temperatures near Glacier Bay have increased and billions of tons of ice have melted. This weight loss causes the land to rebound about two inches per year. One family has unexpectedly reclaimed enough solid ground from the surrounding waters to open a nine-hole golf course.Gustavus is about 20 minutes from Juneau by air \u2014 a four-to-six-hour-long ferry also runs twice weekly in summer \u2014 yet because it is hemmed in on all sides by snowy mountains, feels a million miles from anywhere. (It helps that its dock is too small to accommodate cruise ships.) There\u2019s no downtown, just an intersection called the Four Corners, where you can find an art gallery and cafe, a transplanted 1930s gas station, and the Sunnyside Market, which sells excellent sandwiches and a wide variety of natural and organic foods.We motored slowly past a chunk of rock swarming with bald eagles on top and sea lions below, and approached the spot that, in the 1890s, had marked the terminus of Muir Glacier. The inlet was now open water. The onboard ranger explained that the onetime showpiece of Glacier Bay has receded out of sight, a retreat of more than 30 miles since Muir first saw it.Continuing north, we eventually stopped in front of the Margerie Glacier and parked next to a gigantic cruise ship. Every 10 minutes or so, a thunderclap rang out and a chunk of ice plummeted from the Margerie\u2019s mile-wide blue face, creating an epic splash. The effect was spellbinding.Glaciers advance and retreat; that\u2019s their natural cycle. But the tidewater glaciers of Alaska \u2014 those that extend to the water\u2019s edge \u2014 are almost entirely in retreat these days. The causes are complicated, and Glacier Bay\u2019s ice has been receding since the mid-1700s, but human-caused climate change is accelerating the process. Even the most remote corners of the Last Frontier are hitched to everything else in the universe. It seems likely that the Alaska writings of John Muir will outlast the ice that inspired them.We lingered of the Margerie for half an hour, entranced by its beautiful violence, then turned back toward Gustavus, borne smoothly over calm blue waters.Mark Adams is the author of \u201cTip of the Iceberg: My 3,000-Mile Journey Around Wild Alaska, the Last Great American Frontier\u201d (Dutton), out this month.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg to Meet European Parliament Members Over Facebook\u2019s Data Use", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, plans to meet with members of the European Parliament as early as next week, the latest stop in a wide-ranging apology tour over the social network\u2019s use of people\u2019s personal data.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to travel to Brussels comes as Facebook faces a barrage of public criticism over how the data of tens of millions of its users was harvested without their consent, as well as concerns over the company\u2019s role in elections around the world and questions over whether it has moved quickly enough to remove inflammatory content.His visit will involve a closed-door session with leaders of the European Parliament\u2019s various blocs and the head of the body\u2019s civil liberties committee, which is holding hearings on Facebook\u2019s practices, as well as a stop in Paris, where Mr. Zuckerberg is set to have lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss a range of issues.His planned appearance in Brussels highlights the breadth of the international concern over how Facebook failed to prevent political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica from obtaining and using the data of many as 87 million of its users.Mr. Tajani added: \u201cIt is a step in the right direction toward restoring confidence.\u201dA Facebook spokesman confirmed Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s visit and said the company had accepted the legislature\u2019s \u201cproposal to meet with leaders of the European Parliament and appreciate the opportunity for dialogue, to listen to their views and show the steps we are taking to better protect people\u2019s privacy.\u201dThe meeting in Brussels is likely to take place next Tuesday or Wednesday, officials said. The proceedings will not be televised. A spokesman for Mr. Tajani said lawmakers in attendance will be able to speak freely about it, and a verbatim transcript of the meeting will be released afterward.The format of the meeting was the result of weeks of tense negotiations between Mr. Tajani\u2019s office and Facebook, according to Pedro L\u00f3pez de Pablo, a spokesman for the European People\u2019s Party, the biggest party in parliament, which endorsed Mr. Tajani\u2019s proposed format.Still, one European lawmaker who was invited to the meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg said he would not attend if it was not made public. \u201cIt must be a public hearing \u2014 why not a Facebook Live?\u201d said Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of a liberal group in the European Parliament.The prospect of Mr. Zuckerberg publicly testifying before the European Parliament would have raised the profile of an institution whose 751 members rarely make international headlines. The body does not directly regulate Facebook or other technology companies.Yet Europe has won a reputation in recent years as the technology industry\u2019s toughest watchdog. Officials in the region have investigated Facebook for the improper handling of customer data, fined Amazon and other companies over their tax practices and penalized firms like Google for antitrust violations.\u201cIt shows Zuckerberg really is worried about the effects of regulation and the potential for more,\u201d said Michael Carrier, a law professor at Rutgers University who focuses on antitrust issues and intellectual property law. Mr. Carrier added that the trip demonstrated the leading role Europe plays in regulating the tech sector.Most concerning for Mr. Zuckerberg and others in Silicon Valley, Mr. Carrier said, was a broader skepticism of the industry. \u201cBig tech is under the public microscope from the left and the right,\u201d he said.Facebook has also announced new privacy and security settings that give people more control over their data. This week, the company said it had suspended 200 third-party apps pending a further review of how they had handled Facebook data.Prashant S.

Instead of the $75 million a year the tax was originally expected to raise, it will bring in less than $50 million. The council also included a sunset provision that would require the tax to be reauthorized in five years.The compromise failed to defuse tensions between Amazon and the city it has called home for the last 24 years.Even though the company decided to resume one of its building projects, Drew Herdener, an Amazon vice president, said in a statement, \u201cWe remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council\u2019s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.\u201dTwenty finalist locations across North America have been aggressively wooing Amazon to win up to 50,000 high-paying jobs that its second headquarters would bring. In some of those places, there is opposition growing over the tax incentives that some city and state governments have agreed to give Amazon in return for being selected. And Amazon\u2019s hardball politics in Seattle has further soured some local leaders.\u201cI absolutely find it unacceptable to see politically threatening behavior as is occurring there,\u201d said Robin Kniech, a member of the City Council in Denver, one of the finalists for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t send a message that you expect to be a part of the community.\u201d\u201cBy threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules,\u201d the letter said.Mr. Hederner, the Amazon vice president, said sharp increases in the city of Seattle\u2019s revenues have outpaced the population growth of the city during the same period. \u201cThe city does not have a revenue problem \u2014 it has a spending efficiency problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are highly uncertain whether the City Council\u2019s anti-business positions or its spending inefficiency will change for the better.\u201dThe lower tax was the result of feverish negotiations over the weekend between members of the City Council and Seattle\u2019s mayor, Jenny Durkan, who had opposed the council\u2019s earlier tax proposal. The mayor had publicly hinted that she would veto the original tax proposal because of the risks she said it posed to the local economy.Several members of the nine-person City Council said they were reluctantly voting in favor of the smaller tax because there were not enough votes to override a mayoral veto of the larger tax plan.Advertisement"}

In the final days, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is paying many employees for full-time work, but not requiring them to come into the office if they aren\u2019t needed.\u201cThis aggravates me so much,\u201d said Tracy Forbes, a manager at a Babies \u201cR\u201d Us store in Phoenix. \u201cThese people are getting rich, and we are getting nothing after keeping this company going for 60 years.\u201dFor creditors, it is all about the pecking order.Vendors are fighting to get paid for their toys and landlords are scrambling to find new tenants for the hulking stores that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is leaving behind. Bankruptcy professionals typically sit near the top and are largely assured of getting paid.The high cost of bankruptcy has been an issue for years. The fees in the Lehman Brothers case topped $1 billion two years after the investment bank filed the largest corporate bankruptcy case in history and help set off the global financial crisis in 2008.\u201cThe fees have been increasing, and there is no effective means to control them,\u201d said Lynn LoPucki, a bankruptcy professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.Companies can choose where they want to file for bankruptcy. And Mr. LoPucki said bankruptcy judges were reluctant to push back on fees, fearing lawyers would choose to file big cases elsewhere.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, based in Wayne, N.J., filed its Chapter 11 case in federal court in Richmond, Va., which has a reputation for approving large professional fees.Bankruptcy professionals say that working to reorganize or liquidate a company is time-consuming, complicated and intense. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is made up of multiple corporate entities \u2014 in the United States and internationally \u2014 that have hired lawyers and advisers.All of that has added up to a big bill. So far, the company said, it has shelled out $108 million on professional fees. It expects to spend as much as $348 million as a result of the bankruptcy, according to the company documents.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us collapsed quickly, going from a potential turnaround play to a costly liquidation.With cash tight, the company wanted last spring to take some of the pressure off by refinancing about $200 million of its total $5 billion in debt. But when word got out that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had hired restructuring advisers, the company\u2019s vendors were spooked heading into the crucial Christmas season.By September, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said it had no choice but to file for bankruptcy.The company had originally hoped to shed some of its debt and keep operating. But after dismal holiday sales, the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us lenders began to question whether the company had a future and threatened to pull back on financing.In March, the company said it would close hundreds of United States stores and lay off all its workers.Saddled with huge debt, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had a difficult time competing with Walmart and Amazon. Loan payments were sapping cash that it could have spent on updating its cavernous stores and building out its website.Ms. Forbes\u2019s last day at the Phoenix store is on June 30. The company, she says, will stop contributing to her 401(k) account next week. Ms. Forbes says she is also owed six weeks of vacation, but will not be paid for it.This week, she traveled to Washington D.C. with the labor advocacy group OUR to lobby members of Congress on the need to protect severance in bankruptcy cases. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get severance from Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, we have to stop it from happening to someone else,\u201d Ms. Forbes said.Advertisement"}

Be bold, these call to arms exhorted: Dare to tilt at windmills with your own handmade pole vault. Question everything, they counseled \u2014 light a fire underneath your inner Ralph Nader. Make the world a better place, they goaded \u2014 you\u2019ll be too tired to do so once your newborn is power-blasting your shoulder with boysenberry-hued vomit.But today\u2019s commencement speeches, as evidenced by a new book (\u201cAssume the Worst: The Graduation Speech You\u2019ll Never Hear\u201d) by the novelist Carl Hiaasen and the cartoonist Roz Chast, and another (\u201cIn Conclusion, Don\u2019t Worry About It\u201d) by the actress Lauren Graham, are less fife-and-drum than plaintive bagpipe. Inspiration is superseded by skepticism or a shiny decal that might read: \u201cYou Are Enough.\u201dIn his offering, Mr. Hiaasen advises graduates that \u201clowering your expectations will inoculate you against serial disappointments,\u201d then debunking four \u201clame platitudes\u201d (\u201cLive each day as if it\u2019s your last,\u201d \u201cTry to find goodness in everyone you meet,\u201d etc.) that clog the graduation and self-help industries. The result is a Dave Barry-esque shuffle of loony sarcasm.Mr. Hiaasen applies pragmatic scorn to \u201cIf you set your mind to it, you can be anything you want to be,\u201d pointing out that if Bill Gates had tried to be a professional bronco rider, \u201che wouldn\u2019t have made it past his first rodeo \u2026 and Microsoft would today be a brand of absorbent underwear.\u201d Meanwhile, Ms. Chast breaks up the text with her signature blend of bug-eyed bedragglement.Whence this penchant for resignation and passive self-acceptance amongst commencement speakers? While an armchair sociologist might be tempted to scapegoat the current political climate or lagging attention spans in the face of spoken rhetoric, it\u2019s probably more useful to acknowledge the huge success of similarly skeptical and unbreathy commencement speeches of the recent past.The climax of TV titan Shonda Rhimes\u2019s best-selling memoir from last year, \u201cThe Year of Yes,\u201d recounts how Ms. Rhimes \u2014 an introvert who once hired a publicist to avoid public appearances \u2014 summoned the courage to give the 2014 commencement speech at Dartmouth. Her speech was full of rue: \u201cShonda, how do you do it all? The answer is: I don\u2019t. Whenever you see me succeeding in one area of my life, that almost certainly means I am failing in another area of my life. If I am killing it on a \u2018Scandal\u2019 script for work, I am probably missing bath and story time at home. If I am at home sewing my kids\u2019 Halloween costumes, I\u2019m probably blowing off a rewrite I was supposed to turn in.\u201dIf these young peoples\u2019 implied circumstances have been reduced, he suggests, their resultant actions needn\u2019t be. \u201cSky is not the limit,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIt is only the beginning.\u201d Then: \u201cLift off.\u201dIn the end, maybe it\u2019s only fitting that graduation speeches now sometimes come in a new flavor (bitter melon). Graduating seniors, in the eyes of these texts, are neither lumps of clay nor young warriors equipped with lightsabers. As young folk take their seats and wonder what sort of medicine they\u2019ll be dispensed of \u2014 wide-eyed cheerleading? grim v\u00e9rit\u00e9? \u2014 they are getting a powerful preview of the suspense and open-endedness that their next few years will bring them.Welcome to life.Follow Henry Alford on Twitter: @henryalford.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Says It Will Pay for Its Workers to Earn College Degrees", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalmart announced plans on Wednesday to offer subsidized college tuition for its 1.4 million workers in the United States, joining a growing list of companies that are helping employees pay for higher education as a perk in a tight labor market.The giant retailer will pay tuition for its workers to enroll in college courses \u2014 online or on campus \u2014 to earn degrees in either supply chain management or business, company officials announced at Walmart\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in Bentonville, Ark.Full- and part-time Walmart workers can use the subsidy to take courses at the University of Florida; Brandman University in Irvine, Calif.; and Bellevue University in Bellevue, Neb.The three universities were chosen because of their high graduation rates, particularly among part-time students, and their experience with those already in the work force, Walmart executives said. The employees will not be obligated to continue working for Walmart after they get their degrees, and must put up only $1 a day toward the cost of classes.\u201cWe feel like this is another step forward in investing in our associates,\u201d said Julie Murphy, an executive vice president in Walmart\u2019s United States operation.Walmart, the country\u2019s largest employer, introduced the tuition subsidy as it seeks ways to retain workers at a time of low unemployment. Employers like Starbucks and Amazon also offer tuition support.Walmart, which has faced criticism over low pay and poor working conditions, is also trying to burnish its image while expanding its presence in more upscale markets online.Thom Arnold, 32, who has been working at Walmart since high school, said he would \u201clove to take advantage\u201d of the tuition subsidy.Mr. Arnold, who was chosen by his store in Staunton, Va., to attend the shareholder meeting, said he would like to pursue a career in cybersecurity.\u201cI\u2019d like to advance into something bigger,\u201d he said.Activists groups \u2014 including Organization United for Respect Walmart, which was staging demonstrations in Bentonville through the week \u2014 argue that the company should raise hourly wages to at least $15, a figure that Walmart\u2019s rival Target has committed to. Another group, Making Change at Walmart, a project affiliated with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said it was skeptical of Walmart\u2019s promises and pointed out that the company had announced its wage increases the same day that word spread of the planned closing of 63 Sam\u2019s Club stores.\u201cAt best, if this is more than a publicity stunt, then Walmart is merely playing catch-up to other multibillion-dollar companies when it comes to providing benefits to its workers,\u201d the group\u2019s director, Randy Parraz, said in a statement.Walmart officials did not provide an estimated cost for the tuition subsidy, but they expected that about 68,000 employees would probably enroll during the first five years, based on those who have expressed interest and an analysis of similar programs in other industries.The University of Florida is probably the best known of the universities in the Walmart program. Brandman University, which has multiple campuses in California and an online curriculum, has a focus on Hispanic students. The billionaire investor Joe Ricketts, who founded TD Ameritrade, is among Bellevue University\u2019s benefactors.Walmart workers will qualify for the benefit after 90 days of employment and will not be penalized if they leave the company before finishing their studies.The tuition subsidy will apply only to associate and bachelor\u2019s degrees in two programs that are somewhat related to retail work, but the areas of study could be expanded to other areas in the future, Walmart officials said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Trump\u2019s Tax Incoherence Just a Way to Hurt Amazon?", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months, the Trump administration has rightfully been trying to thwart attempts by some European governments to impose a new corporate \u201cdigital tax\u201d on American high-tech giants. This campaign to block internet-inspired extraterritorial taxation \u2014 taxation of income earned outside of a jurisdiction \u2014 is strongly supported by the American business community. But the White House, in an odd twist that turns its European Union digital tax arguments upside down, just argued before the Supreme Court that the same kind of extraterritorial taxation is acceptable when carried out by American states on retail sales on the internet.Does the left hand of the Trump administration know what the right hand is doing on internet-related tax policy? Are American corporate leaders who have ignored the issue of internet sales taxes about to suffer a key setback in relation to the European Union tax grab? And does sound tax policy go out the window if the president seems to think Amazon is in the cross hairs?State governments want to see Quill overturned because they\u2019re eager to collect more sales tax revenues to balance their books instead of cutting spending. The desire to tax out-of-state businesses has been consistent over the decades, but the pitch is now that the internet changes everything. It makes doing business over large distances too easy, some argue, so government shouldn\u2019t be constrained by outdated considerations like borders and geographical business locations.Chief Justice John Roberts asked government lawyers about the impact on \u201cmicro-businesses\u201d because tax enforcement costs related to audits and litigation are a major concern for small businesses dealing with their own state and local tax officials. But how about when being online makes every state government the same as your local government? The internet is global. This line of reasoning points to a world where even a very small business on the internet is taxed and regulated as if it has facilities and employees everywhere in the world. On this key point, the Trump administration\u2019s Justice Department came down strongly in favor of a world where an internet presence replaces traditional physical presence.What accounts for such an incoherent approach to tax policy? The administration argues in the Supreme Court that the borderless nature of e-commerce should subject someone selling potholders on Etsy or vintage Air Jordans on eBay to taxes in every state \u2014 but then it opposes European governments using the same rationale to tax billions in revenue by the largest American multinationals.A further twist is that a win by South Dakota will not undermine Amazon. Its national distribution network means it must collect sales taxes in every state. New rules are likely to help the company by increasing burdens on lesser-equipped small competitors. Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer both hinted at this during oral arguments, noting that expanding tax duties on the legions of smaller businesses would be likely to benefit the largest online businesses and exacerbate concerns about dominance by the few internet giants.The internet is global. It\u2019s not going away. Governments everywhere want to increase their power to tax internet commerce out of a fear that some tax revenues will go the way of music CD sales and newspaper classified ads. Mr. Trump may think he\u2019s changing the rules to increase Amazon\u2019s tax bill and help states raise more revenues, but if he succeeds it will lead to many American technology companies writing much bigger tax checks to foreign governments for years to come.Advertisement"}

Not interested in the fairy tale? Sit back and enjoy watching Harry\u2019s predecessors fight, scheme and rebel instead.TV ShowBack in the 16th century, the role of queen existed primarily to produce an heir. A daughter was considered fine, but only sons could really be trusted with the throne. King Henry VIII \u2014 glutton, narcissist and bully \u2014 was ruthless in his pursuit of a male heir, ultimately cycling through six wives over the course of his 36-year reign.\u201cThe Tudors\u201d takes a soapy look at this homicidal husband, bouncing merrily between the bedroom and the throne room with the help of an all-star cast and a lot of modern touches. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is Henry, Natalie Dormer is his temptress Anne Boleyn, and Sam Neill is the priest who helped Henry break with the Catholic church so that Henry and Boleyn could be married.TV ShowMovieMovieElizabeth I was known as the Virgin Queen because she never married, but unmarried didn\u2019t have to mean chaste. Shekhar Kapur\u2019s film \u201cElizabeth\u201d has the princess (Cate Blanchett) canoodling with Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) when she is accused of heresy and arrested by her sister, who was then on the throne. The film then follows her unexpected journey from terrified prisoner to powerful queen, not shying away from the violence and instability of England in the 16th century \u2014 a time when people there were burned alive for being the wrong kind of Christian. Concerns over whom she will marry and when she\u2019ll provide an heir loom large throughout this poetically filmed biopic, pressing in on her until she makes a decision, declaring to herself, \u201cI have become a virgin.\u201dMovieA royal wedding can, of course, be followed by a royal divorce, and no divorce has drawn more public attention than when Harry\u2019s parents split up. When Diana, Princess of Wales, died in 1997, she had been divorced from Prince Charles for a year and was no longer a member of the royal family. For the Queen, that meant deciding that there was no need for the royal family to add its voice to the public\u2019s incredible outpouring of grief. She didn\u2019t fly the flags over her palaces at half-mast, which many newspapers presented as deeply disrespectful.Helen Mirren plays a chilly Elizabeth, who starts to doubt how well she knows her own people as she navigates her biggest controversy to date. Director Stephen Frears deftly splices archival footage with imagined discussions taking place between the Queen and those close to her, teasing out the tension between royal protocol and celebrity culture, as an old power system confronts a new one.TV ShowTV ShowDuring Queen Victoria\u2019s reign, the British Empire swelled to cover a quarter of the world. The British believed that Queen Victoria was the Empire in human form, which, in retrospect, wasn\u2019t really something for her to be proud of. At the beginning of this five-part BBC documentary from 2012, the presenter, Jeremy Paxman, promises that the series will confront the horrors perpetrated in the British colonies. But perhaps inevitably, the series more often lapses into the usual celebrations of the empire\u2019s former strength, although the fourth episode is unflinching in its recounting of the atrocities perpetrated by slave owners and British opium trade.The series certainly has its flaws, but it stands as a fascinating example of contemporary Britain\u2019s attempt to grapple with its colonial past. Paxman, a well-known British political journalist, visits former colonies, offering well-researched accounts of colonial events and their legacy. But he, too, has his blind spots, for example asking locals in his clipped upper-class accent whether they think British occupation was a good or bad thing. Surely it\u2019s more complicated than that.MovieDuring World War I, the royal family changed its name from \u201cSaxe-Coburg and Gotha\u201d to \u201cWindsor\u201d in an attempt to hide its German roots. By the time World War II came around, Edward VIII had already abdicated. But during the war, he and his wife, Wallace Simpson, had dinner with Nazi ministers, and Adolf Hitler was reportedly very impressed by the couple.This juicy tabloid-style documentary investigates those connections, building upon archival footage and interviews with historians and firsthand witnesses, complemented by some wonderfully cheesy reconstructions. We are told that Edward \u201cwinked awfully well\u201d and that Simpson was a \u201cgold digger.\u201d We also learn that the couple was passing some sort of information to the Germans through a Nazi foreign minister named Joachim von Ribbentrop. Was Edward aware of Hitler\u2019s plan to put him back on the throne as a puppet king once the Nazis conquered England? Who knows. But he certainly seems to have thought the Nazis had some good ideas."}

I consider it essentially a tender rescue myth, an Orpheus and Eurydice-type story repurposed to feature familial instead of romantic love and made startling by a bravely happy ending.I knew the book\u2019s author, Madeleine L\u2019Engle, for nearly 30 years. She was loyal, generous, opinionated and comfortable in her stature as an elder. Privately I thought of her as Aunt Beast, from Chapter 11. So I turned with interest to \u201cBecoming Madeleine,\u201d this middle-grade audio portrait of the quirky and beloved writer.One listens to \u201cBecoming Madeleine\u201d primarily for clues to how such a genre-buster of a fantasy novel could emerge in the early 1960s, and from this particular author. The two biographers and narrators are L\u2019Engle\u2019s granddaughters. One presents the main narrative in gracious, unhurried prose delivered in level tones suited to a nature documentary voice-over; the other intersperses excerpts from L\u2019Engle\u2019s vivid journals with greater gusto. The authors cover the first half of L\u2019Engle\u2019s life. This includes Florida forebears, a Swiss boarding school education, Smith College, forays into the theater and fiction writing and then marriage and motherhood. The biography leads up to and includes the publication of \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d in 1962. Here the story stops, and sensibly so; children love a triumph. Only scholars care to know what comes next.After \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d brought L\u2019Engle both glory and fame, she became well known as the librarian of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. When she began to publish adult nonfiction that mentioned her faith, some readers weren\u2019t surprised. What is the secret weapon in \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d but love, that most central of Christian virtues? Curiously, \u201cBecoming Madeleine\u201d avoids any mention of L\u2019Engle\u2019s childhood piety \u2014 or lack thereof. Furthermore, the only children\u2019s books identified as having been cherished in her youth are, I believe, \u201cEmily of New Moon\u201d and \u201cSwallows and Amazons.\u201d Both are robust stories of realism without a scrap of myth or an urge of magic about them. Whence, then, L\u2019Engle\u2019s adroitness at fantasy or science fiction, call it what you will, with its reliance on enormous inventiveness, narrative panache and derring-do?Gregory Maguire is the author of \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cEgg & Spoon\u201d and many other books.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Tesla Seems Worried It\u2019s Consuming Too Much Cash: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s plan to cut back on capital expenditures.\u2022 Why Apple\u2019s share repurchases have been good for investors.\u2022 Will the Fed offer clues about future rate increases?\u2022 How activist investors shook Xerox.Tesla in recent weeks has faced concerns that it is consuming too much cash as it tries to produce a new model of electric car.Now, Tesla itself seems to share those worries.While reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to \u201csignificantly cut back\u201d the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash.Cash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it\u2019s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers.In its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in.But the company is running out of room for maneuver. Cash on Tesla\u2019s balance sheet at the end of the first quarter fell to $2.7 billion from $3.4 billion in the previous quarter. And the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on a conference call on Wednesday said the company did not want to raise fresh capital.Analysts on the conference call asked what capital expenditures Tesla may reduce in order to meet its lower target. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company might be able to spend less as it attempts to rationalize its production. But when an analyst then asked Mr. Musk about Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, the chief executive did not answer the question and told the operator to move to another questioner. Around this time, Tesla\u2019s stock slid sharply in the after-market trading.-- Peter EavisTesla lost nearly $800 million in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarter in a row it has lost money.But Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn and could make money in the second half of the year. That, of course, came with a major caveat: Tesla achieving its latest goals for Model 3 production, which is well behind schedule.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s net loss increased to $784.6 million from a loss of $397.2 million a year ago.\u2022 Tesla\u2019s adjusted loss per share came in at $3.35. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a loss per share of $3.58.\u2022 Revenue climbed to $3.41 billion, topping analyst expectations of $3.28 billion.Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, and analysts said investor expectations may have been overblown and voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company\u2019s average revenue per user.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Spotify reported a first-quarter loss of \u20ac169 million ($202 million), or \u20ac1.01 a share, from \u20ac173 million, or \u20ac1.15, in the same period a year earlier.\u2022 Spotify posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago\u2022 Revenue rose 26 percent to 1.139 billion euros. Analysts had expected 1.143 billion euros.\u2022 Monthly active users increased 30 percent from a year ago to 170 million.\u2022 Paid subscribers rose 45 percent from a year ago to 75 million.\u2022 Average revenue per user fell to 4.72 euros from 5.32 euros in 2017.\u2022 Gross margins were 24.9 percent.What is in the executive order, which could be released within days:\u2022 It is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China\u2019s most prominent technology firms.\u2022 Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption.The order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology.\u2022 On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said it was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns.As expected, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.The central bank acknowledged rising inflation but provided little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.Perhaps the biggest change to the Fed policy statement was the use of the word \u201csymmetric\u201d to describe its inflation target.\u201cThe Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.\u201d\u201cTo the extent there is a surprise in the policy statement, it is that the addition of the description of the 2% inflation objective as being \u2018symmetric.\u2019 This intended to reinforce some of the inflation rhetoric that has indicated that deviation of inflation to the upside will not necessarily elicit a policy response, especially in light of the prolonged period of below-target inflation.\u201dApple\u2019s stock buyback program isn\u2019t just bigger than those of other companies, it\u2019s also better at doing what investors want share repurchases to do.Apple on Tuesday said it was going to buy back another $100 billion of its own stock. The company announced the plan as it is about to complete a $210 billion stock repurchase program. As large as those numbers seem, they don\u2019t reveal the degree to which the repurchases have benefited shareholders. What matters to them is whether Apple has significantly fewer shares outstanding at the end of the program. If that is achieved, Apple\u2019s earnings per share will be higher, which could lead investors to view the stock more positively.Apple\u2019s diluted shares outstanding have fallen nearly 24 percent over the past five years. Here\u2019s how that compares with some companies that are known for their large stock buybacks. Over the past five years, IBM\u2019s shares outstanding have declined by some 18 percent, Cisco\u2019s have decreased just over 8 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s have fallen by 7.5 percent.Apple\u2019s cash flow statements show it has spent nearly $200 billion on stock repurchases over the past five years, which works out at 57 percent of its cash flow from operations for the period. That percentage is also above that of other companies. The cash Cisco spent on stock repurchases over the past five years amounted to 46 percent of its cash flow from operations. At IBM, that number was 44 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisMost everyone expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.But investors and policymakers will comb over the Fed\u2019s policy statement for clues about whether the central bank plans to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed.Here\u2019s what to watch:\u2022 Any new signs of officials expressing concern about an acceleration in prices. Investors would likely interpret any new worries about inflation to mean the pace of rate hikes could quicken.\u201cA change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,\u201d said Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive.Critics\u2019 cornerRoss Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes that there was little positive to point to in Snap\u2019s first-quarter results.\u201cSNAP remains a volatile story and execution since the I.P.O. has been less than desirable (outside of 4Q17), but we think a lot of the problems around pricing and Android may start to resolve in 2H.\u201d\u201c1Q:18 miss and forward ad commentary speak to continued challenges SNAP faces in turning its business model around.\u201dSam Kemp, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said:\u201cSnap is a poorly structured company that is demonstrating a clear pattern of mismanagement.\u201dXerox chose to settle with the activists after a judge last week temporarily blocked the Fujifilm transaction, siding with Mr. Deason in a lawsuit and saying the talks were conflicted by Mr. Jacobson\u2019s tenuous position. Seeking a settlement would avoid a distracting fight over its board and uncertainty about the future of the deal, Xerox\u2019s existing board said Tuesday.The fight may not be over: Fujifilm said today that it\u2019s appealing the injunction.\u2022 The Justice Department, which has been harder than expected on M.&A., will assess whether consumers face higher prices.\u2022 The F.C.C. will consider whether it\u2019s in the national interest to let the national wireless market shrink from four providers to three.\u2022 Cfius will rule on how the deal might affect national security.The F.C.C. chairman has sounded warm about consolidation, and controlling shareholders of both companies have passed Cfius reviews before. But regulatory approval is still an open question, and Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s share prices reflect that.Next stop: The judge in The Weinstein Company\u2019s will decide whether to approve Lantern\u2019s deal.Advertisement"}

The privacy law essentially compels companies operating globally to play by stricter European Union rules if they want to keep doing business there. It entitles us \u201cdata subjects\u201d to move our information from one platform to another; to know how and by whom it is being used; and to contest a decision made by an algorithm, among other things. By reaching extraterritorially, regulators make it harder for companies to shop around for friendly jurisdictions to avoid these rules.In broader terms, the regulation is an attempt to make sense of newly complex and decentralized relationships among individuals, their data, the state and the private sector that have emerged under globalization.These are relationships we negotiate and renegotiate every day.The digital privacy law\u2019s \u201cdata subject\u201d gets at the same idea, by tethering what\u2019s done with our data to places on earth. The law doesn\u2019t draw borders around the data itself, or indeed around us; it acknowledges that on the internet, individuals and their data travel all over. Under the new law, you can be a citizen of the United States, a resident of Japan and a European \u201cdata subject\u201d at the same time.And this time, the borders are being drawn around corporations. The law\u2019s extraterritorial reach ensures that corporations can\u2019t weasel their way out. Like so many laws, this one is meant to provide some protections to vulnerable populations from those who wield a lot of power. In the digital world, the power rests with a small handful of multinational leviathans; all of us are vulnerable, and we can be exploited without even knowing it. The new privacy law acknowledges the dangerous power of these companies while attempting to return some personal sovereignty to their clients, the people.We should all start thinking of ourselves not just as clients of a company, residents of a state or citizens of a country, but also as data subjects of the world. Data is currency; creating and holding it is power. This power has gone to Google, Facebook, Amazon and the other neo-feudal masters that use it to their advantage, not ours.If it takes a European Union bureaucrat\u2019s definition of \u201cdata subject\u201d to help us wrest back some of that power, I\u2019m O.K. with that, because what\u2019s done to us should be a matter of fundamental rights, whether online or in real life. Technological innovations should be for the good of the world, not just the market.

Applicants could turn the question back on the employer by asking for the position\u2019s salary range, or what the last person to do the job was paid. Applicants could say something like: \u201cI want to learn more about the job first, in order to have a better sense of my salary expectations.\u201d Or they could provide context for why they\u2019re declining to share the information, by explaining that it contributes to the gender pay gap. The study was not representative of most hiring situations \u2014 the job marketplace was for short-term projects on which applicants bid \u2014 and the experiment was not assessing gender differences in pay.

You Can\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "Researchers can now send secret audio instructions undetectable to the human ear to Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant.Supported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Many people have grown accustomed to talking to their smart devices, asking them to read a text, play a song or set an alarm. But someone else might be secretly talking to them, too.A group of students from University of California, Berkeley, and Georgetown University showed in 2016 that they could hide commands in white noise played over loudspeakers and through YouTube videos to get smart devices to turn on airplane mode or open a website.This month, some of those Berkeley researchers published a research paper that went further, saying they could embed commands directly into recordings of music or spoken text. So while a human listener hears someone talking or an orchestra playing, Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker might hear an instruction to add something to your shopping list.\u201cWe wanted to see if we could make it even more stealthy,\u201d said Nicholas Carlini, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in computer security at U.C. Berkeley and one of the paper\u2019s authors.Mr. Carlini added that while there was no evidence that these techniques have left the lab, it may only be a matter of time before someone starts exploiting them. \u201cMy assumption is that the malicious people already employ people to do what I do,\u201d he said.These deceptions illustrate how artificial intelligence \u2014 even as it is making great strides \u2014 can still be tricked and manipulated. Computers can be fooled into identifying an airplane as a cat just by changing a few pixels of a digital image, while researchers can make a self-driving car swerve or speed up simply by pasting small stickers on road signs and confusing the vehicle\u2019s computer vision system.With audio attacks, the researchers are exploiting the gap between human and machine speech recognition. Speech recognition systems typically translate each sound to a letter, eventually compiling those into words and phrases. By making slight changes to audio files, researchers were able to cancel out the sound that the speech recognition system was supposed to hear and replace it with a sound that would be transcribed differently by machines while being nearly undetectable to the human ear.Amazon said that it doesn\u2019t disclose specific security measures, but it has taken steps to ensure its Echo smart speaker is secure. Google said security is an ongoing focus and that its Assistant has features to mitigate undetectable audio commands. Both companies\u2019 assistants employ voice recognition technology to prevent devices from acting on certain commands unless they recognize the user\u2019s voice.Apple said its smart speaker, HomePod, is designed to prevent commands from doing things like unlocking doors, and it noted that iPhones and iPads must be unlocked before Siri will act on commands that access sensitive data or open apps and websites, among other measures.There is already a history of smart devices being exploited for commercial gains through spoken commands.There is no American law against broadcasting subliminal messages to humans, let alone machines. The Federal Communications Commission discourages the practice as \u201ccounter to the public interest,\u201d and the Television Code of the National Association of Broadcasters bans \u201ctransmitting messages below the threshold of normal awareness.\u201d Neither say anything about subliminal stimuli for smart devices.Courts have ruled that subliminal messages may constitute an invasion of privacy, but the law has not extended the concept of privacy to machines.Now the technology is racing even further ahead of the law. Last year, researchers at Princeton University and China\u2019s Zhejiang University demonstrated that voice-recognition systems could be activated by using frequencies inaudible to the human ear. The attack first muted the phone so the owner wouldn\u2019t hear the system\u2019s responses, either.The technique, which the Chinese researchers called DolphinAttack, can instruct smart devices to visit malicious websites, initiate phone calls, take a picture or send text messages. While DolphinAttack has its limitations \u2014 the transmitter must be close to the receiving device \u2014 experts warned that more powerful ultrasonic systems were possible.That warning was borne out in April, when researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign demonstrated ultrasound attacks from 25 feet away. While the commands couldn\u2019t penetrate walls, they could control smart devices through open windows from outside a building.The Berkeley group also embedded the command in music files, including a four-second clip from Verdi\u2019s \u201cRequiem.\u201dHow device makers respond will differ, especially as they balance security with ease of use.Mr. Carlini said he was confident that in time he and his colleagues could mount successful adversarial attacks against any smart device system on the market.\u201cWe want to demonstrate that it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said, \u201cand then hope that other people will say, \u2018O.K. this is possible, now let\u2019s try and fix it.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Put a Value on the Doctor-Patient Relationship", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "By MICHAEL POLLANBy SULEIKA JAOUADBy ABRAHAM VERGHESEBy KIM TINGLEYIn its push for profits, the U.S. health care system has made it difficult for patients to get personal attention from doctors. But what if hands-on medicine actually saves money \u2014 and lives?More than a decade later, my grandfather, who was 78 by then and had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, developed pneumonia. When he was admitted to the county hospital, it was the same doctor \u2014 now my doctor, too \u2014 who came to his room to describe his options: go on a ventilator and go home, where he would most likely remain bedridden for the remainder of his life (probably months), or let the illness run its course and die within a few days. My grandfather asked if the latter would hurt much. The doctor said no, he could make him comfortable. All right, then, my grandfather replied.By the time the doctor abruptly tendered his retirement notice, I had long since moved away. I had lived with high-deductible health insurance for years and, after a few surprise bills I could not afford, I avoided medical professionals whenever possible. Often, when I didn\u2019t have a primary-care physician or couldn\u2019t remember his or her name (which changed with my ever-changing insurance policy), I filled out forms with my hometown doctor\u2019s name instead: George P. Fitzgerald III, M.D. But until my father told me about his letter, I had not reflected on his role in my life. I\u2019d rarely seen him more than once a year, and any problems I did have were unremarkable, easily treatable by someone else. And yet his departure felt like a loss.My father, after his final checkup, reported why the doctor was leaving: He objected to the increasing industrialization of medical care, in particular a new Medicare mandate that he update patients\u2019 medical histories electronically \u2014 not because he was old-fashioned or contrary (though he was both), but because the idea of dividing his attention between a computer screen and a patient offended him. This shift to electronic health records, intended to improve communication between a patient\u2019s various physicians as well as \u201cautomate and streamline provider workflow,\u201d was the latest in a series of incentives that the health-insurance market created over the past 20 years to maximize efficiency. In this payment system, the time-consuming process of cultivating a relationship with a patient is essentially worthless, because doing so is not a finite, billable procedure. For the doctor, however, the fourth generation of his family to practice medicine, it was vital to his craft.The question of what the role of a primary-care physician should be, and how it should be valued, has perhaps never been more urgent. That figure, typically a general practitioner, family doctor or internist, is a patient\u2019s first and often most personal connection to the rest of the health care system. But well-known corporations are betting that Americans would prefer to have health care \u201cdelivered\u201d by a trusted brand rather than a trusted physician. At least 10 of the nation\u2019s largest tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, have designed tools and software for medical use and increased their involvement in health care start-up deals in recent years; the size of those deals went to nearly $3 billion in 2017 from under $300 million in 2012. Amazon, in partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, has announced its intent to disrupt the industry \u2014 among other ways, by reinventing primary-care delivery. Walmart now offers primary-care services in some of its stores.Surprisingly little is known, though, about what the relationship between a patient and his or her primary-care doctor is actually worth, in terms of that patient\u2019s overall well-being or medical costs, regardless of who bears them. In fact, David Meltzer, an economist and a primary-care physician at the University of Chicago, may be the first and only researcher in the country trying to quantify that relationship\u2019s value in a randomized clinical trial, the most rigorous scientific method.\u201cI\u2019m a complete believer that it\u2019s going to change health care in America,\u201d he told me nearly two years ago. Meltzer continues to believe as much, now that his trial has produced preliminary results, which he plans to present at the end of June at the annual research meeting of AcademyHealth, a health-policy organization. His experiment suggests that strengthening the patient-doctor relationship can significantly reduce patients\u2019 hospitalizations and expenses (to hospitals and Medicare) and improve their mental health; it remains to be seen whether that will be enough to influence the plans that corporations, drawing on their expertise in efficiency and customer service, have to redesign the health care system.In 2016, I spent three weeks over four months at the University of Chicago Medical Center observing Meltzer\u2019s experiment. Its centerpiece was a primary-care practice that consisted of five physicians, a small staff and, at its peak, 1,000 high-risk Medicare patients. I saw more than 90 patient-doctor interactions there; in every instance, the university\u2019s media-relations manager made sure that the patients understood they could quite reasonably refuse me access. Yet almost everyone allowed me to sit in and write about whatever took place. The receptiveness to the presence of a stranger \u2014 potentially representing millions of other strangers \u2014 in these private moments puzzled me but did not seem to surprise Meltzer. Only much later did the question of why they said yes come to seem central to both his project and mine.But not long after physicians coalesced into a professional class, advances in research and technology made it increasingly untenable for any practitioner to master the entire medical canon. At the same time, many experienced physicians argued that medical schools were churning out experts in ever-narrower portions of the body who lacked empathy for the whole person. In 1927, Francis Peabody, a professor at Harvard Medical School, famously defined the trade-off in The Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cThe treatment of a disease may be entirely impersonal; the care of a patient must be completely personal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe significance of the intimate personal relationship between physician and patient cannot be too strongly emphasized, for in an extraordinarily large number of cases both diagnosis and treatment are directly dependent on it.\u201dUltimately, these unique relationships empowered physicians to reject intervention by any regulatory third party, including national government. But doctors\u2019 control over pricing gave rise to inflated costs and gradually sowed anger and mistrust among the public. Demand for reform led to the passage of Medicare in 1965, but the program, eager to avoid angering doctors and hospitals, embraced the same reimbursement practices of most private insurance plans, arbitrarily assigning flat fees to services, like outpatient checkups, regardless of the benefit to patients. For primary-care doctors \u2014 paid the same for a simple exam of a relatively healthy patient as for a more involved consultation with a chronically ill one \u2014 this created a perverse incentive: see as many healthy people and as few sick people as possible.As health-insurance providers prompted physicians to reorganize their patient pools, they simultaneously pushed patients to switch doctors by creating \u201cnetworks\u201d of physicians whose services were covered. (Those physicians, in turn, agreed to care for patients in accordance with the insurance companies\u2019 policies.) Consequently, and as a result of shifting benefits, as more working Americans signed up for employer-sponsored health insurance, many of them \u2014 41 percent, in one survey \u2014 \u201csevered established relationships with their physicians in order to seek new providers,\u201d according to a 1996 study in The American Journal of Public Health. The same study estimated that more than a third of Americans on Medicare who were 65 and older and who had a regular physician had been seeing him or her for a decade or more \u2014 and those with the longest ties had lower medical costs and were less likely to be hospitalized than those with the shortest.Yet concrete proof that the patient-doctor relationship was responsible for these better circumstances remained elusive. \u201cDespite a consensus that longitudinal care is important,\u201d the study\u2019s authors, Linda J. Weiss and Jan Blustein, then of the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, wrote, \u201cremarkably little is known about the actual value \u2014 in terms of health care processes, outcomes or costs \u2014 of long-term provider-patient relationships.\u201d Reliable data on such relationships simply didn\u2019t exist.One afternoon I watched one doctor, Ram Krishnamoorthi, examine L.A. Kizer, who had just turned 70. He was wearing a new-looking ball cap with a trout on it and pulling an oxygen tank. \u201cDid you go fishing?\u201d Krishnamoorthi asked. He had been Kizer\u2019s doctor for more than two years, but he could never tell when such an innocuous question might turn out to be significant: If Kizer said yes, Krishnamoorthi could try using the activity to motivate healthful behavior, or he might find out that someone who could be tapped as a source of support had accompanied Kizer on the outing.\u201cUsed to,\u201d Kizer said. He suffered from congestive heart failure and was still breathing heavily from the trip down the hall.\u201cLet me see you walk over,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said. \u201cThis is a lot worse than before. What happened?\u201d\u201cI saw you two weeks ago,\u201d Kizer said, \u201cand it feels like I woke up and I can\u2019t move.\u201d He added that he had gained four pounds. Krishnamoorthi rolled up his pants legs and probed his ankles. He pressed a stethoscope to his back. A doctor who had not seen Kizer so recently would have no reason to investigate his sudden decline (and Kizer, who said he didn\u2019t like doctors, might not have told an unfamiliar doctor that anything had changed). \u201cHow\u2019d you get here?\u201d Krishnamoorthi asked.\u201cBus.\u201d\u201cHow many?\u201d\u201cOne.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fluid,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said, referring to Kizer\u2019s added weight and difficulty walking and breathing. He asked if Kizer wanted to be admitted to the hospital, where he could get additional medications; Kizer declined. Krishnamoorthi eventually agreed to let him go home if he turned off his tank, waited for 10 minutes and had his blood-oxygen level checked. This would take up more of Krishnamoorthi\u2019s time \u2014 without generating additional reimbursement \u2014 but it would mean vast savings for the health care system if it helped him prevent Kizer from having an emergency on the bus later. Heeding Kizer\u2019s preference probably made him more likely to keep future appointments.\u201cWhy am I doing so bad?\u201d Kizer asked as Krishnamoorthi clipped an oxygen meter to his finger. \u201cIs it all the meds?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d Krishnamoorthi read the meter display: \u201c98 percent. I think you\u2019re safe. Don\u2019t croak on the bus.\u201d\u201cIf I do, you won\u2019t find out.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find out. They call the doctor first. What\u2019d you do for your birthday?\u201d A physician in a hurry might not have noticed the date \u2014 or accepted his first answer.\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing now. Nothing.\u201d\u201cDid you have guests over?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\u201cPlayed cards.\u201d\u201cDid you eat chips while you were playing cards?\u201d\u201cA couple. You know I do.\u201d\u201cDo you think that might be part of the reason for the weight?\u201d Extra sodium can cause fluid buildup.What I couldn\u2019t quite believe was that these lengthy conversations were economically sustainable. Nationwide, primary-care physicians often can\u2019t afford to spend more than 15 minutes with each patient, because of the way the health care system values their time. I had seen Krishnamoorthi and colleagues take that long to sort through patients\u2019 medications, often more than a dozen, which they asked patients to gather up and bring to appointments. During one visit, Grace Berry, another doctor, Google-mapped a patient\u2019s new address to locate a nearby pharmacy, transferring her prescriptions there and helping her secure reliable transportation to and from the clinic.Meltzer insists that doctors spending more time with their patients actually saves money. After a year in his clinic, for instance, patients have 20 percent fewer hospitalizations than their control-group counterparts. Because hospitalizations make up the greatest portion of these patients\u2019 annual cost to Medicare, which averages $50,000 to $75,000 each, that reduction is worth several thousand dollars per person in the first year, or a combined several million dollars; by comparison, the doctors\u2019 annual salaries add up to less than $1 million.In a traditional primary-care clinic, patients\u2019 medication \u2014 prescribed to them by multiple specialists who are not in communication with one another \u2014 might not have been systematically sorted by a single person. Or if it had been, it might have been checked by a professional-care coordinator in consultation with doctors. In Meltzer\u2019s view, that increases labor costs, introduces inevitable miscommunications, as in a game of \u201ctelephone,\u201d and runs the risk of not seeming as important to the patient as instructions personally delivered by the physician.By contrast, Meltzer\u2019s doctors run their clinic in partnership with two nurses, a social worker and a project manager; the leanness of the staff means that most of its internal communication can take place during a 30-minute group meeting each morning. That permits more face time between doctors and patients, according to Meltzer. \u201cAnd face time is possible if you decrease back-room time,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople fail to recognize that when you have a $200 person here and a $200 person here and a $100 person communicating between them, the real cost of that is all of their time.\u201d In this setup, which describes a coordinator relaying a message from a doctor in one setting to a doctor in another, the cost is $300 per hour of conversation, or $600 total. What Meltzer has done, in effect, is consolidate the first two physicians into one, simultaneously doubling their time with patients and eliminating the need for a go-between, cutting out that $600 cost altogether. To accomplish this feat, he employs the oldest, slowest, least-innovative health care delivery model imaginable: general practitioners who oversee almost all aspects of their patients\u2019 care and, in doing so, come to know them personally.In the early 1990s, primary-care doctors typically made daily rounds at their hospitals to oversee the treatment of their patients there. But this was about to change. In 1996, an influential article in The New England Journal of Medicine by Robert M. Wachter and Lee Goldman, then physicians at the University of California, San Francisco, predicted that the \u201cexplosive growth of managed care\u201d emphasizing efficiency would lead to \u201cthe rapid growth of a new breed of physicians we call \u2018hospitalists\u2019 \u2014 specialists in inpatient medicine \u2014 who will be responsible for managing the care of hospitalized patients in the same way that primary-care physicians are responsible for managing the care of outpatients.\u201dAs an economist, Meltzer read their forecast with interest. The appearance of hospitalists was, he recognized, a textbook example of specialization or \u201cdivision of labor,\u201d whereby a task is split into simpler ones that workers can perform more quickly, as on an assembly line. In this case, the split eliminated the need for a primary-care doctor to travel to and from the hospital, enabling him to move patients through his clinic faster; meanwhile, the hospitalist, with his experience treating acute illness and getting the most out of his hospital\u2019s unique facilities, would presumably be able to care for patients admitted there more efficiently and effectively. When, soon after the publication of the article, the University of Chicago Medical Center hired its first two hospitalists, Meltzer volunteered to study their impact. His plan was to compare how patients fared when they were cared for by a specialist (a hospitalist) versus a generalist. He began keeping records \u2014 which physicians treated which patients, for example \u2014 and hired two students to interview patients in the hospital and then again over the phone a month after they were discharged to learn about their health.On its face, Meltzer\u2019s research and that of others seemed to show that hospitalists were a great boon. They reduced patients\u2019 medical expenses (by nearly $800, he as well as Wachter, Goldman and their colleagues found), shortened their hospital stays (by about half a day) and modestly decreased mortality rates. But the effects of the nascent hospitalist specialty were only being analyzed rigorously at teaching hospitals like Chicago\u2019s, where the attendings (supervising doctors who spend most of their time caring for ambulatory patients) did not know the patients any better than the hospitalists did. No one was investigating how the hospitalist model performed beyond academic settings, where it was replacing patients\u2019 primary-care doctors. Meltzer noticed, though, that when the Chicago hospitalists got the weekend off and an attending took over their patients for just 48 hours, the handoff completely erased the cost benefits the model otherwise seemed to generate. It stood to reason, then, that separating patients in community hospitals from their longtime doctors might be having a significant negative impact.But running a clinical trial in a community hospital to directly compare the hospitalist model to the primary-care model it was rapidly replacing was widely considered impossible. How many longtime patients of a general practitioner who was still making hospital rounds would agree to swap her for a hospitalist so that researchers could see whether doing so was good for them?By 2010, the hospitalist model had become the norm. That year, Meltzer published a theorem describing why the model had taken hold so quickly; in the past 15 years, the number of practicing hospitalists had jumped from several hundred to 30,000. (Meltzer practices as a hospitalist himself.) The math itself was basic. But, staring at his final equation, Meltzer had a revelation: increasing one variable \u2014 the likelihood that a primary-care physician\u2019s patients would be hospitalized \u2014 would decrease the odds that the physician would cede his hospital duties to a hospitalist out of financial necessity, halting, at least mathematically, the specialty\u2019s rapid spread.This gave Meltzer an idea. In 2012 he won a grant from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, an organization created by the Affordable Care Act to test novel \u201cpayment and service-delivery models,\u201d to set up an experimental outpatient clinic at the university medical center. For patients, he recruited Medicare recipients who had been hospitalized in the past year and were therefore statistically likely to require future hospitalization. In practice this meant that most of them, like half of Americans, were managing at least one chronic illness; most were also from the impoverished and violent neighborhoods of Chicago\u2019s South Side. Their average annual income at the time of enrollment was $10,000 to $15,000.If they volunteered, they were told, they would be randomly assigned to either a primary-care doctor for outpatient needs and a hospitalist in the hospital, or they would join Meltzer\u2019s new clinic, which he called the Comprehensive Care Program, and receive inpatient and outpatient care from the same doctor. Meltzer\u2019s team would directly compare the two groups using a medley of metrics: how often patients were hospitalized and for how long; whether they did not refill their prescription medications because of expense; and their total costs to Medicare. A standard survey would assess their overall health. Finally, to try to understand how patients\u2019 relationships with their doctors might differ between the two groups and affect the outcomes, the team devised a survey in which patients rated their doctors in categories like trust and interpersonal relationships. Did he or she know their values and responsibilities? Give clear instructions? Seem caring and kind?Meltzer\u2019s biggest fear, at first, was that the patients\u2019 existing primary-care physicians would accuse him of stealing them. It turned out that many hospital patients his team approached did not have one. Within four years, the researchers had signed up 2,000 subjects. \u201cIn a funny way, the study that we\u2019re doing now was the same study that should have been done in 1999,\u201d Meltzer told me. \u201cThe difference is that we could never have gotten people out of having their own doctor until now, when they don\u2019t have it, and we offer it back.\u201dThat Monday morning, his first patient had head and neck cancer and needed an M.R.I. Krishnamoorthi had him practice lying flat and slid pillows under his head and adjusted the bed angle until they found a position the man could tolerate in the scanner that afternoon. (If the patient balked, he would have to be hospitalized longer, increasing his risk of developing an infection and reducing the potential profit for the hospital, which earns money when it admits a patient and loses it for every additional day that patient stays.)Then, Krishnamoorthi jogged upstairs to check on Jamal Johnson, a 34-year-old with cystic fibrosis. Johnson was sitting on the edge of his bed, hunched over his lunch tray. Krishnamoorthi dragged a footstool over and plopped down on it, stretching out his legs. \u201cWhen I woke up, I felt kind of draggy,\u201d Johnson said. But physical therapy, which consisted of wearing a vest that vibrated his chest to break up sputum, had helped. \u201cSee?\u201d Krishnamoorthi said. \u201cIt always works.\u201d\u201cIt hurts like hell, though. That\u2019s something I can say.\u201d Five years earlier, Johnson broke a rib playing basketball, making therapy treatments for his cystic fibrosis excruciating and initiating a cascade of hospitalizations. When he met Krishnamoorthi a year ago, he hated him instantly. Krishnamoorthi wanted him to consider a lung transplant; Johnson refused. He didn\u2019t want to hear about further treatment options. When Krishnamoorthi broached the subject of staying in a nursing facility, Johnson told him that the doctors and nurses there were \u201cjust paid to like you.\u201d The remark stuck. Krishnamoorthi asked around until he found a nurse he thought Johnson might connect with; eventually, Johnson agreed to enter her facility and came less frequently to the hospital. On occasions when he was admitted, Krishnamoorthi would, with his permission, call his mother with updates \u2014 an overture, she later told me, that none of the countless doctors who had treated her son over the years had ever made and for which she was especially grateful. Johnson never wanted to worry her.The new arrangement was more beneficial for Johnson, less stressful for his mother, less expensive for Medicare and less expensive for the hospital, but it had taken Krishnamoorthi weeks to orchestrate. It was increasingly clear to him how rewarding \u2014 but equally taxing \u2014 it was to try to do more for his patients than what was absolutely required. \u201cLast year, I would go home worried whether he liked me or not, if he would \u2018fire\u2019 me,\u201d he told me after we left Johnson\u2019s room. \u201cIt would have affected me a lot.\u201dThe next major test of the model will be whether it can be implemented in different sets of financial, geographic and demographic circumstances. Already, more than half a dozen organizations, from a senior-living community in Florida to the National University Health System of Singapore, have consulted Meltzer about creating versions of his program. One of them is the health-insurance company Kaiser Permanente. The Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group, an organization of more than 1,400 primary-care physicians who serve members of Kaiser\u2019s health plan, ran a pilot of the program in 2015. Two physicians were assigned to its 400 sickest patients. Unlike Meltzer\u2019s team, which relies on hospitalists for after-hours care, Kaiser made the doctors available 24/7 and were surprised to find that patients very rarely called late or on holidays and weekends. Still, the number of times they were admitted to the hospital or E.R. fell drastically, by 80 percent, prompting Kaiser to expand the program to seven doctors and 800 patients. In the summer of 2016, Vanderbilt University Hospital started a similar pilot and observed a 20 percent decrease in hospital admissions. The school is also expanding its program.\u201cAll of us, I think, are struggling with how we can provide care to an aging population with resources drying up left and right,\u201d Bernadette Loftus, a clinician and the executive medical director of the Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group, told me. \u201cDavid and I both came of age at the birth of the hospitalist movement. It\u2019s a great efficiency movement, but it takes about two decades of living in that environment to see the flaws in it.\u201dMeltzer has broadened his experiment, with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to offer additional resources with the hopes of reaching his clinic\u2019s patients who rarely engage with its services; the clinic can now refer them to an additional community-health worker and a neighborhood arts-and-culture program designed with Urban Labs, a center at the university that studies approaches to combating health problems and other social challenges. But he believes versions of the model could also apply to primary-care practices with patients who have a more traditional range of incomes and health issues. For instance, to increase patient-doctor familiarity and streamline communication, a practice might partner with a single hospitalist who takes care of all of its hospitalized patients. In Meltzer\u2019s view, his model\u2019s key mechanism, the prioritizing of the patient-doctor relationship, makes it flexible enough to export anywhere. \u201cTo have a relationship,\u201d Meltzer says, \u201cis to mean that the big incentive is to want them to do well because you care about them and to have the time to really understand what that means and deal with it, because sometimes figuring that out just takes time. When price is the only lever you have, you\u2019re either paying people to do something or paying them not to do something. And it goes only one way or the other, more or less. Whereas when you have a relationship, there\u2019s just so many more nuances.\u201dCurrent metrics are still too crude to capture the intricate effects of these relationships, however, even as they point to their collective impact being quite large. By contrast, day-to-day, patient-to-patient progress has often seemed glacial at best and demanded considerable energy from the clinic doctors and staff. As I observed Meltzer\u2019s team at work, I couldn\u2019t help wondering how long its young, idealistic caregivers would last. Unknown to Meltzer, several of them had lent patients cash for bus money or delivered medications on their way home \u2014 gestures they hadn\u2019t felt inspired (or pressured) to make in previous jobs. When, that October, Jamal Johnson passed away, Krishnamoorthi, upon visiting his bedside to say goodbye, was surprised to find he couldn\u2019t stop crying. \u201cAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t feel finished,\u201d Lauren Wiklund, the project manager, told me one particularly hectic morning. \u201cI just feel like I have to carry on with the rest of my life or I will die.\u201dWhy, then, did they do it? \u201cI became disenchanted with primary care because I was constantly having to cut people short,\u201d Joyce Tang, who spent seven years at her previous practice, told me. \u201cI was always an hour late. Always. My patients just knew to expect that.\u201d One morning, I watched her examine a man who seemed to prefer the accommodations of the hospital to those of his assisted-living facility and habitually took a cab to the emergency room. Tang had brainstormed with him, his sister, his insurance company and a nurse at the facility, about possible solutions. She was carrying a housing application for a faith-based facility she thought he might like better, but so far, nothing had worked to change his patterns. In cases like his, how did she measure success?\u201cThere are traditional metrics: fewer hospitalizations, better compliance with medicines,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then for patients there are more specific goals \u2014 so understanding those.\u201d She gave the example of a patient who was immobilized by her weight. \u201cFor her, the big intervention was I got her a motorized wheelchair, and the next time I saw her she was just smiling. She said it totally transformed her outlook just to be able to get outside and get some fresh air.\u201d Another woman had been on large doses of opioids. For a year she and Tang saw each other every two weeks and gradually reduced her dose until, recently, she flushed the rest of her pills down the toilet. \u201cNow when she comes to the hospital, she doesn\u2019t want IV pain meds,\u201d Tang said. \u201cShe\u2019s so happy. She\u2019s really proud of herself. That\u2019s a big success story. A lot of people don\u2019t come back when we say \u2018taper.\u2019 I asked her, \u2018What made you come back?\u2019 She hated me when I said that. But she said: \u2018I trusted you. I knew you wanted what\u2019s best for me.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe morning after Winslow\u2019s death, Meltzer hosted a weekly meeting with the clinic and research teams. Once everyone had settled in with a paper-wrapped sandwich, he said, \u201cCase of the week?\u201d and the conversation turned to Winslow. She had been hospitalized with minor injuries after a fall and developed an infection; together, her son and Verma had wrestled with when to stop treating it. \u201cHer son last night asked: \u2018Do you think I\u2019m doing the right thing? What do you think I should do?\u2019 He said, \u2018I know you care about her, so I trust you.\u2019 Not, \u2018I trust you because I know you\u2019re a doctor, or I know you\u2019re a professional\u2019 \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t happen with a hospitalist.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing that the struggle was more with your own feelings,\u201d Meltzer said, and Verma agreed.By then, I had watched her and her colleagues confront a breathtaking variety of indignities that age and sickness force upon human beings: impotence, incontinence, immobility, dementia, death. It occurred to me that perhaps the explanation for patients\u2019 allowing me to witness these conversations was as simple as wanting, even at their most vulnerable \u2014 perhaps especially then \u2014 to be seen and heard, and that this was also precisely what they prized in Meltzer\u2019s doctors. What both doctors and patients were after, it seemed, was not just an assignation of \u201cvalue\u201d but of meaning. The better they knew one another, the harder their relationship was to define wholly in medical terms. \u201cEverything\u2019s just too late sometimes, and then what do you do?\u201d a farmer who had recently learned he had metastatic cancer told Tang one morning. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of sad to me and the wife, too. It\u2019s just like a death sentence.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Tang said softly, \u201cI know.\u201d There was little else she could do medically. And yet, it was difficult to imagine the farmer saying the same to a friend or a relative or a social worker or a priest and receiving the same affirmation.Meltzer characterized this singular connection for me one afternoon. \u201cBeing able to even just touch in for a little bit, have the conversation and talk about it, there\u2019s an intimacy to it,\u201d he said, shortly after telling one of his own primary-care patients in the hospital that she had cancer. The subconscious swap of \u201ctouch in\u201d for \u201ccheck in\u201d evoked the laying on of hands \u2014 an antiquated, unbillable and, in the face of cancer, useless gesture, but quite possibly not a worthless one.Source photographs from ClassicStock/Alamy.By MICHAEL POLLANBy SULEIKA JAOUADBy ABRAHAM VERGHESEAdvertisement"}

Monique Heart, her dress held up by packing tape, again blamed her failure to deliver a challenge-winning look on her lack of funds. This does cast sunshine on an important deliberation in the drag world \u2014 with new money pouring in to select drag super PACs, should there be reform? Mon\u00e9t X Change raised the point that she, too, is not wealthy, yet she manages to turn out a look. But, does she? She was almost eliminated twice, owing to her \u201ccheap-looking\u201d pieces. The case remains open, but it is rather clear that when it comes to the depth of their pockets, these citizens are not united.The next issue was education. Fortunately, despite our nation\u2019s proposed budget slashes, the library remains open, and the annual Reading Is Fundamental mini-challenge went on. The dark horse candidate Kameron Michaels continued her campaign of surprise with delightful reads of Eureka and Mon\u00e9t. (I would say \u201cdon\u2019t sleep on Kameron,\u201d but that is all anyone with a pulse wants to do.) Several queens ribbed The Vixen, and she reacted about as good-naturedly as a similarly humorless woman reacted to similarly humorous reads at a televised dinner held within the last seven days.Mon\u00e9t packed it up with a prime Amazon joke at Asia O\u2019Hara\u2019s expense. Her delivery is always guaranteed to be direct and lightning-quick. Keep tracking her. (Can you tell that I am shipping her hard? O.K., O.K., I\u2019ll stop.)Eureka order-fired a joke about The Vixen\u2019s kitchen (the heat of which the latter visibly could not take), and defunded the library, winning a gift certificate to L.A. Eyeworks. (Perhaps she will regift it to The Vixen, whose constant eye-rolling has surely caused vision loss.)The caucus chairman Ru then announced that \u201cChristmas for drag queens,\u201d the also-annual Snatch Game challenge, had finally come with a bound. The Mary gentlemen excitedly jingled their bells, and hung their stockings without Blair.Today, Satan, the first lady of literacy and Snatch Game legend Bianca del Rio arrived in a Holly Goheavily look, and escorted the queens toward serving bawdry, hep burns. She wisely advised Eureka against portraying Divine, steering her instead toward playing the poster child for our nation\u2019s education and food-desert crises, Honey Boo Boo.Kameron announced with her singular quiet confidence that she would play the late, great wrestler Chyna, and, in what would appear to be a body-slam, Monique was encouraged to take on Congress-Auntie Maxine Waters.Aquaria announced that she would embrace her sentence-hobbling \u201cflaws\u201d and use them to her advantage by playing the first lady Melania Trump. Against advisement, Asia and The Vixen chose to impersonate the publicly closed-mouthed moving images Beyonc\u00e9 and Blue Ivy Carter, respectively. Asia called out to the noted student of the \u201cNo, bye!\u201d school of improv The Vixen: \u201cIf I\u2019m stuck, I know there\u2019s someone on the panel that I can have banter with \u2026 I\u2019ll wait to play off of you until you like, really establish your character.\u201d Every atom of oxygen left the room, and every other queen quietly, knowingly secured their masks.There was a war on this drag queen Christmas, and it was a blood bath. Eureka absolutely murdered as Honey Boo Boo, expertly heightening with a bump-set-spike of doodled answers and idiotic childlike glee. Mon\u00e9t, clad in a five-dollar Fulton Street Mall caftan and two-dollar Party City wig, proved that you don\u2019t have to spend money to make Mon\u00e9t, and we\u2019ll never forget how her Maya Angelou made us feel. Kameron and Cracker, as ever, made solid showings, and Aquaria, in an upset, held a Tiffany box and nailed Melania Trump.Back in the workroom, the conversation turned, as it does in these times, to politics. Mon\u00e9t said, \u201cI think it\u2019s important to do political numbers \u2014 as drag queens I feel like that\u2019s our call to duty.\u201d Monique confessed that while she has considered doing more political work, \u201cI live in a former slave state \u2026 Tensions were really high in Kansas City, and I didn\u2019t want to get shot.\u201dThe Mermaid Fantasy runway challenge, a homage to the Divine Miss M, showed us how well these men have been taught to fish. Aquaria served a Rex Tillerson fantasy as an oil-spilled, tattered-tailed mermaid. Mon\u00e9t\u2019s \u201cwarrior mermaid\u201d look earned the quip \u201cTuna Turner\u201d from Ru, and I cannot write anything funnier than that, and therefore will not try.Asia\u2019s grotesque lionfish mask earned an \u201cick\u201d from all of the judges save Kate Upton, who \u201ckind of loved it.\u201d (Kate, if you want to really love a twisted-faced fish, call me. I\u2019m single.) And The Vixen\u2019s unturned tuna had rather wide-set cans, prompting Kate to noodle, \u201cno one wants the breasts in the armpit.\u201d (Sigh, don\u2019t call me, Kate. We\u2019ll never work.)The candidates were then asked that most unanswerable debate question \u2014 \u201cWho deserves to go home tonight, and why?\u201d Every queen on the stage elected to send The Vixen home, with the exception of her arch-nemesis Eureka. She named Asia, who she believes is her fiercest competition, which I do not also believe. The Vixen, naturally, voted Eureka off the island, citing her \u201cunprofessionalism,\u201d her habit of claiming to be attacked and her \u201cThis is who I am. Deal with it\u201d attitude. (And we all thought irony died on 9/11.)In an attempt to Define The Relationship, Eureka countered that she has reached out to Vixen many times with love, and has been rebuffed at every turn. This provoked a torrent of defense, and even more eye rolls. I do hope Ru keeps a medic on hand.Facts are facts: There simply is no excuse, financial or otherwise, for a drag queen to not know the words to a lip sync. Sadly, neither her glitter nor her Jesus saved her, and Monique was buried at sea.Unfathomably, one of the funniest queens to ever appear on the show did not survive the Snatch Game, and the unfunniest queen to ever appear on the show did. Against all predictions, an unbridled rage-channel who can\u2019t take a joke continues to advance. Will knowing the right words be enough to stop her? Will those words be \u201cMiss Vanjie\u201d?See you next week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Pauses Huge Development Plans in Seattle Over Tax Plan", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon abruptly escalated a fight with its hometown on Wednesday, halting major expansion plans in Seattle because of a tax being considered by the City Council.The new tax would charge large employers in the city about $500 per employee, with the money going to help alleviate a housing crisis. The tax is squarely aimed at Amazon, which is Seattle\u2019s largest employer and frequently blamed by many residents for the city\u2019s soaring housing costs.The company said it would halt construction of a new building it was planning to erect downtown and reconsider occupying another that is already under construction, putting 7,000 or more jobs in jeopardy.Late Wednesday morning, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said that \u201cpending the outcome of the head tax vote by City Council, Amazon has paused all construction planning\u201d on a large building in downtown Seattle that was scheduled to begin construction later this year. Mr. Herdener also said Amazon was \u201cevaluating options\u201d to lease out space it had planned to use in another building that is already going up elsewhere downtown.\u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about the impact this decision will have on a large range of jobs \u2014 from our building trades, to restaurant workers, to nurses, manufacturing jobs and tech workers,\u201d said Mayor Jenny Durkan. \u201cAt the same time, our city must urgently address our homelessness and affordability crisis and lift up those who have been left behind.\u201dAmazon\u2019s decision comes as officials in other communities across the country are jockeying to bring Amazon\u2019s business to town. The company is shopping for a second headquarters elsewhere in North America, saying it has outgrown Seattle. And just this week it announced plans to hire thousands more employees in Vancouver and Boston.Amazon, Seattle\u2019s largest employer with more than 45,000 local employees, would owe $20 million to $30 million annually from the head tax and perhaps significantly more when the payroll tax kicks in.For months, Amazon has been quietly lobbying behind the scenes against the tax proposal. Its unexpected announcement could be nothing more than a negotiating tactic to help extract concessions from the council.Mike O\u2019Brien, a member of the Seattle City Council, said Amazon representatives told him on Wednesday morning that they were pausing their expansion projects in the city, without leaving room for discussion.\u201cThey\u2019re not really asking for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just telling us what they\u2019re going to do.\u201dMr. O\u2019Brien said Amazon should not be solely blamed for the homeless problem in Seattle, but that the company bears some responsibility. \u201cFrom my point of view, we have a crisis in our town around housing affordability and homelessness,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re closely related and it\u2019s related to the booming tech industry in Seattle.\u201dHe added, \u201cI need to run a city that has room for prosperous businesses, but doesn\u2019t do it at the expense of people getting pushed into poverty.\u201dGreg Johnson, the president of Wright Runstad & Co., a development firm that is constructing the building that Amazon said it may lease out, said an Amazon executive told him of the plans on Tuesday night. Amazon has a lease for about 720,000 square feet in the 58-story tower.\u201cWhat\u2019s troubling is the 4,500 people Amazon was going to put in the building, they\u2019re now considering elsewhere, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s elsewhere in Seattle,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.After years of criticism for being disengaged from the civic life of its hometown, Amazon has in recent years attempted to show a more compassionate side in Seattle. It has agreed to allow a homeless shelter for families, Mary\u2019s Place, to occupy space rent-free in another building that it is putting up. That is one of several buildings that Amazon still intends to complete.Amazon\u2019s search for a second headquarters has also fanned criticism of the company, in large part because of the hefty tax incentives many of the 20 finalist locations have offered in an attempt to lure the company.Mr. O\u2019Brien, the Seattle city council member, described Amazon\u2019s search as shopping around to see which city will give it the best deal. \u201cWe need companies that want to locate in a city and are willing to work together,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When All Else Fails, Tax Incentives Probably Will, Too", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneTimothy J. Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., estimates that eight of every 10 new jobs will be filled by outsiders. While the new workers will pay taxes, most of the revenue will be spent on public services for a growing population. And the incentives themselves will blow a hole in state and local budgets, draining resources that would be better invested in, say, public education.So why does everybody do it? State and local government spending on tax incentives like those offered by Wisconsin and New Jersey has increased sharply since 1990, to about $45 billion in 2015, by Mr. Bartik\u2019s count. It amounts to roughly all the money that state governments collect from corporate income taxes.Is this just about opportunistic politicians dipping into state coffers so they can be photographed cutting the ribbon at a spanking new factory? I wouldn\u2019t doubt it. But I would also suggest another, more troublesome motivation: desperation. Fiscal incentives are one of few tools for cities like Racine and Newark to create jobs.Whether Racine or Newark, Indianapolis or Detroit, Decatur, Ohio, or Bethlehem, Pa., too many of the cities that built the United States into an industrial power through the first two-thirds of the 20th century still haven\u2019t figured out how to recover from the blow that knocked them over in the third.Racine County, once a healthy manufacturing hub churning out household cleaners, radiators for Caterpillar rigs and the like, has spent a good part of the last 35 years in a funk. Since 1970 it has lost nearly a fourth of its factory jobs, while jobs over all have grown at less than half the national pace. Household incomes in the middle of the distribution have shrunk 14 percent, adjusted for inflation.Of the 45 metropolitan areas in the Northeast, 27 have experienced what they call \u201cchronic distress\u201d since the late 1970s, with much slower job growth than in the country as a whole for an extended period. In the Midwest, 33 of 90 metropolitan areas have suffered the same fate. And fewer than half of these distressed areas have managed to snap out of their stagnation.This is a new problem for the American economy. Through the 1970s, the income gap between rich and poor regions narrowed significantly. It was rare to find areas of persistently high unemployment. Workers moved to high-wage areas. Investment flowed to poor places where wages were lower.In the face of persistent stagnation across a broad swath of the country, economists are reconsidering their longstanding objection to place-based policies, directed at improving the conditions of a local economy.Job growth has lagged, as has overall economic growth. \u201cAmerica appears to be evolving into durable islands of wealth and poverty,\u201d the authors conclude. And that raises a sort of intractable question: What is the appropriate policy tool to bring a decaying industrial island back to life?Mr. Bartik argues that government initiatives can help to clean up environmentally damaged industrial sites, improve transportation infrastructure and train workers in the skills that local employers seek. So can offering technical assistance to help small businesses develop.\u201cYou need to invest in services that increase local businesses\u2019 productivity,\u201d he told me.Count me with the pessimists. I agree with Mr. Bartik\u2019s ultimate proposition. But I doubt that a new airport or a few new roads or some technical assistance for small businesses can achieve the productivity jolt that the Rust Belt needs. And no amount of training will work if there are no local jobs to be had.\u201cA variety of things can make things somewhat better,\u201d Professor Wolman told me, but \u201cexplicit policies don\u2019t have much to do with whether you are going to be able to claw your way out of chronic distress.\u201dThe grand solution \u2014 of course \u2014 is investing in human capital. Study after study finds that areas with more educated work forces perform better. They earn higher wages and are more nimble in adapting to economic change.But \u201cinvest in education\u201d is hardly a prescription that Racine can simply pick up and run with. Indeed, solutions are easier to state than to carry out.\u201cChronically distressed regions need to regenerate through diversification, entrepreneurship and innovation,\u201d Professor Wolman and his co-authors argue. \u201cBut these are more aspirations than strategies or policies.\u201dThe old expectations of the industrial heartland \u2014 about wages and benefits, about career ladders and job stability \u2014 are no longer valid. The region\u2019s social contract, which promised a decent job to anybody who wanted one, has been ripped up. But nothing has yet been put in its place.As decrepit industrial enclaves wait for some new deal to replace the yanked promises of their glory days, one might forgive the billion-dollar incentives with which they try to recapture their lost prosperity. As Professor Wolman put it, incentives might be a bad idea from the standpoint of overall welfare. But \u201cif I were a state government,\u201d he said, \u201cI would be trying like mad to attract Amazon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He doesn\u2019t own a mobile phone or a television, and most of his clothing is secondhand. He never flies, won\u2019t go to a supermarket and can\u2019t remember his credit card PIN.Such is life for one of Australia\u2019s leading environmentalists, who decades ago encouraged homeowners to turn their forgotten backyards into sustainable gardens and is now calling for suburbanites to go further off the grid and make the whole of their lives green.That effort to combine global activism with personal frugality is at the center of a new book, \u201cRetroSuburbia: The Downshifter\u2019s Guide to a Resilient Future,\u201d which Mr. Holmgren describes as part manual and part manifesto.Inside the adobe home he built himself in Hepburn Springs, a spa town in the southern Australian state of Victoria, Mr. Holmgren, 63, is putting his words into practice.\u201cWe need to bring power back to local areas and local people,\u201d he said in March from his home, which sits on more than two acres, where he grows 200 different crops. \u201cThe pursuit of local food is central to that and always has been. Frugal hedonism is our approach.\u201dThat approach is seen throughout his home. In a corner of his living room sit a spinning wheel, baskets of nuts and piles of corn and apples. Excluding rice, coconut cream and his favorite soy sauce, everything Mr. Holmgren eats is grown on the property.The house, known as Melliodora \u2014 a local variety of eucalyptus \u2014 is powered by solar energy and cooled, he explained, through passive design, not air-conditioning.Permaculture started with the idea of turning trashed suburban backyards into sustainable gardens, in which the natural environment dictated the garden\u2019s plan and purpose.That small idea became a global phenomenon, practiced by ecologists and landscape designers in 126 countries. The philosophy stresses a balance between agriculture and a site\u2019s permanent ecology \u2014 its soil, water and climate.Thousands of permaculture practitioners known as \u201cpermies\u201d have come to Melliodora over the decades to live there and learn firsthand from Mr. Holmgren. But after a career filled with accolades and achievements, he is wary of being seen as a green guru.\u201cI have been reluctant to do anything to harvest recognition back to me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat permaculture has gone viral is more than enough, for without any rah-rah hubris you can give more.\u201dHis status as an outsider has its roots in a childhood spent in remote West Australia. Born in York, the state\u2019s oldest inland town, he was raised in the region\u2019s only Jewish family.A move to Perth meant schoolyard taunts about his faith \u2014 he was the only student in a school of 600 who did not attend religion classes \u2014 and about his lunches: whole-meal sandwiches and dried fruit. An iconoclast even then, he refused to stand for the playing of the national anthem in protest of Australia\u2019s involvement in the Vietnam War.A formative moment in his youth, he said, was watching construction crews drain the swamps of the Swan River to build suburban housing developments. The swamps, natural playgrounds, were a respite from the bullying he faced at school.Seeing nature give way to tract houses, supermarkets and the other trappings of 20th-century suburbia awoke in him \u201can imperative to disconnect from the engine of global destruction.\u201dNow, he wants to rescue the suburbs from consumerism and teach others to do the same. \u201cRetroSuburbia\u201d \u2014 edited by his friends, published by his company, Melliodora Publishing, and nearly 600 pages long \u2014 is aimed at teaching suburbanites how to grow food, produce power and reduce debt.By example, Mr. Holmgren buys his clothes only at thrift stores.\u201cSince I was a kid I was interested in fashion,\u201d he said, \u201cso I started sewing my own clothes from 16. I only got them from op shops or my father\u2019s discards.\u201dAmong the skills taught in the book are how to retrofit a home with solar panels, collect and store water, use wood for cooking and warmth, defend against wildfires, raise domesticated animals, preserve food and recycle waste.The book \u201cremoves the fences of the suburbs and the mind,\u201d said Costa Georgiadias, a TV host with a gardening show, \u201cand replaces them with practical and positive solutions.\u201dAnother reader of the book, Louisa Mariana, a 65-year-old artist from the Melbourne suburb of Northcote, has implored friends to buy the book and said she had been inspired to plan a chicken coop and order a beehive.To print \u201cRetroSuburbia\u201d in Australia rather than China, Mr. Holmgren said, he raised an additional 30,000 Australian dollars, $22,500, by crowdfunding. He has avoided selling the book through large multinational stores like Amazon, preferring to offer it through permaculture websites and booksellers.For him, the process of developing and advancing permaculture, as well as writing the book, is rooted in soil that is particularly Australian \u2014 arid, infertile and unforgiving.\u201cI am just another Australian trying to work out how we move beyond camping in this land to being rooted to it,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cPermaculture has been my sustained search to find home.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Earlier in April, it said it would open its fourth fulfillment center in Nevada, bringing more than 1,000 jobs to North Las Vegas. In March, it revealed plans to build its first such facility in Missouri.\u201cThey\u2019ve been on a pretty blistering pace, getting a lot of space everywhere,\u201d said Greg Melich, an analyst with MoffettNathanson.Building research and development centers to support new technology, while also enlarging its vast network of distribution centers, has increased Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures so that they now roughly equal Walmart\u2019s, Mr. Melich said.In Boston, Amazon confirmed on Tuesday that it would move into 430,000 square feet in WS Development\u2019s Seaport project, bringing 2,000 jobs in machine learning, speech science, cloud computing and robotics engineering. That will double its technology work force in the metropolitan area.The emphasis on speech science is a sign that Amazon is betting that its Alexa digital assistant is at the vanguard of voice-based commerce, a form of shopping that Mr. Melich said was poised to grow at a rapid clip the way mobile buying did several years ago.It was not clear if Amazon\u2019s investment in the Boston Seaport project offered any clues to the city\u2019s chances of landing HQ2. The company is expected to announce its selection this year.\u201cEveryone wants the cake, which is the headquarters, but if not, they\u2019ll take the icing,\u201d said Dennis Frenchman, a professor of urban design and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Boston officials approved $5 million in property tax incentives over 15 years for Amazon to occupy its Seaport offices, and have dangled another $5 million in breaks if the company agrees to more local expansion and job creation.The facility will add 3,000 tech jobs to Amazon\u2019s current head count in the area.Vancouver did not land on Amazon\u2019s short list of possible headquarters locations. But it is a three-hour drive from Seattle, where Amazon is based, and a short flight from the California tech centers where Amazon likes to recruit employees.Vancouver has also drawn attention from Microsoft, which is based across the border in Washington State.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Place 14 of 52: Seattle, City of Glass", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 52 Places travelerI didn\u2019t expect glass to be the theme of my visit to Seattle \u2014 but I was captivated. Here are five ways to experience it. Two assistants worked wordlessly beside him, manning blowtorches and helping shape the hot glass with an array of tools. I sat on a bench, feeling like the 2,200-degree heat might melt my face off. The final result would come after many more hours of cooling and sandblasting: a noble bird covered in designs based on Mr. Singletary\u2019s Tlingit tribal culture. In Seattle, I found myself equally captivated. Here are other ways to experience the city\u2019s glass scene. Beneath Seattle\u2019s famed Space Needle, a Medusa\u2019s head of hundreds of yellow, orange and red snakelike tendrils of blown glass sits atop a mound of Black Mondo grass from Japan. Together, they look like a Koosh ball perched on a shag rug \u2014 or maybe a curly-spiked sea anemone stuck to the head of someone with a terrible haircut. Changes are overhead, as well: The Space Needle is refurbishing its observation decks, with new glass and glass benches on the upper level (already open) and the world\u2019s first and only rotating glass floor to open later this year on the lower level \u2014 all the better to see the colorful squiggles of glass below.Mr. Chihluy\u2019s work is everywhere here, too; he\u2019s from Tacoma and inspired the museum. A fountain filled with his undulating clear-glass shapes overlooks the waterfront just outside the museum\u2019s front door. On the monumental Chihuly Glass Bridge, people can walk through a corridor of his glass. His sculptures even hang from the ceiling of the downtown train station.The idea of the Spheres, Ron Gagliardo, head horticulturalist, told me on a tour, was to create a kind of break room for Amazon employees to reconnect with nature in an urban jungle. \u201cThey can relax and refresh, maybe meet a colleague for lunch or coffee,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in a place where they can feel differently and work differently and think differently.\u201d When I visited, dozens of employees were taking meetings or typing away on laptops beneath tropical fauna.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: Branson, Mo.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Americans\u2019 Series Finale: The World Crashes In", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Americans\u201cWe\u2019ll get used to it.\u201dEasy for her to say. Life in the Soviet Union without her children may seem doable for Elizabeth Jennings, but how are we going to do without \u201cThe Americans\u201d?The show\u2019s marvelous six-season run came to a close Wednesday night with an ending that was happy only in the sense that everyone survived. Death took a holiday, but sadness was everywhere, hanging in the air like the Moscow fog in the final shot. As Elizabeth and Philip fled America, their story felt very Russian.In scene after scene, we saw characters \u2014 often for the last time \u2014 sitting down, shellshocked and silent. Henry in the hockey bleachers, abandoned by his parents. Paige at Claudia\u2019s table, totally alone. Oleg on the floor of his cell and Elina in their apartment, not knowing if they\u2019d ever see each other again. Stan in a chair beside his bed, staring at the wife he\u2019d never be able to trust. Most unbearably, Igor Burov on a bench in a Moscow park, slapping his knees in his helplessness, bereft of a second son.The finale, \u201cSTART,\u201d had the mood of a fugue and the structure of a three-act play. Act I was The Escape From Stan, featuring the confrontation on which the entire series pivoted, a static, excruciating 11-minute scene in the parking garage of Paige\u2019s apartment building.Act II was The Flight From America, as Elizabeth, Philip and Paige traveled north by stolen car and Amtrak, with a symbolic stop at McDonald\u2019s, backed by Dire Straits\u2019s plaintive \u201cBrothers in Arms\u201d and U2\u2019s soaring \u201cWith or Without You.\u201d (Kudos to the commenter Pastor Tim for calling that one.) This section was a nonstop emotional workout: the last phone call to the oblivious Henry, the acknowledgment of Oleg\u2019s plight, Stan\u2019s drive to St. Edwards.And the wrenching \u2014 also thrilling \u2014 moment when Elizabeth saw Paige standing on the platform as the train pulled out for Montreal. From now on, it may not be possible to hear Bono begin the closing wail of \u201cWith or Without You\u201d and not see Keri Russell\u2019s face pressed against the train\u2019s window.Act III was the coda \u2014 Philip and Elizabeth back in the U.S.S.R., safe for the first time with only a few minutes left in the series. They were making the world safer too \u2014 completing Oleg\u2019s failed mission \u2014 but at a terrible cost.Some will say the cost \u2014 losing their children and their American lives \u2014 wasn\u2019t high enough; that\u2019s an argument for the comments. For me, it was fitting, and the finale was tremendously satisfying, if not perfect in its details. There was neither need nor time for indulgent goodbye cameos; only Derek Luke as the dead Gregory made a reappearance, in a dream. We saw what happened to the people who mattered, and the questions that mattered were answered to the extent they needed to be. The rest is fan fiction.The episode opened with Philip in one of those bleak, anonymous garages, it\u2019s interior lighted and shot like Caligari\u2019s cabinet. Elizabeth arrived, in the blue baseball cap. (The second disguise we ever saw her in, back in the pilot.) Her plan was to pick up Henry in New Hampshire but Philip said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d It was the first of the episode\u2019s crushing but perfectly logical decisions: \u201cHis future is here.\u201d Elizabeth made a guttural noise, wiped way a tear and carried on.Stan called Dupont Circle Travel, where Rick got a final scene, reporting that neither of his bosses was at work. Stan and Agent Ganzel then staked out one last wrong garage. (It wasn\u2019t a garage we\u2019d ever seen before \u2014 as far as I could tell, the episode wasn\u2019t stuffed with Easter eggs.) Philip and Elizabeth were elsewhere, stealing a car \u2014 an unnoticeable magenta Taurus, I believe \u2014 and heading to Paige\u2019s apartment. Convincing her to leave Henry took a little more work \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019ll hate you,\u201d she said, and Philip replied, \u201cI know.\u201d But she followed orders like always.Meanwhile, the right light bulb finally went off at the right time, and Stan left the stakeout for a little freelancing. From a roof across the street, he saw Elizabeth and Philip arrive at Paige\u2019s and then leave with her. (What are the odds her building wouldn\u2019t have an internal stairway to the parking garage?) He caught up with them just as they got to the car, and the momentous scene played out in the harsh garage light.The Jenningses tried to play it off \u2014 Paige came up with the excuse that she wasn\u2019t feeling well \u2014 but a suddenly livid Stan wasn\u2019t buying it. He knew Elizabeth was lying when she said they\u2019d come from the travel agency. And he knew the car wasn\u2019t a loaner, as Philip claimed. \u201cI\u2019m not some traffic cop,\u201d he snarled, and when Philip took a conciliatory step toward him, Stan pulled his gun. The rest of the scene played out with at gunpoint, and it was hard to say whom to be more worried for \u2014 the Jenningses, with Philip and Paige quaking, or Stan, with Elizabeth coolly waiting for her chance.Even at the wrong end of a gun, the spies took the upper hand, refusing Stan\u2019s order to lie on the ground. Then Philip went to work. Switching to confession mode \u2014 \u201cWe had a job to do\u201d \u2014 he gave the performance of his life, playing Stan the hardest when it mattered the most. The con worked because it was based on truth: Stan was Philip\u2019s only friend; Philip wished Stan had stayed with him in EST (great line); with Oleg arrested, Philip and Elizabeth had to get the message through.Philip also did a little blaming of the victim, telling Stan, \u201cYou moved in next to me!\u201d Stan\u2019s life may have been a joke, as he claimed, but Philip\u2019s was worse. (There was also some lying. Gennadi and Sofia? Who? But Stan made sure Paige knew that her parents were high-volume killers, which probably figured into later events.)The appeals to friendship and world peace worked: \u201cWe\u2019re getting in that car and we\u2019re driving away,\u201d Philip said, and Stan let them go. Before they got in the car, Paige said, \u201cYou have to take care of Henry,\u201d handing off responsibility for her brother and reducing viewers everywhere to tears. And then, as an afterthought, Philip ruined Stan\u2019s life. \u201cI think there\u2019s a chance Renee might be one of us,\u201d he said, throwing out his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201dWhether the scene worked \u2014 whether Stan\u2019s decision was credible \u2014 is a big, series-defining question with no definitive answer, but it worked for me; if anything rang false, it was probably the volume and profanity with which Stan expressed his anger, which didn\u2019t feel like Stan.The tension of the escape was leavened by several cutaways to small, sad scenes elsewhere. Father Andrei broke under Dennis\u2019s gentle prodding, giving the F.B.I. its first accurate descriptions of Elizabeth and Philip, which he was able to do because they had done without disguises during their wedding ceremony. (The sketches, like everything else the F.B.I. did, were too little too late \u2014 all they did was confirm Stan\u2019s last-minute, career-saving report to Dennis.) And in Moscow, Arkady delivered the bad news to Oleg\u2019s dad: Doing the right thing would get Oleg a long American prison term, with no trade in the offing, because Oleg\u2019s mission had been off the books.Now the spies hit the road, stopping at a remote parking lot \u2014 with a sign reading \u201cRules enforced by law enforcement\u201d \u2014 to don their final disguises and bury their American lives (that is, ditch incriminating material). Henry\u2019s unneeded fake passport went into the hole, along with the cyanide necklace and Elizabeth and Philip\u2019s American wedding rings, exchanged for the Russian ones they\u2019d kept in the cubbyhole.At the show\u2019s final pay phone, presumably in a train-station parking lot, Philip asked for Henry Jennings one last time. It wasn\u2019t as sad a scene as Igor Burov\u2019s, but it was up there. Henry, pulled away from a Ping-Pong game, rolled his eyes as his dad told him he loved him and how proud he was of him, and accused Philip of being drunk. Elizabeth, knowing she\u2019d never be able to talk to her son again, could only manage, \u201cWhat your father said,\u201d and Paige couldn\u2019t even get on the phone. \u201cI\u2019ll see you next week,\u201d Henry told his dad, and hung up. Philip, Elizabeth and Paige stood for a moment, then walked on, a silent unit.When the jangling guitars of \u201cWith or Without You\u201d came on the soundtrack for the final pop-song montage, I winced \u2014 it seemed like an awfully obvious choice. (The show had never used either U2 or Dire Straits before this episode.) But like everything else, it worked, even if I\u2019ll never entirely lose the sense that it was cheating \u2014 an easy way to achieve, or accentuate, the big emotional catharsis that was coming.For their last meal the Jenningses stopped at a McDonald\u2019s, putting a bow on Philip\u2019s American experience \u2014 he even stopped to look at an all-American, Jennings-like family of four sitting happily in a booth before carrying the bags out to the car. (The exterior shot was of an actual old-school McDonald\u2019s, but everything around it \u2014 parking lot, dark roads \u2014 was green-screened in.)Back in Washington, Stan was called to F.B.I. headquarters to see the sketches and get a sympathetic shoulder squeeze from Dennis. Coming home late, he looked down at a sleeping Renee, tucked her in and then sat and stared, wondering if the illegals were not just across the street but in his bed. The next day, as Dennis and the F.B.I. swarmed the Jennings house, Stan gave Renee a hug and drove away. Her lingering look at the house across the street \u2014 perhaps incidental, perhaps full of meaning \u2014 was a masterful tease. Like Stan, we\u2019ll never know.The Jenningses were now on a train to Canada, sitting in separate rows, and at the last stop in America the Border Patrol was waiting, sketches in hand for Philip \u201cMischa\u201d Jennings and Elizabeth \u201cNadezhda\u201d Jennings. The tension ratcheted back up as the agents checked first Philip\u2019s and then Elizabeth\u2019s Canadian passports. When the agent handed back Elizabeth\u2019s passport and moved on, she took a deep breath and \u201cWith or Without You,\u201d which had stopped when the agents boarded, came back on in what seemed like triumph.Then the world crashed in: Elizabeth\u2019s face went wild, and through the window she and we saw Paige on the platform, staring back. You could sense it coming, at least as soon as the camera came in on Elizabeth\u2019s face \u2014 why hadn\u2019t we seen Paige\u2019s passport being checked? \u2014 but it was still a dramatic coup. Perhaps even more moving was the next shot, when Philip, sitting farther back, saw Paige and had the presence of mind to bolt from his seat and go to Elizabeth. They sat together, not saying a word, and it was anguishing but it was also the start of what, for Elizabeth, constituted a healing process \u2014 by the end of the episode, she\u2019d be the strong one again.The producers didn\u2019t let up, either. As Paige sank onto a bench, utterly alone \u2014 presumably pondering her lying, killing parents and her reluctance to abandon her little brother \u2014 Stan arrived at St. Edwards and, in one of my favorite details of the episode, rapped on the glass of the hockey rink to get Henry\u2019s attention. Our last view of either of them was from a distance, Henry (wearing a jersey with \u201cJennings\u201d on the back) shaking his head as he learned that his life was a sham and his parents had ghosted him.Paige got the last scene in America: walking into Claudia\u2019s empty apartment, taking the vodka out of the freezer and pouring herself a shot at the table where she, her mother and Claudia had shared all those Russian meals.What will happen to her? We don\u2019t know, and neither do the showrunners Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields, who rightly point out, when asked, that the story is what\u2019s on screen and the rest is for us to decide. Will Oleg rot in jail? Will Paige keep spying? Will Henry become a psychiatrist? Don\u2019t know. Show\u2019s over.We have a better idea about Philip and Elizabeth, though. Skipping over Canada, we next saw them on a plane, where Elizabeth woke from a dream of an alternate life in which she was with Gregory and had apparently lost a pregnancy. (\u201cI don\u2019t want a kid anyway,\u201d she told him. Maybe it had really happened.) Then Gregory was gone from the bed and Elizabeth was looking at artworks on the walls, which included the Erica canvas Elizabeth had burned, and a small, smudged drawing of Paige and Henry, the kids she wanted but no longer had.Finally they were in a car at a Russian checkpoint, where a guard made a phone call before waving them through. This last section felt both elegiac, with Claudia\u2019s favorite tune, \u201cNone But the Lonely Heart,\u201d on the soundtrack, and nervous \u2014 they were so close, but seemingly so vulnerable. (As they drove through the night, reconciling themselves to a future in the eastern bloc, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of the great, sad ending of \u201cThe Unbearable Lightness of Being.\u201d)\u201cThey\u2019ll be O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll remember us. And,\u201d he added, choking up, \u201cthey\u2019re not kids anymore. We raised them.\u201dWell, more or less. The irony was that Paige and Henry, though raised by idealistic Russian spies, were the victims of a funhouse-mirror version of 1980s American bad parenting \u2014 the latchkey kids of swinging, self-actualizing, self-hating parents. America was becoming the shallow, materialistic country the Soviets had always accused it of being, and the Jenningses were forced to go along for the ride.\u201cIt feels strange\u201d to be home, Philip said. Elizabeth gave him a long look and, fully back in control, said in Russian, \u201cWe\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d The last shot was of them from behind, still together, looking at the shining city they\u2019d given up their lives for. It was shrouded in fog.The comments are open, and we want to hear your thoughts about the final episode and the series as a whole. When you\u2019re ready to start rewatching it from Episode 1, the first five seasons are on Amazon Prime Video.An earlier version of this recap misstated the streaming service which has the first five seasons of the show available for viewing.

{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Continues to Test Regulators: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 What\u2019s next for CBS and Shari Redstone?\u2022 Kushners are near a deal for troubled 666 Fifth Avenue.\u2022 China\u2019s banks continue to dwarf those in the West.\u2022 How Michael Cohen\u2019s bank records emerged.\u2022 The splits in the Trump trade team.Wells Fargo\u2019s missteps are creating an important test for President Trump\u2019s regulators.In a statement included in the Journal report, Wells Fargo said: \u201cThis matter involves documents used for internal purposes. No customers were negatively impacted, no data left the company, and no products or services were sold as a result.\u201dBut a bank doesn\u2019t have to harm customers to get into trouble with its regulators. Much of what regulators do is aimed at ensuring banks have systems in place to make sure they are complying with regulations. As scandals have hit Wells Fargo over the past two years, regulators have been pressing the bank to tighten up its controls. But the missteps reported by the Journal occurred as recently as the early part of this year, suggesting Wells Fargo is still struggling to improve its compliance and its workplace culture.It is not clear how widespread the purported abuses are. But the documentation was reportedly related to controls aimed at spotting money-laundering, an area of compliance where regulators tend to hold a hard line. If the documentation missteps in the business bank are significant, regulators could be ready to take tough action. In its enforcement action, the O.C.C. stated that it:\u201c\u2026expressly reserves its right to assess future civil money penalties, or take other supervisory and/or enforcement actions, including in circumstances where the O.C.C. determines that the bank is not making sufficient and sustainable progress towards implementation of an effective and sustainable enterprise-wide compliance risk management program.\u201dIf more problems crop up at Wells Fargo, the public will be more likely to believe that the bank is too big to manage \u2014 and that regulators are not up to the task of reining it in.- Peter EavisChina\u2019s banks continue to dwarf those in the West.The only change from last year among the 10 largest banks came at the No. 10 spot, where France\u2019s Credit Agricole leapfrogged Wells Fargo. Here\u2019s a look at the top 25.Chancellor Andre Bouchard of Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery rescinded a temporary restraining order against Shari Redstone\u2019s National Amusements, handing her a victory in an unusually vicious battle between the broadcaster and its controlling shareholder.In his ruling, Chancellor Bouchard said that it wasn\u2019t necessary for the court to grant the restraining order \u2014 one CBS argued was necessary to prevent Ms. Redstone from replacing directors, to the harm of other shareholders \u2014 because Delaware law allows the company to challenge such board removals.From the ruling:I am not convinced that the harm plaintiffs fear would be irreparable. To the contrary, the court has extensive power to provide redress if Ms. Redstone takes action(s) inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations owed by a controlling stockholder\u2014 Michael de la MercedShares of CBS declined 6 percent after CBS\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order against Ms. Redstone was denied. The stock was recently down 4 percent.What could happen when Chancellor Bouchard rules, as soon as today:\u2022 He blocks Ms. Redstone\u2019s bylaw amendment; CBS\u2019s board proceeds to neuter its controlling shareholder; a big new precedent is set.\u2022 He lets Ms. Redstone\u2019s bylaw change stay; CBS\u2019s insurrection is defeated; and the fate of its board and its C.E.O., Les Moonves, becomes cloudy. (Ms. Redstone has said she doesn\u2019t want to oust the board.)\u2022 Something else we haven\u2019t thought of. Stay tuned.Should CBS ultimately prevail in what would be a highly unusual attempt to dilute a controlling shareholder, a bevy of dual-class companies will no doubt be scrambling to rewrite their bylaws. The conflict is magnified in this instance because Ms. Redstone is the controlling shareholder in both parties to the proposed merger.Charles Kushner, head of the Kushner Companies, is in advanced talks with Brookfield Properties over a partnership to take control of the 41-story aluminum-clad tower 666 Fifth Avenue in Midtown, according to two real estate executives who have been briefed on the pending deal but are not authorized to discuss it. Brookfield is a publicly traded company, headquartered in Canada, one of whose major investors is the Qatar Investment Authority.Mr. Kushner and his son Jared, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and one of his key advisers, bought the office tower, which is between 51st and 52nd Streets, 11 years ago for a record-setting $1.8 billion. But the building today only generates about half its annual mortgage payment, and 30 percent of the 41-story tower is vacant.In late 2016, Mr. Kushner and his son were close to a much different kind of deal with Anbang, a giant Chinese insurance company with ties to the country\u2019s ruling elite, and with a billionaire from Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani. That plan involved demolishing the existing building at 666 Fifth and erecting a $7.5 billion luxury super tower.\u2014 Charles V. BagliFrom the WSJ:\u201cThe employees in Wells Fargo\u2019s so-called wholesale unit, which is separate from its retail bank, added or altered information without customers\u2019 knowledge, according to the people familiar with the matter. The information added varied from social security numbers to addresses to dates of birth for people associated with business-banking clients, the people said.\u201d\u201cThe behavior took place in 2017 and early 2018 as Wells Fargo was trying to meet a deadline to comply with a regulatory consent order related to the bank\u2019s anti-money-laundering controls, the people said.\u201dFor investors, there was perhaps no number in Walmart\u2019s earnings report that mattered as much as the giant retailer\u2019s e-commerce sales, or more specifically the growth of those sales.Walmart said this morning that its digital sales grew 33 percent in its fiscal first quarter and that it expects online sales to grow 40 percent for the year.But the transformation has had its bumps. After three quarters of more than 50 percent growth, e-commerce sales increased just 23 percent in the fourth quarter. Jet was supposed to be Walmart\u2019s answer to Amazon, but analysts said Jet\u2019s growth had slowed in the fourth quarter. And Walmart said it would focus on driving new customers through its main Walmart.com site.\u201cThat system is a safeguard for the bank. It\u2019s a stockpile of information. When something\u2019s not there that should be, I immediately became concerned.\u201dThe $50 billion GCM Grosvenor is expected to announce this morning that its infrastructure business will team up with North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions to make sure that \u201cresponsible contractors,\u201d including union members, will be part of the process for its investments.Sean McGarvey, the union\u2019s president, said, \u201cGCM Grosvenor\u2019s responsible contractor policy is as good as any we have seen for workers and communities, if not better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mom-Coms Latch On to the Raw Reality of New Motherhood", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few weeks ago, I was watching a new show, me and the laptop scrunched into the corner of the sofa. It was late at night and everyone else had gone to sleep, when rounding the second episode, my sympathetic nervous system started working unpaid overtime: short breath, tensed muscles, pounding heart, the whole hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal shebang.Cortisol or no, I binged all seven episodes \u2014 twice \u2014 and lived to tell. But for some new and newish mothers, \u201cThe Letdown\u201d may feel so achingly familiar that it\u2019s just about unwatchable. Speaking of aches, the title refers to the reflex that sends milk flowing through the breast, a reflex sometimes accompanied by knifelike pains. All the joys.Mothers aren\u2019t exactly TV noobs. (I\u2019ve seen \u201cI Love Lucy,\u201d too.) But for a long time, TV seemed to think that having a baby was the kind of story arc that could be handled in an episode. That helpless, screaming, wetting, nipple-abrading bundle of joy wouldn\u2019t really change the woman who birthed it. And if it did, it would change her in some sunshiny, uplifting fashion that didn\u2019t interfere with a return to full hair and makeup by the time the credits rolled.Offscreen, many women may find that new motherhood alters them in a deeper and less camera-ready ways. It can take a sledgehammer to ego boundaries, making you wonder who you were before you had a baby and who you are now and where did all those new moles come from.That\u2019s like life, too. At least it\u2019s like Alison Bell\u2019s life. Ms. Bell, the co-creator of \u201cThe Letdown\u201d who stars as Audrey, became pregnant while she was making the pilot. Her son is now 4 and he still doesn\u2019t sleep through the night. \u201cWe were conscious of making things ongoing concerns, ongoing challenges,\u201d she said.Sarah Scheller, the other co-creator, based the show on her experiences in a support group for new mothers. She\u2019d been conditioned to think of her own stories and the stories of other new parents as mundane, as niche, but she knew that they weren\u2019t.\u201cIt\u2019s such a steep learning curve when you become a mother,\u201d Ms. Bell added. \u201cThe people who suggest that it\u2019s a boring time of your life, that is just bizarre.\u201dShe also had fond memories of sleep training: \u201cYou\u2019re sitting there thinking you\u2019re ruining your child\u2019s life, thinking this is the damage that\u2019s gonna make them a drug addict when they\u2019re 18.\u201dShe always knew that the relationship between her character, Bridgette, and Bridgette\u2019s son, Larry, would drive the show. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the child to be a prop,\u201d Ms. Shaw said. \u201cWhen you are a mother to a young child \u2014 a single mother, a married mother \u2014 you\u2019re constantly preoccupied with your child.\u201d She\u2019s given her own son a small role so that they can hang out together on set, though she (wisely) hasn\u2019t let him see any of the episodes.Julia\u2019s a battler. She\u2019s just not a very good battler. She bungles a children\u2019s party, she falls into a swimming pool, she botches a school auction, trying and mostly failing to wrest a stable identity and some crumbs of leisure time from the work-life imbalance.This extreme focus on the self can make \u201cMotherland\u201d seem solipsistic. But if male characters have been allowed to gaze at their navels for decades, maybe women deserve a turn. (It\u2019s the least they deserve. Have you seen what pregnancy does to the lower stomach?)In these new shows, most of the story lines have been drawn directly from the creators\u2019 own lives and the lives of their friends. \u201cTheir stories are not safe with us and they know that now,\u201d said Ms. Scheller of \u201cThe Letdown.\u201dAnd yet everyone I spoke to emphasized that these shows weren\u2019t intended only for mothers. Certainly \u201cSMILF,\u201d with its casual nudity and premium-cable raunch, seems to reach past the stroller set, while other shows may gratify the child-free. A few close-ups of a wailing baby and Siri and Alexa will be busy searching tubal ligation.Both \u201cMotherland\u201d and \u201cThe Letdown\u201d stick a dad amid the mom\u2019s groups, an equal-opportunity, tent-widening gesture. The main dads \u2014 Audrey\u2019s husband, Julia\u2019s estranged husband, Frankie\u2019s former partner \u2014 are well-meaning, but more or less checked out and not always especially competent. \u201cAlthough men are changing and the dynamics are changing, it\u2019s still not even. That\u2019s what we learned ourselves, that\u2019s what we found through research,\u201d Ms. Bell said. Because my husband reads this paper \u2014 hi, babe, I think we\u2019re out of diapers \u2014 I cannot possibly comment on whether or not I find this relatable.Still there\u2019s one essential story these shows are helpfully debunking, the one about new mothers having it all. Yes, you can have it all, assuming your all doesn\u2019t include sanity, ease, a coherent sense of self, an untrammeled pelvic floor. That part feels familiar, too, mostly because I live in a country without paid maternity leave or high-quality sliding-scale child care, which means I went back to work at five weeks and have blown off R.E.M. sleep since and I\u2019m writing this while the almost-two-year-old is watching \u201cDaniel Tiger\u201d against the explicit recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics.The mothers in these shows, like most of the mothers I know, are slap-fighting with a pretty much unanswerable question. Here it is in Ms. Shaw\u2019s words: \u201cHow do you strike that balance of needing to live your life and also honoring the fact that you have this little being you\u2019re fully responsible for?\u201dMaybe that\u2019s why I keep watching. I\u2019m hoping some show will figure it out for me. I\u2019m pretty sure it involves an au pair.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Capital or Labor Winning at Your Favorite Company? Introducing the Marx Ratio", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your InboxWho benefits the most when a company is successful: its shareholders or its employees? Capital or labor?It is a question that speaks to some of the oldest debates in economics. But now, thanks to a minor provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, we have a tool for measuring, in rough terms at least, how much any given publicly traded firm rewards its shareholders relative to its rank-and-file employees.Behold, the Marx Ratio.We named it for the 19th-century economist and philosopher Karl Marx, who argued that the interests of capital and labor are inherently in tension. His intellectual adversaries argued that those interests are in fact aligned, as successful companies inevitably reward both capital and labor.We take no stand in that debate. But we have come up with a simple way of calculating how the fruits of any given company\u2019s success are distributed.The Marx Ratio, as we\u2019re calling it, captures the relationship between a company\u2019s profits \u2014 the return to capital, on a per-employee basis \u2014 and how much its median employee is compensated, a rough proxy for the return to labor.Companies with high Marx Ratios offer particularly strong rewards to their shareholders relative to workers. For example, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer had a Marx Ratio of 2.64, meaning the per-employee earnings captured by shareholders were about 2.6 times as high as the compensation a typical employee received. Numbers below 1 signal the reverse: a more favorable return to labor. The  Marx Ratio of 0.498 for the health insurer Aetna means that it earned only half as much per worker for its shareholders as it paid its median employee.Companies with high Marx Ratios also included the tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris International; consumer products companies like Kraft-Heinz and Colgate-Palmolive; fast food giants McDonald\u2019s and Yum Brands (parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut); and almost all real estate investment trusts.Those that favored workers more tended to be in labor-intensive industries. They included the huge retailers Walmart and Amazon, hotel companies like Marriott and Hilton, and both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.Companies that record a net loss consequently have a negative Marx Ratio. For those companies, which in 2017 included General Electric and Citigroup, shareholders lost money while workers still got paid.Of the 394 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 that had reported their median compensation number by May 3, the median Marx Ratio was 0.82, meaning at a typical company the median pay was higher than the profit generated per worker.Beginning this year, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies in the United States to disclose their median employee compensation: how much pay the person in the middle of their distribution receives. The research firm MyLogIQ compiled the data; the remaining companies have more time because of the dates of their fiscal year. We spell out the math, and its limitations, below.Median compensation is an imprecise measurement of how much of a company\u2019s returns flow to labor. Among other things, it can be distorted by companies\u2019 use of contract and part-time labor, and a median pay number inherently fails to capture the full range of how a company\u2019s workers are paid.Given those flaws, the Marx Ratio isn\u2019t some definitive measure of how a company affects the economy and society. Rather, it is a tool for understanding the differences between companies and industries. In particular, the more a company\u2019s ability to generate profits is driven by things shareholders own \u2014 patents, a well-known brand or capital goods like machines and real estate \u2014 the higher its Marx Ratio will tend to be.To see how the Marx Ratio can help you understand the competitive dynamics and economic structure of an industry, consider how the numbers vary across well-known companies in some prominent industries.Wall Street may be the ultimate bastion of capitalism. But some of the highest Marx Ratios in the financial industry aren\u2019t found at the companies stocked with cutthroat traders and deal makers. Rather, the business of commercial banking \u2014 accepting deposits and making loans from branches around the United States \u2014 features a higher return to capital relative to labor.So for example, Wells Fargo has a Marx Ratio of 1.4, and JPMorgan Chase came in at 1.2. By contrast, Goldman Sachs\u2019s number was only 0.9 and Morgan Stanley\u2019s was 0.8.In effect, the profitability of those commercial banks is driven by things the company controls: their network of branches, their information technology systems, their brand reputation. Their employees, who include lots of bank tellers and loan officers, have little leverage with which to demand high pay; the median compensation at Wells Fargo was around $60,000.By contrast, the investment banks employ a lot more highly compensated, highly sought-after professionals, who in turn can demand premium salaries. The median compensation at Goldman was about $135,000. Those workers were more successful at claiming the value the organization created.Meanwhile, BlackRock, the giant asset management company, pays Goldman-esque salaries (median compensation: $141,987)  but manages to have a higher Marx Ratio than either commercial or investment banks, as it is able to manage a huge $6.3 trillion with a lean 13,900 workers.You see similar divides among the most powerful giants of the technology industry.Facebook is wildly profitable, generating almost $635,000 in earnings per employee for shareholders. It also pays those employees extremely well, with median compensation of $240,340, for a Marx Ratio of 2.64.More of Facebook\u2019s success accrued to capital \u2014 to the company\u2019s owners \u2014 than to labor. Its profits are driven by the network effects that keep both users and advertisers wedded to it, which are owned by shareholders. Rank-and-file software developers and advertising sales workers have less ability to extract a big chunk of the value being created.By contrast, Amazon is not very profitable \u2014 it is plowing most of the earnings from its mature businesses into longer-term investments in emerging ones. And its core retail business has low profit margins and requires vast armies in distribution centers and, with the acquisition of Whole Foods, grocery stores.With earnings per employee of only $5,359 and median compensation of about $28,000, Amazon has a Marx Ratio that is a mere 0.19. So far, neither the median Amazon worker nor Amazon shareholders are being rewarded very handsomely.Other prominent tech companies are somewhere in between. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, generates a healthy $158,000 in profit per employee, but like Facebook has a high median pay of $197,000. That\u2019s good for a Marx Ratio of 0.8. Other notable tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have not yet reported a median compensation number, but are also likely to end up in that middle ground once they do \u2014 Apple had earnings per employee in the most recent fiscal year of $393,100, and Microsoft came in at $171,000.The highest Marx Ratios were found at real estate investment trusts: companies with a favorable tax structure devised to invest in real estate. Publicly traded REITs in the sample had a median Marx Ratio of 4.13, higher than any other category of companies.This makes sense, as these companies work more as vehicles through which to deploy capital toward real estate than as conventional operating businesses. The highest Marx Ratio, for example, at 38, was for Duke Realty, an Indianapolis-based company that manages $6.2 billion worth of industrial real estate with a mere 400 employees (who, we might add, are well compensated, with median pay of $109,695).Some of the highest Marx Ratios \u2014 as well as some of the lowest \u2014 are to be found at oil- and gas-related businesses. This also makes sense. Energy companies are making huge bets, often with borrowed money, the success of which depends on the future market price and on their ability to extract petroleum.That explains how EQT Corp., a Pittsburgh-based natural gas producer, had one of the highest Marx Ratios among non-REITS (7.1), while Houston-based oil giant Marathon Oil had the lowest in the sample (-18.9). Marathon\u2019s $5.7 billion loss was due mainly to the sale of a Canadian oil sands business.Low oil and gas prices were bad news for many energy shareholders. Over all, the energy sector accounted for four of the five lowest Marx Ratios, a list that also included Hess, Noble Energy and NRG Energy.It is a good business for shareholders to be in when things are going well, but the risk they are taking on is real.Here are the calculations behind the Marx Ratio \u2014 and some of the limitations to the underlying data that make it an imperfect measure of how a company rewards capital versus labor.The numerator is the net income of the company in question per employee. Note that net income is subject to big year-to-year fluctuations, and doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect a company\u2019s continuing operating performance in any given year.Note what the numerator isn\u2019t \u2014 this isn\u2019t about the returns shareholders could earn through stock price appreciation, or dividends. This is focused on the underlying economics of the business; returns through the stock market can fluctuate for all kinds of reasons.The denominator is the compensation to the median employee, as disclosed in the company\u2019s proxy statement, which can create distortions in representing rank-and-file employees.Companies also have some degree of flexibility in how they calculate median pay, so comparisons are not necessarily apples-to-apples. For example, they may choose to use statistical sampling instead of actual payroll records, and may exclude non-U.S. employees depending on privacy rules in overseas markets.A better number for the idea we\u2019re really trying to get at would be average compensation for nonexecutive employees, but companies aren\u2019t required to report that publicly.We intentionally kept the math of the Marx Ratio simple. But if you want to make it a little more sophisticated, there are options.For one, you might adjust the calculation based on how much capital a company required to make its money. Shareholder\u2019s equity, for example, captures the book value of a company\u2019s assets minus its liabilities. If two companies generate similar profits but one requires much less equity to do it, it is essentially more efficient at generating returns for capital.You also might consider adjusting the measure of profitability to smooth out a company\u2019s returns to shareholders. After all, when a company records some enormous loss, it is frequently because the company is marking down the value of an earlier acquisition for which it paid too much, meaning it is capturing a past bad decision rather than providing information about future operating performance.Given all those limitations, the Marx Ratio should not be used as a definitive measure of how a company does or does not contribute to inequality. Rather, think of it as an important clue about how it is organized, how its economic structure works, and to whom its greatest rewards tend to flow.Advertisement"}

Mr. Flannery said last fall that he wanted to sell off $20 billion in assets.Since the end of the financial crisis, G.E. has sold roughly $200 billion of assets. The company has moved to exit its finance arm, sold NBCUniversal and divested its appliance business that most people associated with G.E.Here\u2019s a timeline of some of G.E.\u2019s biggest transactions since the financial crisis.Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund lost when it took on Samsung three years ago. But the activist investor has claimed victory in its latest battle with a South Korean conglomerate, or chaebol.Here\u2019s how the hedge fund prevailed.The contextElliott said that the restructuring plan showed management \u201chas failed to act in the best interest of the companies and their respective shareholders.\u201d It instead proposed turning Hyundai Motor into a holding company that it said was more tax efficient and sustainable.Why Elliott could win this timeIn a presentation earlier this year, the hedge fund noted that Hyundai\u2019s proposed transaction was similar to what Samsung wanted to do in 2015, where the company sold an affiliate to the chaebol\u2019s holding company. There, Samsung was able to rally individual investors, who accounted for nearly a third of its shareholder base, to its cause.By contrast, retail investors comprise some 5 percent of Hyundai\u2019s shareholder base. Big international institutions, which make up the bulk of Hyundai\u2019s investors, are likely to be more immune to the entreaties of companies under attack from an activist if the campaign makes sense financially.\u2014 Michael de la MercedStock markets are up so far this month, suggesting in part that investors were betting that tensions between the United States and its largest trading partners would ease.That seemed to occur this weekend. The United States and China issued a joint statement on trade and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said planned tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods were on hold. China did not seem to commit to much that is concrete to gain a reprieve from the tariffs, a notable achievement for the country\u2019s negotiators.The joint statement said China would significantly increase its imports from the United States, but it did not say how much more it would buy and over what time period. The parts of the statement about investing in each other\u2019s country and protecting intellectual property were even vaguer.President Trump on Monday nevertheless promoted the statement as a win. But influential members of his administration who are still spoiling for a big trade fight will no doubt want to keep up the pressure on China \u2014 and Mr. Trump may at times share their desire in the coming months. Still, the events of recent weeks show that the United States was largely isolated in its trade fights and the Trump administration may have lacked the resolve or unity to keep up its hard-edged approach. The Trump administration can, of course,reintroduce the threat of tariffs if it believes China is failing to make concessions in the proceeding trade talks. But after stepping back this weekend, it will be harder for the Trump administration to make an aggressive stance appear credible.Indeed, the big question hanging over the Trump administration: Why did it withdraw its tariff threat now, before exacting hard, quantifiable concessions from China? One reason may be that the United States needs China\u2019s help in dealing with North Korea ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s summit with Kim Jong Un planned for June. Another reason may be that China was up for a long fight with the United States and signaled so. Whatever the cause, the takeaway for investors is that the Trump administration passed up an opportunity to show China that it meant what it said.Still, investors may not want to relax too much. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity has been rising even as he made combative moves on the trade front that at times roiled the market. In other words, there does not appear to be much political risk domestically, if any, to taking on China, and so Mr. Trump may use belligerent trade talk to stir up his base ahead of the midterm elections in November.But as long as he steps back from taking tough actions, investors will most likely take his rhetoric in stride. That stance has served them well.

But the pressure is on the Trump administration to back up its tough talk on China \u2014 a task that may be more difficult without the leverage of potential tariffs.The fight inside the White House is still real. Free-trade supporters like Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, are still slinging arrows at hard-liners like the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro. (While Mr. Mnuchin said the tariffs were \u201con hold,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said they were still possible.)The two sides have agreed on a \u201cframework\u201d under which China would increase its purchases of American goods, while putting in place \u201cstructural\u201d changes to protect American technology and to make it easier for American companies to compete in China.G.E. was advised by Morgan Stanley and Dyal Company, the boutique investment bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs deal maker Gordon Dyal, as well as the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.

{"Headline": "What the Microsoft Antitrust Case Taught Us", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Blumenthal is a Democratic senator from Connecticut.\u00a0Mr. Wu is a law professor who who specializes in antitrust.Twenty years ago today, Microsoft was sued by the Department of Justice and a coalition of 20 state attorneys general (including one of us, Mr. Blumenthal, of Connecticut) for violating federal antitrust law.Microsoft, the world\u2019s dominant software firm, and Bill Gates, the world\u2019s richest man, faced a challenge from the upstart company Netscape and its internet browser, Netscape Navigator. The suit accused Microsoft of illegally protecting its operating-system monopoly and seeking a new monopoly for its own browser, Internet Explorer. The fear was that Microsoft would kill Netscape, monopolize the browser market and use that point of control to dominate the coming age of the web.After a tough fight, the government won the case. There is now no browser monopoly, and the world has come to rely on the many apps, firms and ideas that were born after Microsoft\u2019s control was broken. Microsoft has become a gentler giant, and Mr. Gates has become a philanthropist.Yet it is worth remembering that at the time, challenging Microsoft was not a popular decision. Microsoft was a well-liked company and Mr. Gates was widely heralded as a visionary genius. Many, Microsoft most of all, argued that enforcing the antitrust laws against Microsoft would damage innovation and impede the economic growth fueled by the technology sector.This view turned out to be wrong. Innovation surged in the newly opened markets and the United States continued to spearhead growth in the technological world. The enduring lesson of the Microsoft case was that keeping markets open can require a trustbuster\u2019s courage to take decisive action against even a very popular monopolist.Imagine a world in which Microsoft had been allowed to monopolize the browser business. Holding a triple monopoly (operating system, major applications and the browser), Microsoft would have controlled the future of the web. Google, the tiny start-up, would have faced an unfair fight against Bing. Microsoft-Myspace might have become the default social network instead of Facebook. And who knows whether Netflix or any other online video service would have been started?It took the power of law enforcement to rebut Microsoft\u2019s claims that everything it was doing was pro-competitive, innovative and innocent. The discovery of candid internal company memos, a famously revealing deposition of Bill Gates and a full trial made it clear that Microsoft saw the internet as a major threat to its monopoly rule and was seeking to tame it.The presiding judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, was right to propose that Microsoft be broken into two companies \u2014 one for the Windows operating system, one for other products. In the end, unfortunately, Microsoft was kept whole.Some limitations were placed on Microsoft\u2019s behavior, such as a requirement that it share certain programming information with third-party companies. The appropriateness of that remedy is still debated. But what we do know is that the remedy pushed Microsoft to act with more caution, creating an essential opening for a new generation of firms.It might seem like a cruel irony that the immediate beneficiaries of the Microsoft antitrust case \u2014 namely, Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 have now become behemoths themselves. But this is how the innovation cycle works: It creates room for saplings to grow into giants, but then prevents the new giants from squashing the next generation of saplings. (Microsoft was itself, in the early 1980s, the beneficiary of another antitrust case, against IBM, the computing colossus of its time.)Which takes us to the present day. Unfortunately, ever since the Microsoft case there has been remarkably little oversight of the technology sector, despite the obvious signs of corporate consolidation and outsize market power. Enforcement of the antimonopoly laws has fallen: Between 1970 and 1999, the United States brought about 15 monopoly cases each year; between 2000 and 2014 that number went down to just three.Antitrust efforts have become too fixated on the idea that the only real harm consists of raising of prices for consumers. Yet in the Microsoft case, Internet Explorer was \u201cfree,\u201d even though Microsoft was bent on destroying competition with it. Today, both Google and Facebook offer products that are free. Society has grown to rely on them, but because they have no dollar price, antitrust regulators have been hesitant to take action.Any American can tell you that there is no free lunch. Everything has a price. We pay for these products and services with our time and our data. And like Microsoft, these firms have come to exert too much control over our shared technological future.At a hearing before the Senate, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, was asked to name Facebook\u2019s biggest competitor \u2014 a company providing a similar service that consumers can go to if they are unhappy with Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg could not name one. Part of the reason for this is that Facebook bought its most obvious competitors, Instagram and WhatsApp, and continues to acquire upstart companies before they can reach that point.The pattern is familiar. And if the Microsoft case showed us anything, it is that we should not trust any one company to decide our future.Richard Blumenthal is a Democratic senator from Connecticut. Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

In 2009, global debt was 213 percent of G.D.P.We used the I.M.F. database to measure the change in debt levels at six countries from 2006 until 2016, and then, using other I.M.F. statistics, we looked at their average G.D.P. growth in that decade. Notably, average growth in that period was slower than in the preceding 10 years, sometimes by a lot. The slowdowns were no doubt largely due to the negative impact of the financial crisis. But this exercise may also show that the added debt has failed to sufficiently stimulate the economies \u2013 and problems may lie ahead.\u2014 Peter EavisMore from Katherine Peralta, Rick Rothacker, Jourdan Rodrigue and Joseph Person of the Observer:Tepper, 60, is the richest of the known bidders who sought to buy the Panthers, with a net worth of $11 billion, according to Forbes.

A spokesman for Tepper declined to comment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhile AT&T is trying to buy Time Warner, its biggest rival is pursuing a different path \u2014 a strategy Verizon is apparently sticking with despite flirting with CBS and 21st Century Fox.Here\u2019s what Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Lowell McAdam, told David Faber of CNBC on Tuesday morning:Look, I can just say that we have looked at these assets over the period of time. We\u2019ve made the decision that digital is the way for us to go. We have no interest in a linear content company.The contextMs. Redstone told the C.E.O. of a potential acquirer of CBS that he should not make such an offer, thereby depriving CBS stockholders of a potentially value-enhancing opportunity that the board or the special committee should have been free to evaluate.Verizon was also said to have been sniffing around Fox assets at the same time that Walt Disney and Comcast were, though it quickly dropped out.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond rose to its highest level in seven years, throwing the recent stock market rally in doubt.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are down 0.7 percent in recent trading. If the Dow finishes down, it would end an eight-session rally that was its longest since September.The yield on the 10-year Treasury recently hit 3.06 percent. The yield first surpassed 3 percent last month.With interest rates at historic lows in recent years, investors pushed into riskier assets like stocks in search of better returns. The concern for investors is that higher yields could make riskier assets like stocks less attractive.As the gun maker nears the end of its bankruptcy proceedings, Andrew asks if some investor could work with its creditors to buy the company \u2014 and turn it into an exemplar of safer firearms policies.What would happen, for instance, if a consortium were to come together so that the banks offered the buyer a below-market loan, giving a socially responsible investor the advantage of a lower cost of capital? What would happen if one of the big retail chains like Walmart and Dick\u2019s \u2014 both of which have already established that they only want to sell guns in a responsible way \u2014 were to guarantee distribution, sales and marketing support?The challenge: Who would have the courage to stand up to the N.R.A. and pro-gun government officials?We saw Bill and Melinda Gates, Ray Dalio, Marc Benioff, Oprah Winfrey, Jerry Seinfeld, Steve Cohen and Bill Ackman.More from Amanda Gordon of Bloomberg:Jennifer Lopez sang \u201cJenny from the Block,\u201d an anthem about not forgetting one\u2019s humble origins, after taking off a plush white coat, and [Paul Tudor] Jones, in his Robin Hood get-up, crooned \u201cHe Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother,\u201d by the Hollies.

{"Headline": "The Female Couples Remaking the Restaurant Industry", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFood MattersOn a cold February morning, Erika Nakamura, 37, studious in gold wire-rim glasses, quietly shaved panels of beef with a blade curved like a scimitar. Standing close, hair tucked under a backward baseball cap, Jocelyn Guest, 34, alternated between a hook and a short skinny knife, frenching a cavernous rack of lamb to expose the bones and make it \u201cprettier,\u201d she said.In 2016, the two women opened White Gold Butchers, a meat shop and restaurant on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. They joined an increasing cohort of American women at the helm of their own establishments. And they became part of a vanguard of female couples who are changing the notion of a mom-and-pop. Their emergence comes at a critical moment: In the past seven months, a number of male chefs and restaurateurs have been accused by former employees of making unwanted advances and fostering work environments in which men felt at liberty to grope women on staff. (Among them was Ken Friedman, whose restaurant group includes White Gold; no allegations of misconduct have been made there, and he declined to comment for this piece.)These stories are part of a larger pattern of brutality built into the bones of professional kitchens, many of which follow some form of the brigade de cuisine \u2014 essentially a caste system that was devised by the 19th-century French chef Auguste Escoffier, an army veteran, to mirror the military\u2019s unyielding chain of command. In the classic hierarchy, every member of the kitchen was assigned a rank and value, from apprentice to commis to the chefs de partie, and held accountable for individual components of a dish, each owing unquestioning fealty to tiers of superiors, rising upward to the chef. How else could the back of the house survive the inferno of a Saturday night, with all the burners on full blast, the printer rat-a-tatting tickets and half the proteins 86\u2019ed? In battle, souls are forged. Never mind that, along the way, a cook might get branded by a white-hot spoon pressed into the flesh. For much of the brigade\u2019s existence, its members have been almost exclusively male. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the system is intrinsically patriarchal. Men claim no monopoly on abuses of power in the kitchen \u2014 several high-profile female chefs have been named in lawsuits \u2014 although men are more likely than women to be given the power to abuse. And the presence of women at the top has not always protected restaurant workers from harassment, as was the case at New York\u2019s gastropub the Spotted Pig, where chef April Bloomfield has since apologized for not knowing the extent of co-owner Friedman\u2019s behavior.But it\u2019s worth asking whether there\u2019s a difference in restaurants run entirely by women \u2014 particularly ones run by female couples linked in life as in work, who consciously model collaboration from the top down. Might they suggest a better way? Preeti Mistry, 41, was determined to banish the ghosts of kitchens past when she opened the Indian pizzeria Navi Kitchen in the Bay Area in 2017 with her wife, Ann Nadeau, 43. No longer would a cook need to stow a paring knife in her back pocket \u2014 as Mistry did early in her career \u2014 to whip out if a guy on the line tried to cop a feel. There would be no hazing in the walk-in, no obscene tirades, no employees going home to cry their eyes out. Above all, no one would rule by fear, perhaps the most radical break from the brigade. \u201cWhen a 6-foot-2 white guy is red in the face, screaming expletives,\u201d Mistry says, \u201csomeone else might see their football coach or their dad\u201d \u2014 that is, an exemplar of tough love. Instead, as a small-statured, queer woman of color, she felt threatened. Mentors were few for these lesbian chefs as they came up the ranks; it seemed that a male chef was more likely to give opportunities to a male cook in whom he saw a younger version of himself. Some of the women felt pressure to act \u201cbutch\u201d in order to fit in. \u201cIt evened the playing field,\u201d says Elise Kornack, 31, who until last year ran the tasting menu restaurant Take Root in Brooklyn with her wife, Anna Hieronimus, 31. For Deborah VanTrece, 58, who owns Twisted Soul Cookhouse & Pours in Atlanta with her wife, Lorraine Lane, 50, the situation is now reversed, with few men applying for jobs in her kitchen: \u201cThey tell me, the idea of working under a lady chef \u2014 they just can\u2019t get with it.\u201d At the modern Japanese restaurant n/naka in Los Angeles, where Niki Nakayama, 43, cooks alongside her wife and sous-chef, Carole Iida-Nakayama, 40, the men who are hired tend to have sisters (so they\u2019re accustomed to following women\u2019s orders).Now mentors themselves, these women are mindful of nourishing their employees\u2019 careers. \u201cWe\u2019re just a steppingstone,\u201d says Jody Williams, who opened the Mediterranean-inflected Via Carota in Manhattan\u2019s West Village in 2014 with her partner and fellow chef Rita Sodi, both in their early 50s. Nakayama seeks to preserve a meditative atmosphere at her restaurant, in which cooks have a chance to \u201clearn and be bored, and have that boredom turn into mastery\u201d \u2014 essential for a kaiseki meal that unfolds in delicate stanzas and infinitesimal details including beads of ponzu gel set with the precision of a chemist\u2019s pipette.When straight couples run restaurants, often it\u2019s the man who takes the mantle of chef while the woman welcomes guests in the front of house or focuses on pastry. This reflects an industry-wide ratio: Only a fifth of chefs and head cooks in the U.S. are women, according to 2017 Bureau of Labor statistics. The dynamic for gay women collaborating at the top is different, as all roles are open, including those usually ascribed to men. Yet one difficulty of dual leadership is sorting out who\u2019s actually in charge. At Twisted Soul, Lane, who composes a cocktail list to match the Southern cuisine, acknowledges the hierarchy with a laugh: \u201cHere comes the chef, she\u2019s the talent\u201d \u2014 meaning VanTrece. One partner might handle equipment and inventory, the other payroll and finances. Still, employees can be confused when taught opposing techniques \u2014 for making porchetta at White Gold, say, or shaving Parmesan at Via Carota. Sodi once arrived at work to find a dish slightly altered from her instructions. \u201cI said, \u2018Jody?\u2019 and the cook said yes,\u201d she recalled. A call home was placed, a compromise reached.Sodi and Williams are both stubborn enough that they \u201ctry not to be together in the kitchen,\u201d Sodi says wryly. Fortunately, each owns her own restaurant (Williams oversees the French bistro Buvette; Sodi runs the Tuscan restaurant I Sodi) in addition to Via Carota, where they schedule themselves on alternating shifts. Still, in emergencies they sublimate their egos and jump on the line to help each other. \u201cWe have differences of opinion,\u201d Williams says. \u201cBut we can finish each other\u2019s plates, sentences, thoughts.\u201d Before they opened Via Carota, they rarely saw each other \u2014 a common complaint for couples in the restaurant industry. By choosing to work together, these women have found a way to give priority to their family life without curtailing their ambitions.\u201cThere was once in the western parts of Libya ... a race which was ruled by women and followed a manner of life unlike that which prevails among us,\u201d wrote the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus in the first century B.C. He was speaking of that tribe of women warriors, the Amazons, who according to myth founded a dominion that required no input from men, beyond some brief assistance in propagating the species and raising children. The story has always sounded improbable: How could women, whether in the savage ancient world or today\u2019s slightly more civilized one, ever hold all the positions of power and make all the rules? What would those rules be?The women who run these restaurants are figuring it out. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a different kind of environment that doesn\u2019t exist outside our four walls,\u201d Nadeau says. None of these places are utopias, and unlearning behavior is an ongoing struggle. \u201cYou wake one day and realize, I really yelled at that kid and I don\u2019t know why,\u201d Nakamura says. At Twisted Soul, \u201cit isn\u2019t all sugar-coated,\u201d VanTrece says. But there\u2019s a give-and-take that she thinks might not happen in a predominantly male kitchen: \u201cIf you cry on the line, I\u2019m O.K. with it.\u201dEliminating hierarchy entirely is difficult and perhaps not even desirable, but productive change begins with the premise that the staff is an ensemble in which \u201cnobody is dispensable,\u201d Williams says; as she sees it, even her dishwashers are training to one day become chefs. Nakamura and Guest, who left White Gold in March and moved north of the city, made a point of hiring a group of peers whom they considered equals in skill. The shop was an intimate setting \u2014 anybody walking in the tight space behind the butchers had to warn them first or risk getting accidentally stabbed \u2014 and Guest hoped the quality of their work always reflected genuine camaraderie: \u201cDon\u2019t do anything because I said so but because we\u2019re a family.\u201d It\u2019s a spirit that spilled over to their customers, who brought them canned p\u00e2t\u00e9s from trips abroad and hand-knit mittens at Christmas. It once was enough for a restaurant to simply serve great food; no one had to think about the anonymous, invisible serfs who made it. In Mistry\u2019s first years as a cook, she toiled in a basement assembling canap\u00e9s for models and movie stars: \u201cThey don\u2019t know you exist, and if they did, they wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d But now diners do care. Some question whether they should patronize establishments reputed to have enabled sexual harassment. Others are choosing to support a different kind of restaurant \u2014 one where chefs make a safe working environment not a goal but a baseline; where employees, regardless of gender, orientation or ethnicity, can thrive. As historian Adrienne Mayor wrote in her 2014 study \u201cThe Amazons,\u201d looking back on the society in which women ruled, \u201cThe surprise answer to the question of who will be dominated and tamed is no one.\u201dNakamura recalled an afternoon last fall when a father brought his young daughter into White Gold. Beaming, he waved a hand at the butchers behind the counter. \u201cLook!\u201d he said. But what did he want his child to see? Two women, smiling, holding knives. Two women with power, who know how to use it. Photographer\u2019s assistant: Timothy Mulcare. Set design assistant: Taryn FujitaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobless Rate Looks Like Old Times, but the Economy Doesn\u2019t", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe last time the unemployment rate fell below the 4 percent threshold was in 2000, during a period of frenetic activity remembered as the dot-com boom.Nine years into a sustained, if less feverish, economic recovery, that milestone has been achieved again.The Labor Department said Friday that the jobless rate in April fell to 3.9 percent, raising anew the question of just how tight the labor market can get, and for how long.In the past half-century, only the late 1960s brought an extended period when the rate stayed below 4 percent.\u201cWe\u2019ve continued to add jobs routinely every month for so long, and the unemployment rate we have reached is amazing,\u201d said Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job site ZipRecruiter.President Trump crowed about the landmark on Friday, tweeting, \u201c4% is Broken!\u201dThe steady-as-she-goes economy has produced a record 91 straight months of job growth. That may represent a healthier foundation than the dot-com era, when pride \u2014 or, as it was branded, \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d \u2014 went before a fall.But the banner number announced Friday did not resolve any of the broader questions that economists have about this unparalleled run.The most prominent is a mystery that has proved impervious to easy explanation: why wage increases haven\u2019t been more robust, when the market continues to edge toward full employment.Friday\u2019s report showed that hourly earnings went up by 2.6 percent over the past year, not much faster than inflation. The subdued wage gains eased the prospect that the Federal Reserve would accelerate its plans to raise interest rates, helping to send stocks higher. But lagging pay also reflects how the economy of 2018 is fundamentally different from earlier eras.\u201cA 3.9 percent rate today doesn\u2019t suggest as tight a labor market as 3.9 percent in 2000 or 3.9 percent in the late 1960s,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief United States economist.A lot has changed since the turn of the century. The share of working-age women in the labor force began to fall in 2000, after increasing for decades. Men have been dropping out for much longer. The upshot is that a smaller share of people are participating in the labor market, and it\u2019s easier to get low levels of unemployment when fewer people are vying for jobs.In fact, a shrinking labor force in April is part of why the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent even as payrolls grew by a fairly routine 164,000 jobs.The population is also older than they used to be, on balance. The baby-boom generation has moved steadily toward retirement over the last two decades. And those still working have not helped push wages up. Generally, workers climb the economic ladder fastest when they are young, and so an older work force may weigh on average wages, economists say.In 2000, wages for rank-and-file workers rose at an annual rate of around 4 percent. Part of the problem now is that some 60 percent of the jobs added since 2010 have been in low-wage, service-sector jobs, according to Morgan Stanley.Fifty years ago, there were plenty of factory jobs paying a decent wage, and unions held much greater sway. Manufacturing accounted for one in four jobs; today it\u2019s not even one in 10.The tech explosion of the late 1990s gave rise to lucrative roles in companies based on new business models. The share of the economic pie going to workers rose steadily for the first time since the 1970s \u2014 a feat not repeated since.Average hourly earnings were 2.9 percent higher in January than a year earlier, a hopeful sign that wages might be gaining traction in a tight labor market. Their stubborn failure to do so is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year.\u201cNo one is creating an e-commerce group out of nothing anymore,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing firm. Instead, companies are bulking up their warehouses to compete with Amazon, slotting in tens of thousands of relatively low-paid pickers, packers and stockers over the past several years.Mr. Gimbel said he had seen a particular hunger for new bodies in call centers, which offer candidates the minimum wage to deal with consumers\u2019 complaints about the gadgets they ordered online.More recently, Mr. Trump\u2019s flirtation with a trade war has thrust uncertainty into the economic picture. The White House has provided little clarity about whether its newly imposed steel and aluminum tariffs will extend to allies like Mexico, Canada and the European Union, and it seems no closer to smoothing over economic tensions with China.Uncertainty over the price of raw materials could prompt factories to cut back from their recent hiring spree. Manufacturers added 73,000 jobs in the first quarter, much more than in the same period last year.\u201cA faster pace of wage growth would be great for households, but in a way that would create even more difficulty for policymakers,\u201d Ms. Zentner said. An acceleration could force Fed officials to raise rates more aggressively, which would raise the cost of car loans and credit card debt.However mixed the blessing, Ms. Zentner said, the ever-tightening job market could soon force faster growth in paychecks. \u201cWe are getting closer and closer to that flash point, but we don\u2019t know exactly when it is going to happen,\u201d she said.A wave of bigger raises has already reached Chandler Steffy\u2019s roofing company in Clive, Iowa.Three years ago, Mr. Steffy could pay laborers less than $15 an hour. No longer. In March, the latest month measured at the state level, the jobless rate in Iowa was 2.8 percent, one of the nation\u2019s lowest. Mr. Steffy now pays roofers $25 an hour, including benefits.His rate for subcontractors has been spiking. It went up 7 percent in March, and will rise another 7 percent in May. There will be bumps in June and August, too. It\u2019s all Mr. Steffy can do to keep himself in the game.\u201cThere\u2019s a price war going on for labor,\u201d he said. He has had crews leave job sites before finishing a roof because they got a better offer from another contractor. \u201cThe next 18 months are going to be crazy,\u201d he said.Ben Casselman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three New Books Illuminate the Rise of Violent White Extremism", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistBefore Dylann Roof murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, before Heather Heyer was killed in Charlottesville while protesting the torch-wielding \u201calt-right\u201d \u2014 before, in short, everyone suddenly felt an urgent need to understand violent white racism \u2014 a Norwegian journalist named Vegas Tenold was watching neo-Nazi street fights, attending a Klan wedding and learning the best way to burn a cross (first wrap it in old clothes, then finish with a ribbon of burlap to create a flaming spiral effect).Tenold\u2019s focus is not on the Richard Spencers of the world. He hangs out with the \u201cboots,\u201d not the \u201csuits\u201d segment of the movement, presenting a Mountain Dew and menthol-fueled loserfest of fizzled marches, cruddy hotel banquets and logically challenged monologues, all recounted with a dutiful dose of disapproval. At a National Socialist weekend, an Oklahoma man who identifies himself as a sergeant in the group\u2019s SS says his son has been expelled from school for wearing a \u201cWhite Power\u201d T-shirt. \u201cThere are no rights left for whites in this country,\u201d the man complains.One of the main characters, Matthew Heimbach, an Amazon warehouse employee and devoted organizer of the extreme right, tries throughout the book to usher in a new, less overtly hateful era. At one rally, he cajoles Klansmen to ditch their white robes, arguing that they\u2019ll be better able to fight without them.Through Heimbach\u2019s attempts to unite disparate white groups under one umbrella \u2014 which finally succeed in Charlottesville \u2014 we get a vivid tour of the most explicit and least devious forms of American extremism, with each sub-ideology curdling in its own sour shell.While the book provides plenty of color, it lacks much insight. There is no narrative arc to lift long historical passages out of the bog of copious facts. In one of his rare moments of reflection, Tenold seems to discount the importance of his own subject, writing that the far right is \u201cdestined to fail,\u201d because, he argues, America doesn\u2019t need organized racism: It\u2019s racist enough without it.The music came from a mail-order service called Romantic Violence. It was for \u201cwhite people with guts.\u201d Picciolini, then a punk rock kid in Chicago struggling against the assimilationist dreams of his immigrant Italian parents, was hooked.He soon learned that skinhead trappings \u2014 Doc Martens, the skinny suspenders known as braces, Nazi insignias \u2014 made people automatically fear him, and he got hooked on that, too. Picciolini became an enterprising disciple. He shoplifted, and read, a copy of the only book he could find on skinheads. He diligently photocopied and disseminated racist literature. When his mentor went to prison, Picciolini was ready to step in, ultimately fronting Final Solution, one of the first American neo-Nazi bands to play in Europe.He got expelled from school multiple times, once after beating a black kid who refused to move and hurling racial epithets at the principal. He presided over street fights and began to stockpile weapons for the race war he believed was looming.He also grew up: He got married, had two sons and opened a record store that sold some white supremacist music, but also attracted anti-racist and nonwhite customers who turned out to be real human beings. A friend, a fellow band frontman and father, was killed in a fight. Picciolini began to realize that the movement was no longer for him.But in the end, there is something unsatisfying about this redemption checklist. In Christian Picciolini\u2019s story, the only character is Christian Picciolini. We don\u2019t hear from anyone he hurt \u2014 other than a chance encounter with the former security guard at his high school, to whom he apologizes, he does not seek any of them out. By this time his wife has left him, and though Picciolini worries about what his new girlfriend, who \u201csaw beyond my mistakes to the man I had become,\u201d will have to say about his old tattoos, we don\u2019t actually find out. When a tragedy befalls his family, Picciolini goes so far as to wonder if it isn\u2019t divine payback for his own mistakes.There is a vintage piece of neo-Nazi propaganda that is a racist take on an old Charles Atlas ad. After the whiny young protagonist bulks up and punches out a black man who bullied him, beachgoers in bikinis coo and pat his biceps. The cartoon makes Kimmel\u2019s point perfectly: Extremism is fueled by wounded masculinity.In Kimmel\u2019s astute and, yes, empathetic analysis, he argues that without understanding the gendered aspect of extremism (he looks mostly at white supremacist groups, but also jihadists), we will not be able to defuse it. The young men in this book are enticed not by ideology, but by the powerful draw of camaraderie, belonging and a moral code, not to mention access to women and sex (even if, in the case of jihadis, it\u2019s in the afterlife). Having suffered trauma, abuse, the need to keep homosexuality closeted, loneliness, economic insult or more mundane indignities, they turn to violence to ward off shame, coming to the table with what Kimmel, a sociologist who has spent his career focused on masculinity, calls \u201caggrieved entitlement.\u201d The racist framework that comes to explain their woes usually arrives later.Kimmel looks at recovering extremists in four countries \u2014 Germany, Sweden, the United States and Britain \u2014 and the organizations that help them escape when they become disillusioned. Those groups \u2014 EXIT in Germany and Sweden, Life After Hate in America and Quilliam, which works with British jihadis \u2014 offer not just safety, as many \u201cformers\u201d face violence when they try to leave, but also counseling, job training and the rudiments of an alternative form of manhood. (Life After Hate was given a $400,000 grant by the Obama administration, but it was later rescinded by Trump.)Kimmel makes it clear that any approach to recovery lacking in empathy will fail. These men, he argues, have in fact lost something \u2014 they have been passed by and overlooked. But, Kimmel writes, they have been delivering their hate mail to the wrong address.Shaila Dewan is the national criminal justice editor for The Times.Advertisement"}

Inviting him to pay a late-night visit to her SoHo loft, Marcy is the first of the strange, increasingly menacing women with whom Paul will become entangled. The others are Marcy\u2019s roommate (Linda Fiorentino), a sculptor; a waitress and Monkees fan (Teri Garr); the driver of a Mister Softee truck (Catherine O\u2019Hara); and another artist (Verna Bloom).

{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Profit Slips as It Spends to Expand Its Empire", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHENZHEN, China \u2014 Alibaba, the online shopping giant, is increasingly going offline. That is making some investors nervous.The Chinese company on Friday reported a fall in profit of nearly 30 percent in the latest quarter, the first such decline in a year and a half. One reason: Alibaba got a bump in profit last year from selling its shares in a social media app. Another culprit, however, was heavy spending on Alibaba\u2019s businesses outside of e-commerce, including cloud computing and brick-and-mortar retail \u2014 which the company, counterintuitively, likes to call \u201cnew retail.\u201dThey remain well above their level a year ago, however, thanks to strength in Alibaba\u2019s core online business. In the first three months of the year, total revenue increased by more than 60 percent over the same period last year, the company said Friday. It added that it expects a similar pace of sales growth for the coming financial year.Modest minimarts these are not. A typical store might feature tanks of live lobsters and crabs, a bar with beer on tap and a grill where steaks are cooked to order. Bags of groceries zip on conveyors above shoppers\u2019 heads on their way to being delivered to nearby homes.All of these could someday help turn Alibaba into the vast digital enabler of on- and offline commerce that it wishes to be. But for now, they are new and unfamiliar activities for a company that prides itself on not owning much in the way of merchandise, warehouses, delivery trucks or other physical assets.It does not help that the company\u2019s archrival in China, the internet conglomerate Tencent, is also storming into many of these same businesses, including traditional retail.\u201cI like Hema,\u201d said Tian X. Hou, founder of T.H. Data Capital, a research firm in Beijing. \u201cBut Alibaba management is going to have to do a lot of thinking, and go through a lot of trial and error.\u201dDespite investors\u2019 worries, Ms. Hou said, Alibaba executives are at least sounding more resolute about their commitment to this new, offline future for the company.\u201cThey are fully communicating with the Street: \u2018We\u2019re doing it. And we actually do not care what you think, because we think it\u2019s great, and it is the way to reach offline customers. It\u2019s the way to sell in product categories that are not sold online.

{"Headline": "The Next Privacy Battle in Europe Is Over This New Law", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new European data privacy legislation is so stringent that it could kill off data-driven online services and chill innovations like driverless cars, tech industry groups warn.If the current draft prevails, the law will require Skype, WhatsApp, iMessage, video games with player messaging and other electronic services that allow private interactions to obtain people\u2019s explicit permission before placing tracking codes on users' devices or collecting data about their communications.Industry and consumer advocates are essentially fighting over a contentious issue central to the post-Cambridge Analytica online economy: whether data-driven digital services represent more of a boon to consumers or the kind of surveillance that can threaten democracy.The ePrivacy Regulation will replace and broaden an older European Union directive \u2014 which covered traditional telecommunications like voice calls \u2014 by also covering digital communications like text messaging and video chat apps.The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users\u2019 electronic communications: obtaining consumers\u2019 explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.\u201cDo you really want that app to use your metadata? Do you really want them to read your content on a dating app?\u201d Ms. Sippel asked. \u201cConsumers need to get back control over what is happening with their lives and their data.\u201dBut tech industry groups and their supporters argue that ePrivacy\u2019s consent requirement and other provisions are so onerous that they would hinder innovations like smart cars, which automatically transmit safety information back to the manufacturer. And requiring companies to provide equal communications services to people who opt out of data mining, they say, could cause sites or apps that rely on data-driven advertising to start charging fees or close down.\u201cEvery stakeholder I have talked to from industry, from all sizes from the very biggest to the very smallest businesses, are unanimously opposed to this,\u201d he said.Tech companies and trade groups have waged a furious, multipronged lobbying campaign to shut down, or at least weaken, the legislation.Cisco, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, the American Chamber of Commerce, DigitalEurope and the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe, a digital advertising industry group, have all lobbied officials at the European Commission about ePrivacy, according to a lobbying database created by Transparency International EU, a nonprofit research group in Brussels.How much they are spending on the effort is unclear. While companies and trade groups that lobby European Commission officials must provide financial details on annual lobbying expenditures, they do not have to break out the spending by issue.Industry associations have also lobbied the Council of the European Union, whose leadership rotates every six months. For the ePrivacy law to be enacted, the Council must first come to its own consensus on the bill before negotiating the law\u2019s final language in a three-way discussion with the European Parliament and the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm.Elitsa Zlateva, a spokeswoman for the permanent representation of Bulgaria to the European Union, said her country\u2019s officials were committed to the bill\u2019s progress. She declined to provide names of other trade groups that the country\u2019s representatives had met with on ePrivacy.The \u201cBulgarian presidency acts as an honest broker,\u201d she wrote in an email, and works to balance the interests of European member states, citizens and business.Christian Borggreen, vice president for the computer industry group in Europe, said he hoped that the ePrivacy Regulation would not conflict with the G.D.P.R. and that it would \u201cadd meaningful privacy protection without unduly hurting digital innovation.\u201dMichela Palladino, director of European policy and government relations at the Developers Alliance, said of the ePrivacy bill\u2019s restrictions on handling user content and metadata: \u201cThat is something that is too extreme and will really cut potential business opportunities\u201d for many industries that rely on data.Ms. Sippel said hewing to industry opinions was impeding progress on the ePrivacy effort.\u201cIn my view, we have some weak governments on the Council that are not willing to get into trouble with industry,\u201d she said, emphasizing that she was expressing her opinion and not stating an official parliamentary position. \u201cSo, for the time being, they haven\u2019t found a common position.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The causes crying out for civic-minded vision are legion. Blasting adventure tourists into space is not one of them.PHILIP WARBURG, NEWTON, MASS.The writer is a nonresident senior fellow at Boston University\u2019s Institute for Sustainable Energy.To the Editor:Harold Pollack argues that by allocating his vast fortune to space, Jeff Bezos is squandering an opportunity to serve humanity. As Professor Pollack illustrates, there are many areas of dire human need that desperately require resources. Yet, arguably, Mr. Bezos\u2019s space endeavors are likely to contribute to the area of greatest human impact: the preservation of the species itself.Even in the unlikely scenario that the most comprehensive efforts possible are undertaken from here on out, there is a strong likelihood that terrestrial life on Earth is already doomed to extinction at some point in the future. Therefore we as a species should be very grateful to Mr. Bezos for prioritizing the humanization of space, and in the process ensuring the preservation of the human species.LOUIS BRENNAN, DUBLINThe writer is co-author of the forthcoming book \u201cAbove and Beyond: Exploring the Business of Space.\u201dTo the Editor:Prof. Harold Pollack has suggestions for how Jeff Bezos can spend his vast fortune, other than on space travel. Mr. Bezos\u2019s primary responsibility, however, is to improve pay and conditions for the workers who are making him so rich. In Arizona, an estimated one of three Amazon employees qualifies for food stamps; in Pennsylvania and Ohio, the figure is one of 10.Instead of \u201cconverting my Amazon winnings into space travel,\u201d Mr. Bezos needs to pay much more attention to what is happening here on Earth.The writers are co-executive directors of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Truckers\u2019 Strike Paralyzes Brazil as President Courts Investors", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Brazil is roaring back, at least according to President Michel Temer.That was the message Mr. Temer\u2019s government sought to convey in a series of upbeat statements issued over the past couple of weeks leading up to a foreign investment forum that begins Tuesday in S\u00e3o Paulo.Yet a weeklong standoff between striking truck drivers and the government has provided a stark counternarrative, illustrating the shaky recovery of Brazil\u2019s economy, Latin America\u2019s largest, and the widespread disdain Brazilians have toward their ruling class.Hundreds of trucker roadblocks sealed off highways across the country as a protest against rising fuel prices ground Brazil\u2019s economy to a halt in recent days. Gas stations from S\u00e3o Paulo, the financial capital, to Manaus, in the heart of the Amazon, have run out of fuel.Dozens of flights have been canceled, fresh food supplies in supermarkets have dwindled and millions of chickens and pigs have been culled because of a lack of animal feed. On Monday, many schools and universities suspended classes.An announcement by Mr. Temer on Thursday that he had struck a deal with the strike leaders proved premature. Roadblocks were maintained through the weekend and oil workers announced that they intended to go on strike this week, raising the prospect of a deepening crisis that has laid bare the weakness of Mr. Temer\u2019s lame-duck government ahead of a presidential election in October.Over the weekend, Mr. Temer issued an order authorizing the military to clear roads using force, if necessary, a move that drew condemnation from human rights groups.But after that threat failed to bring the strike to an end, Mr. Temer appeared weary as he announced in a televised statement on Sunday that the government would subsidize the cost of diesel to drop the price at the pump by 12 percent. He also said truck drivers would pay less in tolls and get more government contracts. The measures were striking concessions by a government that has sought to rein in spending as Brazil emerges from a long, crippling recession.\u201cOur fundamental and correct concern is with the truckers and I understand their difficulties,\u201d said Mr. Temer, the most unpopular president in modern Brazilian history, according to polls. \u201cWe all understand the natural difficulties of truckers in their work.\u201dFuel costs have soared in Brazil as oil prices have risen globally, and the real, Brazil\u2019s currency, has depreciated. Under the current policy, the price of diesel fuel has fluctuated on an almost daily basis. As part of the latest agreement, diesel price adjustments will occur on a monthly basis.Union leaders have urged drivers to accept the latest deal. But on Monday, as fuel tankers escorted by police officers and soldiers began to restock some gas stations, many protesters held firm.\u201cThe government has now met all of the demands in relation to diesel prices, and at a very high cost to public coffers,\u201d said Laura Barbosa de Carvalho, a professor of economics at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, who pointed out that taxpayers would ultimately pick up the tab. \u201cBut the big question is: Is this movement still focused on the price of diesel or does it have a bigger component that wants to destabilize the country?\u201dMr. Temer\u2019s speech on Sunday night prompted Brazilians frustrated by what they see as a failed government to honk their horns and bang pots from their windows in protest in many cities across the country. It was a sign of the mistrust and outright hostility many Brazilians feel toward the president.A poll published by the Globo website on Monday showed that 55 percent of Brazilians disapproved of the strike, but a full 95 percent disapproved of the way Mr. Temer has handled it.The strike has been the most disruptive period of unrest since Mr. Temer helped lead an effort to impeach his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, in 2016. Since then, Mr. Temer has spent much of his political capital fending off accusations of corruption and obstruction of justice stemming from the wide-ranging graft scandal known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash.On Monday morning, roughly one hundred protesters gathered at an oil refinery on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, which has been one of the focal points of the strike. Truckers were a minority at the demonstration. But scores of unemployed oil workers, motorcycle couriers and public transportation workers said they wanted their grievances addressed as well.\u201cThis started with the truckers, but it reached millions,\u201d said Alexsandro Faria, 39, an unemployed scaffold builder who worked at the refinery for seven years before being laid off in 2016. \u201cThis is the best moment to call attention to our demands. If we only stay on our sofas, complaining about corruption, it won\u2019t work.\u201dSeveral strikers have voiced support for a military intervention, arguing that the country was safer and more orderly during the dictatorship that lasted from 1964 to 1985. While support for a step that drastic is by no means widespread among strikers, calls for the military to step in have riled up crowds at protest sites over the past week.\u201cIt isn\u2019t just about the truckers anymore,\u201d said Antonio Marcos Rocha, a proponent of a military intervention who was wearing a Brazilian flag around his waist as he distributed free sandwiches to a crowd outside the refinery. \u201cIt\u2019s against corruption.\u201dAs the protests have struck a chord with many Brazilians, politicians across the political spectrum have taken aim at the increasingly isolated and weakened president.Leftist leaders, who have traditionally championed workers\u2019 rights, and right-wing politicians both sought to portray themselves as champions of the truck drivers as the government threatened to prosecute business leaders who have backed the strike.\u201cOnce more, the Temer administration uses the military to hide its incompetence,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cWith the increase in fuel prices, society is paying prices that are too high for the mistakes of a government that does everything to save its own skin and keep itself in power.\u201dThe timing could hardly be worse for Mr. Temer as he sets out to promote Brazil\u2019s economic recovery before would-be foreign investors while defending the legacy of his two years in office.Mr. Temer was recently mocked for unveiling a slogan that suggested that Brazil had advanced 20 years in the span of two. Critics were quick to point out that a slight variation in punctuation made the slogan convey that Brazil had in fact regressed two decades in two years.But Mr. Temer sought to strike a bullish tone on Monday as investors arrived in S\u00e3o Paulo, where fuel trucks have needed police escorts to resupply airports.\u201cBrazil is opening to the world and the world is reconnecting with Brazil,\u201d he said in a statement prepared for the event. He noted that on his watch, inflation has dropped and interest rates have fallen to 6.5 percent from 14.25 percent, and investor confidence has begun to grow in his market-friendly policies.The economy has pulled out of recession, but the recovery has been tenuous. The value of the currency has slumped to a two-year low, in large part because of uncertainty over Brazil\u2019s political future. Voters have turned their backs on the traditional parties mired in the corruption investigation.Mr. Temer is set to leave office having failed to pass critical structural changes he pushed for, including an overhaul of the bloated pension system.While truck drivers weigh their options, oil workers unions have announced a three-day strike starting on Wednesday to demand, among other things, a reduction of fuel prices and the firing of Pedro Parente, the president of the state-run oil company, Petrobras.\u201cThe government has tried to sell this idea that it solved the country\u2019s economic problems,\u201d Ms. Carvalho, the economics professor, said. \u201cThis crisis is evidence that it was never true.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Seven percent reported spending more than $1,000.The findings, based on a nationally representative sample of tens of thousands of teachers, underscore the demands teachers across the country have been making in recent months amid protests over stagnant pay and underfunding.The protesters have been successful at extracting concessions from conservative lawmakers, though the deals have not always fully met their demands.Limited budgets and red tape have led some teachers to seek outside funds for classroom projects. Like Mr. Yung, some of them use DonorsChoose.org, a crowdfunding website where educators can solicit donations for supplies, trips, and other projects.The cost of the additional materials was less than the DonorsChoose.org $100 minimum and Mr. Yung had already reached a city reimbursement limit, so he spent his own money to buy two more books, an ant farm and caterpillars.\u201cI don\u2019t want to deprive my kids of this awesome experience of witnessing a caterpillar turn into a butterfly and watching ants burrow because it\u2019s such an interest that they have right now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I went on Amazon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Pushes Facial Recognition to Police. Critics See Surveillance Risk.", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot long after, it began pitching the technology to law enforcement agencies, saying the program could aid criminal investigations by recognizing suspects in photos and videos. It used a couple of early customers, like the Orlando Police Department in Florida and the Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Oregon, to encourage other officials to sign up.But now that aggressive push is putting the giant tech company at the center of an increasingly heated debate around the role of facial recognition in law enforcement. Fans of the technology see a powerful new tool for catching criminals, but detractors see an instrument of mass surveillance.On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union led a group of more than two dozen civil rights organizations that asked Amazon to stop selling its image recognition system, called Rekognition, to law enforcement. The group says that the police could use it to track protesters or others whom authorities deem suspicious, rather than limiting it to people committing crimes.Facial recognition is not new technology, but the organizations appear to be focusing on Amazon because of its prominence and what they see as a departure from the company\u2019s oft-stated focus on customers.With the letter, the A.C.L.U. released a collection of internal emails and other documents from law enforcement agencies in Washington County and Orlando that it obtained through open records requests. The correspondence between Amazon and law enforcement officials provides an unusual peek into the company\u2019s ambitions with facial recognition tools, and how it has interacted with some of the officials using its products.Many of the companies supplying the technology are security contractors little known to the public, but Amazon is one of the first major tech companies to actively market technology for conducting facial recognition to law enforcement. The efforts are still a tiny part of Amazon\u2019s business, with the service one of dozens it offers through Amazon Web Services. But few companies have Amazon\u2019s ability to effectively push widespread adoption of tech products.\u201cThe idea that a massive and highly resourced company like Amazon has moved decisively into this space could mark a sea change for this technology,\u201d said Alvaro Bedoya, executive director at the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center.The spokeswoman said that, as with all A.W.S. services, the company requires customers to comply with the law.\u201cWe have it being used in unaccountable ways and with no regulation,\u201d said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, a nonprofit civil rights organization that signed the A.C.L.U.\u2019s letter to Amazon.The documents the A.C.L.U. obtained from the Orlando Police Department show city officials considering using video analysis tools from Amazon with footage from surveillance cameras, body-worn cameras and drones.Amazon may have gone a little far in describing what the technology can do. This month, it published a video of an Amazon official, Ranju Das, speaking at a company event in Seoul, South Korea, in which he said Orlando could even use Amazon\u2019s Rekognition system to find the whereabouts of the mayor through cameras around the city.In a statement, a spokesman for the Orlando Police Department, Sgt. Eduardo Bernal, said the city was not using Amazon\u2019s technology to track the location of elected officials in its jurisdiction, nor did it have plans to. He said the department was testing Amazon\u2019s service now, but was not using it in investigations or public spaces.\u201cWe are always looking for new solutions to further our ability to keep the residents and visitors of Orlando safe,\u201d he said.Early last year, the company began courting the Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office outside of Portland, Ore., eager to promote how it was using Amazon\u2019s service for recognizing faces, emails obtained by the A.C.L.U. show. Chris Adzima, a systems analyst in the office, told Amazon officials that he fed about 300,000 images from the county\u2019s mug shot database into Amazon\u2019s system.Within a week of going live, the system was used to identify and arrest a suspect who stole more than $5,000 from local stores, he said, adding there were no leads before the system identified him. The technology was also cheap, costing just a few dollars a month after a setup fee of around $400.In February of last year, before the publicity wave, Mr. Adzima told an Amazon representative in an email that the county\u2019s lawyer was worried the public might believe \u201cthat we are constantly checking faces from everything, kind of a Big Brother vibe.\u201d\u201cThey are concerned that A.C.L.U. might consider this the government getting in bed with big data,\u201d Mr. Adzima said in an email. He did not respond to a request for comment for this article.Deputy Jeff Talbot, a spokesman for the Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said Amazon\u2019s facial recognition system was not being used for mass surveillance by the office. The company has a policy to use the technology only to identify a suspect in a criminal investigation, he said, and has no plans to use it with footage from body cameras or real-time surveillance systems.\u201cWe are aware of those privacy concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have a policy drafted and why we\u2019ve tried to educate the public about what we do and don\u2019t do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Tries a New Role: Moral Leader", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen there\u2019s Microsoft, a giant that spent most of the 1990s and early 2000s as tech\u2019s biggest company and villain. It now seems to be auditioning for a different role: the industry\u2019s moral conscience.Among the five most valuable tech companies, Microsoft is the only one to avoid sustained public criticism about contributing to social ills in the last couple of years. At the same time, Satya Nadella, its chief executive, and Brad Smith, its president, have emerged as some of the most outspoken advocates in the industry for protecting user privacy and establishing ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.Echoing a theme he talked about at the conference last year, Mr. Nadella said the industry had a responsibility to build technology that empowered everyone.\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d he said.Microsoft\u2019s new role is partly due to the fact that the company isn\u2019t a major player in social media, video streaming and smartphones \u2014 the products behind the current dark mood around tech. It no longer squeezes the oxygen out of markets as Amazon can.But while the company\u2019s power has diminished since a couple of decades ago, when it controlled computing through Windows, Microsoft remains an influential voice. On Monday, its market capitalization of $733 billion made it the third most valuable technology company, behind Apple and Amazon and ahead of Google parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook.\u201cThe irony for Microsoft is that they lost in search, they lost in social networks and they lost in mobile, and as a consequence, they have avoided the recent pushback from governments and media,\u201d said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cThis has given Microsoft the freedom to take the high road as the ethical leader in technology.\u201dSince taking the reins at Microsoft in 2014, Mr. Nadella has brought a more sensitive style of leadership to the company than his two predecessors, Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. That shift has proved to be more suitable for Microsoft in this era.In a phone interview, Mr. Smith, who is also Microsoft\u2019s chief legal officer, called its legal problems in past decades a \u201cgut-wrenching experience\u201d that had shaped Microsoft in its current form. \u201cIt made Microsoft a better and more responsible company,\u201d he said.\u201cNot only did Microsoft learn from its mistakes, Satya is a unique and caring individual,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Reilly, a tech industry publisher and conference organizer. \u201cHe understands deeply that Microsoft must help others to succeed.\u201dFacebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have defended their advertising businesses for allowing them to deliver services for free. They\u2019ve promised to add more human moderators and invest in software tools that can screen out misinformation and other prohibited content.Mr. Cook has not turned his ire toward Microsoft, which gets most of its revenue from software, hardware and cloud computing services. The company has investments in internet services that are supported in part by advertising, including its Bing search engine and LinkedIn, the social network for professionals it acquired in 2016.Mr. Nadella has been more hesitant than Mr. Cook to publicly criticize other technology companies, turning to more subtle types of persuasion. A low-key leader, Mr. Nadella peppers his speeches and interviews with references to literature, warning that careless creators of technology could contribute to a dystopian world of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d or Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World.\u201d His lieutenant, Mr. Smith, has become a ubiquitous ambassador for Microsoft on the big social issues facing technology in Washington, in Brussels and on the conference circuit.Still, the Microsoft of 2018 is a long way from the company that was once portrayed as a corporate predator.\u201cMicrosoft lived through negativity that these companies are experiencing now, and it doesn\u2019t want to go back to those days,\u201d said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Silicon Valley campus.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said the greater scrutiny on the tech sector would not always fall on the same companies.\u201cAt any given moment, there may be one or two companies in the spotlight,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think one should assume the same one or two are always going to be in the spotlight or always on the defensive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kelly and XXXTentacion From Playlists, Stirring a Debate", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile their music will remain available for streaming by choice, it will no longer appear in Spotify\u2019s influential curated packages, which often appear on the service\u2019s front page. \u201cWe don\u2019t censor content because of an artist\u2019s or creator\u2019s behavior, but we want our editorial decisions \u2014 what we choose to program \u2014 to reflect our values,\u201d Spotify said in a statement. \u201cWhen an artist or creator does something that is especially harmful or hateful, it may affect the ways we work with or support that artist or creator.\u201dOronike Odeleye, a founder of the #MuteRKelly campaign, said she was \u201cjust dumbfounded and awe-struck\u201d that Spotify had \u201cdecided to take this moral stance against R. Kelly\u2019s amoral behavior.\u201d She added, \u201cHopefully it\u2019s a domino effect with the other streaming services.\u201dIn a statement on Thursday, representatives for R. Kelly denounced what they called an \u201congoing smear campaign against him, waged by enemies seeking a payoff,\u201d and called Spotify\u2019s decision \u201cunfortunate and shortsighted.\u201d\u201cSpotify has the right to promote whatever music it chooses, and in this case its actions are without merit,\u201d R. Kelly\u2019s management team said. \u201cIt is acting based on false and unproven allegations. It is bowing to social-media fads and picking sides in a fame-seeking dispute over matters that have nothing to do with serving customers.\u201dUniversal Music, which oversees XXXTentacion\u2019s distributor, Caroline, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. R. Kelly\u2019s label, RCA Records, a division of Sony Music, did not immediately comment either.\u201cAs you can imagine this is a complicated process with room for debate and disagreement, so we can\u2019t get into an artist-by-artist discussion,\u201d a spokesman for Spotify said in response to follow-up questions. \u201cIn general we work with our partners and try to make decisions on a case-by-case basis.\u201dOfficial playlists can be a huge platform, especially for developing artists, on streaming services such as Spotify, which counts more than 70 million paying subscribers worldwide, and on competitors like Apple Music and Amazon Music. Streaming has become the dominant mode for music consumption in the United States \u2014 with hip-hop/R&B representing the most popular genre \u2014 and digital plays are directly correlated to royalty payouts from the services.While R. Kelly, who has not had a Top 40 hit in more than a decade, was unlikely to have appeared recently on a flagship Spotify playlist like Rap Caviar (9.5 million subscribers) or Today\u2019s Top Hits (nearly 20 million), a young artist like XXXTentacion may stand to lose more. His song \u201cSad!,\u201d which had been a popular playlist staple since its release in March, is currently No. 15 on Spotify\u2019s United States Top 50 chart.As of Thursday afternoon, the track still appeared on Apple Music\u2019s premiere rap playlist, \u201cThe A-List: Hip-Hop.\u201d Apple declined to comment on its editorial decisions.Observers on social media were quick to question where exactly Spotify was drawing the line on conduct. The singer Chris Brown, who was convicted in the 2009 felony assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna and is the subject of a restraining order by a subsequent ex-girlfriend, currently appears on Today\u2019s Top Hits as a featured artist on Lil Dicky\u2019s \u201cFreaky Friday.\u201d Other artists who have been accused (but not convicted in court) of violence against women, including Rich the Kid, Famous Dex and YoungBoy Never Broke Again, remained on influential playlists like Rap Caviar on Thursday.Terrence Henderson, the executive known as Punch from Top Dawg Entertainment, home to Kendrick Lamar and SZA, wrote on Twitter: \u201cWhoa. Are they censoring the music? That\u2019s dangerous.\u201dDon Gorder, the chairman of the music business and management department at Berklee College of Music, called Spotify\u2019s decision \u201ca big deal\u201d given the influence of its playlists, but warned that \u201cit is a slippery slope.\u201d\u201cThere are lots of bands in history that have been accused of bad behavior, but they\u2019re not taking the pummeling that R. Kelly is taking,\u201d he said in an interview, adding that while he found R. Kelly\u2019s reported behavior \u201cdeplorable,\u201d the singer had not been convicted in court. Spotify \u201ccreated this new moral standard \u2014 what is it? Where is the line?\u201dSpotify said the decision to no longer promote an artist would be made by an internal committee led by Jonathan Prince, Spotify\u2019s vice president of content and marketplace policy. The company said it had also partnered with advocacy groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center, Glaad and the Anti-Defamation League to help identify hateful content.In its announcement on Thursday, Spotify acknowledged that it was now entering thorny territory when it came to monitoring lyrics and artist behavior. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that cultural standards and sensitivities vary widely,\u201d the company said. \u201cThat means there will always be content that is acceptable in some circumstances, but is offensive in others, and we will always look at the entire context.\u201dAdvertisement"}
