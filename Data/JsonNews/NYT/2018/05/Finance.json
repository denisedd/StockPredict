{"Headline": "Venezuela Election Won by Maduro Amid Widespread Disillusionment", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElectoral officials declared Mr. Maduro the victor Sunday night, in a contest that critics said was heavily rigged in his favor.In the capital and around the country, the turnout was extremely low, with more than half of voters not casting ballots, reflecting both a call from many opposition leaders for a boycott of the vote and the disillusionment of longtime government supporters.Voting centers in pro-government strongholds and opposition areas alike often had no lines \u2014 a significant change from previous presidential elections, and a sign that many Venezuelans repudiated the candidacies of both Mr. Maduro and the two opposition candidates.Election officials said Mr. Maduro, the political heir of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the leftist firebrand who led this oil-rich country until his death in 2013, received 5.8 million votes, with more than 92 percent of voting centers reporting. That was nearly 68 percent of the votes cast.Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is using access to food and money as a weapon in Sunday\u2019s election.\u201cSo much they have underestimated the revolutionary people! So much they have underestimated me,\u201d Mr. Maduro said, addressing a cheering outdoor crowd in Caracas. \u201cAnd here we are again, victorious!\u201dHe scarcely mentioned the low turnout and said that the 68 percent of the vote he received was the highest percentage for a winner in a Venezuelan presidential election, calling it a knockout.Despite his triumph, there is little relief in sight for Mr. Maduro or Venezuela.The United States \u2014 which condemned the election as unfair and anti-democratic even before it happened \u2014 has threatened stricter sanctions. Also likely to increase pressure on Mr. Maduro\u2019s government even before his next term begins: He has largely been cut off from international financing, and the government-run oil industry, which provides virtually all of the country\u2019s hard currency, is in free fall, with plummeting production.Some may also point to the low turnout and vote totals and question Mr. Maduro\u2019s leadership. He received about 1.5 million fewer votes than when he was first elected in 2013. Mr. Maduro has shown no signs so far that he has the ability to solve the country\u2019s deep problems, and his response to the crisis has often been to crack down harder on adversaries \u2014 including the traditional opposition as well as rivals on his side of the political divide.The official turnout figure was given as 46 percent, compared to about 80 percent in the last two presidential elections.Mr. Falc\u00f3n accused Mr. Maduro\u2019s party of pressuring voters and said that he would not recognize the election results.\u201cWe don\u2019t recognize this electoral process as valid,\u201d Mr. Falc\u00f3n said, speaking at his campaign center before the official results were made public. \u201cFor us, there was no election. There must be a new election in Venezuela.\u201dMr. Falc\u00f3n had defied a broad call to boycott the election over expectations of just the sort of unfairness that he denounced after the polls closed.Mr. Maduro\u2019s victory was certain to set off a new round of infighting and finger pointing within the opposition. Some accused Mr. Falc\u00f3n of giving legitimacy to the president\u2019s re-election. Others asked if the opposition might have missed a chance to displace Mr. Maduro, given his falling popularity among his own supporters, many of whom failed to turn out.Venezuela, which is estimated to have the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, is in the throes of one of the worst economic crises in recent history in the Western Hemisphere. The International Monetary Fund estimates that inflation this year could reach 13,000 percent, by far the highest rate in the world.With soaring prices and shortages of basic goods of all kinds, many Venezuelans are malnourished. It is common to find families who eat just twice a day, and with little protein, fresh fruit or vegetables in those meals. Two pounds of chicken or beef costs as much as the monthly minimum wage package, which, including food coupons, is worth about $2.50.That is hardly a recipe for a president to win re-election, but Mr. Maduro sought to give himself every advantage in Sunday\u2019s vote.Electoral authorities also moved up the election to May, although it is traditionally held in December, allowing little time for the opposition to organize and campaign. They even eliminated the requirement that voters dip a finger in indelible ink, which is used to keep people from voting more than once.In response, many opposition leaders called for an election boycott.Mr. Falc\u00f3n ultimately decided to break with the rest of the opposition and run against Mr. Maduro.Mr. Maduro attributes the country\u2019s problems to what he calls an economic war waged against Venezuela by the United States. But most economists place the blame on poor government management, corruption and broken policies, like tight controls over foreign exchange, an overvalued currency and price controls on goods.The government has responded to the crisis by providing people with boxes of food, including powdered milk and pasta, although most people say they arrive irregularly and do not contain nearly enough to sustain a household. The food boxes became both an incentive and a threat during the campaign, with many voters fearful that they could be cut off if they didn\u2019t support the government.At many polling places on Sunday, people cast their vote and then visited a so-called Red Spot \u2014 named for the ruling Socialist Party\u2019s color \u2014 set up nearby.At the Red Spot, voters presented the special identity card used to receive the food boxes and other services and gave their names to workers who were keeping lists of those who had voted. Workers at the Red Spots said that there was no effort to pressure voters or link a pro-Maduro vote to future food deliveries.Mr. Falc\u00f3n accused the government of violating campaign rules through the use of these Red Spots.A woman waiting outside a polling station in a Caracas slum, La Vega, said she worked for a government agency and feared losing her job if she did not vote and report afterward at the Red Spot. The woman, who would not give her name out of fear of reprisals, also said that she felt compelled to vote for Mr. Maduro, even though she did not support him, because she was sure that government computers tracked people\u2019s votes \u2014 a common notion here.One of the most striking aspects of the day was the large number of voters who appeared to have stayed away.\u201cI\u2019m surprised by the low turnout,\u201d said Loreima Henr\u00edquez, a National Electoral Council employee, who was overseeing a polling place in Dos Caminos, a middle-class area of Caracas. There were about 4,200 voters registered to cast ballots there, but by 1 p.m. only 313 had done so.\u201cWe were aware of the calls to abstain from voting, but many fewer people than we expected are coming out,\u201d Ms. Henr\u00edquez said.Rosa Rodr\u00edguez, 50, a former Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro supporter, said that this time she voted for Mr. Falc\u00f3n and volunteered to work as a poll watcher.\u201cPeople are not voting on both sides and I think this is a silent message that they\u2019re giving the country today,\u201d said Ms. Rodriguez, who lives in a working-class area in the center of Caracas. \u201cThey have to realize that the people are protesting in silence. For me that says it all.\u201dIn a slum abutting the main airport outside Caracas, Marielis Idimas, a mother of two, said she had voted for Mr. Maduro despite the economic hardships \u2014 but she showed more resignation than enthusiasm.\u201cMy life is not good,\u201d she said, sitting at a small stand where she sold eggs for 60,000 bol\u00edvars each (the currency\u2019s devaluation makes that only about 6 cents although it is a vast sum for poor Venezuelans). \u201cBut who lives comfortably now?\u201dAnother slum resident, Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda, 63, said that she had not voted because doing so would have been supporting a sham.\u201cI\u2019m not going to be part of this,\u201d Ms. Garc\u00eda said. \u201cI hate everything about this government and I don\u2019t want anything to do with them.\u201dPatricia Torres and Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Says It Will Buy Back $100 Billion in Stock", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple said it would buy back an additional $100 billion in stock, by far the largest increase in its already historic record of returning capital to investors. The company didn\u2019t provide a timeline for the repurchases. Apple also increased its dividend by 16 percent to 73 cents a share, pushing past Exxon Mobil to become the largest dividend payer, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.But critics say the actions can take money away from potential investments in hiring or research and development, and can increase economic inequality because they typically benefit wealthier people.Investors should want companies to reinvest in themselves and their employees versus repurchasing their own stock to increase the share price, said William Lazonick, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, who studies stock buybacks. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a manipulation of the stock market.\u201dLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview that Apple was making significant investments in hiring, research and development, and manufacturing, \u201cbut we also have a very, very profitable business.\u201dHe said that \u201cbecause we\u2019re making all the right investments all around the company, it makes perfect sense for us not to keep the cash on our balance sheet but return it to investors.\u201dNo company has ever done stock buybacks like Apple. In the most recent quarter, Apple repurchased $23.5 billion in stock \u2014 the largest single stock buyback ever and more than the market value of 275 of the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices.Apple said Tuesday that it had now returned $275 billion to shareholders since 2012 and that it planned to finish its previous stock-buyback program in the current quarter, about nine months early.Other academics and investors cheered Apple\u2019s continued returns to shareholders.\u201cPeople like to believe the stories that C.E.O.s do things to boost the short-term stock price and line their own pockets,\u201d said Alex Edmans, a finance professor at the London Business School. \u201cBut if you look at hundreds of examples, you find that stock buybacks do increase long-term value.\u201dHe said that companies typically bought back stock only when they had extra cash that they would not reinvest otherwise, and that investors would spend that money elsewhere.Apple said its profit increased 25 percent to $13.8 billion in the most recent quarter on the back of strong revenue growth for iPhones, the Apple Watch and its services business. Apple earned $2.73 a share, it said, beating Wall Street estimates by 6 cents. Revenue rose 16 percent to $61.1 billion.The three months ending with March were Apple\u2019s first full quarter selling its new flagship phone, the iPhone X. Analysts had pointed to signs, including the financial results of Apple\u2019s suppliers, that the device and its sister iPhone 8 and 8 Plus had not revitalized Apple\u2019s iPhone business as the company had hoped. Many analysts lowered their estimates for Apple in recent weeks as a result.Apple said it sold 52.2 million iPhones in the quarter, or 3 percent more than a year earlier. But an 11 percent increase in their average price \u2014 driven by the $1,000 iPhone X \u2014 helped raise iPhone revenue by 14 percent.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, hit back at the notion that the iPhone business, which accounts for 62 percent of the company\u2019s overall revenue, had little room to grow. \u201cI don\u2019t buy the view that the market is saturated,\u201d he said.Investors have also worried that Apple\u2019s influence in China, the company\u2019s No. 2 market, is waning amid stronger competition from Chinese rivals. But Apple\u2019s results suggest that Chinese consumers are willing to pay for the pricier iPhones. Apple said revenue in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong had risen 21 percent to $13 billion, the largest increase in 10 quarters.And Apple\u2019s services revenue, which includes iCloud and Apple Music subscriptions and its share of app sales, rose 31 percent to $9.2 billion. Apple said consumers had paid for more than 270 million subscriptions for its services or ones sold via its App Store, up from roughly 170 million a year earlier.Advertisement"}

A spokeswoman for Carl E. Heastie, the Assembly speaker, said he would review the legislation, as did Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office.The legislation would go even further than the executive order, which dates back to Gov. Eliot Spitzer. It would not just ban donations from appointees of the governor but also other members of their household, including spouses and children.The Times reported in February that spouses, children and businesses of appointees had contributed $1.3 million to Mr. Cuomo, in addition to the roughly $890,000 in appointee donations. In some cases, appointees stopped donating after receiving state posts while family members continued to contribute.Under Mr. Ranzenhofer\u2019s bill, the contribution ban would also apply to the years before and after people\u2019s appointments.The bill\u2019s formal justification said that government appointees donating to the executive that appointed them \u201cfosters skepticism and distrust of the political process in Albany,\u201d and leads citizens to believe that Albany is rife with a pay-to-play culture.The legislation does not include appointments made by lawmakers. \u201cThis is the place to start,\u201d Mr. Ranzenhofer said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Please, Please Buy This Gun Company", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookRemington Outdoor, one of the country\u2019s oldest and largest gun makers, is getting ready to emerge from bankruptcy.The usual suspects of potential buyers are circling, including rival gun manufacturers like Sturm, Ruger & Company and some small financiers willing to accept whatever criticism would come from buying Remington.Yet all of those options have challenges. So here\u2019s a practical idea that should be considered more than just a thought experiment:What if the big banks that have provided financing to Remington during its bankruptcy were to back \u2014 and partner with \u2014 one or more of the big private equity firms in an effort to transform the company into the most advanced and responsible gun manufacturer in the country?After all, virtually all the banks have a \u201csocial impact\u201d unit or at least an initiative meant to \u201cdo good.\u201d And so do many private equity firms, like TPG and Bain Capital.And they would not be out to kill the business; quite the opposite: They could create a profitable model for the rest of the industry using technology and sound sales policies to reinvent the modern-gun manufacturer.A reimagined Remington with a new management and mandate could develop smart-gun technology. It could back fingerprint technology meant to prevent anyone who is not the gun\u2019s owner from shooting it, a measure that could greatly reduce suicides and the potential for guns to be stolen. It could add an identity stamp to ammunition fired from any of its guns. It could also establish and standardize responsible sales policies for retailers to sell its firearms.What would happen, for instance, if a consortium were to come together so that the banks offered the buyer a below-market loan, giving a socially responsible investor the advantage of a lower cost of capital? What would happen if one of the big retail chains like Walmart and Dick\u2019s \u2014 both of which have already established that they only want to sell guns in a responsible way \u2014 were to guarantee distribution, sales and marketing support?Such an approach would be in the best interests of all of the players, the banks and retailers included.Of course, it would takes leadership, and a substantial amount of courage. The National Rifle Association and other industry groups have been pushing back hard against even the slightest addition of restrictions on gun sales.There is pressure from within the government, too. Just two weeks ago, Michael Piwowar, a Republican commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission, used a regularly scheduled meeting with Citigroup executives, one intended to discuss various banking regulations, to berate them over the bank\u2019s new policy distancing it from financing gun manufacturers, according to Bloomberg News.Bank of America, which has also started putting gun makers at arm\u2019s length, was criticized along with Citigroup by Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who wrote a letter admonishing it for \u201cusing their market power to manage social policy.\u201dBefore it established its policy, Bank of America decided to provide financing to Remington. It insists that it will not offer such financing going forward.Yet the opportunity for Bank of America \u2014 which said it had \u201cmore than $11.3 billion in assets with a clearly defined environmental, social and governance approach\u201d as of the end of 2016 \u2014 could be a perfect candidate to take a piece of Remington. Other banks, like JPMorgan Chase, which also owns a stake in Remington as a result of previous financing, says it is trying to reduce its relationship with gun makers. It, too, has been a big proponent of impact investing.And here\u2019s a big opportunity.Investors have been hard to find. After all, many people who are interested in gun control cannot stomach the thought of actually investing in any kind of gun company, no matter how responsible it may be. Many of the banks, which have pledged to stop backing gun makers, might now find it difficult to change course, even for a company that is aimed at changing the industry.Will someone step up to make it happen?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Booming Savannah Port Sees Trade Tensions as Just a Hiccup", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "At the nation\u2019s fourth-busiest gateway, local confidence over its potential outweighs any anxiety over the threat of tariffs.Supported bySAVANNAH, Ga. \u2014 Savannah\u2019s ocean ports feature skyscraping silver cranes that stand at attention on the water\u2019s edge. Container ships stretch the length of four football fields, with 40-foot containers stacked behind them like multicolored Lego bricks.\u201cI repeatedly hear that this is the best port in the country,\u201d said George T. Powers, president and chief executive of TradePort Logistics, who has been talking to scores of shippers as he scouts business for a new 100-door loading facility and a 650,000-square-foot fulfillment center he\u2019s building near the port.That local confidence in the port\u2019s potential has apparently helped insulate some of Savannah\u2019s business leaders and workers \u2014 whose livelihoods depend on global commerce \u2014 from anxiety over rising tensions with trading partners.Instead of a trade war, businesses talked of a trade hiccup.\u201cWe feel very comfortable that this will just continue to grow,\u201d said Rebecca George Ogden, president of PortFresh Logistics, a 100,000-square-foot cold-storage and packing facility for produce that opened last year, contending that American appetites will carry the day. \u201cThe demand is so great. I really believe Americans are going to want their grapes in January and their citrus in June, this year-round availability that we\u2019re accustomed to.\u201dThe optimism is reflected in the shortage of industrial space \u2014 a vacancy rate of 0.52 percent compared with the average 5 percent in a healthy market, according to Colliers International, a real estate services company. Tracts of land that the port puts on the market are \u201cjust gobbled up,\u201d said Clifford H. Dales, a principal of Colliers.Whatever concern about tariffs exists, it has not had an impact on business, he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t hear much about it,\u201d Mr. Dales said about local and out-of-town developers.\u201cSavannah has become a magnet for containers,\u201d said Walter Kemmsies, an economist at Jones Lang LaSalle, who has advised more than a dozen American ports on development.Savannah does have a few distinct assets, among them location. Its southern latitude disguises just how far west the shipping channel reaches \u2014 far enough to catch a plumb line dropped from Cleveland.Another is that in Savannah, unlike other major ports in the country that lease to different terminal operators, the ports authority runs the whole show.That makes it easier to get containers from Point A to Point B. Truckers have a single check-in point when they enter and exit, and 9,700 feet of contiguous docking space. Several ships can dock on the same day, and the mechanics, crane operators and drivers working directly for the port can be quickly deployed where they are most needed.In New Jersey, for instance, a trucker might make only one trip if the ship unloads at rush hour, Mr. Kemmsies said. In Savannah, warehouse owners said truckers can average four to six.\u201cA private owner would not have the same outlook,\u201d Mr. Powers of TradePort Logistics said. \u201cThe port\u2019s mission is not to create profit for themselves but to provide services and create jobs for the region.\u201dThis approach extends to the transportation hub, which is undergoing bridge, road and interchange modernizations designed to streamline port traffic. To finance the increased capacity on Georgia\u2019s roads, the state passed a gas tax indexed to inflation and fuel efficiency.The port\u2019s coordinated investments are helping it lure ships away from the West Coast \u2014 which is more vulnerable to trade tensions with China \u2014 and nip at the heels of the Port of New York and New Jersey, its biggest rival in the East.\u201cInfrastructure drives jobs,\u201d said Ms. Ogden of PortFresh Logistics. \u201cGeorgia gets it.\u201dHer company\u2019s warehouse, cold enough for workers to wear knitted ski masks, is 15 miles from the Garden City Terminal off Interstate 16 on a 182-acre parcel bought from the county and designated for port-related development. Aiming to double its building space within the next year, the company plans to expand its 120-person work force.Nearby is a Mitsubishi Hitachi plant that makes gas and steam turbines. Its location six miles from the port was a key factor in the decision to set up manufacturing there, said Peter Mierke, the plant\u2019s general manager. The state and local governments paid for a rail spur to deliver the giant turbines directly from the warehouse to the docks.The area has become a manufacturing powerhouse, and 10 of the 15 fastest-growing cities in the country are in the South.Foreign car companies like Toyota, Mercedes and BMW \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest auto exporter \u2014 have set up factories in the Southeast in the last two decades, and their vast network of suppliers followed.Kia opened a factory in Georgia in 2009. Part of the draw was the port, which was already knee deep in its infrastructure overhaul. The company was impressed, said Corinne Hodges, a spokeswoman for Kia, with \u201chow quickly can a truck get in and out and how fast can freight get off the boat and get its way into the plant.\u201dSavannah has also benefited from some unanticipated assistance. Labor troubles caused a monthslong slowdown at the nation\u2019s largest port complex in Los Angeles, stranding cargo on ships and frustrating retailers with tight deadlines. The episode pushed importers and shipping lines to diversify their points of entry and better acquainted them with the efficiencies of Savannah\u2019s port.That may be why union leaders here emphasize that no matter what happens, they intend to keep the cargo moving.\u201cWe don\u2019t think the administration is out to hurt anybody\u201d with its trade policy, said Timothy S. Mackey, president of the 1,500-member Local 1414 of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association. \u201cTrump is a competitive guy, a businessman. He wants the best deal.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019ll do what we need to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world keeps moving.\u201dFollow the reporters on Twitter: @PatcohenNYT and @NataliekitroPatricia Cohen reported from Savannah and Natalie Kitroeff from New York.Advertisement"}

Paralyzing traffic is one symptom; the increasingly absurd price of putting a roof over one\u2019s head is another.One person from the Midwest devised a quick formula to calculate the price of a house in the Bay Area: See how much a similar house would cost in Minnesota and then add a million dollars.Every few weeks there seems to be another story in the California news media about a dilapidated shack in an ordinary neighborhood selling for seven figures, just to be torn down. It has become common enough to lose its shock value.California recorded another milestone last week, one reflecting a prouder facet of the state\u2019s success. If the state were an independent country, its economy would rank as the fifth-largest in the world, ahead of Britain\u2019s (which has been crawling lately). California held that spot once before, but it slipped a bit during the Great Recession a decade ago.As the state has blossomed, outpacing many others, it has reinforced a liberal narrative about growth, that a state can have big government and a booming economy, too. (Texas is the conservatives\u2019 counterexample: a big, fast-growing economy under laissez-faire government.)California has strict environmental protections, a progressive tax system and an ascendant minimum wage, now $10.50 an hour and set to rise in stages to $15 in 2023. The state welcomes immigrants, celebrates ethnic and linguistic diversity, and actively tries to combat climate change. And with all that, its economy continues to soar.\u201cWe have raised income taxes and imposed increasingly high fees to reduce greenhouse emissions,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. \u201cNone of that has overridden the attractiveness of this state for talent and innovation and entrepreneurship.\u201dCalifornia is not the only state doing well, of course.

The economies of states like Kansas and Louisiana shrank slightly last year, while those in the West thrived: Nevada grew by 3.5 percent, Washington by 4.4 percent, Arizona by 3.2 percent.Even among its booming neighbors, though, California, which saw 3 percent growth last year, stands out for the diversity and sheer size of its economy.Every sector contributed to the state\u2019s growth last year except agriculture, according to Irena Asmundson, the chief economist of the California Department of Finance. Financial services and real estate led the pack, and even manufacturing, often said to be in decline in America, grew significantly, contributing $10 billion in output to the $127 billion the state added over all.\u201cMost of this is a lot of relatively small firms that are very specialized,\u201d Ms. Asmundson said of the growth in manufacturing.Unsurprisingly, Silicon Valley is a big part of California\u2019s success. One of the state\u2019s technology giants, Apple, brought in more revenue in its latest fiscal year \u2014 $229 billion \u2014 than the entire economic output of Wyoming, five times over.All of that money pouring in to California\u2019s tech and entertainment industries produces a big wealth effect, ballooning what the state\u2019s workers can spend \u2014 and not just those who work directly in those fields.When Gov. Jerry Brown returned to office in 2011, he faced a budget deficit of $27 billion. Now, after eight years of economic expansion, the state has a surplus of $6 billion, and its tax revenues are running well ahead of projections.Yet it is hard to overlook the pain that prosperity has brought: traffic, property prices, homelessness.Those last two issues are increasingly seen as sides of the same coin. In 2017, California saw the fastest growth in its homeless population of any state (14 percent), and also had the highest proportion of them unsheltered: 68 percent of the state\u2019s 134,000 homeless people sleep outdoors.All economic booms run out of steam sooner or later, and some Californians say they might welcome a little relief from this one. William Yu, an economist with the Anderson Forecast at the U.C.L.A. Anderson School of Management, recalls a panel discussion a month ago with real estate developers.\u201cOne developer was asked, \u2018Are you worried about a recession coming?\u2019\u201d Mr. Yu said. \u201cThe developer said, \u2018I\u2019m not worried at all. I\u2019m waiting for it.\u2019\u201dWhy? So he can snap up some properties at cheaper prices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Baltimore Neighborhood Is Revitalized, With Help From Its Residents", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetBALTIMORE \u2014 The Mount Vernon neighborhood of this city was for many years a haven for prostitutes and crack dens. But its residents, intent on fending off the drug scourge and high homicide rate that had infected many areas of Baltimore, joined together to turn their neighborhood\u2019s prospects around.\u201cBetween 1990 and 2000, Baltimore went into free fall,\u201d said Charles Duff, a developer whose nonprofit organization, Jubilee Baltimore, has spent more than two decades trying to revive the city\u2019s ailing neighborhoods. \u201cBy the end of the 1990s, houses and other buildings in Mount Vernon on a per-square-foot basis were selling and renting at slum prices.\u201dThe residents of Mount Vernon, a historic area with once-elegant buildings more than 100 years old, have embarked on a determined comeback, focusing first on the neighborhood\u2019s Washington Monument. The first major memorial to honor George Washington, the monument had been largely ignored for decades.\u201cIt was an underachieving asset for the city,\u201d said Lance Humphries, the executive director of the Mount Vernon Place Conservancy.That began to change in 2008 when residents, supported by city officials, formed the conservancy to restore the monument and the four small parks that surround it. With the aid of $7 million in state, city and private funds, Baltimore\u2019s Washington Monument reopened on July 4, 2015, the bicentennial of the laying of its cornerstone.Around the same time, Mount Vernon was beginning to come into its own.Through a well-organized neighborhood association, residents have retained substantial sway over how the community has developed. In the early 2000s, after a bruising fight with city officials, residents successfully resisted construction of high-rises, and have since been able to work with developers on projects that generally maintain the low-rise scale and complement the historic architecture.Eddie C. Brown, the founder and chief executive of Brown Capital Management, has watched the neighborhood evolve.Mr. Brown arrived in Baltimore 1973 to work for T. Rowe Price. Ten years later, he founded his investment management firm and moved it to refurbished office space in Mount Vernon. His firm has since expanded to several adjacent buildings.When a city-owned former mansion in Mount Vernon caught his eye, Mr. Brown decided to expand his portfolio. \u201cThe quality and history of these buildings is just incredible,\u201d he said.Three years ago, he opened the Ivy Hotel, where rooms can cost $600 a night, with a spa and the upscale Magdalena restaurant.Another entrepreneur, Dennis Richter, immigrated to Mount Vernon with his mother from Germany in 1987 when he was 14. After spending the past decade buying small properties and turning them into apartments and a coworking space, he is planning a $40 million mixed-use development. His project would add about 120 apartments and about 15,000 square feet of commercial space in the heart of Mount Vernon.\u201cThere is so much room here, so much opportunity to add to great density without having to displace anybody,\u201d Mr. Richter said. He added that he hoped to lure a grocery store to the ground-floor retail space and build a rooftop pool and dining area.Other recent projects in the neighborhood include the conversion of a former fur storage warehouse into apartments; construction of the Varsity, an 11-story apartment building that provides student housing; and transformation of a firehouse into a brewery and pub.Mount Vernon\u2019s turnaround has helped draw outside developers and investors.The Hotel Revival, a midprice boutique hotel in a renovated building overlooking the Washington Monument, opened in early May. The hotel was developed by NuovoRE of Denver and financed by Alice Walton Proietti, a granddaughter of the Walmart founder Sam Walton. Ms. Walton Proietti\u2019s sister-in-law Tracy Proietti lives in Mt. Vernon and headed up the project.\u201cIt is the type of market that we have targeted for growth \u2014 urban redevelopment space. We see a lot of positive movement in Baltimore,\u201d said Michael Everett, the president of NuovoRE. \u201cWe are trying to find a diamond in the rough and bring in serious reinvestment.\u201dAri Heckman, a Brooklyn-based developer, also has Mount Vernon in his sights. He hopes to arrange financing to open a hotel at the Latrobe, a former single-occupancy residence built in the early 20th century that became an office building.\u201cI was attracted to Mount Vernon because it felt like an island of relative tranquillity in Baltimore,\u201d said Mr. Heckman, who has projects in Detroit, New Orleans and Providence, R.I. \u201cThere are not many urban neighborhoods that have been relatively mixed use from before the 19th century and have continued relatively unabated.\u201dMuch of the recent building boom has been residential, but a few commercial projects have brought some chain stores and a medical cannabis dispensary.When SBER, a developer based in Baltimore, opened a residential and commercial development about 10 years ago, it included a Starbucks and later a Chipotle. Others might find the arrival of chain stores disconcerting, but Mount Vernon residents took it as a sign that retailers thought the neighborhood had potential.Since then, more coffee bars and restaurants have sprouted up, as business owners were lured to a neighborhood that includes tourist draws like the Washington Monument, the Walters Art Museum, the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall and the Center Stage Theater. Mount Vernon is within walking distance of Baltimore\u2019s business district and Inner Harbor, and an Amtrak station lies about 15 minutes north. City officials and Amtrak are discussing ways to overhaul the aging station to include a major commercial development.The neighborhood also counts among its assets the Maryland Institute College of Art, the University of Baltimore and its law school, and the Peabody Institute.Steve Shen, a former engineer and banker, has lived in Boston, Chicago, Hong Kong and New York. But for the past 16 years, he has called the neighborhood home, attracted to the large brownstones, former mansions and a walkable neighborhood.Mr. Shen, who has worked with his neighbors over the past few decades to preserve height limits and retain a sense of scale, is happy to see more density. He eagerly welcomes new residents and the growing number of small shops, coffee bars and restaurants, as well as a children\u2019s park and a dog park.\u201cOur goal is to have the highest quality development possible that respects the historic character of the neighborhood and responds to modern needs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a great sense of community. I have really never felt it anywhere else.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Mothers and Childbirth", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:You commented on the alarming disparity of maternal mortality for black women compared with white and Latino women in the United States and particularly in New York City.This unusually high death rate has been noted for many years and has been attributed to numerous factors, including being overweight, poverty, lack of education and access to health services.The overt and unconscious racism that pervades our society and the medical community has not been adequately addressed. Decades of systemic racism cannot be erased quickly, and there is no silver bullet to eliminate the accompanying stress that black women endure.It is time to incorporate anti-bias training throughout the medical and academic communities. Women of color may require additional support and attention when presenting to health clinics, doctors\u2019 offices and hospitals.Saving one mother and her newborn can lead to a paradigm shift whereby racial bias no longer acts as a deleterious factor in a woman\u2019s health outcome.HARRY STRULOVICI, NEW YORKThe writer, a surgeon and global health consultant, is the founder of Life for Mothers, an N.G.O.To the Editor:In response to the statistics that black women in New York City are 12 times as likely to die from childbirth as white women, the editorial explored some solutions, including improved response to three leading causes of death (hemorrhage, hypertension and blood clots), publishing hospital ratings and funding doula programs.New York recently said it would expand Medicaid coverage for doulas. As a doula, a student nurse, a future student midwife, and a mom who experienced traumatic births, I can\u2019t agree more.As a student learning about public health perspectives, however, I also realize that these are downstream solutions. We are being taught to think more upstream.Why are black women at higher risk for hemorrhage, hypertension and blood clots? The editorial talks about poverty and lack of access to health care. But why? Racism is also mentioned. If we think upstream, it seems clear that racism is the root cause of the disparity black women face. I\u2019d love to see more discussion about how to reduce racism to improve health care outcomes.One key seems to be to make the health care work force more diverse. To better care for black women, we need more black doulas, nurses, midwives and doctors.SHOKO ODANI, SAN FRANCISCOTo the Editor:Best practices outlined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have already been instituted all over the country. Doctors and nurses have been weighing blood-soaked sponges in every delivery and rolling \u201chemorrhage carts\u201d for those resulting in excessive bleeding. That is good practice, but it does not seem to have affected the maternal death rate.As for the use and financing of doulas, it\u2019s a good idea, but do not expect much effect in the statistics.Perhaps the country should take a new and more humane approach. It should start compensating fairly the doctors who labor in the inner cities with heavy loads of sick and uninsured patients. These doctors are well trained to treat pregnant women with diabetes and hypertension, but they get burned out trying to pay the student loans and make ends meet.And what about the hospitals in poor neighborhoods? They are underfunded, understaffed and undersupplied.This is rich country. We must find a way to stem the spiraling of the maternal death rate of its women of color.The writer is a fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.To the Editor:Talk to any large sample of white women, and you will hear stories about how medical professionals condescended to them, refused to listen to them and put their lives in jeopardy out of arrogance and prejudice. Extrapolate that behavior to black women, and compound it with racism and the increased stress of being both black and a woman in our society.This is clearly a case where prejudice is a matter of life and death. The medical profession needs to do a thorough self-examination and heal itself so that it will stop doing harm.KATHRIN AYER, BROOKLYNTo the Editor:As co-chairwoman of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\u2019 District II Safe Motherhood Initiative in New York and as an advocate for care standardization and maternal mortality review boards, I believe that we are seeing some progress but that there is much more work to do.The reasons behind the staggering rates of mortality for black women are complex, but we are committed to better understanding them and doing whatever is necessary to ensure that no woman or community experiences a preventable maternal death.The initiative has shown me how collaboration at all levels of care and policymaking is critical for progress and how important the sharing of stories about maternal deaths and \u201cnear misses\u201d is to inspiring and sustaining change in maternal health care. Please continue to share these stories.MARY E.

Dr. D\u2019Alton is a member of the advisory board of Merck for Mothers, which provided grant funding for the initial stages of the Safe Motherhood Initiative.To the Editor:You struck just the right note in highlighting the racial disparities that are a stain on New York\u2019s health care system. But one of the proposed solutions \u2014 giving pregnant women information about hospital outcomes to facilitate better choices \u2014 while meritorious on its face, creates an implication that is not wholly true.Women are not choosing the wrong hospitals; poor women in particular do not have a full array of choices. The fact that more than 90 percent of births in some hospitals are Medicaid-funded while births in hospitals a short walk away have less than 10 percent Medicaid-funded births doesn\u2019t reflect bad decisions; it reflects poor access.Even hospitals that accept some Medicaid may have first-come, first-served policies for the slots reserved for poor women, such that the highest risk women \u2014 those with late entry into care \u2014 find themselves with even more limited choices.Yes, women need to know where it is best to go for prenatal care, but there must be no barriers when they arrive.HOWARD MINKOFF, BROOKLYNThe writer is chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Maimonides Medical Center.To the Editor:Confronting the ways in which racism and gender oppression conspire to create poor birth outcomes for black women requires public health departments to work in partnership with health care systems and community partners.The New York City Health Department has pioneered surveillance of life-threatening complications during childbirth and recently started the Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Committee, including clinicians, birth activists and community partners, to review all maternal deaths and make recommendations to eliminate preventable deaths.In addition, the Health Department and SUNY Downstate Medical Center are starting an initiative to improve obstetric care and disease management, a leading cause of racial disparities in birth outcomes.By forging partnerships beyond medical experts, New York City can ignite sustainable change to achieve the same opportunity for healthy pregnancies and births for all New Yorkers.Dr. Askew, a pediatrician, is the deputy commissioner of the Division of Family and Child Health at the New York City Health Department.

{"Headline": "Once-Thriving City Nonprofit Sputters Under Mayor\u2019s Wife, Chirlane McCray", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the years after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Mayor\u2019s Fund to Advance the City of New York became a fund-raising juggernaut: The city-run nonprofit, which channels donations to city programs or causes, raised tens of millions of dollars from private sources.But under Mayor Bill de Blasio, the fund has not kept pace. Contributions are stagnant, if not falling, and now support fewer programs.And the chairwoman of the nonprofit, Chirlane McCray, has largely been missing in action: She has attended less than half of the fund\u2019s board meetings, and her outreach to donors has been sporadic.Ms. McCray, the mayor\u2019s wife, has not even set foot in the fund\u2019s office for nearly a year; her public schedules in 2017 recorded less than 20 hours spent on Mayor\u2019s Fund business during the entire year.Even as fund-raising has stalled, the fund has moved into larger offices \u2014 which include a new, private office for Ms. McCray \u2014 and the cost of running the operation has increased by more than 50 percent in the last two years.\u201cIt\u2019s about being an active chair,\u201d Ms. McCray said in a recent interview. She defended her tenure and said that she frequently took part in activities outside the fund offices, like visiting programs that it had financed.\u201cI know what goes on,\u201d Ms. McCray said, adding that she was justified in skipping board meetings. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary for me to sit through them if I can be raising thousands of dollars to actually pay for\u201d fund programs. She added, \u201cThis is 2018; work can get done in all kinds of ways.\u201dMr. de Blasio had to seek permission from the city\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Board to name his wife to chair the fund, because city rules barred him from giving the job to a relative. The mayor argued that she would be \u201cexceptional\u201d and was \u201cuniquely qualified\u201d to connect government with for-profit and nonprofit groups.From mid-2002 through mid-2014, the fund raised an average of $32 million a year, although that number is inflated somewhat by a spike in donations after Hurricane Sandy (and includes large donations from Mr. Bloomberg).From the fiscal year that began in July 2014 \u2014 the first year the fund was under full control of Mr. de Blasio and Ms. McCray \u2014 through June 2017, the fund raised an average of $22 million a year. In the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, the fund raised $14 million, according to a spokeswoman, Cynthia Olson, putting the fund on pace for its lowest annual revenues in more than a decade.The number of programs the fund supports has also declined, from 123 during Mr. de Blasio\u2019s first year in office to 97 the next fiscal year. After a brief rise, the number declined again. There were 85 programs at last count, according to Ms. Olson.But the fund itself has become a much larger operation, adding employees and salaries. The organization spent $753,000 on management and fund-raising in the fiscal year that ended in June 2017, 50 percent more than two years earlier.\u201cThe amount of time it takes to manage a $50,000 program or project is not infrequently the same amount of time that it might take to manage a $5 million program or project,\u201d said Darren Bloch, the executive director of the Mayor\u2019s Fund, defending the staffing increase. He said that a better measure of the fund\u2019s success was the number of programs that it finances \u2014 a number that has also fallen.The fund has also moved into a larger space, in a building across from City Hall, which, for the first time, now includes a separate office for the chairwoman. The office has Ms. McCray\u2019s name on a metal plaque on the door. Inside there is a small desk with a computer; a bookshelf is adorned with bibelots and certificates of appreciation with her name in fancy script.Ms. McCray last stopped by in May 2017, Ms. Olson said.The first lady was a similarly infrequent presence at board meetings, attending just five of 12 since being appointed, according to the meeting minutes. The fund\u2019s federal tax returns say that she spends only an hour a week on fund business. Her public schedules indicate she spends even less: a total of 19.5 hours spent on fund activities in all of last year; 35 hours in 2016. (Her spokeswoman, Kate Bernyk, estimated she spends 10 percent of her time on fund business.)And while the fund\u2019s bylaws define the chair as \u201cthe lead fund-raiser,\u201d officials struggled to show her direct involvement with those efforts. In interviews with more than a dozen donors and others who had contact with the fund, none said that they had substantive conversations with Ms. McCray.Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, a donor to the fund virtually since its inception, recalled receiving a brief phone call from Ms. McCray in 2015 when the foundation was considering a large donation to support a mental health initiative. He also attended a meeting of philanthropic organizations at Gracie Mansion to discuss the initiative, at which Ms. McCray spoke. But he said that he had no in-depth conversations with her about fund business.Ms. Harris missed only one board meeting in the last four years she served as chairwoman, the period for which records were available.Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for the mayor\u2019s office, said that Ms. McCray\u2019s public schedules listed fund-raising calls made on behalf of the fund, but an analysis of those schedules showed just three such calls in the first three years Mr. de Blasio was in office. The pace appeared to pick up last year, with 16 calls on the schedules and seven more in the first two months of this year.City Hall later provided a list of 44 people contacted by Ms. McCray in 2015 and 2016. Several people on the list, when asked about the call, either did not remember the interaction or did not recall discussing donations.\u201cShe makes calls to share what our priorities are and to get attention and interest from others,\u201d said Mr. Bloch, describing Ms. McCray as a key part of the organization\u2019s fund-raising. He said that she does not typically make direct requests for money, which is a task that he or another staffer will do in follow-up calls.However, of the 25 one-on-one calls identified on the schedules, in only three cases did the person or the organization they were associated with follow up with a donation, according to a list of contributions provided by the fund.One exception was Marilyn Simons, a philanthropist married to the hedge fund billionaire James Simons. The couple donated $260,000, earmarked for Ms. McCray\u2019s mental health initiative, in 2015 and 2016. Ms. McCray\u2019s schedules show that last year she made three calls to Ms. Simons, in July, September and December. In December, the Simonses made another donation, of $250,000. A spokeswoman said that they had pledged an additional $250,000, which will be paid this year.Ms. Simons declined to be interviewed.But another pattern is revealed by the calls: almost half of those contacted by Ms. McCray were contributors to her husband\u2019s mayoral campaigns (the Simonses each gave the maximum donation to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election campaign last year). In at least two cases, a person made a campaign donation to Mr. de Blasio within days of one of Ms. McCray\u2019s calls on behalf of the fund.There is no limit to the size of donations to the fund, as there is for campaign contributions, and as a nonprofit controlled by the mayor\u2019s office, the fund has routinely and legally raised money from donors who gave to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaigns and his political causes.\u201cWe understand we\u2019re working at a sensitive intersection of civic investors and public projects, so we try to be sensitive to it,\u201d Mr. Bloch said. \u201cIf you\u2019re civic-minded, you\u2019re probably involved in campaign support as well as philanthropy and the rest of it, so it\u2019s hard to. There\u2019s no separation as a practical matter.\u201dIn several cases, donations to the fund coincided with city action on a particular project, though donors dispute any effort to curry favor with the administration.Harold Fetner, a real estate developer who joined the fund\u2019s advisory board in 2014, made multiple donations to the fund, through companies he owns, from 2015 through 2017, totaling $67,350. He also made maximum contributions to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inaugural fund in 2013 and to his 2017 re-election campaign.Besides the calls that Ms. McCray makes to donors, she has met with potential donors and hosted an annual Christmas fund-raiser at Gracie Mansion. But the fund-raising work has mostly been done by others: Mr. Bloch; Gabrielle Fialkoff, the fund\u2019s vice chairwoman, who also works as a senior adviser to Mr. de Blasio and was the finance chairwoman of his 2013 mayoral campaign; and Daniele Baierlein, a longtime Democratic Party fund-raiser who previously worked at the Podesta Group, the powerful Washington lobbying firm. Ms. Baierlein was hired last year as director of development.Under Ms. McCray\u2019s leadership, the fund has made priorities of mental health, youth employment and immigration services. The three largest programs, according to the most recent tax filing for 2016, were federal grants for antipoverty initiatives, civic service programs and a Bloomberg-era effort known as the Young Men\u2019s Initiative aimed at supporting black and Hispanic men.Ms. McCray declined a request for a follow-up interview to discuss the fund\u2019s activities in more detail. After The Times reviewed its findings with staff at the Mayor\u2019s Fund, officials on May 18 announced the addition of 19 members, including Ms. Simons, to its advisory board, a largely ceremonial position chiefly aimed at fund-raising.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Good News on Early Breast Cancer: Herceptin Treatment Can Be Shortened", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past 20 years, hundreds of thousands of women with breast cancer have taken the drug Herceptin, typically for a year or more. The medicine, used to treat an aggressive form of the disease, is credited with saving many lives, but it also has some tough side effects, particularly damage to the heart.A large new study that followed thousands of women with early-stage breast cancer for a median of more than five years has found that those treated with Herceptin for only six months did just as well as those who got it for a year \u2014 and they suffered fewer side effects.The shorter regimen also saved money. A yearlong course of the drug costs $76,700.Dr. Bruce E. Johnson, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said the study\u2019s findings should change treatment for women who have early-stage breast cancer treatable by Herceptin. He was not involved in the research, which was done in Britain and will be presented at a meeting of the oncology society next month.\u201cA lot of people will likely adopt a shorter regimen based on this finding,\u201d Dr. Johnson said.Cancer specialists say the study offers not only important news for women\u2019s health, but also highlights a type of research that pharmaceutical companies almost never do and that is also critically important for cancer drugs that can often be quite toxic.The study has not yet been published in a medical journal, and some experts reserved judgment until the data have been peer-reviewed.Dr. Johnson noted that as the field of cancer research matures, more efforts are being made to fine-tune treatments \u2014 lessening doses or duration, or even dropping some forms of therapy entirely for certain patients \u2014 to minimize harsh side effects without sacrificing efficacy.Dr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical and scientific officer of the American Cancer Society, said there was also an increasing recognition among doctors that it is safe to monitor some early cancers, including certain tumors in the prostate, thyroid gland, kidney and bladder, rather than perform surgery immediately. Some tumors will eventually require removal, but others will not grow, spread or threaten the patient\u2019s life or health.The Herceptin study was paid for by the British government. Dr. Johnson said that although drug companies finance many studies, they are not eager to pay for research that may decrease use of their products.Dr. Brawley agreed, saying: \u201cWhen drug companies do research, they\u2019re interested in gaining knowledge such that they can make money for their shareholders. There is a difference. You will not see drug companies doing this kind of study. They don\u2019t mind that somebody else did it, but they will not get caught doing a study that decreases their bottom line.\u201dCourtney Aberbach, a spokeswoman for Herceptin\u2019s maker, Genentech, owned by Roche, said in an email that previous studies had not found that a shorter duration worked as well as the longer one.She said the 12-month course was still the only regimen approved for early-stage disease by the Food and Drug Administration and recommended by several international organizations that issue treatment guidelines.But Dr. Brawley pointed out that this type of research underlines the importance of government entities in conducting or supporting cancer research, because their goal is to increase understanding of the disease.The new study is the first to show that women with early-stage disease can safely cut back on Herceptin, Dr. Helena Earl, its first author, at the University of Cambridge in Britain, said in an email.\u201cHere we are asking the question whether less is more,\u201d she said.Studies like the new one, aimed at finding out whether one treatment is no worse than another, are more difficult and more expensive \u2014 requiring more patients and longer follow-up \u2014 than studies trying to prove that one treatment is better than another, Dr. Brawley said.About 15 percent of women with early breast cancer have tumors that respond to Herceptin, also called trastuzumab. Such tumors are particularly aggressive, because they have high levels of a protein called HER2, which promotes cancer growth. The drug significantly increases survival in those women.But it has risks as well, particularly heart problems, which are sometimes permanent.\u201cI have personally seen congestive heart failure caused by Herceptin,\u201d Dr. Brawley said. \u201cThe longer you give it, the likelier they are to get it. So it\u2019s a wonderful thing if you can give it for a shorter time.\u201dIn the United States, 266,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected in 2018, and nearly 41,000 deaths. Globally, the most recent statistics come from 2012, when there were 1.7 million new cases.The women in the study had early-stage breast cancer, meaning it had not spread to bones or organs \u2014 stages 1, 2 and 3. The findings do not apply to women with more advanced disease that has spread, Stage 4. Those patients need a longer course of treatment, Dr. Earl said.She said the findings would undergo \u201crigorous scientific scrutiny\u201d by other researchers and be published in a peer-reviewed journal.In addition, the results will be analyzed further to determine whether there are subgroups of patients with specific levels of risk that would signal different advice about Herceptin.\u201cThe final call will be with our colleagues and patients to decide whether these results will change practice,\u201d Dr. Earl said.\u201cThis could be absolutely practice-changing for a lot of patients,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Litton, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.But she added, \u201cI\u2019d like to see the data, and see it peer-reviewed, before I make a big practice change.\u201dIn the meantime, the results should reassure women who in the past had to quit Herceptin after only six months because of side effects, Dr. Litton said.She had a patient like that whom she had worried about. \u201cNow I don\u2019t feel bad,\u201d Dr. Litton said.Dr. Earl\u2019s study, called the Persephone trial, included 4,089 women in Britain who were picked at random to take the drug for six or 12 months, along with standard chemotherapy. The women were 23 to 82 years old, with a median age of 56. They were followed for a median of more than five years.After four years, the disease-free survival rate was 89.4 percent in those treated for six months, and 89.8 percent in the 12-month group.Disease-free survival means they had no signs of breast cancer, and the lack of difference between the two groups suggests that their overall survival should be equal as well, Dr. Johnson said, though longer follow-up would be needed to be sure.Dr. Earl said they would be followed for 10 years.Toxicity can build up over time, and with the shorter course, half as many women had to quit treatment early because of heart problems: 4 percent in the six-month group, versus 8 percent in the 12-month group.Earlier studies that proved Herceptin\u2019s effectiveness treated patients for a year, a somewhat arbitrary duration, but one that became the standard of care because there was data to support it.To change that standard, researchers had to produce evidence that it could be safely done. Dr. Earl\u2019s study is the first step in that direction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Air France Dispute Threatens to Escalate Macron\u2019s Battle With Labor", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 In the first year of his presidency, Emmanuel Macron has pushed business-friendly labor laws through Parliament, made it easier for companies to hire and fire, cut the wealth tax and decentralized collective bargaining. Through it all, France\u2019s most militant unions have resisted.His changes, which set out to reshape the way France\u2019s economy and society work, are now facing increasing pushback from labor groups. For weeks, unions have staged a series of strikes to oppose efforts to make the nation\u2019s main railway system, the SNCF, more competitive. And unions representing Air France-KLM staff on Monday called for new strikes after rejecting a pay proposal.While Mr. Macron\u2019s economic changes do not take aim at the nation\u2019s flagship air carrier, his administration has inserted itself directly into the fight, warning labor leaders that they risked driving Air France to the brink of calamity.France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the company might \u201cdisappear\u201d if unions persisted in their demands for an immediate 5 percent wage increase and continued rolling strikes that have already affected tens of thousands of fliers worldwide. The French government, which owns a minority stake in Air France, would not ride to the rescue with a taxpayer bailout if the airline faltered, Mr. Le Maire said.The standoff, which has already cost the airline an estimated 300 million euros, or $360 million, in lost revenue, prompted the abrupt resignation of the airline\u2019s chief executive. Shares of the company were down 13 percent on Monday.\u201cI am not taking the money of the French and putting it in a company that isn\u2019t at the required competitive level,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said.The battle is an outgrowth of Mr. Macron\u2019s effort to remake the French economy.Mr. Macron\u2019s moves have been cheered by businesses and investors. It has encouraged drawn companies like Facebook and Amazon to step up their presence in France.In many ways, that has been Mr. Macron\u2019s point. Although only around 8 percent of the nation\u2019s workers are unionized, organized labor has long held outsize clout at the negotiating table with employers. In France, even small changes tend to agitate unions, which have historically sought to secure workplace protections through protests and strikes.Before pushing through changes to the labor laws, Mr. Macron held more than 50 meetings with unions shortly after his election in an effort to get them onboard with his program.The General Confederation of Labor, known as the C.G.T., has largely resisted, seeing an effort to repeal hard-won labor rights. The union has been at the forefront of mobilizing actions that in recent weeks have led hundreds of thousands of people into the streets, and encouraged regular strikes at the nation\u2019s railway system that are scheduled to last until July.At Air France, the government pushed back against labor groups over the weekend after the chief executive, Jean-Marc Janaillac, resigned abruptly on Friday. Mr. Janaillac had failed to win workers over in a contentious internal referendum that proposed a 7 percent pay increase for pilots and staff over four years.Air France\u2019s hard-line pilots\u2019 union had demanded an immediate 5 percent raise to make up for wages that have been frozen for nearly five years. The company has recorded record profits thanks to lower oil prices since 2016, prompting the union to insist that Air France could afford the pay increase.Still, it has set up a dangerous game of brinkmanship between unions and the French government, which has hinted that it is willing to let Air France go under.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t make the necessary efforts to be at the same competitive level of Lufthansa and other major airlines, it will disappear,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said on the French television station BFM on Sunday. He added that the union\u2019s salary demands were \u201cunjustified\u201d and urged employees to show \u201cresponsibility.\u201dSuch talk is reminiscent of Mr. Macron\u2019s broader approach to overhauling the economy. Some analysts have criticized the way he has pushed through changes to the labor laws, most of which have been done by the equivalent of executive order, raising questions about how democratic \u2014 or not \u2014 his methods have been.\u201cEmmanuel Macron is walking a fine line between the rehabilitation of a certain presidential authority and authoritarianism,\u201d Jean-Claude Monod, a specialist in political philosophy, said in an interview published Monday in the French daily Le Monde. \u201cOne has the impression of a deafness in front of forms of protest or political experimentations, of a will to use force for his reforms.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Banks Tried to Curb Gun Sales. Now Republicans Are Trying to Stop Them.", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Congress decided not to take significant action after a spate of mass shootings this year and last, some big banks opted to take matters into their own hands by restricting financing for gun sellers.Now, Republican lawmakers are pressing regulators to stop banks from doing so, over concerns they are veering too far into social activism.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to turn us into a nation of red banks and blue banks, you\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican and member of the banking committee, said in a recent interview before the latest shooting. \u201cDon\u2019t come crying to us when you screw up and you want the American taxpayer to bail you out.\u201dMr. Kennedy said he planned to file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau against banks that are effectively restricting gun sales by setting their own rules on legal products and refusing to do business with gun makers and retailers that do not comply. He is also working to get Republican colleagues to join him in writing legislation to stop banks from discriminating against gun buyers.BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, said it would begin offering a new line of investment funds that do not include producers of firearms or retailers that sell them, cutting off a potential avenue of financing for gun makers and retailers.Gun advocates have viewed the moves as a direct assault on the industry.Senator Michael D. Crapo, the Idaho Republican who heads the banking committee, sent blistering letters in late April to the top executives at Citigroup and Bank of America, accusing them of using their market power to manage social policy. He told them not to go any further and warned them against developing ways to monitor gun transactions through their payments systems, a move that gun advocates view as a dangerous step toward using data to block law-abiding customers from buying guns.\u201cI am concerned when government agencies use their power to try to cut off financial services for lawful businesses they may disfavor,\u201d Mr. Crapo wrote to Michael Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s chief executive. \u201cI am also concerned when large national banks use their market power for similar purposes.\u201dMr. Crapo reminded the banks that he had fought against Operation Choke Point, an Obama-era initiative in which the Department of Justice and bank regulators worked to discourage banks from doing business with companies such as payday lenders and gun sellers. The Trump Justice Department decided to end the policy last year.At a meeting with the Securities and Exchange Commission this month, a departing Republican commissioner, Michael Piwowar, assailed Citigroup executives over the bank\u2019s gun policies. Mr. Piwowar, according to Bloomberg News, warned that the bank could struggle to get Republican support on the commission for easing derivatives regulations. He declined to comment on the exchange.\u201cWe tried to balance respect for law-abiding gun owners and respect for the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Skyler said, explaining that the bank\u2019s goal was just to keep firearms out of the wrong hands. \u201cThe sense was nothing was really changing in our society.\u201dGun lobbyists that usually direct their resources at attacking Democrats have now jumped into the fray to take on banks, pressing Republican lawmakers to use their influence to make the banks back down.The website of the National Rifle Association\u2019s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, has been accusing bankers of infringing on constitutional rights from the comfort of New York City skyscrapers.Lawrence Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said his organization had been lobbying lawmakers in hopes they would take action against banks. He said businesses should not be able to tell consumers what legal products they could and could not buy.\u201cWe are very concerned that banks enter into this hotly contested political issue,\u201d Mr. Keane said. \u201cThese are matters for the policy arena. Banks shouldn\u2019t be interjecting themselves into this issue.\u201d\u201cPlease do not support the Dodd-Frank reform legislation without the inclusion of an amendment that stops federally funded banks from discriminating against the lawful exercise of the Second Amendment,\u201d said John Velleco, director of government operations at Gun Owners of America. No such amendment was included, and President Trump signed the bill into law on Thursday.Mr. Trump, who has not hesitated to publicly attack companies such as Amazon for policies that he opposes, has not yet weighed in on the banking industry\u2019s efforts to curb gun sales. However, members of his administration have expressed doubt that there is much their regulatory agencies could do.During congressional hearings this spring, Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Randal K. Quarles, vice chairman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, faced questions from Republican lawmakers about whether regulators could intervene.Mr. Quarles indicated that the issue was outside of the scope of the Fed\u2019s mandate. Mr. Mulvaney said that what the banks were doing to the gun industry was \u201ctroubling,\u201d but that he did not think it was his agency\u2019s role to intercede.While lawmakers have been mulling how to respond, legislation, at the moment, appears unlikely.The gun restrictions are one of the few areas where Democratic lawmakers have been supportive of the banks, and Republican leaders in the House have expressed reluctance about interfering in the financial sector despite their strong belief in gun rights.Thus far, other banks have remained quiet about their intentions, but more action against the gun industry could bring reluctant Republican lawmakers off the sidelines.\u201cI\u2019m still thinking through this, because I generally don\u2019t like to tell businesses how to conduct their business,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. \u201cBut it is certainly problematic if it were to be the case that the major banks that provide the infrastructure for so much of our financial services decided that they were going to practically shut down a perfectly legal industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kale, Not Jail: Urban Farming Nonprofit Helps Ex-Cons Re-enter Society", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Even by the standards of the Bay Area, where sourcing local, organic chicken feed is seen as something of a political act, the spectacle of 30,000 fruit and nut trees being tended by formerly incarcerated orchardists is novel.The green thumbs are there because of Planting Justice, a nine-year-old nonprofit that combines urban farming with environmental education and jobs for ex-offenders. From its headquarters in a pair of salvaged shipping containers on a dead-end street in East Oakland, Calif., Planting Justice has forged a trail in which revenue-generating businesses help subsidize the group\u2019s core mission: hiring former inmates, many from nearby San Quentin State Prison, and giving them a \u201cfamily sustaining\u201d wage, along with health benefits and a month of paid leave annually. About half the total staff of 30 have served time in prison.Though still young, the organic orchard generates roughly $250,000 of Planting Justice\u2019s yearly $2 million operating budget. Another $250,000 comes from an edible landscaping business, in which roving horticulturalists hired by well-off clients install beehives, fruit trees, chicken coops, massive barrels for harvesting rain water and \u201claundry to landscaping\u201d systems that funnel used washing machine water into the garden. The money helps subsidize pro bono edible landscapes in low-income neighborhoods.In addition, there are the 2,000 or so \u201csubscribers\u201d who make monthly pledges to Planting Justice, which brings in another $450,000 annually, and grants from a variety of nonprofit organizations, among them the Kresge FreshLo program, the Thomas J. Long Foundation and Kaiser Permanente\u2019s community benefit programs.Planting Justice cultivates metaphors along with the food. \u201cWe\u2019re composting and weeding the things in our lives we don\u2019t need and fertilizing the parts of ourselves we do need,\u201d Mr. Raders explained, sitting on a eucalyptus stump.The guiding principle: kale, not jail.Mr. Raders and Ms. Zandi, who are partners and have two children together, got their start as door-to-door peace activists. Mr. Raders had spent some time in India protesting a Coca-Cola bottling plant that was depleting groundwater. The couple eventually decided they wanted to commit to something tangible, particularly since \u201cthere was a war happening in our own community \u2014 violence and multigenerational poverty,\u201d Mr. Raders said.Studies of the garden programs at San Quentin and at Rikers Island in New York City indicated lower recidivism rates than state averages, perhaps not surprising given the bleakness of prison environments and the relief that access to nature can bring, said Sander van der Linden, an assistant professor of social psychology at the University of Cambridge.Of the 35 formerly incarcerated workers hired by Planting Justice since 2009, only one is known to have returned to prison, Mr. Raders said. Employees must commit to staying sober and drug free. A few have gone into detox programs and rebounded, but two were let go because of poor job performance, he said.Anthony Forrest, 56, who served 25 years at San Quentin for armed robbery, started his job at Planting Justice five days after his release, earning $17.50 an hour. (He now makes $25 an hour.)\u201cWorking in the garden calms me down,\u201d Mr. Forrest said. His first assignment was building vegetable gardens for clients and planting fruit trees at the county juvenile justice center. He now leads weekly educational programs at four Oakland schools, another part of Planting Justice\u2019s mission, helping students plant and maintain raised vegetable beds, whipping up nettle smoothies for dubious teenagers and teaching a health- and nutrition-oriented class \u201cabout what goes into your body,\u201d as he put it.\u201cWe live in the ghetto,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything you see on the shelves is not nutritious and has been sitting around.\u201d Mr. Forrest also recently started teaching meditation and gardening at the prison where he once served.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about food security, but the security of providing living wages,\u201d she said. That\u2019s no mean feat in a foodie monoculture.Planting Justice has also had success with crowdsourced funding. When offered the chance to buy 30,000 trees from a nursery that was closing, Ms. Zandi and Mr. Raders raised $100,000 through Kickstarter and secured additional funding. Then there was issue of where to put 30,000 trees: The Northern California Community Loan Fund came through with a $600,000 loan to help finance the acquisition of the East Oakland land.But for now, the main focus is on aiding these former inmates, and trying to help ease their way back into life in the outside world.\u201cI believe I have an edge up,\u201d he said of his own experience, which has been hard-won. \u201cIn East Oakland, what\u2019s fashionable are the hustlers. Now my hustle is the garden.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Man Who Bought New York", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoney hasn\u2019t made Stephen Schwarzman universally beloved. Who cares?Last May, a familiar routine took place on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Katy Perry ascended the red carpet at the annual Costume Institute gala looking like the bride of Frankenstein in her red John Galliano dress and veil. Jennifer Lopez wafted by in sky blue Valentino, flanked by her favorite Yankee of all time and the founder of the design house responsible for making her gown. By contrast, the entrance of the private equity guru Stephen A. Schwarzman and his wife, Christine, was inconspicuous. He wore a simple black tuxedo. She had on a shimmering gray Versace gown.\u201cI think this one,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said, although it was hard not to wonder if this guess was a measure of reality or wishful thinking. Certainly, the Met had no live camels in the entryway to the party space. Nor did Gwen Stefani serenade Anna Wintour to the reported tune of $500,000. But all that\u2019s neither here nor there. He and his wife helped underwrite the exhibition \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,\u201d handing over a check that two sources close to the museum said was in the ballpark of $5 million. \u201cMuch of the cultural vitality of New York has long been due to the benevolence of such great Americans as Brooke Astor and David Rockefeller,\u201d Ms. Wintour said in a statement last week. \u201cAt the Met, we\u2019ve been extraordinarily lucky to partner with Stephen and Christine Schwarzman, who, like the philanthropists who\u2019ve gone before them, have always supported everything from arts and culture to education to Catholic charities. It\u2019s their generosity \u2014 along with that of my friend Donatella Versace \u2014 that has made this brilliant and groundbreaking exhibition possible. When you work with the likes of Stephen and Christine, everyone benefits.\u201dSo Mr. Schwarzman may be a flash point for income inequality, a man with more money than respect, but that seldom stops him from having the last laugh, or getting the multi-million-dollar tax write-off. (All the people involved declined interviews.) There are several reasons Mr. Schwarzman inspires enmity. Second: Mr. Schwarzman is famously brash, a 5-foot-6-inch bundle of testosterone who in 2008 described his business philosophy by saying, \u201cI want war \u2014 not a series of skirmishes.\u201d This has extended not only to his rivals at competing firms, but also at times to those closest to him. Together, Mr. Peterson and Mr. Schwarzman started the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm that grew into a financial colossus that dwarfed competitors like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Carlyle Group. Mr. Peterson died in March. At the memorial, numerous attendees took note that Mr. Peterson\u2019s most famous prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was not selected as a speaker.So whose idea was it to name the building in the donor\u2019s honor? \u201cI can\u2019t answer questions about the contractual negotiation,\u201d Mr. Salovey said in a phone interview that was supervised by a public relations person from Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s team. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of confidentiality.\u201dAnyway, Mr. Salovey pointed out, \u201cthere are hundreds of spaces on our campus named for donors.\u201d Annette de la Renta, a board member at the Met and the New York Public Library, doesn\u2019t get why all this inspires such fuss, such sanctimony. \u201cPeople should just be grateful,\u201d she said. Yet they\u2019re not always. \u201cAll that money for a bunch of useless fountains,\u201d said Michael M. Thomas, the best-selling author who preceded Mr. Schwarzman both as a student at Yale and as a partner at Lehman Brothers. According to Mr. Thomas, Mr. Salovey is right to argue that Mr. Schwarzman is one of many people at Yale with a space named in his honor. But that reveals the extent of the problem with modern philanthropy, not its absence, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m not going to my 60th reunion,\u201d he said. \u201cYale is Whoresville, U.S.A. You can quote me on that.\u201dTo the delight of Mr. Thomas, the donation still went through. \u201cIt took a little high school in Pennsylvania to do what Yale would not,\u201d he said, chuckling. Jimmy Lee, a friend of Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s, has joked that Mr. Schwarzman has given more money to the archdiocese than any Jew in New York. Partly, this is because his wife, Christine, is Catholic.Mr. Schwarzman met her sometime around 1994. \u201cI fixed them up,\u201d said Debbie Bancroft, a party scene fixture and a contributor to Avenue Magazine. He had previously been married to Ellen Philips, the daughter of a wealthy Ohio industrialist, whom he met during his graduate work at Harvard Business School. Five years later, Mr. and Mrs. Schwarzman made their first real mark as a society couple by buying a 17,000-square-foot, three-floor penthouse apartment at 740 Park Avenue. That was its own kind of a leveraged buyout. The apartment once belonged to John D. Rockefeller. Later it was owned by Saul Steinberg, who sold it to Mr. Schwarzman after Mr. Steinberg\u2019s company, the Reliance Group, went into bankruptcy. Off went Mr. Steinberg\u2019s billiard tables. Down came the red vinyl walls, which really would not have been the way to showcase Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s Monets and Cy Twomblys. Soon, Mr. and Mrs. Schwarzman began dining t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Cardinal Edward Egan, the late archbishop of New York. Mr. Schwarzman happily gave financial advice for Cardinal Egan to take back to the archdiocese. \u201cThey\u2019re peas in a pod,\u201d said Ms. Bancroft, who often gets a Valentine\u2019s Day card from Mr. Schwarzman thanking her for the introduction that has made him the happiest man in the world. \u201cThey\u2019re energizer bunnies. They love dancing, and they love watching people.\u201dMere months after Mr. Schwarzman spent $100 million to have his name plunked across the facade of the New York Public Library, Mr. Koch paid $100 million to have his name put on the facade of Lincoln Center. Residents at 740 Park Avenue began to float the theory that the conservative billionaire on the fourth floor was trying to one-up the conservative billionaire on 15. How does a man people are inclined to make fun of usually wind up with the upper hand? Well, having money helps a lot. Just look at Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s relationship with the president.Mr. Schwarzman didn\u2019t endorse Mr. Trump during the campaign. Instead, he donated to Jeb Bush. (He even once compared Mr. Trump to P.T. Barnum, when speaking to CNN in 2015.) But the Blackstone Group is an enormously powerful real estate investor. Between 2013 and 2017, it provided more than $400 million to the troubled real estate projects of Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Mr. Trump was unusually solicitous about Mr. Schwarzman during the campaign, and reportedly asked aides numerous times if there had been any luck getting him to pledge allegiance. That did not happen until after Mr. Trump won the election, at which point Mr. Schwarzman agreed to come aboard his team of business advisers and began raising money for his re-election. When Mr. Schwarzman celebrated his 70th birthday in Florida in February 2017, Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, were among the guests. As was Donatella Versace.In September 2017, Cardinal Egan\u2019s successor at the archdiocese, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, received a visit from a couple of people representing the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Cardinal Dolan still can\u2019t entirely remember who they were.\u201cThere was a guy named Andrew and this lady who edits a magazine,\u201d Cardinal Dolan said in an interview.Still, it was clear to him she is a pretty big deal, an \u201cadmired\u201d person, he said, because \u201call these people\u201d in his office got bizarrely star-struck when she walked in.As Cardinal Dolan\u2019s visitors explained it to him, the theme for the Costume Institute\u2019s big exhibition for 2018 was to be \u201cHeavenly Bodies,\u201d a tribute to the Catholic imagination.Not all the publicity the church receives is positive, so it came as a relief to hear that the exhibit was being underwritten by his old friend Mr. Schwarzman.\u201cThat\u2019s when I said, \u2018Bingo,\u2019\u201d Cardinal Dolan recalled.Over the last few weeks, friends of the Schwarzmans have been slightly surprised that his check underwriting the exhibition didn\u2019t translate into invitations for them. \u201cI\u2019m still holding out for the possibility they may get a cancellation from J.Lo,\u201d Ms. Bancroft joked.People close to the museum and to Ms. Wintour have been a little surprised that requests made of the Schwarzmans occasionally get turned down. Ultimately, though, it\u2019s a win-win. The Costume Institute has the money it needed for the exhibition.Mr. and Mrs. Schwarzman are the second couple underwriting the exhibit and co-hosting the gala since 1997, when none other than Mr. Koch and his wife, Julia, had their names on the invitation. Mr. and Mrs. Schwarzman\u2019s friends at the archdiocese are happy. Ms. Versace\u2019s clothes are prominently featured in the galleries. An earlier version of this article misidentified the part of the National Library of Israel that is being named for Stephen A. Schwarzman. It is the library's education center, not the entire library.Advertisement"}

There was no continuous rail link across Eurasia. There still isn\u2019t, but 125 years later China now envisions financing and building multiple such overland routes (with much faster trains). That\u2019s for the \u201cbelt\u201d portion of what it calls the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative: It is also developing a string of new ports, from the South China Sea through the Indian Ocean to Africa and the Mediterranean.The number and scale of the projects proposed are breathtaking, far surpassing even the imagination of a sci-fi writer. They have stimulated awe and, more often, dark suspicions among many foreign observers.So one wonders: Is China presenting a new model of development to a world that could use one, or is One Belt, One Road itself the new colonialism?China\u2019s pretty talk of development and cooperation sounds like cover for a strategic advance, and of course it is that. But besides investing financially in infrastructure, One Belt, One Road also invests China\u2019s prestige in a globalist message that sounds all the right notes \u2014 peace, multicultural tolerance, mutual prosperity \u2014 and that rhetoric sets standards by which to hold China accountable.The Chinese government has rolled out the initiative with fanfare, casting it as President Xi Jinping\u2019s signature foreign policy project, and outsiders have in turn treated it as a monolithic venture. In fact, it is made up of many elements: cultural, diplomatic, developmental, as well as commercial and strategic. You can\u2019t give thumbs up or thumbs down to the whole package, because One Belt, One Road is nothing less than the rebranding of China\u2019s entire foreign policy, in all its complexity.For example, complementing the initiative\u2019s harder edge is a cultural component that observers often overlook: numerous school programs, cultural exchanges, art shows, museum exhibitions, musical performances, dance concerts, archaeological explorations and Unesco collaborations. These extensions of Chinese soft power play on the idea of the Silk Road, that mythical ancient golden age of untrammeled trade and cross-cultural synergy. In fact, there never really was a single Silk Road (nor several roads) linking East to West that you could draw on a map; rather, trade fanned out in networks across the breadth of Eurasia \u2014 as it did elsewhere. And machinations of empires always played a larger role in promoting exchanges than did intrepid private traders.But the idea of the Silk Road (unlike, say, the idea of the \u201cGreat Game\u201d) is nonthreatening, a sepia-tinged vision of camels and bazaars full of exotic luxuries. China has cleverly pinned its foreign policy to a pleasant historical myth that unites the peoples of Afro-Eurasia. It is a fable that can literally be told as a bedtime story about \u201csharing\u201d and giraffes.To the cynical, this is just so much propagandistic treacle. But China is also now loudly speaking the language of international development; it has announced that it is stepping up to be a global good citizen concerned about the economic well-being of its neighbors. Sincere or not, the message is at least supranational, in stark contrast to the protectionism and xenophobia displayed by President Trump and emerging nationalistic ideologies in Europe, India and elsewhere.Is a new approach, by a new player, such a bad thing? The economic orthodoxy long imposed by the United States-dominated World Bank and International Monetary Fund on developing countries in crisis \u2014 a reform package known as the Washington Consensus \u2014 has enjoyed a mixed record at best. And in Africa, for example, Western investment remains small, given the continent\u2019s size, population and needs.China, for its part, has embraced Africa. Although some of its projects have coddled corrupt dictators in order to haul off African raw materials, others have delivered concrete economic benefits locally. Moreover, some Chinese government and corporate investors have proved willing to take risks that Western corporations and countries have consistently avoided.Some of China\u2019s Silk Road projects will be boondoggles. Some will produce economic benefits. Some may be effective at reducing poverty. Some will promote Chinese state and corporate interests. One Belt, One Road, with its many faces, is neither a nefarious plot for world domination nor the answer to all the world\u2019s problems. We should evaluate its projects individually and hold them to the goal that the broader initiative has set for itself: to build a better future modeled on an idealized past.James A.

{"Headline": "When the President Takes On Amazon, Nobody Wins", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIf President Trump resumes his fight with Amazon, the ultimate loser is clear: It will be the American economy.Economists are a disputatious bunch, but across the political spectrum we agree on one thing: Politicians shouldn\u2019t be attacking specific companies based on their own whims or preferences.But putting the factual basis of these claims aside, there is another problem that may even be even bigger: The president was unnecessarily specific about a single company.Some economic interventions necessarily pinpoint particular companies. When talking about the major credit rating agencies, for example, it\u2019s hard to avoid talking about the big three: Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch.That isn\u2019t the case here. The issues the president raised about Amazon actually apply to large parts of the economy. For example, every retail transaction on the web raises the thorny issue of how to handle local sales taxes. But Amazon itself collects taxes for 45 states and the District of Columbia.Political interference in markets is always dangerous. But when it is narrowly targeted, it is particularly so.First, such interference creates unclear rules.Any sports fan knows the frustration of watching a game with arbitrary and unpredictable refereeing. Consistency is equally important for a well-functioning economy.Capricious refereeing complicates managerial decision-making. It distorts cost-benefit calculations, delaying decisions and wasting resources.Second, political targeting opens the door to various forms of corruption. When politicians play an outsized role in the economy, companies must curry their favor.This is obvious in many countries, particularly poor ones, where politicians interfere heavily in local economies by deciding such matters as which companies will get a license to operate and which will be audited by the tax authority. Managers must focus as much effort on catering to politicians as to customers, not just through campaign contributions but through bribes, both subtle and overt.These incentives don\u2019t merely warp the economy. They alter the political sphere, too.Companies have many tools at their disposal when they seek to influence politicians. A few weeks before an election, a company seeking to help a candidate can announce a major plant opening. Or it can cut prices in response to a politician\u2019s entreaties.Professor Fisman found that when Suharto\u2019s health was reported to be poor, the shares of companies most closely linked to the ultimate leader declined the most sharply. As Professor Fisman put it, \u201cA large percentage of a well connected firm\u2019s value may be derived from political connections.\u201dStock prices of such companies did not budge when his political fortunes rose \u2014 as when he was first chosen as the vice-presidential candidate \u2014 or when his health was impaired while in office.The heartening truth is that until now, the United States has, by and large, done a good job of insulating the economy from political interference. Should that insulation wear down, though, we will find ourselves in a troubling world. That\u2019s why President Trump\u2019s campaign against Amazon is worthy of continuing scrutiny.Any possible interference with freedom of the press endangers the economy \u2014 and much more. An efficient economy \u2014 and a democracy \u2014 requires uniform application of the law.We live in partisan times. But we all can root for the rule of law. It\u2019s not a particularly exciting cause, but it is in dire need of supporters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Currency Plunges, Potentially Threatening Erdogan\u2019s Re-election Bid", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey called early elections for June 24, more than a year earlier than scheduled, in part to get ahead of tremors in the economy. But on Wednesday they caught up with him as the country\u2019s currency, the lira, took a steep dive, presenting a potential danger to his re-election campaign.The lira fell close to five to the dollar on Wednesday, a 20 percent drop this year, according to Reuters, before the Central Bank stepped in to buck it up with a sharp increase in one of its primary lending rates, to 16 percent from 13.5 percent.The turbulence was not only a sign of growing investor alarm at the state of Turkey\u2019s economy. The drop in the lira has also left some of Turkey\u2019s biggest businesses embattled, while eating deeply into the living standards of ordinary Turks, meaning voters.In that regard, it could not come at a worse time for Mr. Erdogan, who officially opens an election campaign on Thursday that is expected to emphasize his economic achievements and impressive year-on-year growth over 15 years at the head of government.Despite that record, business leaders and financial markets have shown increasing concerns over Mr. Erdogan\u2019s management of the economy as he has accumulated power, with the possibility that the June election for a newly enhanced presidency will give him still more swagger.Financial analysts and political opponents say the latest plunge in the lira was set off by Mr. Erdogan himself, and by his overriding of his financial officials and the Central Bank, in particular his rejection of their calls to raise interest rates.Turkey\u2019s inflation rate is over 10 percent, but out of a desire to maintain high growth rates, Mr. Erdogan has opposed raising interest rates, which financial analysts say is needed to ease the pressure on the currency.The president set off the latest decline of the lira with comments in an interview with Bloomberg News on Monday, when he revealed his intention to take even greater control of the Central Bank if he wins the election to a new, more powerful presidency.\u201cFrom the moment we move to a presidential governing system, our effectiveness there will be very different,\u201d he said, referring to the Central Bank. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this so we can be held accountable for the responsibility we\u2019ve taken.\u201d\u201cWhen the people fall into difficulties because of monetary policies, who are they going to hold accountable?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll hold the president accountable. Since they\u2019ll ask the president about it, we have to give off the image of a president who\u2019s influential on monetary policies.\u201dOpponents of Mr. Erdogan warn that an economic crisis is nearing.\u201cThis rhetoric is extremely dangerous and will put Turkey in a dead-end street,\u201d Durmus Yilmaz, a former governor of the Central Bank who is running for Parliament, said of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s remarks in London. \u201cTurkey did try the exact same thing in 1994 and that\u2019s how we ended up with a crisis.\u201dThe president\u2019s officials would have none of it. His deputy prime minister, Bekir Bozdag, cast the lira\u2019s fall as a foreign plot to damage Mr. Erdogan.\u201cThose who believe that by manipulating the dollar they will lead to results that will harm the nation and their pockets and change the election result, are mistaken,\u201d he told the semiofficial Anadolu news agency.Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, speaking to the news channel NTV, blamed speculators.\u201cWe have instruments that the necessary steps can be taken about monetary policies and the value of the lira,\u201d he said. \u201cThe relevant institutions have very strong instruments.\u201dOne reason for the pressure on the lira is that the United States Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates and drawing international capital away from emerging markets like Turkey. It can be remedied if Turkey raises interest rates, analysts say.But Mr. Erdogan may have overreached. After 15 years of growth and easy credit, his country has accumulated a great deal of foreign credit that it is now struggling to finance, analysts say.Turkey\u2019s corporate foreign currency debt has ballooned since 2009, and 80 percent of it is held by Turkish banks. With the slide of the lira, they are struggling to service the debt and are no longer extending credit to Turkish businesses.Two of Turkey\u2019s biggest companies have recently entered discussions to refinance their debt. Yildiz Holding, a global confectionary and cookie business owned by Turkey\u2019s richest man, entered negotiations to refinance $7 billion of debt in March.The credit crunch is affecting small and medium-size businesses, too, said Atilla Yesilada, an investment analyst. \u201cJust look at the empty shops in the main streets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been the last three years, the currency depreciation continues and people are suffering.\u201dEconomists and financial analysts say the rot lies within Turkey, where crony capitalism and corruption have grown as the rule of law and an independent judiciary, essential bulwarks for foreign investors, have been eroded under Mr. Erdogan.Foreign direct investment has declined to a third of previous levels. Credit rating agencies have downgraded Turkey\u2019s sovereign debt rating in recent months, citing a lack of economic structural reform and a removal of checks and balances by Mr. Erdogan.At a campaign rally, Muharrem Ince, a physics professor who is the leading presidential challenger, called on Mr. Erdogan to cease interfering with the Central Bank and to stop listening to advisers who were feeding him false information.He advised the president to reassure the nation that public fiscal discipline was a priority, rather than funding his mega-construction projects, and to quash rumors of currency controls.\u201cThe economy is sinking,\u201d Mr. Ince told supporters. \u201cWe are about to crash into a wall. My beloved nation, the truck is about to crash into the wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Takes a Risk: Old Iraqi Enemies Are Now Allies", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSUL, Iraq \u2014 Iraq\u2019s interior minister, Qassim al-Araji, has a troubled history with the United States. He was detained twice by the Americans at the notorious Camp Bucca prison during the Iraq war and held for 23 months, accused of smuggling Iranian-made bombs that had become effective killers of American troops.As a former commander of an Iranian-backed militia, his loyalties are open to question. But when he met with the United States ambassador last year, he had a surprising message: He and other former Shiite militants wanted the Americans to stay. Iraq needed their help, he said, to stabilize the country and combat the threat of the Islamic State.He even jokingly praised the superiority of American jails over Iraqi ones. \u201cYou have some things to teach us,\u201d he told the American ambassador, Douglas A. Silliman.The request represented a monumental switch for some of Iraq\u2019s most influential Shiite leaders, and an opportunity for the United States to achieve its elusive security goals in the region, albeit with some unlikely partners.But the evolving alliance means that the United States military is taking a risk: training, sharing intelligence and planning missions with former members of Iranian-backed militias that once fought and killed Americans.Several former militia commanders have risen to high-level political positions. Now, a coalition of them is expected to be among the biggest winners in parliamentary elections this Saturday, giving them even more prominent roles in the new government and possibly determining the future of the American presence in Iraq.\u201cThis is a time when Iraqi patriots can build their nation,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Paul E. Funk II, the commander of the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \u201cThere is an opportunity here. We will do all we can to give them all the help they need and want.\u201dLast year, Congress appropriated $3.6 billion to train and equip Iraqi security forces, with a priority on units under Mr. Araji\u2019s Interior Ministry. They include border guards monitoring the long Syrian-Iraqi frontier, a place where American and Iraqi commanders fear that Islamic State remnants could regroup, and which Iran sees as part of its corridor to move fighters and weapons to Syria and Lebanon. The funds also equip the Iraqi SWAT teams responsible for arresting and detaining terrorism suspects, and train a national police force in charge of daily security.It was the Islamic State\u2019s conquest of a third of Iraqi territory in 2014 that first brought together once-rival Iraqi militias and security forces with an American-led military coalition in a united effort to defeat a common enemy. The United States wanted to prevent the Islamic State from building a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, and the Shiite militias saw the Sunni extremist group as a sectarian threat.After Iraq\u2019s regular armed forces crumbled in the face of the Islamic State blitz, a coalition of Iranian-financed Shiite militias took up front-line positions against the extremists. The militias never worked directly with the Americans, but a joint command helped coordinate their efforts to defeat the Islamic State.Now, some of the most influential militia leaders are working directly with the Americans and pressing for a continued American military presence.\u201cWe all made mistakes in the past, the Americans, as well as us,\u201d said Hadi al-Ameri, the leader of the Badr Organization, the largest of the Shiite militias that helped battle the Islamic State and the leader of the electoral alliance of former militia members, known as Fatah. \u201cNow, we need their help. We can\u2019t let our country become a playground for other powers and their agendas.\u201dThe vote on Saturday could determine whether the United States military stays in Iraq or leaves.Most polls show that the front-runners are the current prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, Washington\u2019s closest ally in Iraq, and Mr. Ameri, whose electoral list includes the interior minister, Mr. Araji. If either of them lead the new government, the military partnership is likely to continue.However, Iraqi political analysts say that the previous prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who demanded the withdrawal of American forces in 2011 and still has close ties to Iran, could play spoiler. They believe he has a good chance of being included in a new coalition government, giving Iran a way to foil America\u2019s growing influence.So far this year, the American-led coalition has trained six brigades of Iraqi border units, about a quarter of the estimated force required to seal the largely barren, desert frontier with Syria, as well as six brigades of federal police and a special Baghdad-based police force.The tight-knit nature of the partnership is already on display in several of Iraq\u2019s security hot spots.On the streets of Mosul, once the largest city in the Islamic State\u2019s so-called caliphate, Iraqi counterterrorism police receive intelligence from American Special Forces deployed at the regional Iraqi command headquarters there and allow the Americans access to Islamic State detainees. On the dusty Syrian border, American and coalition forces provide air surveillance for the border guards newly equipped with American communications and tactical gear. And on Iraqi bases outside Baghdad, coalition teams from Italy, Canada, Denmark and France are training law enforcement units.But the partnership means that the United States is working with some Iraqis who previously received financing, training and arms from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, considered a terrorist organization by the American government.Critics say it\u2019s giving the fox the keys to the henhouse.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Michael Pregent, a retired military intelligence officer in Iraq who now works at the Hudson Institute, a policy research organization. \u201cAmericans are sitting with a lieutenant of Qassim Suleimani,\u201d the leader of the Revolutionary Guards, \u201cgiving him direct access to American intelligence, weapons and equipment.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Ameri, the leader of the political alliance of former militia members and a possible next Iraqi prime minister, has a long history of ties to Iran. When Gen. David H. Petraeus commanded American forces in Iraq during the so-called surge of 2007, and Iranian-armed Shiite militias were killing American forces, he used Mr. Ameri as a liaison to Mr. Suleimani.But many current and retired American officials who served in Iraq acknowledge that while there is a risk, you work with the partners you have.\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to do business or build relationships in Vietnam without dealing with the former Viet Cong,\u201d said Douglas Ollivant, a retired Army officer and National Security Council adviser for Iraq under two White House administrations. \u201cAt some point, America needs to work with men who previously were on the other side.\u201dMr. Ameri led the coalition of Iranian-backed militias, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, to defend against the Islamic State\u2019s advances toward Baghdad in 2014. Those militias were credited with helping to turn the tide against the extremist group, but some units were also accused of grave human rights abuses, including illegal detentions and extrajudicial killings.Several other members of Mr. Ameri\u2019s electoral coalition lead prominent Iranian-backed factions that have antagonistic histories with the Americans.But a regional campaign manager for Mr. Khazali\u2019s group, Habib al-Hillawi, publicly apologized for the American deaths this month. \u201cTimes are different now,\u201d he said on the sideline of a campaign rally.And in a recent interview in his office in Baghdad, Mr. Khazali said that he supported a continued \u2014 albeit limited \u2014 American presence in Iraq. \u201cLimited and specific training missions would be acceptable to us, as well as an American force proportional to that mission,\u201d he said.Mr. Araji, the interior minister, says his views have evolved to match Iraq\u2019s political realities.A secret cable from the United States Embassy in Baghdad in 2007 said the Americans had \u201cgood information\u201d that he had been involved in smuggling the Iranian-engineered bombs to Iraq, leading to his imprisonment.But Mr. Araji denied any wrongdoing, and was ultimately released without charges. In an interview, he said that American intelligence officials had concluded he had been \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201dWhen he took over the Interior Ministry \u2014 which controls the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies, elite counterterrorism forces, border guards, civil defense forces and regular traffic cops \u2014 he and like-minded colleagues in the army and government sought to broker new relationships with the coalition.That agency, too, has a deeply checkered past. While Washington had previously allocated billions of dollars to help Iraq\u2019s domestic law enforcement, the Interior Ministry had been considered too dysfunctional, sectarian and corrupt to build durable partnerships.A decade ago, rival Shiite militias controlled the Baghdad police, a division of the Interior Ministry, and they were often implicated in kidnappings, killings and even ethnic cleansing of Sunni neighborhoods.Mr. Araji set a new tone when, as minister, he tried to clean house. He started internal investigations and ousted about 30,000 people who had broken the law, abused their power or \u201cdidn\u2019t display the type of behavior conducive to a professional security force,\u201d he said.He also promoted several long-serving Sunnis to key positions in an effort to integrate the mostly Shiite ministry.\u201cThere have been steps to stamp out favoritism,\u201d said Gen. Ammar al-Kubaisi, a Sunni who heads the Border Guards 2nd Division, responsible for the Syrian frontier. \u201cWe still need to work on this, but sectarianism is going away.\u201d\u201cMy most important goal is to bring security to Iraq,\u201d he said during an angry debate in Parliament. \u201cIraq is in need of the friendship of the Americans.\u201dAs a safeguard, Iraqi officials have accepted a key requirement for the coalition training: American vetting of each training candidate. Military commanders say this security check, which can take up to two months, is meant to root out former Shiite militia members involved in violence against American forces, or suspected of human rights abuses and other crimes.Mr. Araji said he did not consider this vetting an infringement on Iraq\u2019s sovereignty, but part of the process of building a stronger nation. People rejected for training know it is a black mark that will sideline their careers, he said in an interview this month at his Baghdad office. \u201cWe have zero tolerance for people who have the wrong attitudes.\u201dMr. Ameri and Mr. Araji have cooperated with Iraqi army commanders and Prime Minister Abadi to formulate a multiyear training schedule with the international coalition.So far, training has been approved through 2018. American and Iraqi commanders agree that it is vital for the missions to continue through at least 2020, but further plans have been frozen until after the election.American commanders, worrying that anti-American political factions could make the coalition training a wedge issue, halted news media access to training operations during Iraq\u2019s election campaign.Last week, they announced the closing of America\u2019s ground forces command in Iraq, which had been active since 2014. This move is expected to decrease the number of American troops deployed here, currently about 5,000, which was already a fraction of the 170,000 troops serving in Iraq at the peak of American involvement in 2007.Whoever leads the new Iraqi government will have to tackle the thorny question of what to do with the now-institutionalized militias, either by trying to integrate them into the army\u2019s command structure or leaving them quasi-independent and a potential tool of Iran\u2019s.Mr. Ameri, as a political and military leader with credibility in the pro-American and pro-Iranian camps, may be best positioned to bring the militias into the fold of the American-trained domestic security forces.If he wants to.Mr. Ameri, who is introduced at his campaign events as the \u201csheikh of the holy warriors,\u201d is vague on the question. In a recent interview, he said only that he believed the state should control the monopoly of force.For now, the Americans are gambling on his sense of Iraqi patriotism, says Michael Knights, the senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and expert on Iraqi security forces.\u201cWho is Hadi al-Ameri?\u201d Mr. Knights said. \u201cThat is the fundamental question. Is he more loyal to Iran than Iraq? We will only know it when it\u2019s too late.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the middle initial of the American ambassador. He is Douglas A. Silliman, not Douglas J.Falih Hassan contributed reporting from Baghdad.Advertisement"}

Regulators require efficient and accurate controls so that banks can assess their financial strength and the risks they face, especially through difficult times in the economy.Subpar controls could hamper Deutsche Bank\u2019s ability to pass two crucial upcoming tests in the U.S.The first is the Fed\u2019s stress tests, which are used to determine whether large banks can survive a severe economic downturn. Until now, only Deutsche Bank\u2019s small U.S. trust bank had gone through the tests \u2013 and even that failed. Commenting on the 2016 test, the Fed slammed the subsidiary for continuing \u201cto have material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine its capital planning process.\u201d The entity did not get tested last year because of a rule change.But this year, effectively all of Deutsche Bank\u2019s operations in the U.S., including its substantial Wall Street operations, will be subject to a public stress test (the operations went through a confidential test last year.) If the issues with controls that afflicted the small trust bank exist in the trading business, Deutsche Bank could fall short on the test.Banks can also effectively fail the stress tests if they cannot make it through the hypothetical turbulence with adequate equity capital. Regulatory filings show that, at the end of last year, Deutsche\u2019s U.S. operations had $7.3 billion of equity supporting $148 billion of assets. The stress tests, scheduled for next month, will reveal if that equity is sufficient for the storm.But Deutsche Bank, along with several other large foreign banks, faces another tough challenge. By July 1, the banks have to file a detailed plan with regulators that lays out how they would wind themselves down in a bankruptcy-type scenario. Regulators require such plans because they want to be able to shut down troubled banks while minimizing the chaos and confusion that characterized the 2008 financial crisis. These plans can be difficult to get right, particularly for banks with shoddy controls.- Peter EavisMasayoshi Son\u2019s grand plan for SoftBank\u2019s $100 billion Vision Fund was audacious: Own pieces of all the companies in a wide range of sectors \u2014 transportation, food, work, medicine and finance \u2014 that may underpin the global shifts brought on by artificial intelligence.So far many of the biggest wagers have been on transportation.The fund announced plans Thursday to invest $2.25 billion in General Motors\u2019 driverless-technology division to help the automaker ramp up a ride-hailing service and other new businesses.The investment in G.M. Cruise is just the latest in the companies and technologies rapidly transforming the auto industry.Before GM Cruise, its last investment directly into an autonomous driving start-up was last year, when it co-led a financing round for Nauto, a maker of sensors for autonomous vehicles.So far ride-hailing has been a major focus. SoftBank and the Vision Fund have poured money into Uber and its rivals, like Didi Chuxing in China and Ola in India. SoftBank has also invested in Brazil\u2019s 99 and Singapore\u2019s Grab.The investments go beyond just ride-hailing start-ups. SoftBank also bought ARM and invested in Nvidia, semiconductor companies that are making chips for self-driving cars.There have also been investments in Auto1, a German car dealer service, and Mapbox, a mapping start-up.Michael Ronen, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said in a statement that he was \u201cvery impressed by the advances made by the Cruise and G.M. teams.\u201d He also said, \u201cthe G.M. Cruise approach of a fully integrated hardware and software stack gives it a unique competitive advantage.\u201dIt also appears to be second in the state in terms of performance, based on the number of times a driver had to take over from the robotic vehicle. G.M. Cruise drivers had to take control once every 1,300 miles, while Waymo\u2019s drivers intervened just once every 5,600.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe tariffs are meant to make good on President Trump\u2019s longstanding promises to protect American industry. But they have prompted a fierce response from allies, who have already readied lists of American products they plan to tax in return, as well as American businesses that use steel and aluminum, which are seeing their costs rise as a result of the measure.Opposition from an unusual sourceThe tariffs drew the opposition of the Koch brothers\u2019 political network, one of the most powerful in conservative politics. Though known for its advocacy of conservative causes, the Kochs\u2019 approach has generally tended toward more libertarian, deregulatory ends \u2014 and tariffs run counter to that.Trade wars hurt everyone. They trigger retaliatory tariffs from our trade partners and that raises prices on American families who need affordable access to household goods. We urge the Trump administration to abandon these tariffsIt wasn\u2019t just President Trump\u2019s plan to slap tariffs on metal imported from the E.U., Canada and Mexico. While the White House has considered putting tariffs on imported cars, a report from a German business magazine suggested that the president wanted to go much further.Whether the report is accurate, shares in Daimler and Volkswagen fell after the magazine article went up on Thursday, declining about 2 percent.Prosecutors said Woojae \u201cSteve\u201d Jung \u2014 who is Korean and attended Seoul National University before moving to the United States, according to his LinkedIn profile \u2014 made the trades in a brokerage account opened at Interactive Brokers in the name of a friend in South Korea.Prosecutors said he earned illicit profits of just over $130,000.Mr. Jung specialized in technology, media and telecommunications deals, according to his LinkedIn profile.

While the company repaid some of its debt due next year, it still has more debt coming due in October of 2019. And overall it still has $3.8 billion in long-term debt that it must settle at some point.But such efforts seem unlikely to counter its debts, and Thursday\u2019s results are unlikely to silence the whisperings of more financial troubles ahead.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIt\u2019s part of a slow but steady removal of Obama-era limits placed on Wall Street \u2014 and a move that bank C.E.O.s like JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon had long pushed for. But critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren have warned that it could reintroduce a Wild West mentality on Wall Street, and potentially leave taxpayers on the hook if banks make poor decisions.Paul Volcker himself has supported simplifying the rule \u2014 so long as the basic principle of no public bailouts for banks\u2019 risky trades remained.Buffett would have effectively lent Uber his sterling reputation, along with some capital, in exchange for cushy deal terms. Under the proposed agreement, Berkshire Hathaway would have provided a convertible loan to Uber that would have protected Buffett\u2019s investment should Uber hit financial straits, while providing significant upside if Uber continued to grow in value.Uber\u2019s C.E.O., Dara Khosrowshahi, reportedly suggested a smaller $2 billion deal, but the two sides couldn\u2019t agree on terms.European officials have said they plan to swiftly impose levies against as much as \u20ac2.8 billion ($3.3 billion) in U.S. exports under a rule at the World Trade Organization that allows members to punish a country immediately for inappropriately seeking a \u201csafeguard\u201d against their exports.Elsewhere in tradeIt was Chesky who pulled the plug, these people say. He worried that Airbnb would lose control of its carefully curated brand, they say. One investor likened Chesky\u2019s attitude to someone who couldn\u2019t commit to a long-term relationship.Investors are still unhappy about the move, as it means Airbnb continues to burn cash in China.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cardinal George Pell\u2019s Sexual Abuse Trials May Be Held in Secret", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 An Australian court is to decide on Wednesday whether two planned trials for Cardinal George Pell, the senior Vatican official accused of sexual abuse, will be conducted in secret with the public barred from knowing what took place until the proceedings are over.On Friday, prosecutors in the state of Victoria applied for a \u201csuper injunction\u201d against news coverage of the separate trials. Legal experts described the application as an extreme move aimed at keeping juries in both cases from learning anything that might cause bias.But a trial held behind closed doors would also limit accountability for the judge, jury and lawyers in the case.\u201cThe proposed order is a blanket ban and is the most extreme form of order that can be made,\u201d said Jason Bosland, deputy director of the Centre for Media and Communications Law at Melbourne Law School.The injunction, if approved, would apply to \u201call states and territories of Australia and on any website or other electronic or broadcast format accessible within Australia.\u201dHe was a major figure in the Vatican for years, and served as Pope Francis\u2019 finance chief, the third-highest-ranking official in the church.The charges landed a few weeks later. He returned to Australia and his home state of Victoria, where he served as a priest and bishop, and has vigorously denied the charges against him.Legal experts said public attention has become a weapon wielded by lawyers on both sides, with potential risks to each.The prosecutors\u2019 request to bar news coverage appears aimed at heading off a possible attempt by Cardinal Pell\u2019s lawyers to argue that unprecedented publicity would make it impossible for fair trials to occur \u2014 especially the second trial, which in theory, could be prejudiced by reporting on the first.But Cardinal Pell\u2019s profile may be even higher, given the decades in which he has had a prominent public role in Australia, and it is not clear whether the judge will side with privacy or transparency.Super injunctions have become increasingly common in Victoria courts, and the scope of the requested ban is as wide as possible, with the potential to shroud even innocuous information.News outlets, for example, may not even be able to report when or where the trial is happening, or even why that information cannot be shared.\u201cIt prevents publication of all details to do with the case, including the fact that proceedings are on foot and, indeed, that a suppression order has been issued,\u201d Professor Bosland said. \u201cYou can\u2019t even publish the judge\u2019s name.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guatemala Corruption Panel Has New Foe: U.S. Senator Marco Rubio", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe commission of international prosecutors has charged Mr. Morales\u2019s brother and his son in a fraud case and it continues to investigate him on campaign finance violations.Last August, he ordered its director, Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, a Colombian, out of the country, but he was overruled by Guatemala\u2019s highest court. Mr. Morales has met with the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, to lay out his complaints against Mr. Vel\u00e1squez and limit the commission\u2019s mandate \u2014 all to no avail.But now he appears to have an ally: Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who said this weekend he has placed a hold on $6 million in funding to the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala.If funding for the commission is canceled or even delayed, it would deal a severe blow to Guatemala\u2019s anti-corruption efforts, Latin America analysts warn. The commission\u2019s work is part of a wave of anti-corruption investigations that have been ensnaring elites across the region.The commission has helped Guatemala\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office pursue vigorous anti-corruption prosecutions. Under Mr. Vel\u00e1squez, it uncovered a customs fraud scheme that prosecutors say was led by President Otto P\u00e9rez Molina, who resigned shortly before the end of his term in 2015 and has been in jail ever since.\u201cI am concerned that Cicig, a commission mostly funded by the United States, has been manipulated and used by radical elements and Russia\u2019s campaign against the Bitkov family in Guatemala,\u201d Mr. Rubio said in a statement, using the Spanish initials for the commission.\u201cCicig was established by the United Nations and Guatemala to prosecute official corruption and human rights abuses, not to participate in it,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, adding that the hold on the funding would stay in place \u201cuntil we have clear answers on its role in the mistreatment of the Bitkov family.\u201dMr. Rubio did not specify what action was needed to lift the hold.Last week, Guatemala\u2019s highest court threw out the family\u2019s convictions and sent their case back to the trial judge, with orders to reconsider their case. They could be released from jail this week.The United Nations commission \u201chas been doing terrific work on a whole host of issues with the attorney general of Guatemala,\u201d said Eric Olson, a Guatemala expert with the Wilson Center in Washington. \u201cIt would be unfortunate if this led to some irreparable harm to those efforts.\u201dSenator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who has supported the commission, warned against using the Bitkov case to attack it. \u201cIf Mr. Velasquez is removed for specious reasons or Cicig is shut down, it would set back the cause of justice and seriously jeopardize U.S. assistance to the government of Guatemala,\u201d he said on Sunday.The family\u2019s plight caught the attention of William F. Browder, a prominent investor who has led an international campaign to punish Russian human rights abusers. After a Guatemalan court sentenced Igor Bitkov to 19 years in jail, and his wife, Irina, and daughter, Anastasia, to 14 years for using false documents, Mr. Browder began working to free the family. He made Mr. Vel\u00e1squez and the commission one of his targets.Mr. Browder argues that the Russian government, through the state-owned bank VTB, pushed for the commission and the Guatemalan attorney general\u2019s office to wrap the Bitkovs into a longstanding investigation into a scheme at the government\u2019s passport office to sell fake passports.\u201cAll of these people who are screaming about the sacred cow of the Cicig are doing an injustice to the Cicig because the Cicig is clearly involved with the Russians in a vendetta against the Bitkov family,\u201d Mr. Browder said in a telephone interview on Sunday.Cicig said it had identified the Bitkovs\u2019 purchase of the passports independently.Despite widespread support for the commission in Congress and among members of the Trump administration, Mr. Browder\u2019s zeal for the Bitkovs\u2019 case struck a chord with Mr. Rubio.Three Republican lawmakers \u2014 Senators Roger F. Wicker of Mississippi and Mike Lee of Utah, and Representative Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey \u2014 joined Mr. Rubio in writing to the chairmen of the House and Senate committees on foreign relations to suspend funding to the commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mangano Corruption Trial Ends in Mistrial on Long Island", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. \u2014 A federal judge declared a mistrial on Thursday in the corruption case of Edward P. Mangano, the former Nassau County executive, who had been accused of accepting bribes from a restaurateur in return for help in obtaining government contracts and millions of dollars in loans.The trial came to an end with little explanation after the foreman told the court in a note that he could not continue.\u201cI can no longer carry out my duties as a juror,\u201d wrote the foreman, Marc Tambassopoulos. \u201cI wish to be excused.\u201dThe judge, Joan Azrack, of Federal District Court here, said that she would soon set a new trial date.\u201cIt is, you know, truly a sentence in and of itself, a trial\u201d Mr. Mangano said outside the courthouse, adding, \u201cIt is emotionally draining.\u201dFederal prosecutors had argued that the restaurateur, Harendra Singh, provided Mr. Mangano, 56, with a stream of gifts, including expensive chairs, a luxury watch and subsidized vacations.Mr. Singh, who had pleaded guilty to bribery and was a witness for the government, also gave Mr. Mangano\u2019s wife, Linda Mangano, 54, what prosecutors called a \u201cno-show\u201d job.Last week, the jury acquitted the former Oyster Bay supervisor, John Venditto, who had been on trial along with the Manganos, on all the charges he had faced. They continued weighing the evidence against Mr. Mangano, who was the county\u2019s top elected official for eight years.One juror was replaced by an alternate on Tuesday after telling the judge she was ill. A defense lawyer said the departing juror had described a \u201ctoxic environment\u201d during deliberations.He said he had been unwilling to convict Ms. Mangano of making false statements because the government had not produced quotes. And, he added, he believed that Mr. Singh had provided gifts to Mr. Mangano purely out of friendship.\u201cTo me it\u2019s just a gift, a birthday gift,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you going to say that\u2019s a bribe?\u201dMr. Mangano, a Republican, once wielded considerable power. He surprised many by narrowly defeating the incumbent executive, Thomas Suozzi, in 2009 while running on the Republican and Tax Revolt Party lines. Four years later, he was re-elected.The mistrial, coming after a 10-week trial that included 60 witnesses, is a blow to prosecutors and the latest indication of how a United States Supreme Court ruling in 2016 may be affecting public corruption cases. That year the court overturned the bribery conviction of former Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, who prosecutors said had used his office to help a businessman who gave him and his wife luxury products, loans and vacations.The decision narrowed the basis for such prosecutions, ruling that only formal government actions count and that routine political courtesies, like arranging meetings, do not.But prosecutors in the Mangano trial outlined activities that appeared to go far beyond the routine. Central to it all was Mr. Singh, who owned about 30 businesses, including two at properties owned by Oyster Bay: a concession stand at Tobay Beach and a restaurant and catering facility called the Woodlands.Beginning in 2010, prosecutors said, Mr. Singh sought loans that eventually totaled more than $20 million. To obtain financing, they said, he turned to Mr. Mangano, who convinced Mr. Venditto to arrange for Oyster Bay to back the loans. A lawyer for the town had warned that a guarantee would violate New York State law, so lawyers from Mr. Mangano\u2019s former firm, Rivkin Radler, were hired to find a way to make the arrangement work, prosecutors said.In addition to helping Mr. Singh obtain loans, prosecutors said, Mr. Mangano helped him receive contracts to provide bread to the county jail and food for emergency workers after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.Prosecutors said that in return, Mr. Singh gave Mr. Mangano a massage chair and arranged for a $7,300 Panerai Luminor watch to be delivered to Mr. Mangano\u2019s home as a birthday present for his son. Mr. Mangano and his family also took trips to Turks and Caicos and Florida\u2019s Amelia Island that prosecutors said were mostly paid for by the restaurateur.Mr. Singh, 58, was a familiar figure around Oyster Bay. He drove a Maserati and used an email address that identified him as \u201cthe restaurant mogul.\u201d He also donated to a range of politicians.Among them was Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City. At one point during the trial, Mr. Singh testified that he steered tens of thousands of dollars to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaigns to gain better lease terms for a restaurant on city property. Mr. de Blasio has denied any wrongdoing, and federal investigators brought no charges against the mayor, saying he had not received any personal gifts from the restaurateur.During closing arguments, lawyers for Mr. and Ms. Mangano repeatedly attacked Mr. Singh, calling him a habitual liar and comparing the prosecution to one that might take place in North Korea. Prosecutors responded by calling the defense assertions \u201cclassic misdirection.\u201dJurors indicated early on that they were at loggerheads. They sent notes on their second and third days of deliberation saying they could not agree on \u201ccertain items.\u201dThe judge instructed the jury to begin deliberations anew after replacing Juror No. 5 with an alternate, but they were still unable to reach a consensus.Advertisement"}

According to Christie\u2019s, it went to an undisclosed bidder on the phone who had guaranteed a set price for the sculpture before the sale and who earned roughly $190,000 in financing fees as part of the transaction.Christie\u2019s had estimated the work would sell for at least $70 million.\u201cIt\u2019s an icon, and people chase icons,\u201d said Abigail Asher, a partner at Guggenheim Asher, an art advisory firm based in New York, commenting on the Brancusi. \u201cThe dramatic contrast between the polished sculpture and its carved base was breathtaking. And it was rarer than rare.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his greatest sculpture, but it was a fair price,\u201d Offer Waterman, a dealer based in London, said. \u201cI thought it would make more.\u201dCunard was one of the indelible personalities of the Parisian avant-garde. A style pioneer who numbered Ezra Pound, Samuel Beckett, Tristan Tzara and the jazz pianist Henry Crowder among her many lovers, she threw her energies into partying, publishing, writing and political activism for causes such as the Spanish Civil War and combating racial discrimination.Though Cunard knew Brancusi socially, she never posed for the artist. It was only years later that she became aware of the sculpture, initially mistaking it for a torso, rather than a head. \u201cThere was one in wood, the other in bronze, both utterly unlike what I take to be my \u2018line,\u2019 but exquisite things,\u201d Cunard said, according to the Christie\u2019s catalog.The Malevich that sold Tuesday was won on a bid within the room by Brett Gorvy, the dealer and former Christie\u2019s executive, on behalf of an undisclosed buyer.Back in 2008, in a jittery market, this much-exhibited Russian masterwork sold at Sotheby\u2019s to its guarantor for $60 million, then an auction high for Malevich.\u201cIt made a record then, and it made a record now,\u201d said Mr. Waterman. \u201cThe owner hung onto it for 10 years and got a decent return.\u201dChristie\u2019s auction raised $415.9 million from 37 lots with just four left unsold. Despite the withdrawal of two high-value works belonging to Mr. Wynn, this was an improvement on the $289.2 million achieved last May from a low-energy auction of 55 Impressionist and modern works.Advertisement"}

Mr. Giuliani, back on the network less than 12 hours after his appearance on \u201cHannity\u201d aired, mused that Mr. Cohen\u2019s efforts to quiet Ms. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, had helped Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid.\u201cImagine if that came out on Oct. 15, 2016, in the middle of the, you know, last debate with Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.Fair point \u2014 but problematic for Mr. Trump, whose legal team would be better off avoiding any suggestion that he had violated federal campaign finance laws that require the disclosure of spending meant to influence the electorate.\u201cYou are truly THE BEST,\u201d Mr. Avenatti wrote. \u201cWhere can we send the gift basket?\u201dAlso, Mr. Trump and some of his closest allies choose to appear only on Fox News \u2014 meaning that any gaffes are bound to appear there, rather than on rival networks.From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress.Still, other moments have scrambled the usual Fox News formula.Mr. Henry, though, belongs to the reporting side of Fox News, rather than its conservative commentariat. And the network\u2019s pundits have been less aggressive in their questioning when interviews go south.On Wednesday night, Mr. Hannity did not press Mr. Giuliani for details about the president\u2019s reimbursing of Mr. Cohen, and the host even offered the former mayor a mulligan.\u201cBut do you know the president didn\u2019t know about this?\u201d Mr. Hannity asked, seeming to prompt Mr. Giuliani to correct his earlier statement.\u201cHe didn\u2019t know about the specifics of it as far as I know,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cBut he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this.\u201dLater, Laura Ingraham, who follows Mr. Hannity at 10 p.m., seemed taken aback at what had transpired in the previous hour.\u201cGod, if you go on \u2018Hannity\u2019 you better think it through, as the attorney for the president,\u201d she said, her eyes wide in disbelief.\u201cI love Rudy,\u201d she added, \u201cbut they better have an explanation for that.

{"Headline": "Women Rally on Cannes Red Carpet to Highlight Gender Inequality", "Date": "2018-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCANNES, France \u2014 Eighty-two women working in the film industry swarmed the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday to denounce the gender inequality in their field.Why 82? Because in the 71 festival competitions since 1946, only 82 movies by female directors have been in contention for prizes. This compares with a total of 1,645 films by male directors. Only one movie by a female director, \u201cThe Piano\u201d by Jane Campion, has ever won the festival\u2019s top prize, the Palme d\u2019Or.The 82 women \u2014 who included the French filmmaker Agn\u00e8s Varda and the actresses Salma Hayek and Marion Cotillard \u2014 appeared on the red carpet for the premiere of \u201cGirls of the Sun\u201d by Eva Husson. Ms. Husson is one of three female directors among the 21 Palme d\u2019Or contenders this year.As songs including \u201cWoman\u201d by Neneh Cherry blared from the loudspeakers, the 82 women in evening dress walked up the carpeted staircase, then turned around to face the crowd.Cate Blanchett, this year\u2019s competition jury president, and Ms. Varda took to the microphone to voice the protesters\u2019 concerns. Ms. Varda said, \u201cWomen are not a minority in the world, and yet our industry says the opposite. We want this to change.\u201dIn an interview as she left the red carpet, Ms. Hayek described the event as a historic moment and \u201can important part of the conversation.\u201d She added that as a producer, she was already seeing change in the appetite for projects by and about women.Asked to comment on the shortage of films by women at the festival, Ms. Hayek said, \u201cYou cannot say it\u2019s only the fault of Cannes.\u201d Describing it as \u201ca complicated equation,\u201d she added, \u201cNot that many women are making their films because they\u2019re not being financed or green-lit or distributed.\u201d It was the responsibility of the \u201centire industry\u201d and not just one festival, she said.Hours before the red-carpet march, Ms. Husson said the decision by the organizers of the festival to allow the women\u2019s march to coincide with the premiere of her movie \u2014 the story of a group of female fighters in Iraqi Kurdistan taking on ISIS \u2014 was a clever move to highlight their inclusion of a film with a mostly female cast and crew in the lineup. She described the selection of her film for the competition as \u201cpolitical.\u201dThe team running the Cannes Film Festival has been fending off complaints about women\u2019s representation for a few years now.At the April 12 news conference in which he unveiled this year\u2019s competition lineup, the festival\u2019s artistic director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux was asked to comment on the small number of films by women on the roster. \u201cThe movies that were selected were chosen for their quality,\u201d he replied, adding that there would \u201cnever be positive discrimination\u201d at the Cannes Festival.He noted that on this year\u2019s jury there were five women and four men.Mr. Fr\u00e9maux did acknowledge, however, that there had been a gender disparity in the selection committees that choose which films make it into the festival. He said two members of last year\u2019s jury \u2014 the actress Jessica Chastain and the director and actress Agn\u00e8s Jaoui \u2014 had asked him about the makeup of those committees.\u201cThe committees were not balanced,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw to it that they were.\u201d The festival did not respond to requests for details on the steps taken.A previous version of this article misstated the name of the film by Jane Campion that won the Palme d\u2019Or.

{"Headline": "Republicans Can\u2019t Even Cut Red Tape Correctly", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Republicans look at what they\u2019ve gotten out of their current moment of unified government, they can point to cutting corporate taxes, some judicial appointments and \u2026 not much else. Beyond that, they claim that they\u2019ve teed up the economy for explosive growth through the magic of \u201cderegulation.\u201d But deregulation is a term that should be banned from the nation\u2019s policy lexicon, mixing as it does equal parts wholesome and foul \u2014 in this administration, almost exclusively foul.The wholesome justification for deregulation arises when government uses its power in ways that gum up the dynamic power of markets. In the long run, our nation\u2019s wealth and the opportunity it provides for improving quality of life depend on the forces of creative destruction. In competitive, open markets, incumbent actors cannot prevent challenges from more nimble competitors, armed with new products or more efficient ways of organizing the production process.This process can be stifled when government acts in ways that stymie or distort competition. Our economy is, increasingly, plagued by these kinds of constraints. The growth of patent and copyright protection over the past few decades has made it harder for new companies to recombine existing technologies in new ways, thus shielding the entertainment industry, tech companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers from challenges. Byzantine regulation of housing construction at the local level has made the cost of living prohibitively expensive in many high-growth areas and blocked millions of workers from moving to high-paying jobs. The growth of company-specific tax subsidies (like those offered by places in competition for Amazon\u2019s HQ2) has shoveled resources toward large businesses that can effectively lobby for government largess.The list could go on, but the point is simple \u2014 in all these areas, there are huge opportunities for growth that are being hamstrung by rules that protect existing companies at the expense of new ones. A bonfire of regulations like this would be entirely wholesome for the American economy and also help to eat away at some of the hyper-inequality that is generated by these forms of crony capitalism.Unfortunately, this is not the kind of regulation that the Trump administration has been attacking. Instead, it has been sharpening its knives for precisely the kinds of regulation that, far from distorting markets, help to improve them. In particular, regulation is often necessary to a properly functioning market when, in its absence, businesses can make a profit by pushing costs onto others, in effect forcing others to subsidize their bottom line. In two areas, the environment and finance, these are exactly the sorts of market-improving regulation that the administration has put in its cross hairs, with the effect of increasing profits via freeloading.The classical justification for environmental regulation is that without properly designed rules, businesses do not have to pay the true costs of their economic activity (what economists call \u201cexternalities\u201d). If a company was making money by parking vehicles in all our driveways without paying, it would be obvious, and individuals would have a remedy in the form of trespass laws. But the costs that companies generate through pollution are widespread and hard to trace. Environmental regulations, by making companies absorb the costs they would otherwise impose on the rest of us, reduce market-distorting subsidies to polluters.Finance is another area where supposed deregulation can be a scheme for allowing a favored few to profit by pushing costs onto others. The challenge in financial regulation is to protect the public from market meltdowns while not also allowing businesses to take excessive risks with the knowledge that the government will pick up the tab if they fail. The Dodd-Frank legislation passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis has numerous flaws and shortcomings, but it did impose more stringent rules on the largest banks. The administration and its allies in Congress have proposed dramatically reducing the number of banks covered by these rules, without (as a large number of economists have recommended) creating other, more effective ways of reducing excessive risk-taking. The consequence of this species of deregulation is to move back toward the world of \u201cHeads I win, tails you lose\u201d that brought us the financial crisis in the first place.Even in the realm of market-improving regulation, there are still many rules that are misconceived or out of date and whose main effect is to protect today\u2019s economic winners from competitive challenge. In these areas, regulatory reform could do a lot of good. For instance, rather than just scrapping the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, as the Trump administration wants to do, we could replace it with a much less distortive and more effective alternative, like a broad-based carbon tax. Instead of just cutting Dodd-Frank rules on the largest banks, we could require that they increase their reliance on equity rather than debt, so that the costs of failure fall on investors rather than taxpayers.But there is a critical difference between areas where regulation\u2019s main effect is to protect incumbents and those where government is legitimately, if imperfectly, solving real problems of market failure. If Republicans are really serious about encouraging growth through pro-market policies, they should focus their red-tape-cutting zeal on the former, market-distorting kind of regulation \u2014 not on the rules needed to make markets function properly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Regulator Urges Banks to Compete With Payday Lenders", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA federal regulator on Wednesday encouraged banks to offer small, short-term loans to people in need of emergency cash, the Trump administration\u2019s latest relaxation of banking regulations and a rare moment of common ground with consumer groups that oppose payday lending.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, said it will start allowing banks to make small loans \u2014 typically in the range of $300 to $5,000 \u2014 outside of their standard underwriting processes.Joseph Otting, the agency\u2019s leader, said the new guidance is intended to help extend banking services to Americans whose credit scores are too low to qualify for conventional loans or credit cards.Mr. Otting offered the example of the owner of a vehicle in need of immediate repairs who had few options other than seeking a quick loan from a check-cashing shop or even a liquor store.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that credit demand went away, it just got displaced into the most expensive segment,\u201d he said. \u201cI personally believe that banks can provide that in a safer, sound, more economically efficient manner.\u201dA handful of large and midsize banks, including Wells Fargo and Regions Bank, once offered so-called deposit advance loans that let customers quickly borrow small sums, which would typically be repaid from their next paycheck. The banks stopped making such loans in 2014, after federal regulators warned banks against providing products that \u201ccan trap customers in a cycle of high-cost debt that they are unable to repay.\u201dMr. Otting\u2019s office rescinded that guidance last year. The memo sent on Wednesday formally gave banks the green light to return to the short-term lending market.The Pew Charitable Trusts, which has fiercely opposed payday lending, praised the change of heart. \u201cIf banks begin offering these loans according to strong safety standards, it could boost financial inclusion and be a game-changer for the millions of Americans who use high-cost loans today,\u201d said Nick Bourke, the director of Pew\u2019s consumer finance research.No major banks are planning to immediately introduce any new products, but several, including Wells Fargo, said they are considering their options.Fifth Third Bank, in Cincinnati, recently introduced a loan for customers who have been with the bank for at least a year. They can quickly borrow up to $1,000, which they must repay in 45 days or less. The fee is 3 percent of the amount borrowed \u2014 far less than a payday lender would charge.\u201cWe believe there is a need for a convenient and flexible small-dollar solution that is appropriate for an emergency situation,\" said Laura Trujillo, a Fifth Third spokeswoman.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Is Said to Have Known of Payment to Stormy Daniels Months Before He Denied It", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump knew about a six-figure payment that Michael D. Cohen, his personal lawyer, made to a pornographic film actress several months before he denied any knowledge of it to reporters aboard Air Force One in April, according to two people familiar with the arrangement.How much Mr. Trump knew about the payment to Stephanie Clifford, the actress, and who else was aware of it have been at the center of a swirling controversy for the past 48 hours touched off by a television interview with Rudolph W. Giuliani, a new addition to the president\u2019s legal team. The interview was the first time a lawyer for the president had acknowledged that Mr. Trump had reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payments to Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels.It was not immediately clear when Mr. Trump learned of the payment, which Mr. Cohen made in October 2016, at a time when news media outlets were poised to pay her for her story about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump in 2006. But three people close to the matter said that Mr. Trump knew that Mr. Cohen had succeeded in keeping the allegations from becoming public at the time the president denied it.Ms. Clifford signed a nondisclosure agreement, and accepted the payment just days before Mr. Trump won the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump has denied he had an affair with Ms. Clifford and insisted that the nondisclosure agreement was created to prevent any embarrassment to his family.Mr. Giuliani said this week that the reimbursement to Mr. Cohen totaled $460,000 or $470,000, leaving it unclear what else the payments were for beyond the $130,000 that went to Ms. Clifford. One of the people familiar with the arrangement said that it was a $420,000 total over 12 months.From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress.Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, has known since last year the details of how Mr. Cohen was being reimbursed, which was mainly through payments of $35,000 per month from the trust that contains the president\u2019s personal fortune, according to two people with knowledge of the arrangement.One person close to the Trump Organization said people with the company were aware that Mr. Cohen was still doing \u201clegal work\u201d for the president in 2017, but another person familiar with the situation said that Mr. Weisselberg did not know that Mr. Cohen had paid Ms. Clifford when the retainer agreement was struck and when the payments went through.Mr. Weisselberg\u2019s knowledge of the retainer agreement could draw Mr. Trump\u2019s company deeper into the federal investigation of Mr. Cohen\u2019s activities, increasing the president\u2019s legal exposure in a wide-ranging case involving the lawyer often described as the president\u2019s \u201cfixer\u201d in New York City.In interviews on Wednesday and Thursday, Mr. Giuliani insisted that the president had reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the $130,000 hush payment \u2014 and then paid him another $330,000, if not more \u2014 which was in direct conflict with the longstanding assertion by Mr. Trump and the White House that he did not know about the hush money or where it came from.In an interview with The New York Times on Friday, Mr. Giuliani sought to clarify his statements by saying that he did not know whether Mr. Trump had known that some of the payments to Mr. Cohen had gone to Ms. Clifford. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m aware of, nor is it relevant to what I\u2019m doing, the legal part,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that \u201cpolitically,\u201d it could be troublesome. \u201cPolitically, everything matters, but I don\u2019t see a problem here, at least not\u201d legally, he said.A lawyer for the Trump Organization declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for the organization did not respond to an email about Mr. Weisselberg.The president has said that he would view any investigation into his finances or those of his family as \u201ca violation,\u201d though he was referring to the investigation into Russia by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III; the investigation into Mr. Cohen is being run by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.The payment to Ms. Clifford is a part of that investigation. The circumstances surrounding it had become all the murkier this week after Mr. Giuliani gave an explanation of how the funds to Ms. Clifford were accounted for that contradicted all those that came before it.After initially appearing to back Mr. Giuliani\u2019s assertions in a series of Twitter messages on Thursday, Mr. Trump reversed course on Friday, after a series of headlines suggesting that the president had lied about knowing of the hush payment. In remarks to reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Giuliani and said he would eventually \u201cget his facts straight.\u201d\u201cVirtually everything said has been said incorrectly, and it\u2019s been said wrong, or it\u2019s been covered wrong by the press,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters, though he excused Mr. Giuliani by explaining he had \u201cjust started a day ago.\u201dIn a written statement later in the day, Mr. Giuliani said that he had not been \u201cdescribing my understanding of the president\u2019s knowledge.\u201d And he reversed a previous suggestion that the payment to Ms. Clifford was motivated by the election. Mr. Giuliani said on Friday that the payment was personal in nature and \u201cwould have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not.\u201d Mr. Giuliani told The Times that he had \u201cconfused\u201d the two factors, but that it was irrelevant since Mr. Trump had repaid Mr. Cohen.While some White House officials had insisted that Mr. Trump was pleased with Mr. Giuliani\u2019s performance on Fox News in an interview with Sean Hannity on Wednesday night, two people close to the president painted a different picture. They said that Mr. Trump was displeased with how Mr. Giuliani, a former New York mayor, conducted himself, and that he was also unhappy with Mr. Hannity, a commentator whose advice the president often seeks, in terms of the language he used to describe the payments to Ms. Clifford.The nature of the payments is significant because of campaign finance laws that regulate who may contribute to candidates and how much they can give.If Mr. Cohen or others paid to silence Ms. Clifford primarily out of fear that a public airing of her story would have harmed Mr. Trump\u2019s election prospects \u2014 rather than to keep it from his family for personal reasons \u2014 then the payment would most likely be viewed as an illegal campaign expenditure. Mr. Giuliani told The Times on Friday that the issue was \u201cprimarily\u201d about keeping Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, from being embarrassed by the claim, which Mr. Trump has maintained was false.Lawyers from inside and outside the White House are confronting the Mueller inquiry, while others are focused on payments made to silence a pornographic film actress who said she had sex with Mr. Trump.But if investigators determine that the hush payment was in effect a campaign expenditure, then how the funds were distributed could take on added legal significance. Mr. Cohen had been careful to say that neither the campaign nor the Trump Organization was involved in the deal or any effort to reimburse him.Under campaign finance law, Mr. Trump would have been within his rights to pay Ms. Clifford himself as a way to protect his presidential prospects \u2014 though he would have had to have formally made note of it in his public campaign filings, which had no accounting of the payment. If he directed Mr. Cohen to pay it on his behalf, then that could qualify as an illegal, coordinated campaign expenditure, even if Mr. Trump later paid him back.Any involvement by the Trump Organization would further complicate the legal picture, given that American election law is strictest of all when it comes to corporate involvement with political campaigns. Businesses are not allowed to donate directly to campaigns or to coordinate with them.Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, Michael J. Avenatti, has been arguing for months that Mr. Trump\u2019s company was more involved in the arrangement than Mr. Cohen had been letting on.After filing a lawsuit on Ms. Clifford\u2019s behalf seeking to get out of the deal \u2014 which he has called invalid \u2014 Mr. Avenatti showed that Mr. Cohen had used his Trump Organization email at one point in arranging the payment. He also pointed to a secret document in California that a Trump Organization lawyer filed to force Ms. Clifford into arbitration this year.In an interview, Mr. Avenatti said that any indication that still more executives at the Trump Organization knew about the effort to reimburse Mr. Cohen for the payment to Ms. Clifford could lead to further investigation of the Trump family business.\u201cThere\u2019s no question it opens up another avenue of inquiry into the depths of the involvement of the Trump Organization,\u201d he said.Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Think the Big Banks Have Abandoned Coal? Think Again", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "An environmental group\u2019s analysis shows the five largest United States banks have started lending to coal companies again now that they\u2019re out of bankruptcy.Supported byStarting three years ago, the largest American banks vowed to cut back on lending to the coal industry.\u201cThe bank has a responsibility to help mitigate climate change by leveraging our scale and resources to accelerate the transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon society,\u201d Bank of America said in its coal policy in May 2015.Their pledges seemed so dramatic that Paul Argenti, a professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business, began citing them in lectures as a rare example of a corporate principle\u2019s trumping profits. \u201cI read it as: They were done,\u201d he said.But the banks, it turns out, never actually promised to walk away from coal completely. And now, with coal companies enjoying a small resurgence under the Trump administration, banks are again embracing the industry.At the time of the pledges, the three biggest coal mining companies were in bankruptcy, the United States was signing a pact to reduce carbon emissions, and cheap natural gas was forcing coal-fired power plants out of business. There were few coal loans to make.But Peabody Energy, Arch Coal and Alpha Natural Resources have emerged from bankruptcy, their balance sheets scrubbed clean. President Trump has vowed to support the industry.Five of the country\u2019s biggest banks are lending tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to coal companies again, in one case eclipsing what they lent in 2014, before the industry entered a nose dive, according to an analysis by Rainforest Action Network, a liberal environmental group.JPMorgan\u2019s coal lending increased to $654 million 2017 from $32 million in 2015, according to the analysis. That was more than the $570 million the bank lent to coal interests in 2014. The vast majority of JPMorgan\u2019s coal loans in 2017 were to Peabody, which emerged from bankruptcy that April.Morgan Stanley\u2019s coal loans, though well below their 2014 levels, more than doubled from 2015 to 2017. And though their loans to coal companies haven\u2019t quite reached earlier levels, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America each added new coal loans last year, the analysis shows. Citigroup made more such loans in 2016 and 2017 than it did in 2015, though well below its 2014 figure.Combined, the five banks issued about $1.5 billion in new coal-related loans last year, according to Rainforest Action Network.The analysis includes loans to companies like Glencore and BHP Billiton, which produce commodities like copper and oil in addition to coal. It weights each loan based on the percentage of the company\u2019s business that comes from coal. Fifteen percent of Glencore\u2019s assets are in coal, for example, so a $229 million loan that Bank of America made to Glencore last year was given a value of $34 million.The analysis looked only at new loans, not at the banks\u2019 overall exposure to the coal industry.The banks made their pledges around the time that world leaders negotiated the Paris agreement to reduce carbon emissions. Some of the banks vowed to curb lending to new coal-fired power plants in wealthy countries and to plants that did not use pollution-mitigating technology.In November 2015, for example, Morgan Stanley said it would reduce financing for projects using \u201cmountaintop removal,\u201d in which mountains are dynamited to reveal coal seams. In March 2016, JPMorgan said it would eliminate such financing, as well as stop lending to new coal mines.Banks used the pledges as part of a broader effort to project a green corporate image. Citigroup listed its reduced lending as the first item in the environmental section of its 2016 report on its \u201ccitizenship\u201d initiatives. Bank of America and JPMorgan were lead sponsors of Climate Week NYC 2016, a gathering of world leaders and corporate executives who discussed ways to fulfill the Paris accord\u2019s goals.Even experts got the impression that banks were abandoning coal.\u201cA few years ago when a lot of these major banks came out and said that they would no longer be supporting the sector, I think, a lot of people generalized in a major way,\u201d said Chiza Vitta, an analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cThe sector is in decline, but it remains a very important component of electricity generation.\u201dThe banks left themselves plenty of room to respond if the coal industry recovered.Few coal mining companies still use mountaintop removal. And it is far more common for companies to expand existing mines than to break ground for new ones.Environmental groups are crying foul.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an environmental policy,\u201d said Alex Bozmoski, managing director of RepublicEn, a conservative environmental activism group. \u201cIt was financial and risk management policy that was used by communications departments.\u201dAlison Kirsch, a spokeswoman for Rainforest Action Network, said the banks\u2019 initial pledges had left \u201chuge loopholes,\u201d which she said JPMorgan in particular was \u201cshamelessly exploiting.\u201d\u201cWe disagree with the report\u2019s conclusions,\u201d said Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman. \u201cOver the last two years, we have declined to participate in dozens of transactions related to coal-fired power plants and coal mining, and our credit exposure to companies deriving the majority of their revenues from coal has declined by about a third.\u201dKelly Sapp, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, said the company was adhering to its 2015 pledge. \u201cWe have been reducing our credit exposure over the past several years to companies focused on coal mining while growing our financing of renewables,\u201d she said. \u201cOur policy is not changing.\u201dRepresentatives of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.Part of the reason that coal has been resurgent is that it is used to fuel blast furnaces in which steel is made. The Rainforest Action Network analysis doesn\u2019t differentiate between loans for so-called metallurgical coal and coal used in power plants.Randall Atkins, who briefly worked as a JPMorgan investment banker specializing in the coal industry and now runs Ramaco Resources, a small coal producer based in Kentucky, said the banks\u2019 rapprochement with coal companies was \u201cBanking 101.\u201d Coal producers appear financially healthier now, he said, so banks think they can make money lending to them.\u201cThe banks are receptive to come back in and do normal lending in the space,\u201d he said.Not every coal company is having an easy time getting a loan. Grant Quasha, the chief executive of Paringa Resources, said his company had no loans from major United States banks. Some of their policies prohibit loans to projects like the new Poplar Grove mine, which Paringa is developing in Kentucky.\u201cFor smaller companies such as ourselves, it\u2019s still very difficult to obtain financing,\u201d Mr. Quasha said. \u201cIt exists, it\u2019s just very expensive.\u201dMr. Argenti, the Dartmouth professor, said he would no longer cite the banks\u2019 coal pledges in his classroom lectures on corporate responsibility.\u201cA lot of what passes for sustainability is actually nothing more than public relations,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

If Mr. Byford is able to pull it off, the overhaul could mean substantial improvements to the subway over the next five years by tackling longstanding problems.But Mr. Byford has an even more difficult task than just fixing the nuts and bolts of the system: He must win the political support and the money that will be needed if there is any hope to revive the subway.Even before Mr. Byford\u2019s announcement, it became clear that the plan would face major obstacles. The chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Joseph J. Lhota, quickly walked back the $19 billion estimate and said it was too soon to determine the costs \u2014 an acknowledgment that the price tag might spook elected officials.The governor, who has suggested a new but unproven technology to modernize the system, also said he wants more input from tech experts about upgrading the signals. The subway\u2019s poor performance could be one of the biggest issues Mr. Cuomo faces as he seeks re-election.Mr. de Blasio immediately distanced himself from helping to pay for the subway proposal, instead urging state leaders to approve a tax on the wealthy and making clear who he believes is obligated to fix the subway. \u201cIt\u2019s now fully understood that the responsibility for the M.T.A. resides in the state of New York, ultimately the governor,\u201d Mr. de Blasio told reporters. \u201cWe finally know who to hold responsible \u2014 just like everyone holds me responsible for our schools.\u201dMr. Cuomo scoffed at the idea that Mr. de Blasio would not help pay for Mr. Byford\u2019s subway plan.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then the real problem is you\u2019re not going to be able to do anything significant to fix the subways,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.A spokesman for the authority, Jon Weinstein, forcefully hit back against the mayor\u2019s comments on Wednesday evening, saying Mr. de Blasio did not care about subway riders and \u201chis lack of responsibility will be one of his great legacies.\u201d\u201cThe mayor basically declared the Byford N.Y.C. Transit plan dead on arrival because he won\u2019t have anything to do with funding it,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said.There are other hurdles. The authority struggles with a lack of credibility after regularly delivering projects late and over-budget and the recent failure in Albany of congestion pricing \u2014 a proposal to charge drivers to enter Manhattan that would have raised money for the transit system, but did not garner widespread support.Cynthia Nixon, an actress who is challenging Mr. Cuomo for the Democratic nomination for governor and who has repeatedly criticized his management of the subway, quickly weighed in, saying that Mr. Cuomo was again punting.\u201cWe can\u2019t fix the subway until we have a governor who knows it\u2019s her job to fund the M.T.A.,\u201d Ms. Nixon said in a statement.The subway has long been a political football in part because of the unusual nature of its governance \u2014 even though it serves the city, it is controlled by the state, a fact that many riders do not realize. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio spent months fighting over who should pay for the roughly $800 million subway rescue plan that was announced last summer after the governor declared a state of emergency for the system. Mr. de Blasio eventually agreed to pay for about half, but only under pressure from the state.For his part, Mr. Byford assured reporters that he was up to the challenge. He said he was no stranger to a difficult political and media environment \u2014 Mr. Byford was in Toronto during the period when Rob Ford was that city\u2019s combative mayor.\u201cI did my homework before I came here,\u201d Mr. Byford said, acknowledging that New York City\u2019s transit system was a hot potato. \u201cI knew this would be a tough gig.\u201dMr. Lhota said it was now the M.T.A.\u2019s job to sell the plan to all levels of government. He joked that he was not a fan of the millionaire\u2019s tax. \u201cAs somebody who would be subject to that tax,\u201d he said, \u201cI am not particularly interested.\u201dAs Mr. Byford outlined the proposal, he compared the subway crisis to earlier emergencies that the city had confronted and recovered from, including the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack and Hurricane Sandy.\u201cNot acting now is not an option, and it will only get more difficult and more expensive,\u201d Mr. Byford said. \u201cI believe this can be achieved and we now have a road map.\u201dMichael Whyland, a spokesman for Carl E. Heastie, the Democratic Assembly speaker, said he would review the subway plan. Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, said he was glad the authority wanted to replace signals quickly. \u201cI would say I\u2019m cautiously optimistic, but like most New Yorkers, I have some serious concerns about the M.T.A.\u2019s ability to complete projects on time and under budget,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in a statement.New York\u2019s political climate is particularly thorny and New York City is much larger than Toronto, said Christina M. Greer, a political-science professor who is a McSilver Institute Fellow at New York University.\u201cI\u2019m sure Andy has management skills and that\u2019s why he was hired, but let\u2019s be respectful of the size and scope of this city,\u201d she said.As for a reconciliation between the governor and mayor over the subway? \u201cIf someone can bring them together, that person deserves the keys to the city,\u201d Ms. Greer said.Brad Lander, a city councilman from Brooklyn who has focused attention to the subway\u2019s antiquated and unreliable signals, said he hoped Mr. Byford was successful. But he said he was not optimistic because Mr. Cuomo was playing coy about the plan.\u201cWithout sufficient funding,\u201d Mr. Lander said, \u201cthis plan will mean nothing.\u201dJeffery C. Mays contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Trump\u2019s Termination of Iran Deal Is a Risky Bet", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 For President Trump and two of the allies he values most \u2014 Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 the problem of the Iranian nuclear accord was not, primarily, about nuclear weapons. It was that the deal legitimized and normalized Iran\u2019s clerical government, reopening it to the world economy with oil revenue that financed its adventures in Syria and Iraq, its missile program and its support of terrorist groups.Now, by announcing on Tuesday that he is exiting the nuclear deal and will reimpose economic sanctions on Iran and companies around the world that do business with the country, Mr. Trump is engaged in a grand, highly risky experiment.Mr. Trump and his Middle East allies are betting they can cut Iran\u2019s economic lifeline and thus \u201cbreak the regime,\u201d as one senior European official described the effort. In theory, America\u2019s withdrawal could free Iran to produce as much nuclear material as it wants \u2014 as it was doing five years ago, when the world feared that it was headed toward a bomb.But Mr. Trump\u2019s team dismisses that risk: Iran does not have the economic strength to confront the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia. And Iran knows that any move to produce a weapon would only provide Israel and the United States with a rationale for taking military action.It is a brutally realpolitik approach that America\u2019s allies in Europe have warned is a historic mistake, one that could lead to confrontation, and perhaps to war.And it is a clear example of Middle East brinkmanship that runs counter to what President Barack Obama intended when the nuclear deal was struck in July 2015.Mr. Obama\u2019s gamble in that deal \u2014 the signature foreign policy accord of his eight years in office \u2014 was straightforward. He regarded Iran as potentially a more natural ally of the United States than many of its Sunni-dominant neighbors, with a young, educated Western-oriented population that is tired of being ruled by an aging theocracy.By taking the prospect of nuclear weapons off the table, the Obama administration had argued, the United States and Iran could chip away at three decades of hostility and work on common projects, starting with the defeat of the Islamic State.It did not turn out that way. While the deal succeeded in getting 97 percent of Iran\u2019s nuclear material out of the country, Iran\u2019s conservatives and its military recoiled at the idea of cooperating on any projects with the West.Months before it became clear that Mr. Trump had a decent shot at being elected, the Iranian military increased support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; it expanded its influence in Iraq and accelerated its support for terrorist groups. And it doubled down on deploying cyberattacks against targets in the West and in Saudi Arabia, embracing a weapon that was not covered by the nuclear accord.Then came Mr. Trump, with his declaration that the deal was a \u201cdisaster\u201d and his vow to dismantle it. That is exactly what he has now done, but at a huge cost.Moments after he delivered his statement \u2014 in which he made it sound as if Iran was cheating on the accord, even though his intelligence chiefs have testified otherwise \u2014 Mr. Trump received a stinging rebuke from Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.The three leaders, America\u2019s closest European allies, essentially rejected his logic. They noted that the United Nations Security Council resolution that embraced the Iran deal in 2016 \u201cremains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear program.\u201dThat was polite diplomatic language for the stark conclusion that it is the United States \u2014 not Iran \u2014 that first violated the accord.And now, suddenly, the world may well be headed back to where it was in 2012: on a road to uncertain confrontation, with \u201cvery little evidence of a Plan B,\u201d as Boris Johnson, the British foreign minister, said on a visit to Washington.Exiting the deal, with or without a plan, is fine with the Saudis. They see the accord as a dangerous distraction from the real problem of confronting Iran around the region \u2014 a problem that Saudi Arabia believes will be solved only by leadership change in Iran.The Saudis have an ally in John R. Bolton, the president\u2019s new national security adviser, who had made clear before taking office that he shared their view. Mr. Obama\u2019s deal, Mr. Bolton said on Tuesday afternoon, featured \u201can utterly inadequate treatment of the military dimension of Iran\u2019s aspirations.\u201dThe Saudi case against Iran has been bolstered in recent months by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has repeatedly referred to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as \u201cthe new Hitler.\u201d\u201cMany countries around the world and in Europe did not realize how dangerous Hitler was until what happened, happened,\u201d Prince Mohammed said in a recent interview with the CBS News program \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the same events happening in the Middle East.\u201dIn a speech in March at the Brookings Institution, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, asserted that Iran was \u201cthe biggest problem we face in our region.\u201d He blamed Iran for interfering in neighboring countries, backing allied armed groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, and supplying Yemeni rebels with ballistic missiles they fired at his country.Even if its restrictions on nuclear weapons were tightened and extended, \u201cthe agreement by itself does not solve the problem of Iran,\u201d Mr. Jubeir said. \u201cIran must be held accountable.\u201dJeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a State Department official during the Obama administration, argued that the nuclear deal\u2019s opposition from Saudi Arabia, Israel and other regional players was primarily about its effects on American politics and policy.\u201cThey believe they are in this existential conflict with the Iranian regime, and nuclear weapons are a small part of that conflict\u201d \u2014 but the one that most influences public opinion in the United States, Mr. Shapiro said.\u201cIf the deal opened an avenue for better relations between the United States and Iran, that would be a disaster for the Saudis,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to ensure a motivation for American pressure against Iran that will last even after this administration.\u201dIsrael is a more complicated case.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed Mr. Trump to abandon an arrangement that the Israeli leader has always detested. But Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s own military and intelligence advisers say Israel is far safer with an Iran whose pathway to a bomb is blocked, rather than one that is once again pursuing the ultimate weapon.\u201cThe individuals who shoulder responsibility for Israel\u2019s survival and security have been crystal clear,\u201d Graham Allison, a Harvard professor who has spent his career examining cases of nuclear proliferation.But Mr. Netanyahu holds Israel\u2019s bullhorn, and he used it last week to persuade Mr. Trump to pull the plug on the Iran deal. By releasing Iranian documents, stolen from Tehran in January, Mr. Netanyahu proved what Western intelligence agencies long knew: A decade ago or even longer, the Iranians were working hard to design a nuclear warhead.To Mr. Netanyahu, this was proof that Iran could never be trusted and that it had reached the nuclear deal under false pretenses by pretending it never had a weapons program. To Mr. Trump and his allies, the Israeli discovery said less about Iranian nuclear capability than it did about Iranian perfidy.Given evidence that Iran was preserving its bomb designs as a hedge for the future, the discovery suggested it has not given up its ambitions. As Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator, put it, someone needed to address the Israeli discovery \u201clest they give the Iranians the ability to pick up quickly where they left off on weaponizing.\u201dStill, at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement on Tuesday is a conviction that Mr. Obama made a critical mistake in agreeing to a deal that contains an expiration date. Mr. Trump\u2019s argument is that Iran can never be allowed to accumulate enough material to assemble a bomb.So when the Europeans said that would require reopening the negotiations, Mr. Trump balked, and decided instead to scrap the entire deal.It was a classic Trumpian move, akin to the days when he would knock down New York buildings to make way for visions of grander, more glorious edifices. But in this case, it is about upsetting a global power balance and weakening a government that Mr. Trump has argued, since he began campaigning, must go.An earlier version of a caption with this article misstated the day on which it was taken. It was Tuesday, not Wednesday.David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and David D. Kirkpatrick from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018He\u2019s a Pit Bull\u2019: T-Mobile C.E.O. Is the Colorful Outlier of Wireless", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, T-Mobile\u2019s chief executive, John Legere, crashed the AT&T party at the Venetian hotel. Wearing a black leather jacket and his customary pink T-Mobile T-shirt, Mr. Legere said he was just hoping to see the rapper Macklemore perform.Since taking over T-Mobile in 2012, Mr. Legere has made a name for himself with those kinds of publicity stunts \u2014 promoting his own brand while undermining the competition.But now, Mr. Legere may have truly crashed the party.Under the terms of the proposed deal, Mr. Legere would become chief executive of the combined company, which would keep the T-Mobile name.It\u2019s a bold move, and one that illustrates Mr. Legere\u2019s willingness to disrupt the status quo, even if he appears to have the weaker hand.\u201cHe wants to take on the titans of AT&T and Verizon,\u201d said Steve Grasso, director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel and a market analyst for CNBC, who knows Mr. Legere socially. \u201cHe\u2019s a pit bull.\u201dThe combination of T-Mobile and Sprint has been years in the making, as both companies have sought to add scale and compete with their larger rivals. Yet the last time the companies formally attempted a deal, in 2014, it was Sprint that was planning to acquire T-Mobile.That deal fell apart in the face of regulatory scrutiny. And since then, Mr. Legere has managed to build T-Mobile\u2019s business by flouting convention. Under his leadership, T-Mobile began offering unlimited data, reduced prices and less stringent contract commitments.When Mr. Legere took over in 2012, he was a very different executive, and T-Mobile was a very different company.T-Mobile was reeling from a failed attempt to sell itself to AT&T and struggling to distinguish itself from other low-cost carriers like Sprint and Metro PCS. Mr. Legere, who spent 20 years working at AT&T, was a conventional, if ambitious, telecommunications executive.\u201cHe was a finance guy,\u201d said Dan Hesse, the former chief executive of Sprint, who was a mentor of Mr. Legere\u2019s at AT&T. \u201cThe first time I saw John after he was named C.E.O. of T-Mobile, he was there in his suit.\u201dThat soon changed. In 2013, Mr. Legere was onstage at an event in Las Vegas with Joe Torre, the former manager of the Yankees, promoting a partnership between T-Mobile and Major League Baseball.When reporters asked him about the state of the wireless industry, he responded with a tirade about how badly customers were mistreated, and what he planned to do differently.Soon, Mr. Legere, now 59, had a whole new look. He grew his hair to his shoulders. He wore company T-shirts wherever he went. He pulled on custom pink Converse sneakers emblazoned with the T-Mobile logo. Before long, the finance guy looked more like an aging rock star.And on Twitter, he began hurling insults at competitors and tangling with rival C.E.O.s \u2014 including Sprint\u2019s Marcelo Claure.Offline, Mr. Legere also cultivated an eccentric image. He is a regular visitor to T-Mobile stores and call centers, where he delivers boisterous pep talks. At company meetings, he offers employees $100 if they will ask him a question in the form of a song. And in the office, he is fond of riding around on a Segway.\u201cJohn has built a franchise around T-Mobile, which is in part his own,\u201d said Stephen Scherr, head of the consumer and commercial banking division at Goldman Sachs, who has worked with Mr. Legere for more than a decade.But Mr. Legere has paired showmanship with results. During his tenure, T-Mobile has added subscribers and increased revenues and profits. \u201cHe\u2019s also a great operator,\u201d Mr. Scherr said. \u201cHe runs a really good business.\u201dIf Mr. Legere succeeds in finally joining T-Mobile and Sprint, the man who wanted to come off as the consummate outsider will have pulled off the ultimate insider move: a mega-merger to combine two rival companies and seize a greater share of a changing industry.Under President Trump, antitrust enforcement has become unpredictable. The Justice Department has mounted a court fight against the proposed combination of AT&T and Time Warner, which do not directly compete with each other. At the same time, there appears to be little resistance to the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets by Disney, a deal which would reduce competition in the film and television industry.Mr. Legere, who is sensitive to public perceptions, seems to have anticipated this moment. In January 2017, after Mr. Trump\u2019s election but before his inauguration, Mr. Legere was asked about his view of the regulatory environment under the Trump administration.\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be excited,\u2019\u2019 he said, about regulatory views that would be \u201cconducive to us significantly expanding our business.\u201dMr. Legere knew from firsthand experience. In 2015, after Mr. Trump insulted the U.F.C. fighter Ronda Rousey on Twitter, Mr. Legere came to her defense. In the ensuing exchange, Mr. Legere said Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t presidential material.\u201cI am an undecided Republican,\u201d Mr. Legere wrote. \u201cWell not totally undecided, I know what I don\u2019t want :)\u201dBut it seems that the prospect of a multibillion-dollar deal can heal old wounds.Mr. Legere has since deleted that tweet about the president. And on Sunday, Mr. Legere was making the rounds with Mr. Claure of Sprint, another old social media sparring partner, to talk up their alliance.Advertisement"}

His political hero, Teddy Roosevelt, believed the good life should be lived \u201cin the arena,\u201d and even now he seems to be living that creed to its fullest. He\u2019s still a force in the Senate, he has a new book and he\u2019s planning his own funeral (like his other hero, Winston Churchill). The president is not invited. Your thoughts?It was the absolute best political event I ever covered. Not sure it was entirely a race, since he was up in New Hampshire for months and months all by himself, just going to town meetings and talking about campaign-finance reform.And he won! New Hampshire that is. Went on down to South Carolina for the next big primary and everything changed. He was actually a pretty terrible front-runner. Lost the primary, lost the nomination. Went back to the Senate and passed that campaign finance law, which was pretty much destroyed by the Supreme Court.So I can\u2019t say there was a happy ending. But there was certainly a moment.But there was always a seriousness of purpose, and a quality of self-deprecation, and a basic decency to everything he did.

{"Headline": "Trump Indonesia Real Estate Project Gets Chinese Government Ally", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Trump Organization\u2019s partner in a lavish Indonesian development project boasting a six-star hotel and golf course with President Trump\u2019s name has brought on a new ally: a Chinese state-owned company.The Indonesian partner, the MNC Group, said Tuesday that it had struck a deal with an arm of Metallurgical Corporation of China, a state-owned construction company, to build a theme park next door to the planned Trump properties.The timing is awkward.Also the deal between the Chinese state-owned company, M.C.C., and the Indonesian developer falls under the umbrella of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious plan to spread the country\u2019s money and influence around the world by financing infrastructure and other projects. The initiative is a high priority for President Xi Jinping.The Chinese state-owned construction company, in an announcement of the deal, did not provide any details on the agreement. The announcement, which was initially published on its website, was later taken down. A representative for M.C.C. declined to comment.Both the theme park and the Trump-branded hotel and 18-hole golf course are being developed by the billionaire Hary Tanoesoedibjo, head of the MNC Group, and packaged together as part of a splashy $500 million complex called Lido City that it has marketed as an \u201cintegrated lifestyle resort and theme park.\u201dHatunggal Muda Siregar, a spokesman for MNC, said the theme park and the Trump properties are separate projects within the Lido development. The agreement with the Chinese company to build the theme park does not include any financing for the project, he said.The company will use a different contractor to build the Trump resort at Lido and a second Trump resort and golf course on Bali, he said. The company has its own resources to finance the resort projects, he added.There isn\u2019t any evidence that the agreement with the construction company was intended to sway the Trump administration on any matters. Still, Mr. Trump has threatened China with tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese-made goods if it doesn\u2019t back away from plans to use state support to finance a new generation of high-tech industries.Both the Justice Department and Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said the suits are groundless.There is no indication that the president or the Trump Organization was involved in helping arrange the Chinese role in the Lido City project. The deal was first reported by Agence France-Presse.The Lido resort and theme park, about 50 miles south of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, is one of two projects in the country that the Trump Organization has signed onto with Mr. Hary, who ran for vice president of Indonesia in 2014, and who is the founder and president director of MNC.Mr. Hary, 52, is ranked 31st on Forbes magazine\u2019s list of wealthy Indonesians, with a net worth of $1.1 billion. His business interests include television stations, newspapers, telecommunications, land development and financial services.Mr. Hary has a reputation for being hard-nosed in both business and politics. He founded his political party, the United Indonesia Party, in 2015.Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings in Indonesia prompted scrutiny even before his inauguration, and he pledged not to embark on any new deals while in office. But the Trump Organization held onto the projects in Indonesia, saying the contracts with Mr. Hary were signed in 2015 and were binding.At the old Lido Lakes Resort, the site of the Trump resort and theme park, the only work underway for the Trump project appears to be the moving of dirt on the site.\u201cIt\u2019s fine to do a business deal with an offshore magnate, but he\u2019s still got to translate it into business success, and at the moment there\u2019s not much sign of progress,\u201d said Keith Loveard, a senior analyst at the Jakarta-based firm Concord Consulting.Alexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong, and Richard C.

Members of the Liberal Party, of which Mr. Uribe was a member, said he had ties to top drug families, including one who worked for the kingpin Pablo Escobar.The cables shed new light on allegations which have dogged Mr. Uribe for years. He has repeatedly issued blanket denials, saying the accusations reflect attempts by political rivals to undercut him.Mr. Uribe, who over time has moved far to the right politically, now serves as a senator and may soon lead the conservative bloc which won the most seats this year in Colombia\u2019s parliamentary elections. Iv\u00e1n Duque, Mr. Uribe\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who he has supported in the presidential election, is running ahead of five other rivals in a first-round vote on Sunday.One cable from 1993 described an embassy meeting with Luis Guillermo V\u00e9lez Trujillo, then a Liberal Party senator. The senator complained that the Ochoa V\u00e1squez family \u2014 a top Colombian clan in Mr. Escobar\u2019s Medell\u00edn cartel \u2014 \u201chad financed\u201d Mr. Uribe\u2019s political campaigns.Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez, another senator from Mr. Uribe\u2019s party, told diplomats that Mr. Uribe \u201cfeared for his life because he was unable to deliver for his Medell\u00edn cartel mentors\u201d on a promise to broker a deal between Mr. Escobar and the government for his surrender.While the diplomats say they did not find hard evidence to back the accusations they received, they spent years collecting them and expressing concerns to American officials and diplomats.\u201cWe still remain leary [sic] of Uribe\u2019s own narco connections,\u201d said one cable in 1992 where American diplomats discussed counternarcotics operations carried out with Mr. Uribe\u2019s support.And the Americans struggled to understand the motivations of a man who would be president \u2014 and has emerged again this year as his country\u2019s kingmaker.On the campaign trail, Mr. Duque has said Mr. Uribe, who cannot run for president again because of term limits, is the country\u2019s \u201ceternal president.\u201d\u201c\u00c1lvaro Uribe transformed Colombian politics. His legacy is everywhere, and he remains an important political player,\u201d said Michael L. Evans, a senior analyst at the National Security Archive, an investigatory nonprofit that provided The New York Times with the cables after petitioning that they be declassified.He added: \u201cIn these cables we learn more about the allegations that most worried the Embassy: the aviation licenses for cartel figures; his financial ties to the Ochoa clan; and above all the possibility that he might be indebted to them.\u201dMr. Uribe served as president from 2002 to 2010 and was considered America\u2019s closest ally in the region in the war against drug traffickers. He negotiated a deal to demobilize paramilitary groups in 2004 and delivered the blows to leftist rebels that led to a peace deal under his successor in 2016. Both were financed by the cocaine trade.But questions persist about possible connections between Mr. Uribe and illegal activity.Colombia\u2019s Supreme Court has ordered an investigation into a witness-tampering case against Mr. Uribe involving the Bloque Metro, a paramilitary and drug trafficking group based in Medell\u00edn. Mr. Uribe\u2019s brother, Santiago, is awaiting trial on charges that he ran a death squad called the Twelve Apostles from his ranch.The American cables offer a window into the accusations Mr. Uribe faced during his political rise.In the 1990s, a time marked by escalating drug violence and corruption in Colombia, Mr. Uribe emerged as a \u201cyoung leader with a rosy future\u201d and a \u201cbright star on the Colombian political scene,\u201d the diplomatic cables say.However, diplomats also came across accusations that tarnished that reputation.Mr. V\u00e9lez, the senator who said Mr. Uribe\u2019s campaign was financed by the Ochoa drug family, told diplomats about a meeting that was arranged in the 1990s between Mr. Uribe, two other politicians and the wife of Mr. Escobar. The meeting had been secret until Mr. Escobar published a letter about it, and the diplomats wanted to know how it had come about.Mr. V\u00e9lez said Mr. Escobar had used the Ochoas, lieutenants in the Medell\u00edn cartel, to organize the meeting \u201cto open a communication channel to\u201d C\u00e9sar Gaviria, Colombia\u2019s then-president, as a personal favor to them.Asked by embassy officials about the meeting, Mr. Uribe said it had occurred and that he had expected to meet Mr. Escobar\u2019s mother, not his wife, to discuss Mr. Escobar\u2019s surrender, one cable said. \u201cHe absolutely rejects any thoughts of dialogue or concessions to Escobar,\u201d diplomats wrote.In another cable from March 1993, diplomats raised doubts about Mr. Uribe, citing his connection to Ernesto Samper, who became Colombia\u2019s president in 1994. The cable said \u201cthere is substance to rumors\u201d that Mr. Samper, Mr. Uribe and a third politician linked to Mr. Samper were linked to drug traffickers.\u201cRumors of the involvement of these three with narcotics traffickers abound,\u201d the cable said, adding that they believed Mr. Samper, if elected, would be soft on drug traffickers.Diplomats were puzzled about the information they received, as Mr. Uribe met with them repeatedly to discuss plans for stopping drug trafficking.A cable from July 1993 said: \u201cSenator Uribe has proved an enigma to the embassy \u2014 his family ties to narcos (he is a cousin to the Ochoas) plus rumors from credible contacts taint him, but past declarations against the traffickers and vehement protestations to the embassy,\u201d wrote diplomats, \u201csay otherwise.\u201dA March 1995 cable describes information diplomats received around 1992 about an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Uribe to nominate \u201ca person associated with a known narcotics trafficking family\u201d as his party\u2019s candidate for mayor of Medell\u00edn. When that effort failed, Mr. Uribe then tried to nominate an uncle of Mr. Escobar, which was \u201calso shot down,\u201d the cable said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "White House to Impose Metal Tariffs on E.U., Canada and Mexico", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Union, Canada and Mexico, which will face 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, quickly denounced the action and drew up lists of tit-for-tat measures, many aimed at parts of the United States where President Trump enjoys his strongest political support.The tariffs \u201chave already had major, positive effects on steel and aluminum workers and jobs and will continue to do so long into the future,\u201d White House officials said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, the Trump administration\u2019s actions underscore its commitment to good-faith negotiations with our allies to enhance our national security while supporting American workers.\u201dBy keeping trading partners guessing, the president has sought to create leverage in trade negotiations, including in talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. But in the process, he has sowed an atmosphere of chaos among allies as well as manufacturers uncertain about the ultimate impact on their vast supply chains.The latest twist in the trade drama does little to alleviate the confusion among business owners and foreign leaders. Although the Trump administration signaled a tougher stance with the tariffs, it also left open the possibility for continued negotiations with affected countries.As trade tensions escalate, Europe, Canada and Mexico are threatening to respond in kind, raising the potential of an all-out trade war.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, on Thursday, called the tariffs \u201cillegal,\u201d while saying \u201cthe measures carry the threat of a spiral of escalation that will result in damaging everyone.\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that Canada \u201ccould be considered a national security threat.\u201d Within minutes of the American action, Mexico had detailed a list of goods to target for retaliation, including steel, pork, apples, cranberries and cheeses.\u201cFor the first time in generations, we\u2019ve really thrown out the rule book with our best trading partners,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents some of the largest exporters in the United States. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect them to continue business as usual with us if we are throwing out the rules. So that means everything from airplanes to agriculture is on the chopping block.\u201dBut the tariffs loomed in the backdrop as the administration continued to negotiate with Mexico and Canada over Nafta and European officials over other trade matters. Neither talks achieved much.On Nafta, the Trump administration had been pushing for a quick conclusion to ensure the deal passed through Congress this year. But negotiations have sputtered as the countries remain deeply divided on several important issues, like the rules for automobile manufacturing.Mr. Trudeau said the countries had the broad lines of \u201ca decent win-win-win deal\u201d last week. He spoke to Mr. Trump and offered to travel to Washington so they could work out the final details.But Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday phoned to tell the Canadian prime minister that the precondition of a deal was a sunset clause, meaning the pact would automatically expire unless the three countries voted to continue it. The idea has drawn ire from both foreign leaders and business executives, who say it undercuts the surety that trade agreements are meant to create.\u201cI had to highlight that there was no possibility of any Canadian prime minister signing a Nafta deal that included a five-year sunset clause,\u201d said Mr. Trudeau, \u201cand obviously the visit didn\u2019t happen.\u201dEuropean officials had tried offering the United States a limited trade deal. They wanted to avoid tit-for-tat actions \u2014 something they view as unproductive, economically perilous and detrimental to the increasingly fraught relationship between the longtime allies.Allies have vowed to challenge the legal statute the Trump administration used to roll out the tariffs, which is related to national security.The Trump administration has argued that imports have weakened the country\u2019s industrial base, and, by extension, its ability to produce tanks, weapons and armored vehicles. \u201cWe take the view that without a strong economy, you can\u2019t have strong national security,\u201d the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said Thursday.The European Union and Canada have objected strongly to the idea that they pose any kind of threat to national security, citing their close alliances and defense agreements with the United States. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, called the steel and aluminum tariffs announced by the White House on Thursday \u201cprotectionism, pure and simple.\u201dWith the tariffs set to go into effect at midnight, all three allies are readying their counterattacks.Canada announced corresponding tariffs on a broad list of American exports, including steel and aluminum, as well as dozens of basic consumer products like ketchup, insecticides and laundry machines. The Canadian tariffs, which go into effect July 1, will cover $12.8 billion worth of American goods, the value of Canadian steel and aluminum exports to the United States in 2017.\u201cThis is the strongest trade action Canada has taken in the postwar era,\u201d said Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland. \u201cThis is a very strong Canadian action in response to a very bad U.S. decision.\u201dAlong with fighting the tariffs at the World Trade Organization, European officials have been preparing levies on an estimated $3 billion of imported American products in late June. In a joint statement, ministers from France and Germany said the countries would coordinate their response.\u201cGlobal trade is not a gunfight at the O.K. Corral,\u201d Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s finance minister, said on Thursday after meeting with Mr. Ross. \u201cIt\u2019s not about who attacks whom, and then wait and see who is still standing at the end.\u201dWhether American consumers and companies get caught in the crossfire depends on how it all plays out.American metal manufacturers say that has helped to level the playing field. Century Aluminum, which has supported the tariffs, said the action \u201cprotects thousands of American aluminum workers and puts U.S. national security first.\u201dBut it has left businesses that rely on imported metals, like beer makers, auto manufacturers and others, exposed. And now that the tariffs will hit America\u2019s closest allies, some early supporters are changing their view.Canada is the largest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the United States, and the supply chains for many products snake back and forth across the border. The United Steelworkers union, which represents members in Canada as well as the United States, said the decision called \u201cinto serious question\u201d the design and direction of the administration\u2019s trade strategy.\u201cThe regular chaos surrounding our flawed trade policies is undermining the ability to project a reasoned course and ensure that we can improve domestic production and employment,\u201d the union said in a statement.The Aluminum Association, the industry trade group, also said it was disappointed. Heidi Brock, the group\u2019s president, said the tariffs would do little to address the larger issue of overcapacity in China \u201cwhile potentially alienating allies and disrupting supply chains that more than 97 percent of U.S. aluminum industry jobs rely upon.\u201dThe steel and aluminum tariffs already appear to be hurting construction companies, retailers and manufacturers \u2014 by raising their costs and injecting uncertainty into the price and availability of the metals going forward.The Federal Reserve\u2019s latest Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes about the health of regional economies, contains more than two dozen references to business fears that the administration\u2019s trade policies, and the steel and aluminum tariffs in particular, would hurt sales and profits.In a more pointed statement, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, called the tariffs \u201cdumb.\u201d\u201cEurope, Canada and Mexico are not China, and you don\u2019t treat allies the same way you treat opponents,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Liz Alderman in Paris; Elisabeth Malkin in Mexico City; Catherine Porter in Toronto; Jim Tankersley in Washington; Melissa Eddy in Berlin; Ian Austen in Ottawa; and Milan Schreuer in Brussels.Advertisement"}

In 2018, a better question is, why not?What was once a life-consuming, deeply romantic \u2014 or at least deeply romanticized \u2014 struggle to get signed, get heard and get along is now, for many bands of a certain vintage, a more comfortable experience, free of the pressures that may have contributed to their demise decades ago.

Ms. Donelly released four solo albums and raised two daughters with her husband of 22 years.

{"Headline": "Lawyers in Cohen Case to Appear in Court to Negotiate Disputes", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile it is possible that the early-morning searches could eventually result in criminal charges, the broader inquiry that led to them is, for now, bogged down in two legal disputes about the cache of materials that was seized. On Wednesday morning, five sets of lawyers in the case are expected to appear in Federal District Court in Manhattan to work toward resolving both of the quarrels \u2014 negotiations that will affect how the case moves forward.The most important (and, perhaps, most complicated) argument concerns the question of whether any of the paperwork or data swept up in the raids may be protected by the lawyer-client privilege that Mr. Cohen shared with Mr. Trump. After the raids, Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers asked the judge in the case, Kimba M. Wood, for an order to prevent the government from making that decision, saying that they and lawyers for Mr. Trump were best suited to determine the issue of privilege. Calling that request unusual, federal prosecutors told Judge Wood that, under normal circumstances, a team of their colleagues who were not directly involved in the matter would be the ones to sort through the materials and set to the side any that contained privileged information.When Mr. Cohen\u2019s apartment, hotel room and office were raided, some of the seized materials concerned negotiations between Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford\u2019s former lawyer, Keith Davidson, who were working out the details of a $130,000 payment designed to keep Ms. Clifford quiet about her relationship with Mr. Trump. Mr. Avenatti has said he suspects that Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson secretly conspired to strike the deal to Ms. Clifford\u2019s disadvantage, and he has asked Judge Wood for permission both to appear and to formally intervene in the case.But Mr. Avenatti has also used his newfound celebrity in the case to wage a relentless publicity campaign against Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump and other members of the Trump legal team in a barrage of social media posts and televised appearances on issues that have strayed beyond the boundaries of the case.While Judge Wood may rule on Wednesday on Mr. Avenatti\u2019s requests, the review of the materials that prompted them is expected to continue for another few weeks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cadillac Makes Great Cars. Too Bad Americans Want S.U.V.s.", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsWhen General Motors recruited Johan de Nysschen to lead Cadillac in 2014, the prominent auto executive hoped for a cavalry of new sport-utility vehicles to shore up the luxury brand\u2019s weakest position.As it awaited reinforcements, Cadillac soldiered on with a legion of widely praised sports sedans, the kind of beautifully engineered vehicles its German rivals would have been proud to call their own.\u201cCadillac is just not selling what people want to buy today, especially in America,\u201d said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Kelley Blue Book.G.M. had lured Mr. de Nysschen \u2014 the rare company outsider to lead a G.M. division \u2014 on the strength of a successful stint atop Audi of America. His first major act was to place physical and psychological distance between Cadillac and Detroit, moving Cadillac\u2019s headquarters from Motown to Manhattan\u2019s SoHo neighborhood in 2015.\u201cHow is it possible that we have so few crossovers from this iconic American luxury brand?\u201d Mr. de Nysschen said in an interview at the time. \u201cThe Germans have more than I can count on two hands.\u201dAt BMW alone, that count now includes the X1, X2, X3, X4, X5 and X6, with the most expensive, the three-row X7, arriving next year. All that from a German brand that built its reputation on high-performance sport sedans and was once criticized for pandering to American tastes by building S.U.V.s. In ironic contrast, while G.M. is known for its expertise in S.U.V.s and trucks, Cadillac has just one car-based S.U.V.: the midsize XT5, which merely replaced the defunct SRX.The result is that Cadillac, a brand that had begun to transform its stodgy, retiree-only image during G.M.\u2019s post-bankruptcy comeback, is struggling. Cadillac\u2019s annual domestic sales had rebounded above 180,000 in 2013, up from about 110,000 in the recession doldrums of 2009. But sales plunged to 156,000 by 2017, even as the German brands were soaring. In the closely watched luxury race, Mercedes rode its own S.U.V.-heavy lineup to 337,236 sales in 2017, while BMW found 305,685 buyers, nipping Lexus\u2019s 305,132.Now, GM\u2019s leadership has replaced the South African-born Mr. de Nysschen with Steve Carlisle, the president of G.M. Canada, who joined the company 36 years ago. In a statement, Dan Ammann, G.M.\u2019s president said that Mr. de Nysschen had set \u201ca stronger foundation\u201d for Cadillac.\u201cLooking forward, the world is changing rapidly, and, beginning with the launch of the new XT4, it is paramount that we capitalize immediately on the opportunities that arise from this rate of change,\u201d Mr. Ammann said.That 2019 XT4 finally goes on sale this fall, priced from $35,790, and it will need to elbow its way through a crowded party of compact S.U.V.s. A three-row XT6 is also in the works, but George Peterson, president of the research firm AutoPacific, did not expect it to arrive before 2020. Mr. Peterson already counts some 38 small crossovers in the marketplace, ranging from $20,000 to more than $90,000, and said that count should soon reach 45.\u201cCadillac is recognizing that it\u2019s a crossover world, but they\u2019ve been slow to get off the dime,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be launching into the teeth of a hugely competitive battleground.\u201dCadillac may have had a chance to move more quickly.Following his hiring, Mr. de Nysschen tried to persuade G.M.\u2019s leadership to move S.U.V.s to the front of the development line, according to two company officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters. Traditional sedans and coupes that were already in the product pipeline, including the flagship CT6, proceeded on course. Despite wildly positive reviews, they have mostly fallen flat with S.U.V.-besotted consumers.Another former G.M. executive, Robert A. Lutz, can empathize with the predicament Mr. de Nysschen faced. Mr. Lutz, a former Chrysler and BMW executive, was also a high-wattage outsider facing huge expectations when G.M. lured him out of retirement in 2001, naming him vice chairman and giving him far-reaching control over G.M.\u2019s designs and product lineups. In contrast, Mr. Lutz said, Mr. de Nysschen lacked veto power and had to answer to several higher-ranking executives.\u201cJohan was a very able executive, certainly able to run a premium brand,\u201d Mr. Lutz said. \u201cBut he was never fully in charge.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say Mr. de Nysschen did not have successes.Mr. Lutz said Mr. de Nysschen had done critical dirty work by breaking Cadillac\u2019s habit of dumping production into rental fleets to plump sales numbers, a practice that marred the brand\u2019s image, retail prices and resale values. By April, according to J.D. Power data, retail buyers paid an average of nearly $54,000 for their Cadillacs, second only to Mercedes among luxury brands.Mr. de Nysschen also helped expand Cadillac\u2019s international reach: Even as its American sales fell 8 percent last year, Cadillac\u2019s 175,000 sales in booming China brought its global total above 356,000, approaching 1978\u2019s historical high for the 115-year-old brand. And Cadillac\u2019s semiautonomous Super Cruise technology \u2014 which allows full hands-free driving on most major highways \u2014 is being hailed by some critics as superior to Tesla\u2019s vaunted Autopilot, particularly for its emphasis on safe operation.But Mr. de Nysschen also frustrated Cadillac dealers with Project Pinnacle, his carrot-and-stick plan that offered tiered incentives to dealers who invested in showroom upgrades and Lexus-style customer service \u2014 and steered others toward $180,000 franchise buyouts.Mr. Lutz suspected that de Nysschen\u2019s physical separation from Detroit made it harder to win allies and arguments alike. He recalled poring over clay models of car designs during his G.M. tenure, and being able to march into a finance executive\u2019s office if he had removed $200 worth of chrome that Mr. Lutz viewed as critical.\u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Where did the chrome go?\u201d Mr. Lutz said. \u201cYou stare him in the eye, argue with him and get it fixed. Even in this day of electronic connectedness, distance matters.\u201dMr. Brauer, the Kelley Blue Book publisher, panned Cadillac\u2019s move to New York as window-dressing. It might have made sense, he said, if the brand had set up design studios or engineering in New York, but those linchpins of auto creativity remained in Detroit. The change of address seemed a dubious sequel, Mr. Brauer said. Between his time at Audi and Cadillac, Mr. de Nysschen led Infiniti, where he convinced its parent, Nissan, to move its luxury headquarters from Japan to Hong Kong.Some observers fault Mr. de Nysschen for spending too much effort chasing the Germans, including by challenging them on their literal home turf: the famed N\u00fcrburgring circuit. Cadillac\u2019s 640-horsepower, nearly 200-m.p.h. CTS-V became the world\u2019s first production sedan to circle the 12.9-mile track in less than 8 minutes.But Mr. Lutz, who forged his own industry reputation as an ultimate \u201ccar guy\u201d by birthing performance legends like the Dodge Viper and the CTS-V, said that most of today\u2019s luxury buyers were oblivious to the nuances of speed or handling.\u201cNot one in 1,000 Americans even knows where the N\u00fcrburgring is,\u201d he said.When he was hired, Mr. de Nysschen said that Cadillac would be a distinctly American alternative, on par with any rival in design, quality and performance. But, reached via email, Mr. de Nysschen rejected the idea that Cadillac \u201chas been trying to \u2018chase the Germans.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe team absolutely wants to leverage the unique American heritage,\u201d he wrote, while rebuilding Cadillac\u2019s reputation for excellence in such areas as craftsmanship and fit-and-finish.\u201cI believe that is a noble pursuit, worthy of an iconic brand such as Cadillac.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, relying on information from Cadillac, misstated the source of data on the average sale price of its vehicles.

{"Headline": "De Blasio Moves to Bring Safe Injection Sites to New York City", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio is championing a plan that would make New York City a pioneer in creating supervised injection sites for illegal drug users, part of a novel but contentious strategy to combat the epidemic of fatal overdoses caused by the use of heroin and other opioids.The endorsement of the strategy by New York, the largest city in the country, which last year saw 1,441 overdose deaths, may give the movement behind it impetus.For the sites to open, New York City must still clear some significant hurdles. At minimum, the plan calls for the support of several district attorneys, and, more critically, the State Department of Health, which answers to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The city sent a letter on Thursday to the state, asserting its intention to open four injection centers.The plan calls for four sites to open after a 6- to 12-month period of outreach to the communities where they will be located. They would operate as pilot programs for a year.At the sites, which would be called Overdose Prevention Centers, trained staff would be available to administer medications, such as naloxone, to counteract drug overdoses. Social workers would also be on hand to possibly counsel drug users in the hope that they could be steered into programs intended to help them with their addiction.The sites would be financed and run by nonprofit groups authorized by the city, and may be located within social service providers that already operate needle exchange sites.The mayor\u2019s office said that the centers would be located in Washington Heights and Midtown West in Manhattan; the Longwood section of the Bronx; and Gowanus, Brooklyn.\u201cAfter a rigorous review of similar efforts across the world, and after careful consideration of public health and safety expert views, we believe overdose prevention centers will save lives and get more New Yorkers into the treatment they need to beat this deadly addiction,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.Mr. de Blasio has faced pressure from activist groups who support safe injection sites, and who have staged demonstrations at City Hall that have included civil disobedience, with numerous protesters, including City Council members, arrested.But even as the mayor unveiled his plan, he seemed to be doing so at arm\u2019s length. On Thursday morning, he held a news conference on the sunny Brooklyn waterfront to discuss ferry service, with no mention of the injection sites.City Hall officials refused to make Mr. de Blasio available for an interview; the earliest he could answer questions about the plan would be Friday, in his weekly appearance on New York Public Radio.The plan is based on a report commissioned in 2016 by the City Council and pushed by the Council speaker, Corey Johnson, when he was chairman of the health committee. The report was completed months ago but its release was delayed by City Hall as the mayor weighed his decision.\u201cThis is ultimately about saving lives while we have a major opioid crisis in New York City and around the country,\u201d Mr. Johnson said on Thursday, after speaking with Mr. de Blasio about the proposal.The letter sent on Thursday from Deputy Mayor Herminia Palacio to Howard A. Zucker, the state health commissioner, asked him to authorize or license four injection sites. The letter said that Dr. Zucker had the authority to permit such sites if they were part of a \u201cresearch study.\u201d\u201cYou are authorized to license research studies that may include the possession of controlled substances,\u201d the letter said. It cited as a precedent the authorization by the state health commissioner of needle exchanges in the early 1990s. Those exchanges began as an effort to halt the spread of H.I.V. among drug users who shared needles.The state health department said that it would review the city\u2019s request. \u201cWe of course support the mission of reducing opioid-related deaths and have been studying multiple options for combating the opioid epidemic,\u201d Gary Holmes, a spokesman, said in an emailed statement.The most serious obstacle to the safe injection sites may be the federal government. A section of federal law known as the crack house statute makes it illegal to own, rent or operate a location for the purpose of unlawfully using a controlled substance.The enforcement of the statute in the case of safe injection sites, however, would be up to the discretion of federal authorities. While it is unclear how the Trump Justice Department will respond to the city\u2019s proposal, the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has taken a hard line on drug policy.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe a president who has routinely voiced concern about the national opioid epidemic will use finite federal law enforcement resources to prevent New York City from saving lives,\u201d Eric F. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s press secretary, said in a written statement.There were 1,441 drug overdose deaths in New York City last year, according to a study commissioned by the City Council, an increase from 1,374 deaths in 2016. Officials have said that more people die of overdoses in New York than the combined total of deaths by murder, suicide and vehicle crashes. In data for the first nine months of 2017, Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had the greatest number of overdose deaths with 260. The Bronx, with a smaller population, was second with 250.The Bronx and Staten Island have the highest rate of overdose deaths. In 2016, the Bronx saw 32 overdose deaths per 100,000 residents, and Staten Island had 30 deaths per 100,000.Eric Gonzalez and Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorneys for Brooklyn and Manhattan, said that they supported the mayor\u2019s plan. Darcel D. Clark, the Bronx district attorney, said that she was \u201copen-minded on the matter\u201d and needed more information to draw a conclusion.San Francisco may be on track to be the first American city to open a safe injection site. Rachael Kagan, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Department of Public Health, said that officials expected to open two centers in the late summer or the fall \u2014 although officials there had previously said they hoped to open them by July. She said officials were \u201caddressing the legal and siting issues.\u201dPhiladelphia announced in January that it expected to open sites within 18 months.Advertisement"}

They Were the Last to Know.", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsJean Kim first spotted her future husband on a chilly day in 2002 at Amherst College. She was on the rooftop terrace of Valentine Hall, a dining facility that was doubling as a dormitory, when she looked out onto the campus grounds and Bryan Woo caught her eye.\u201cHe has this cocky strut,\u201d Ms. Kim, 33, recalled. \u201cHe was completely bald, he wore this giant puffy jacket and flip flops in the cold. I thought to myself, \u2018Who is this scary-looking guy?\u2019\u201dMr. Woo and Ms. Kim, it turned out, couldn\u2019t be more different. He is a New York City native, unnerved by the silent countryside of Amherst, Mass. She acclimated easier coming from a New Jersey suburb. He was private-school educated. She went to public schools her whole life.At Northern Valley Regional High School at Demarest, N.J., Ms. Kim had a natural aptitude for both academics and athletics. She made the all-state orchestra for violin and the varsity volleyball team, where she helped the team to a state championship her senior year.Although both Mr. Woo and Ms. Kim coincidentally enrolled in the same Japanese Aesthetics class \u2014 he loved anime; she respected the culture \u2014 they interacted mainly because of mutual friends. During their freshman year, Mr. Woo grew close to four of his Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity brothers, who quickly formed an inseparable crew. Three of them also lived in Valentine Hall, along with Ms. Kim.\u201cThey all looked after me as a little sister, but I was still one of the guys,\u201d she said.Then, in 2004, Ms. Kim fell between a stairwell banister, fracturing her right wrist and jaw and dislocating her hip. She took the year off to recover. In 2005, Mr. Woo started dating Ms. Kim\u2019s friend during his junior year. Upon Ms. Kim\u2019s return, the three of them would often spend time together.\u201cIt was very platonic,\u201d Mr. Woo said of their deepening friendship. \u201cAlthough, somehow in every single photo we have of us three, Bryan is trying to eat my face,\u201d Ms. Kim added, laughing.After the relationship between Mr. Wood and Ms. Kim\u2019s friend dissolved in 2008, Ms. Kim remained a confidante to both parties.Mr. Woo, who had a double major in economics and psychology, returned to New York after graduating in 2006. He traded real estate bonds for NorthStar Realty Finance. Then, in September 2008, he moved to Seoul, South Korea, for a job at Mirae Asset Global Investments. He resided on Yeouido Island, which, coincidentally, was where Ms. Kim\u2019s parents and maternal grandparents had at one time lived.Ms. Kim graduated in 2007 with a degree in English, and that summer started a career in marketing analytics at Viacom in Manhattan. She currently works as a senior account manager of the Enthuse Marketing Group.Although both actively dated other people, their approaches were very different. \u201cDating was never just fun for me,\u201d said Ms. Kim, who viewed relationships as a means to finding a potential life partner and settling down. Mr. Woo courted women casually, with relationships lasting from one to six months.After Mr. Woo returned from Seoul in 2010, he became the director of acquisitions at his family\u2019s firm. That October, Ms. Kim received an unexpected phone call from Mr. Woo. Eventually they caught up over dinner at BCD Tofu House in Koreatown \u2014 but not before Ms. Kim had tried to reschedule.Mr. Woo insisted on their original date. The reason? His cousin\u2019s archery tournament was on the alternate day she had suggested. \u201cI never expected him to prioritize his baby cousin or family,\u201d Ms. Kim said. \u201cThat stood out to me.\u201dFrom then on, their encounters were casual and often in group settings. \u201cI would ask her about my dating life because she was the only female opinion that I trusted,\u201d Mr. Woo said. Ms. Kim was in relationships, but Mr. Woo never approved of her suitors.In October 2014, Mr. Woo invited Ms. Kim on a weekend trip to Connecticut with Amherst friends. As the only singles, their friends \u201chad very strategically put us in the barn together that night,\u201d Ms. Kim said.\u201cWe kept saying we have to make sure we get married later in life \u2014 only to other people,\u201d Mr. Woo recalled of their evening.Nothing romantic transpired (much to those friends\u2019 disappointment), but the weekend revealed a different side of Mr. Woo. \u201cI was surprised that Bryan wanted to get married and have a family,\u201d Ms. Kim said. \u201cUntil then, I thought he was just a playboy.\u201dThree weeks later, Mr. Woo invited Ms. Kim and some friends to a fund-raiser. When Mr. Woo arrived with a date, Ms. Kim was surprised. \u201cThree weeks ago, we were consoling each other, saying \u2018You\u2019ll find someone.\u2019\u201d Upon seeing the other woman, Ms. Kim believed that finding love \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like a big dilemma for him.\u201dEventually the evening progressed to a Chinatown bar, then Mr. Woo\u2019s apartment. Once Mr. Woo\u2019s date left, his childhood friend, Charles Clinton, became frustrated. \u201cWhen you see two people who are in love sometimes it\u2019s very obvious,\u201d Mr. Clinton said.\u201cClearly you\u2019re in love with Jean,\u201d Mr. Clinton said to Mr. Woo. \u201cJust go tell her that.\u201dWhile Ms. Kim retreated to the restroom, Mr. Woo shooed everyone from his apartment. When she emerged, he confessed his feelings. \u201cI think I really like you,\u201d Ms. Kim remembered him saying. Not wanting to hurt their friendship, she replied, \u201cI think me too.\u201dThe next morning, Mr. Woo left for a 10-day business trip. When he returned, he organized a formal \u201cbusiness meeting\u201d over dinner at Gaonurri in Koreatown. Despite the risks to their friendship, they decided to give a relationship the old college try.A week later, Mr. Woo planned a romantic getaway to Cold Spring, N.Y. Although both describe the weekend as \u201cvery awkward,\u201d the butterflies were there. \u201cI was so giddy,\u201d Ms. Kim remembered when they held hands.After that, Mr. Woo and Ms. Kim felt at ease with their romance. Their friends? Not so much. Most were skeptical, given Mr. Woo\u2019s dating record. One friend, Alister Dabreo, told Mr. Woo, \u201cIf you date Jean, you better marry Jean.\u201dMr. Clinton noted that Mr. Woo \u201chas a very kind heart that you didn\u2019t always see with women, but that was immediately evident with Jean.\u201dMr. Woo\u2019s father, Young S. Woo, agreed. \u201cBryan is not exactly a soft guy, lovely guy or quiet guy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut every time he sees Jean he becomes like a pussy cat.\u201dOn New Year\u2019s Eve in 2014, Mr. Woo told Ms. Kim he loved her. \u201cShe\u2019s such a complement to me,\u201d Mr. Woo explained. \u201cShe\u2019s able to read me and understand my motivations in ways I don\u2019t fully comprehend.\u201d One year later, they discussed marriage.On Feb. 10, 2017, Mr. Woo proposed to Ms. Kim at his family\u2019s country house in Garrison, N.Y. He surprised Ms. Kim with two stacked bamboo steamers on an outside table. The first contained Ms. Kim\u2019s favorite food, dumplings. In the bottom, she discovered a ring box.On April 14, they were married before 260 guests (including Martha Stewart, who is a friend of the groom\u2019s family) in the Bronx Post Office. The building holds special significance for Mr. Woo, whose family firm purchased the landmark building in 2014. His parents also met 10 blocks away from the historic site \u2014 his father had delivered rice from a Korean grocery store to his mother\u2019s apartment in 1972.Ms. Kim wore a pale blush, strapless lace dress by Monique Lhuillier. Mr. Woo donned a white tuxedo jacket and black pants by Ermenegildo Zegna. Mr. Clinton, who had prompted his friends to express their love four years ago, became ordained through the Universal Life Church. He officiated alongside his wife, Jacqueline Clinton. The bride\u2019s brother, Daniel Kim, read \u201cLove in Action\u201d from Romans 12:9-16.After Ms. Kim agreed to take Mr. Woo as her husband, Mrs. Clinton paused, asking: \u201cAre you sure, Jean?\u201d Laughter erupted in the room.Ivory and white velour curtains transformed the industrial space, which was finished only days before the wedding, into a romantic setting. After cocktail hour in the historic lobby, the 16-person bridal party emerged into the dimly lit reception area to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop \u2019Til You Get Enough.\u201d During the couple\u2019s first dance, Mr. Woo dramatically dipped his wife backward to Etta James crooning \u201cat last my love has come along.\u201dWhile guests noshed on branzino, steak and pasta, the groom\u2019s brother, He-myong, shared a slide show of Mr. Woo. His Korean name, He-ryong, means bright dragon. For a time, Mr. Woo was pure dragon. Under Ms. Kim\u2019s influence, He-myong said he saw his brother\u2019s lightness come back. \u201cJean isn\u2019t the light, but she\u2019s a source that brings out that light in him,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cheat Sheet to the Trump Circus", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs.\u00a0Jurecic is the managing editor of Lawfare.So goes a normal week in 2018. The push alerts ping. The tweets stack up. Arguments over constitutional law and attorney-client privilege fill the airwaves. The noise roars so loudly and from so many different sources that however much we strain to listen, it\u2019s next to impossible to make sense out of it.Or to put it another way: Does any of this matter?Probably. But the unsatisfying answer is that we don\u2019t know \u2014 and we really don\u2019t know which parts will end up mattering in the long run. As the litigations and investigations move forward, though, it\u2019s worth taking a step back and considering the various legal fronts on which the president is fighting simultaneously \u2014 filtering out as much noise from the signal as we can so the stakes are clear. Think of what follows as a cheat sheet to the legal circus surrounding the White House.The Mueller investigationThough impeachment has a legal flavor, in practice it\u2019s a matter of politics. Congress would need to mutiny, and while Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings are bad, they are not bad at all among Republicans, which makes impeachment unlikely for now, given Republican control of both the House and the Senate.Election interferenceCampaign and administration contacts with RussiansThat\u2019s a lot of smoke, and we know the special counsel is looking into it: According to The Times, the subjects about which Mr. Mueller wants to interview the president include many questions about collusion. What we don\u2019t know is whether Mr. Mueller has found any fire or whether any smoke reaches the Oval Office.Obstruction of justiceObstruction requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted intentionally to impede a proceeding. That\u2019s why it\u2019s notable that so many of Mr. Mueller\u2019s potential questions for Mr. Trump seem to aim at determining the president\u2019s state of mind in dismissing Mr. Comey and pressuring Mr. Sessions not to recuse himself from the investigation. Keep in mind that Congress listed obstruction of justice among the articles of impeachment for both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.The Cohen investigationBut the real danger of the Cohen investigation, so far as the president is concerned, may simply be that the investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle have grown beyond the scope of Mr. Mueller\u2019s probe alone. The special counsel reportedly referred the Cohen case to federal prosecutors in the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. And that means that even if Mr. Trump fires the special counsel, his legal problems will not go away.Civil lawsuitsMr. Trump isn\u2019t a defendant in the latter two cases \u2014 but they still implicate his business ties and his conduct on the campaign trail. The real risk to the president will most likely come if these lawsuits can make it to the phase in which the plaintiffs can start requesting information and testimony from Mr. Trump and those around him. Remember that the \u201cdiscovery phase\u201d in the Paula Jones case was ultimately what set in motion President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment proceedings.***The jokes of 2018 are all about nihilism: \u201cNothing matters!\u201d we cheerfully, or not so cheerfully, declare. This is at its truest and most despairing when it comes to the legal chaos around the president. Perhaps none of this means anything, as Mr. Trump and many of his supporters believe. Or perhaps all of it will one day turn out to have meant everything \u2014 to the president, to the presidency, to the country.Meanwhile, the president rages. And Mr. Mueller is nearing the one-year mark of his appointment as special counsel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "First-Time Home Buyers Learn to Move Quickly in Tight Markets", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserRising home prices and a slim supply of starter homes in many areas are making this spring a challenging one for first-time buyers, real estate professionals say.And, homes sell quickly when they come on the market \u2014 especially smaller, lower-priced homes. Seasonal demand is increasing as usual, but buyers are finding that there is a lack of new listings. Homes are going under contract in about a month, the association reported, about four days faster than last year.\u201cThe starter house is nearly missing in some markets,\u201d said Jessica Lautz, the association\u2019s managing director of survey research and communication.Much new construction is aimed at more affluent buyers. And, investors \u2014 both professional and amateur \u2014 are turning to single-family homes as rental properties to diversify their holdings, creating more competition for traditional buyers when houses come on the market, said Danny Gardner, senior vice president of affordable lending and access to credit at Freddie Mac. Freddie is one of two (along with Fannie Mae) big government-controlled mortgage finance companies.Competition for all homes in general was particularly cutthroat in some areas, especially in Western markets like San Francisco and other California cities, along with parts of Texas and Colorado, according to Realtor.com, a listing website. The website also cites Boston as a \u201chot\u201d market.In Colorado Springs, Jay Gupta, a real estate agent, described an \u201cunprecedented\u201d imbalance between the supply of homes and the demand for them. Prices in Colorado Springs are rising, in part because buyers priced out of already costly areas like Denver and Boulder are seeking places that are relatively affordable, brokers say.In April, Mr. Gupta said, the Colorado Springs market had 1,524 active listings, and ended the month with 1,286 sales. Properties selling for less than $225,000 are in extremely short supply, he said: \u201cThose homes just aren\u2019t there.\u201dRecently, Mr. Gupta said, a home was listed for $310,000. Forty people attended a three-hour open house, and the property went under contract to a buyer offering $30,000 over the asking price. The buyer, who was relocating from out of state, apparently grew tired of seeing his offers on other houses get declined, Mr. Gupta said.In addition to daunting bidding wars in some markets, first-time buyers often have trouble coming up with a down payment.Based on the median home price, a down payment of 20 percent \u2014 a longtime rule of thumb \u2014 would be more than $50,000. Amassing that much cash can be difficult. The average savings of people who do not own homes was $5,200 in 2016, according to the Realtors association, citing Federal Reserve data.The notion that a 20 percent down payment is required is increasingly a \u201cmyth,\u201d said Mr. Gardner of Freddie Mac.Both Freddie and Fannie, as they are known, support home loans to eligible buyers who put down as little as 3 percent. (The companies do not directly make home loans, but buy mortgages meeting their standards and package them as securities).Freddie Mac said it would soon expand its low down payment program to broaden the pool of buyers who can qualify. The updated program, to become available this summer, will serve first-time borrowers regardless of income.Fannie Mae was already offering its low down payment program to a broad pool of borrowers, said Jonathan Lawless, vice president of product development and affordable housing at Fannie Mae.Here are some questions and answers about home buying in a seller\u2019s market:Should I put 20 percent down on a home, if I can afford it?Making a 20 percent down payment is still a sound strategy, if you can swing it. You will usually qualify for a lower interest rate on your mortgage, and you will avoid paying for private mortgage insurance, which adds to the cost of your monthly payment.And, in hot markets where sellers can choose from several bids, a larger down payment makes you a more attractive buyer, said Kelly Moye, a broker with ReMax and a spokeswoman for the Colorado Association of Realtors. In bidding wars, she said, \u201cthe ones with the biggest down payments usually win,\u201d because they are seen as safer buyers more likely to close the deal.How can I increase my chances of getting the home I want?Shoppers should get preapproved for a loan and know what they are looking for in a home, so they are prepared to act quickly if they find one they like, Mr. Gupta said. In hot markets, you do not have time to ponder your options. Make a list of two or three \u201cmust haves,\u201d he said \u2014 whether it\u2019s a big yard or a nice view \u2014 and make those the priority so you can move fast when the opportunity arises. \u201cYou have to be more flexible,\u201d he said.What are current mortgage rates?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Discloses Cohen Payment, Raising Questions About Previous Omission", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s financial disclosure, released on Wednesday, included for the first time repayment of more than $100,000 to his personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, in 2017, raising questions about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s sworn filing from a year ago improperly omitted the debt.In a highly unusual letter, the Office of Government Ethics alerted the Justice Department on Wednesday to the omission, telling Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, that the ethics office had determined \u201cthe payment made by Mr. Cohen is required to be reported as a liability.\u201dMr. Trump repaid Mr. Cohen $100,001 to $250,000 in 2017, according to a footnote in the filing.David J. Apol, the acting director of the Office of Government Ethics, sent Mr. Rosenstein a copy of Mr. Trump\u2019s current and previous financial form, noting in his letter that \u201cyou may find the disclosure relevant to any inquiry you may be pursuing regarding the president\u2019s prior report that was signed on June 14, 2017.\u201dThe letter is not an official referral and does not constitute a finding of wrongdoing, according to lawyers.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, who prepared the document that was released on Wednesday, said that Mr. Trump was reporting the repaid debt \u201cin the interest of transparency\u201d but declared in the footnote that the transaction was \u201cnot required to be disclosed as reportable liabilities.\u201dCritics of Mr. Trump seized on the repaid debt as proof that the president should have included it in last year\u2019s statement, which was filed voluntarily in June and signed by Mr. Trump under a line that said, \u201cI certify that the statements I have made in this report are true, complete and correct to the best of my knowledge.\u201dNoah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said in a statement that the inclusion of the payment on this year\u2019s form \u201craises serious questions as to why it was not disclosed in last year\u2019s filing.\u201d The group, known as CREW, had filed a complaint with the Justice Department and the ethics office asking for an investigation into whether the payment constituted a loan.Under federal law, an official who \u201cknowingly and willfully falsifies information\u201d on a financial disclosure could face criminal charges.Marilyn L. Glynn, who served as the general counsel at the Office of Government Ethics from 1997 to 2008, said that the letter to the Justice Department was significant and unusual and that if Mr. Trump intentionally filed an inaccurate disclosure last year, he may have violated the law.But she added that the matter was now unclear \u2014 as the letter from the ethics office did not explicitly state that the agency itself had concluded there was a violation and it was hard to know exactly when Mr. Trump learned about the debt.\u201cWhat did he know and when did he know it,\u201d she said. \u201cAt time he filed it last year, he may not have known this payment was made or that a payment was made at all.\u201dMr. Giuliani said that Mr. Trump started paying Mr. Cohen back through a series of monthly installments of about $35,000 and that those payments began last year and may have carried into this year. The filing released on Wednesday capped the amount Mr. Trump paid back to Mr. Cohen in 2017 at $250,000, leaving more than $200,000 of the amount Mr. Giuliani mentioned unaccounted for.The disclosure did not preclude the possibility that federal investigators could determine the payment to Ms. Clifford violated campaign finance laws. If they conclude it was made with the intention of influencing the presidential campaign \u2014 making it an effective political contribution \u2014 it would violate election law, which caps individual donations to federal candidates at $5,400 an election cycle.Candidates are allowed to spend as much as they want on their own campaigns. And, according to the filing, Mr. Trump paid Mr. Cohen back, making Mr. Cohen\u2019s initial payment a loan. But campaign finance law treats personal loans as contributions and the $5,400 limit would have applied. Public campaign filings are also supposed to account for all loans, contributions and payments; Mr. Trump\u2019s made no mention of the Cohen arrangement.Mr. Giuliani has argued that Mr. Cohen made the payment to Ms. Clifford on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf for personal reasons unrelated to the campaign and should not, therefore, be counted as a campaign expense subject to election law restrictions. This new disclosure could help bolster that argument by Mr. Trump.Beyond the repaid debt to Mr. Cohen, the 92-page form provides the most detailed window into how Mr. Trump\u2019s finances have fared during his presidency.The document, which covers the 2017 calendar year, showed total income from Mr. Trump\u2019s business operations and investments of at least $453 million and assets valued at a minimum of $1.4 billion. The disclosure from the previous year showed total income of at least $597 million and a similar level of assets, but that report spanned nearly 16 months so is not directly comparable.Mr. Trump earned at least $1.1 million from his operations in India, the most active location overseas for the Trump Organization, with at least four current real estate projects, in Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata and Gurgaon, which is outside New Delhi.At least an additional $1.1 million came from operations in the Philippines and Istanbul and at least $558,000 from Panama, where the Trump family had a branded condominiums and hotel complex, which was renamed this year after a dispute with condo owners.The form also shows that Melania Trump earned $100,001 to $1,000,000 from Getty Images, the photo licensing company.Individual performance aside, there are broader signs that the business is retreating somewhat during the first part of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.Since he took office, Mr. Trump\u2019s name has been erased from three of his family company\u2019s prized properties. His company has watched its pipeline of deals ebb and flow. And one new line of business it has pursued is limited to quietly managing other companies\u2019 hotels that are unattached to its once-flashy brand.The president\u2019s company has also been stymied by some of the new ethics restrictions it voluntarily adopted after the election.As part of a voluntary ethics plan, the Trump Organization has not pursued new deals in foreign countries, cutting off an important stream of business that was projected to provide much of its future revenue. The Trump Organization is also subjecting all new domestic projects to vetting from an outside ethics adviser, which appears to have had a chilling effect on certain potential deals: The company has yet to open a new hotel in the United States since Mr. Trump took office.Faced with these challenges, the company has decided to focus primarily on its existing properties, which consist of 16 golf courses, a winery, seven stand-alone hotels, Mar-a-Lago and a portfolio of commercial and residential real estate properties. While the Trump Organization owns many of those properties, it shifted in recent years to branding and managing properties, rather than owning them outright.And despite rolling out two new and more affordable hotel lines \u2014 Scion, a four-star-chain, and American Idea, a budget-friendly brand \u2014 the Trump Organization has only announced one such endeavor, a deal in the Mississippi DeltaThe filing showed that Mr. Trump has received $26,667 in management fees related to the project.The head of the company\u2019s hotel division, Eric Danziger, said in March that the pipeline of current deals was \u201cstill very active,\u201d and that he was continuing to line up new Scion and American Idea hotels.Jim Rutenberg and Agustin Armendariz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

When I say hello, people ask where I\u2019m from. Ukraine, I answer. The eastern part not controlled by the government. The so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, from which I recently returned after a three-month visit.Invariably, the next questions are: \u201cOh, what\u2019s happening there? Is there a war still going on?\u201d This indicates a failure of media coverage. We write about things extensively while they are new and exciting \u2014 and drop them as soon as they get boring.The war in Ukraine has become boring. So I answer:Well, it\u2019s still taking lives at an average of one to two people every day. However, it has become so static that it\u2019s sort of weird. Two armies sit before each other, sometimes just 100 feet apart. Bound by the Minsk truce agreements of 2014 and 2015, they cannot really fight each other. But without a political solution, they cannot leave. Sometimes they exchange fire, mostly at night while international monitors sleep. Mostly it\u2019s just to let off steam.Because the fighting is so ritualized, predictable and low-profile, civilian life is returning near the front lines, where war and peace coexist bizarrely and uneasily. I\u2019ve seen a school that operates 500 feet from the front. Children are bused there along a narrow road through minefields. I\u2019ve heard that another school was shelled earlier this month. The windows were blown out while 370 children were inside. Four days later, the glass was fixed and the classes resumed. War is war, but you\u2019ve got to go to school.I\u2019ve seen people fishing and picnicking close to the front line, taking short breaks if shelling starts \u2014 if it \u201cbecomes loud,\u201d as they say.One man I met lives in his bathroom because it\u2019s the only part of his house that has survived the shelling, which was most intense early in the war, in 2014 and 2015. Another man is rebuilding his house a mile from the Donetsk airport, where fighting reignites now and then. His house has taken five hits, but the foundation is O.K. and the owner is optimistic. \u201cWhy are you doing it?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI am an old man, and I have two daughters. I want to leave the house for them in good condition, but if I wait for the war to end I might not live that long.\u201dWhen I tell these stories, people ask if I still have family there. Yes, my family remains in Donetsk. What\u2019s life like? It\u2019s hard to explain. But I try:When you think of war, you imagine terror, action and panicked people enduring bombings and shootings. There, it\u2019s different. In downtown Donetsk, life looks pretty normal: hipster coffee shops, mothers pushing strollers, and in spring blossoming lilacs and roses.But life is hard for other reasons.Ukraine\u2019s breakaway territory is the size of New York State, with about four million inhabitants facing impossible choices. Held hostage by opportunistic separatist authorities, they are simultaneously cast as outlaws by the Ukrainian government \u2014 as separatist sympathizers and disloyal citizens, whose sin was having been taken hostage. Even when they leave, as I did, accusations of treason and collaboration follow them.As a result, these people have trouble receiving pensions, traveling to \u201cmainland\u201d Ukraine and back, obtaining passports, working or voting. Locked in a ghettoized quasi-state, they are torn between both sides\u2019 unclear and repressive rules.One of my relatives runs a small business in Donetsk but finds it difficult. Ukraine\u2019s government has imposed an economic blockade on local businesses that are accountable only to the Ministry of Finance of the breakaway republic. The chairman of this ministry is known not by his given name, but by a nom de guerre \u2014 Tashkent.Every two months, my grandmother must travel to government-controlled territory to claim her pension. The trip is not fun: You spend a whole day waiting in maddeningly slow lines at multiple checkpoints. People swarm on a narrow road that bisects a minefield. Because of the lack of facilities, they use roadside bushes as lavatories and occasionally become land-mine casualties. You can avoid this by traveling with a smuggler, who bribes the checkpoint bureaucrats to skip the lines. But that costs a whole month\u2019s pension. You get to choose.A friend of mine had a grandmother who wasn\u2019t receiving her pension because she was too old for the grueling trip. She died recently. The death certificate issued by separatist authorities has no legal force, and there is no mechanism to issue a Ukrainian one for people who lived in uncontrolled territory. When my friend sought help in court, the judge demanded evidence \u2014 three witnesses to grandma\u2019s death, or a video of the funeral. So goes the surrealism of life in this war.Soon enough, the final question comes: So, whom do local people support \u2014 the separatists or the government? My answer disappoints everyone: Most support neither. It\u2019s tempting to root for good guys against bad guys in a conflict on TV, especially if Russia is involved. But when you find soldiers digging trenches in your backyard, you suddenly don\u2019t care if they are good or bad soldiers. You just want them out.Our real-life choices are seldom political. People choose to stay in the war zone for many reasons \u2014 work, property, old age, disability, sentimental attachment to home. The lack of support from the state and the stigma attached elsewhere to being a displaced person also make it sensible to stay put.Those who remain hope that somehow something will change. But hope is gradually yielding to despair and fatalism. The conflict is at a geopolitical deadlock in which everyone seems more satisfied with the status quo than with any proposed solution. Everyone except the people who must pay the price.Recently, a thoughtful interlocutor who pursued a conversation like this concluded by telling me: \u201cFrankly speaking, people in the U.S. are tired of hearing about this chronic conflict in Ukraine poisoned by corruption and the lack of political will to move anywhere.\u201dAll I could say was, \u201cIf you are tired, imagine how tired we are.\u201dAlisa Sopova, a Ukrainian freelance journalist, is currently a research scholar at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.Advertisement"}

Then, in 2017, allegations surfaced that he had himself been involved in abuse beginning early in his priesthood and continuing until he became archbishop of Melbourne. He has denied those accusations.It is unclear when the criminal trial will begin. At least two more hearings will be held before then to determine which evidence is admissible and to set a court date.\u201cThe trial could be up to a year away,\u201d said Judy Courtin, a lawyer and advocate who has represented sexual abuse victims. \u201cThe unknowns can be stressful and traumatic for survivors.\u201dBut she characterized the magistrate\u2019s decision as an important step for victims of priest abuse, saying \u201ctheir truth is being acknowledged.\u201d\u201cThe plain fact of the matter is that \u2014 well before this case began \u2014 Cardinal Pell\u2019s star in the Vatican had begun to dim,\u201d said John Allen, editor of the independent Catholic news website Crux.Mr. Allen said a common working assumption is that Francis would accept the cardinal\u2019s resignation if the trial goes ahead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Populist Parties Win Approval to Form Government", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 After 88 days of impasses and negotiations, two Italian populist parties with a history of antagonism toward the European Union received approval Thursday night to create a government that has already unsettled the Continent\u2019s political order.On Thursday, the populists reshuffled, keeping the same prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and other top players, but moving the objectionable finance minister to a less critical post.That was apparently enough to satisfy the president, who preferred an elected government to a caretaker alternative he had in reserve. The populist parties constituting the new government won the most votes in a March 4 election, promising a sweeping crackdown on the illegal immigration that helped fuel their ascent.But the president\u2019s assent was not enough to allay concerns about the actual agenda of the populists once they enter power, even though they now claim a sudden conversion to full faith in the euro.\u201cThe populist and right-wing government has a program that\u2019s dangerous for the country and the events of recent days confirm our longstanding concerns,\u201d said Maurizio Martina, a leader of the Democratic Party, which will now leave government for the opposition. \u201cTheir acts so far have been a mix of extremism, anti-Europism and iniquity.\u201dThe new government still needs to win a confidence vote in Parliament, but that was a formality. The government will be sworn in Friday.The remarkable rise of the populists now leaves Italy\u2019s traditional political establishment, left and right, in tatters. It also shocked a European Union that thought it had successfully beaten back an anti-establishment and hard-right insurgency last year.But amid all the geopolitical and economic threats to the European Union, Italy represented perhaps the gravest. And as is often the case with Italy, it was overlooked.The birthplace of fascism and for years the home of Western Europe\u2019s largest communist party, Italy again proved an incubator for political experiment. The populist parties it produced \u2014 the Five Star Movement, a party developed on the internet, and the League, a formerly northern secessionist movement \u2014 to varying degrees both blame the euro for depriving Italy of sovereignty.Like the other countries that have adopted the euro, Italy has lost its power to control interest rates, which are set by the European Union\u2019s central bank. The so-called eurozone countries also must adhere to strict fiscal rules, which are especially difficult for Italy because of its heavy debts.Economists say that if Italy, the fourth-biggest economy in the European Union, were to exit the euro it would do enormous financial damage to the country and hurt the Continent\u2019s economic stability.The political uncertainty in Italy \u2014 as well the remote possibility of leaving the euro \u2014 spooked the markets when the formation of a government by the two parties appeared likely. The combination created some of the scariest economic days for the country since the 2011 financial crisis that planted the seeds for this week\u2019s populist flowering.After a leaked draft of the alliance\u2019s government platform included proposals about leaving the eurozone and a proposed finance minister turned out to have helped write a guide to leaving the euro, the global markets dipped precipitously.Since then, however, seemingly every Five Star and League leader has disavowed their antagonism to the euro, or rather denied ever harboring any hostility to it whatsoever.On Wednesday night, League officials literally whitewashed their anti-euro history by painting over the blue \u201cBasta Euro,\u201d or no more euro, sign on its headquarters in Milan.\u201cThe euro was never in discussion,\u201d Mr. Conte, who will be sworn in Friday as prime minister with the rest of his cabinet, said in Florence on Thursday morning before traveling to Rome and then the Quirinal Palace in a plain taxi cab, the preferred transportation for the anti-establishment Five Star.But for any global investor with a search engine or European Union leader with a memory, there remained a real question as to whether the sharply negative market reaction had truly chastened the populists, or whether it simply had led them to disguise their hostility as the price of admission into power.Also unclear was how the parties, which had demanded an Italians-first approach and a dramatic restructuring of their relationship with Europe, would go about it.\u201cI will read the composition of the government,\u201d Mr. Conte said late Thursday night, minutes after receiving approval to form a government from President Mattarella.The cabinet still included the minister blocked by President Mattarella \u2014 Paolo Savona, the euro-skeptic economist. But Mr. Savona has now been moved from the powerful finance ministry to the less consequential European affairs ministry.He will nevertheless be Italy\u2019s representative in Brussels, a key spot for a coalition that wants to change the rules of the European Union.While some other key posts in the cabinet were filled with politicians experienced in working in the European Union, Mr. Conte said the leaders of Italy\u2019s populist alliance, Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini of the League, would be at his side as vice premiers.Critics have said Mr. Di Maio and Mr. Salvini will most likely be in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cWe will work intensely\u201d to implement the alliance\u2019s electoral program and \u201cwith determination to improve the quality of life of all Italians,\u201d Mr. Conte said.Populist leaders in Europe and across the Atlantic looked on with delight as they gained a powerful ally in the heart of Western Europe.Stephen K. Bannon, an architect of President Trump\u2019s own populist-themed campaign, was in Italy to celebrate the new government. He explained in an interview how, a few days after the election, he had met for hours with Mr. Salvini and other senior League officials in Milan urging them to form an alliance with Five Star.Mr. Bannon said he told Mr. Salvini, \u201cYou are the first guys who can really break the left and right paradigm. You can show that populism is the new organizing principle.\u201dHe expressed confidence others in Europe would follow.The League and Five Star both want to renegotiate treaties on budgets, migration and a range of other issues with the European Union. They also want to lift sanctions against Russia and for Italy to move closer to its president, Mr. Putin, who once said he did not need to meddle in the Italian election because it was all going his way.The political breakthrough between Five Star and the League seemed both inevitable and frustratingly out of reach.An inconclusive election led to months of stalemate. Mr. Mattarella threatened to form a caretaker government, which triggered the formation of an alliance between the Five Star and League parties. After weeks of intense negotiations, they presented a prime minister and a cabinet that Mr. Mattarella rejected.The president was about to exercise his authority to create a caretaker government but held off, as the populist parties struggled to give it another shot.Mr. Di Maio, 31, triumphant after his party claimed a third of the March vote, was this week reduced to imploring Mr. Salvini to abandon his calls for another election. With grumbling growing inside his own party, Mr. Di Maio needed help forming a government.Ultimately, Mr. Salvini, with a performance Machiavelli would be proud of, accepted and gained plenty of influence in the government.In the hours immediately following the official announcement about the new government, Mr. Salvini returned triumphantly to his northern Italian base.He said he looked forward to \u201csnipping\u201d the billions of euros in the Italian budget reserved for \u201cmaintaining immigrants in the country.\u201dIn a retort to the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who suggested that Italians must work harder and be less corrupt, Mr. Salvini made clear that the days of Italy going \u201chat in hand\u201d to Brussels were over.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Next New Thing in Finance \u2014 Bonds Linked Directly to the Economy", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewWhen the next big recession comes, we\u2019ll be much better off if governments have established a new kind of bond tied to the ups and downs of the economy.In fact, just such a financial innovation is almost ready for the marketplace.The investment vehicle, called a G.D.P.-linked bond because it is tied to fluctuations in a country\u2019s gross domestic product, would be immensely valuable to cash-strapped governments when revenue fell and debt-service costs climbed. In those circumstances, payments on G.D.P.-linked bonds would decline. That\u2019s because the bonds automatically reduce debt payments as the economy weakens, a boon to governments but not obviously a good thing for investors.In boom times, on the other hand, investors would profit as national economies grow and payouts on the bonds increase. If G.D.P-linked bonds had been on the market, global investors could have cashed in on the rapid growth of China\u2019s economy over the past few decades by buying the Chinese version of such bonds. This would not have been the same as investing in Chinese stocks, which would have represented a claim only on earnings of then-traded corporations based in China.The idea behind these bonds may seem strange. But many financial innovations that are now commonplace also seemed strange at one time.Consider the inflation-linked bonds known as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or T.I.P.S. They are standard, unexciting and very useful now. But that wasn\u2019t always the case.Many people are interested in buying them now.In December, T.I.P.S. accounted for 9 percent of the federal debt held by the public, or more than $1 trillion. While inflation is low now, people perceive that there remains a risk it could rise, which has sustained a strong market for those bonds.Basically, once the market sets an appropriate price for G.D.P.-linked bonds, their benefits are straightforward.From the Treasury\u2019s standpoint, the bonds would be helpful in a major financial crisis, when economic growth, inflation and tax revenue fall but conventional debt stays burdensome. Without G.D.P.-linked bonds \u2014 or extraordinary intervention by government or multilateral institutions, as happened in the most recent global financial crisis \u2014 a nation can find itself at risk of default.In a crisis like that, investors would suffer as bond payments declined. In expansions, however, investors would benefit. In the United States, for example, bondholders can probably expect strong long-term growth in gross domestic product, which has risen 3.2 percent a year in real dollars, or 6.1 percent in nominal dollars, since 1929. Foreign investors should want such bonds to diversify their holdings.Purchases of G.D.P.-linked bonds by investors outside the United States would be good for the American government because foreigners would be assuming part of this country\u2019s economic risks from all causes, including global warming.Furthermore, if countries around the world issued G.D.P.-linked bonds, truly diversified global portfolios would be possible, allowing investors to share in risk and to benefit from growth. Modern finance tells us that this would lead to safer, not riskier portfolios.Some technical details still need to be worked out.It is not clear, for example, how credit rating agencies would rate these new bonds. They do not rate equities today and might conclude that individual G.D.P.-linked bonds were too similar to stocks in their risk/return profiles to permit a bond rating.One legal issue to be resolved is whether G.D.P.-linked bonds would come with provisions that allowed disputes to be settled by a vote of a supermajority of investors, who have come to expect this protection from so-called collective action clauses in other types of sovereign bonds.Specifically, a trill would pay an annual dividend equal to one trillionth of that particular year\u2019s G.D.P., and would do so without any end date. This would define the bonds in a transparent way, implying that they are natural extensions of stock markets, which are also perpetual. The trills would go even further because they encompass everything that goes on in an economy.The remaining issues need not be major obstacles. In fact, an advanced country\u2019s government could issue G.D.P.-linked bonds now, setting an example for others to follow. Eventually, a vibrant market for the bonds could exist worldwide.Once that happens, we can use G.D.P.-linked bonds as diversification tools, providing another way to protect vulnerable people and governments against economic fluctuations. One day, we may well take these bonds for granted, as if they had always existed.An earlier version of this article misstated the year John Y. Campbell and Robert J. Shiller wrote a research paper about inflation-linked bonds known as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or T.I.P.S. It was 1996, not 1966.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Republicans, Defying Leaders, Move to Force Immigration Votes", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 More than a dozen House Republicans defied Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Wednesday and moved to force a vote on immigration in the House, aiming to settle the uncertain futures of so-called Dreamers, young immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children.The group is gathering signatures for a so-called discharge petition, a parliamentary maneuver that could be used to circumvent Mr. Ryan by bringing legislation to the House floor with the support of a majority of members. The party out of power often uses such petitions, but they rarely succeed because a signature from a member of the party in power is seen as a betrayal of leadership.\u201cWe are well aware that the speaker\u2019s preference was not to have this process,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, who introduced the petition Wednesday morning. \u201cI\u2019ve made the argument to the speaker personally that this process actually empowers him.\u201dIf nine more Republicans sign on, along with all House Democrats, the group will be able to revive an immigration debate that had appeared all but dead. Its goal is to force debate on four immigration-related measures, including one of the speaker\u2019s choosing.Under a little-used rule known as Queen of the Hill, the measure that received the most votes would be adopted, and advance to the Senate, so long as a majority of the House voted in favor. Representative Jeff Denham, Republican of California and the architect of the strategy, said such a rule could be brought up on the first and third Monday of every month. The next opportunity to do so, he said, would be June 11.Mr. Ryan has repeatedly said that he is opposed to the strategy, contending that it might produce legislation that President Trump would not sign. \u201cWe continue to work with our members to find a solution that can both pass the House and get the president\u2019s signature,\u201d his spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said Wednesday.But Representative Mia Love, Republican of Utah and a backer of the petition, argued that the White House should not govern how Congress acts. \u201cThis is about doing our job,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about making sure that we are not consolidating power in the White House.\u201dThe White House has demanded that whatever bill passes contain \u201cfour pillars\u201d: a path to citizenship for Dreamers, funding for Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, an end to a visa lottery system aimed at bringing in immigrants from underrepresented countries and sharp limits on family-based migration.Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said Wednesday that the White House would \u201clove to see a piece of legislation with all four of the pillars that the president outlined.\u201dFor now, DACA continues. A federal judge ruled last month that the protections must stay in place and the government must start taking new applications. On Capitol Hill, some lawmakers say that has lessened the urgency to act. And some are reluctant to take up such a thorny issue so close to election time.Whether the discharge petition will change that calculus is unclear. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and an immigration hard-liner, said the effort \u201cre-energizes the focus on getting this done.\u201d But he does not intend to sign the petition, he said, because he does not want to put bills he disagrees with on the floor.The last successful discharge petition drive came in 2015 when Republicans and Democrats forced a vote to revive the Export-Import Bank, which guarantees loans to overseas customers buying American exports.In 2002, the process forced a successful vote to pass the McCain-Feingold campaign finance overhaul.Mr. Denham said he was \u201cextremely confident\u201d that the group would get enough signatures to move forward. If the Queen of the Hill strategy succeeds, the House would take up three immigration bills that are already in circulation, along with whatever measure the speaker decided to put forth. They range from liberal to hard-line.The Dream Act \u2014 short for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors \u2014 which is backed by many Democrats, would offer legalization and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. The bipartisan U.S.A. Act \u2014 United and Securing America \u2014 would pair renewable work permits and a pathway to legal status with increased border security, and has the support of about 50 Democrats and Republicans.The measure would end the diversity visa lottery program, as Mr. Trump wants, and end family-based migration for all relatives other than spouses and minor children.

{"Headline": "China Cuts Car Tariffs, in a Small Offering to the U.S. on Trade", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China has carried out a pledge to cut tariffs on imported cars and car parts, the latest move by Beijing to ease trade tensions with the United States. The American auto industry and its workers, however, might be unimpressed.The moves are intended to address longstanding complaints from the Trump administration and global automakers that China\u2019s tariffs on imported cars are much too high. Those tariffs are one reason \u2014 though by no means the only reason \u2014 that global automakers like Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen have built enormous factories in China over the past two decades. Those factories, built and run with Chinese joint venture partners, have helped make China by far the world\u2019s largest automaker.Chinese tariffs will still be relatively high, however, and the change is unlikely to motivate automakers to shift production away from China. The United States has a tariff of 2.5 percent on cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles, for example, although it has a 25 percent tariff on imported pickup trucks. Global automakers have also grown comfortable making cars in China, where sales have boomed.The drop \u201cis a significant reduction, but it really won\u2019t have much of an effect\u201d on where automakers assemble vehicles, said James Chao, the chief Asia auto analyst at IHS Markit.By cutting the tariff on imported car parts more than on imported cars, China may actually strengthen its role as the world\u2019s largest car-assembling nation.Lower tariffs on imported components will make it more attractive for global manufacturers to do much of their final assembly in China, since they will not have to pay as much to import high-tech parts made elsewhere.Cementing China\u2019s role as the leading country for car assembly will help Beijing move the economy toward more sophisticated industries that can provide well-paid jobs for an increasingly well-educated population. Through a process Chinese officials call supply-side reforms, they hope to close older, smokestack industries that offer little more than low wages and high pollution.Tariffs will be reduced, the Finance Ministry said in a statement, \u201cin order to further expand reform and opening up, promote supply-side structural reforms, promote the transformation and upgrading of the auto industry, and meet the people\u2019s consumer demand.\u201dIt also hopes to ramp up exports of cars made in China, and reducing its own tariffs makes it less likely that Chinese-made cars will be hit by retaliatory tariffs.German luxury carmakers and German manufacturers of high-technology brakes could also be winners. While all of the world\u2019s major auto parts manufacturers now have extensive operations in China, a handful of the most sophisticated components, notably advanced braking systems, are made only in Germany.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is scheduled to meet Mr. Xi in Beijing this week. The Chinese government is eager to gain her support in its trade struggles with the Trump administration, at a time when Germany\u2019s business elite is deeply worried about Chinese acquisitions in the robotics and auto parts sectors.Ford still exports some Lincolns to China, and Tesla exports large numbers of electric cars to China despite the current tariff. General Motors has already moved to China practically all of its production for the Chinese market, including Cadillacs, which are now made in Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Pitch for Progressivism Finds an Ally Across the River", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom at least three trips to Iowa and several trips to the nation\u2019s capital, Mr. de Blasio has crisscrossed America during his four and a half years as mayor talking about the wave of progressivism that he sees sweeping the country.Two months earlier, during a recent trip to the United States Conference of Mayors, Ras. J. Baraka, the mayor of Newark, N.J., said he asked Mr. de Blasio about New York City\u2019s right to counsel law, which provides free lawyers in housing court for tenants who make less than $50,000 per year for a family of four.That discussion led to Tuesday, as Mr. de Blasio took the 10-mile drive across the Hudson River from City Hall to Newark to help Mr. Baraka announce a tenant initiative modeled after New York City\u2019s, which was believed to be the first in the nation.\u201cWe obviously took the lead from Mayor de Blasio and the great work that he\u2019s doing in New York City,\u201d Mr. Baraka said during a news conference at Newark City Hall, as Mr. de Blasio stood behind him wearing a big smile.\u201cAt the U.S. Conference of Mayors, I got a chance to corner him and sit down and have a conversation about a few things \u2014 Amazon, second term and right to counsel,\u201d Mr. Baraka said, referring to his city\u2019s efforts to become home to Amazon\u2019s second headquarters and his bid for a second term.Mr. de Blasio was equally effusive.\u201cSo, this is going to be a game-changer for Newark,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cAnd I want to say, thanks to Mayor Baraka, a lot of people are going to be able to stay in their home, a lot of illegal evictions are going to be stopped, that\u2019s a new day for Newark.\u201d\u201cAt the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Mayor de Blasio has a huge footprint,\u201d Mr. Baraka said in an interview. \u201cPeople look to him. As one of the larger cities in the country, he\u2019s very vocal about the pushback against Donald Trump.\u201dChristina M. Greer, a political-science professor who is a McSilver Institute Fellow at New York University, said she was not surprised to see Mr. de Blasio promoting his brand outside of the city.\u201cIf he wants to maintain the idea that he is a progressive mayor, he has to consistently reiterate the ways in which he supports progressive ideas,\u201d Professor Greer said.The danger is that highlighting these proposals also highlights some of the difficulties the city has had, Professor Greer said. For example, the IDNYC program caused the administration to go to court to be allowed to destroy the information of undocumented residents. Others have questioned the effectiveness of ThriveNYC in light of recent fatal police shootings of mentally ill individuals.\u201cWe have a lot of progressive values and ideas that appear to have been a success, but you scratch the surface and there\u2019s a lot more to be done on those issues,\u201d Professor Greer said.Newark, where 78 percent of the residents are renters, still has to work through several issues, including funding.Mr. Baraka said that Mr. de Blasio isn\u2019t the only mayor he looks to for ideas, citing two other Democrats, Eric M. Garcetti in Los Angeles and Mitchell J. Landrieu in New Orleans. He\u2019s considering implementing a proposal from Stockton, Calif., whose mayor, Michael Tubbs, has suggested that homeless people clean the streets.\u201cMayors, we encourage each other, we support each other, if one\u2019s got a good idea they tell the next one,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cIf one\u2019s got a problem, we talk it through and help each other out.\u201dMr. de Blasio then concluded his remarks and ducked out of Newark City Hall, refusing to take questions.Mr. Baraka did not follow the mayor\u2019s lead, inviting the press to ask questions.\u201cThe mayor has to head on back to New York,\u201d Mr. Baraka said moments after a hug and a handshake from Mr. de Blasio.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cory Booker on His Side, Newark\u2019s Mayor Charts a Pragmatic Second Term", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 Mayor Ras J. Baraka strode through the room with confidence as he took the stage in a hotel in downtown Newark, which is booming with development that four years ago some feared Mr. Baraka might forestall.\u201cThe city is finished with the past,\u201d he said on Tuesday night, after his overwhelming re-election to a second term. \u201cToday marks the day that you either go forward with all of us or you stay back with the few.\u201dThis time, Mr. Baraka promoted himself as a unifier who seeks to transform a city that has been mired in decay for decades, a leader intent on building relationships with business leaders and others with whom he has had frosty relationships, perhaps most notably his onetime political foe, Mr. Booker.\u201cEveryone knows we used to go at it like cats and dogs,\u201d Mr. Baraka said in his victory speech. \u201cBut things change based on time and conditions. And let me tell you this: With this government that we have in the White House, Senator Booker is our No. 1 ally.\u201dTheir partnership is based in part on mutual need. Mr. Baraka needed Mr. Booker\u2019s counsel as he embarked on a challenging first term; Mr. Booker wants his former critic on his side as Newark experiences a rebirth, particularly when his record while mayor of the city could become a subject of scrutiny if he runs for president in 2020.There is no doubt that Newark is a better place than it was when Mr. Baraka inherited it from Mr. Booker four years ago.Unemployment in the city has dropped to 8 percent, down from 13 percent, when Mr. Baraka took office, though that is still double the national average. Crime has also fallen, and the city has regained control of its schools from the state as the graduation rate has steadily risen.Mr. Baraka said that was always a misperception. \u201cRunning for mayor and governing is two different things, right?\u201d said Mr. Baraka, explaining that his role was to find a middle ground between development and residents\u2019 fear of gentrification.\u201cYou have developers pushing back, saying finally the city is taking off,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAnd you have residents who say, \u2018Oh the city is moving too fast.\u2019\u201d This is why he said he has initiated policies to protect Newark\u2019s affordable housing, including restructuring rent-control guidelines and expanding protections from illegal evictions.\u201cWe want to continue to build, and build in our city,\u201d Mr. Baraka said on Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of growth. We\u2019re not afraid of development. We deserve nice things in our city, too.\u201dIt is a delicate balance that, so far, has won him praise.\u201cWe\u2019re probably in the best place we\u2019ve ever been in terms of welcoming development, but development that is appropriate to the city and provides inclusion and opportunity for residents across income levels,\u201d said Richard Cammarieri, the longtime chairman of the Newark Community Development Network, a nonprofit that promotes neighborhood development.His shift from a campaign populist to a pragmatist mayor has been reflected in his relationship with Mr. Booker. In 2014, the two men and their top aides met for lunch at Andros Diner to discuss a transition plan that had been drawn up by the Booker team. What some aides feared could be a contentious discussion was fairly peaceful and productive.Running against Mr. Booker\u2019s record might have helped him win the mayor\u2019s office, but Mr. Baraka realized he needed allies if he was going to succeed in office.\u201cI\u2019m about collaboration,\u201d Mr. Baraka said. \u201cWhatever we need to do to fix it, pragmatically, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dSoon the two men were working together on projects across Newark. When Mars Wrigley called Mr. Booker about coming to Newark, he directed them to Mr. Baraka, and the two made the sales pitch together. When Mr. Baraka was battling Gov. Chris Christie over control of the city\u2019s schools, seeking to fulfill a core campaign promise, Mr. Booker called him and urged him to go to Trenton and advocate in person despite Mr. Baraka\u2019s misgivings.With Mr. Booker\u2019s name regularly mentioned as a top potential Democratic presidential candidate, his efforts to help Mr. Baraka could be seen as motivated, in part, by a desire to burnish his own image. Mr. Booker, who was not immediately available for an interview, could make the case that Mr. Baraka is building on a foundation that he put in place during his seven years in office.For his part, Mr. Baraka now says that Mr. Booker was particularly effective at changing the city\u2019s narrative.\u201cBooker began to get people to look at Newark differently,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Baraka said. \u201cHe put us in the game, got us to the coliseum. And I give him credit for that.\u201d\u201cSo my job,\u2019\u2019 he added, \u201cwhen I got in the game, was to win.\u201d\u201cI know he\u2019s going to come up here and speak, but he really doesn\u2019t need to,\u201d Mr. Booker said, referring to the mayor. \u201cYou could drive around this whole city, and from the parks and schools, small businesses, you could drive around the whole city to see the kind of work our city workers are doing.\u201dThe two men were in the courtyard of an apartment complex that provides low-income housing for older people for about an hour, as supporters snacked on hamburgers and hot dogs. (Some were cooked by Mr. Booker, who also peddled slightly charred veggie burgers while reminding the crowd, \u201cI\u2019m a vegan.\u201d)Flavia Mercado, who has lived in Newark for 45 years, watched as Mr. Booker posed for photographs on a bocce court.\u201cHe was a mayor once, now he\u2019s a senator \u2014 the best that we had,\u201d she said in Spanish.When asked what she thought about Mr. Baraka, she said he was impressive, too, but that it was difficult to pick \u201cthe best.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re clones,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deal Is Reached to Sell the Plaza Hotel", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of trying, two investors have reached a deal to buy a majority share of the historic Plaza Hotel for $600 million, a top executive for the seller, the Sahara Group, confirmed.The buyers are Shahal Khan, founder of the Dubai-based family office White City Ventures, and Kamran Hakim of the Hakim Organization, a major New York City landlord. The deal is scheduled to close on June 25.Sandeep Wadhwa, head of corporate finance at the Sahara Group, which owns a 70 percent stake in the hotel, and Sant Singh Chatwal, a hotelier who owns the other 5 percent being sold, confirmed the deal. Both men declined to comment further, citing confidentiality agreements.Opened in 1907, the Plaza is a city landmark and the only hotel listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Home of the literary troublemaker Eloise, famous for pouring water down the mail chute, the hotel has been featured in countless movies, from \u201cNorth by Northwest\u201d to \u201cHome Alone 2,\u201d and was at one time owned by Donald J. Trump, who lost it in a bankruptcy. In 2005, it was largely converted into luxury condominiums, though a smaller hotel component and restaurants, including the Palm Court and the underground food hall, remain.The Sahara Group has long tried to sell the property, and last year, it hired Jones Lang LaSalle, a brokerage firm, to carry out an auction of the property. The latest deal follows a string of reported sales that never came to fruition, though this time the buyers have made a $30 million deposit that they would forfeit if they backed out, making a completed sale more likely.Prince Alwaleed was among a group of Saudi princes and ministers who were taken into custody by the government in November in a series of arrests orchestrated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Prince Alwaleed was released in January.Calls to Kingdom Holdings Co. and Ashkenazy Acquisitions were not returned.The transaction is complex. The $600 million purchase price includes the refinancing of a more than $410 million mortgage on the hotel. The Qatari Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, known as H.B.J., holds the mortgage, which is set to mature in early July.Subrata Roy, chairman of the Sahara Group, and Mr. Chatwal bought their shared stake in the hotel in 2012. Shortly after the purchase, Indian regulators sought to arrest Mr. Roy over a bond sale. He was jailed for two years, and has since been ordered to return several billion dollars.In 2010, Sahara purchased the Grosvenor House, a historic hotel in London. Last year, Ashkenazy Acquisition, with financing from H.B.J., acquired that hotel. As part of that deal, H.B.J. took over the mortgage on the Plaza.Mr. Khan has spent several years trying to buy the hotel. It was suggested that he would use cryptocurrency to fund the acquisition, but the financing for the deal is a combination of traditional equity and debt.Mr. Khan confirmed the deal, but declined to comment further. Mr. Hakim did not return requests for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giuliani May Have Exposed Trump to New Legal and Political Perils", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s new legal team made a chaotic debut as Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was tapped recently to be one of the president\u2019s lawyers, potentially exposed his client to legal and political danger by publicly revealing the existence of secret payments to Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s personal lawyer.The explosive revelation, which Mr. Giuliani said was intended to prove that Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen violated no campaign finance laws, prompted frustration and disbelief among the president\u2019s other legal and political advisers, some of whom said they feared the gambit could backfire.Legally, the failure to disclose the payments could be a violation of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which requires that federal officials, including Mr. Trump, report any liabilities of more than $10,000 during the preceding year. Mr. Trump\u2019s last disclosure report, which he signed and filed in June, mentions no debt to Mr. Cohen.Politically, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s remarks \u2014 made in television appearances and interviews \u2014 raised questions about the president\u2019s truthfulness and created a firestorm at the White House, where aides were caught off guard and furiously sought to deflect questions they could not answer. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said she had been unaware of the payments before the interviews.\u201cEveryone is wondering, what in the world is he doing?\u201d said George Arzt, a longtime New York Democratic consultant who has known Mr. Giuliani for decades. \u201cI would not have sent out Rudy to talk about the investigation. But Trump likes chaos and Trump just added to the chaos.\u201dBy the end of the day, the president and his advisers had done little to clarify the confusion that Mr. Giuliani had set in motion a night earlier.Even some of the president\u2019s advisers said they were skeptical of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s statements that Mr. Cohen entered into a settlement, made payments to a pornographic film actress and was reimbursed by the president all without Mr. Trump\u2019s knowing why.Mr. Giuliani\u2019s disclosure is a sign of how Mr. Trump\u2019s reshuffled legal team \u2014 which now includes a highly paid Washington lawyer, a famous former mayor, a constitutional lawyer who specializes in religious cases and former federal prosecutors \u2014 will function in the coming weeks as they sort out who takes the lead on representing the president.Mr. Giuliani has said he is the lead lawyer dealing with the special counsel\u2019s investigation in Washington. But his statements on Wednesday night related to the continuing investigation in New York that is examining the conduct of Mr. Cohen. People close to the president are concerned that Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani may create more problems for themselves if they consult only with each other and leave out the other lawyers who may know more about the nuances of the cases.Mr. Trump faces a two-front battle with the Justice Department: one investigation in New York into Mr. Cohen and the special counsel investigation in Washington.Whoever runs the president\u2019s legal defenses will almost certainly adopt a more aggressive strategy than the previous team, which was led by the Washington lawyers John Dowd and Ty Cobb.Despite the president\u2019s desire to take on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and the Justice Department, Mr. Dowd and Mr. Cobb persuaded Mr. Trump to buy into their strategy of cooperation. The more helpful the president was, Mr. Dowd and Mr. Cobb told him last year, the more likely the investigation would conclude by year\u2019s end.Instead, the investigation has intensified, and the president has concluded that approach was a mistake, according to people close to him. Convinced that the investigation is a growing threat to his presidency, he has resorted to his initial inclination to fight.Mr. Trump appears to hope that Mr. Giuliani, a like-minded political street fighter from New York, will aid his combative approach. Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments on Wednesday and Thursday were an attempt to do just that.His aggression carried risks. Besides revealing that the president had reimbursed Mr. Cohen, Mr. Giuliani appeared to admit that the payment to Ms. Clifford just before Election Day in 2016 was made because of concerns about the coming vote. That could be used to argue that it was an illegal campaign contribution.\u201cImagine if that came out on October 15, 2016, in the middle of the, you know, last debate with Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said on the Fox News program \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cCohen didn\u2019t even ask. Cohen made it go away. He did his job.\u201dMr. Giuliani\u2019s comments also raised fresh questions about the president\u2019s relationship with Mr. Cohen. As Mr. Giuliani told it, Mr. Cohen entered into a legal agreement with Ms. Clifford and paid her without Mr. Trump\u2019s knowledge. Mr. Giuliani described that as commonplace, saying he performed similar services for his own clients. But legal ethics experts said such an arrangement was highly unusual and would only expose Mr. Cohen to new questions.From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress.Lawyers are required to keep their clients fully informed of their activities and are generally prohibited from advancing money to or on behalf of their clients, said Deborah L. Rhode, a scholar on legal ethics at Stanford Law School. \u201cThis is a guy who says he\u2019ll take a bullet for the president,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what they\u2019re giving him is the legal ethics equivalent of a bullet.\u201d\u201cGiuliani thinks he\u2019s serving President Trump\u2019s interest,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s interest is not the same as Michael Cohen\u2019s interest.\u201dIn his tweets on Thursday, Mr. Trump contradicted his earlier statements that he knew of no payment to Ms. Clifford. Mr. Trump said he paid a monthly retainer to Mr. Cohen and suggested that the payment to the actress could not be considered a campaign contribution.Government watchdog groups warned that willfully violating the financial disclosure laws can be punished by a fine of up to $50,000 and a year in prison. Although federal officials who lie on the forms are also typically charged with other, more serious offenses such as bribery or fraud, more than 20 officials or former officials have been charged in the past 12 years with making false statements to federal officials, a felony offense. An Environmental Protection Agency official who failed to report a source of income on the form, for instance, was convicted and sentenced to probation.\u201cMr. Giuliani did his client no favors,\u201d said Norman L. Eisen, the chairman of the good-government group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.Mr. Cohen had worked for Mr. Trump for a decade and has said he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for him. Mr. Trump, however, treated Mr. Cohen poorly over the years, people familiar with their relationship have said.Michael D. Shear and Matt Apuzzo reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Reporting was contributed by Matt Flegenheimer, Sharon LaFraniere, Jeremy Peters, Michael S.

{"Headline": "Attempted Murder by Parachute? British Soldier Convicted in Sabotage Case", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Capping a chronicle of illicit sex, bad loans and serial mendacity, a British Army sergeant was convicted on Thursday of trying to murder his wife by tampering with her parachute before a sky-dive as a prelude to life with another woman.Sgt. Emile Cilliers, 38, had pleaded not guilty to two charges of attempted murder, after a jury found that he tried to kill his wife, Victoria, by first causing a gas leak at the couple\u2019s home and then using his experience as a parachute packer to meddle with his wife\u2019s equipment to ensure that it would not open.He offered to pay for the jump in April 2015, purportedly as a treat following the birth of their second child, the prosecution said. He will be sentenced later.The imagery conjured by testimony at the trial riveted followers of the case, in which Victoria Cilliers, a 41-year-old physiotherapist, leapt from an airplane 4,000 feet above the ground unaware that neither her main parachute nor the reserve could open.She plummeted to the ground as horrified onlookers watched, but she survived the impact of the fall, apparently because of her slight build and because she landed on recently plowed soft ground. Her injuries included a broken spine, internal injuries, and fractures to her ribs and pelvis.At the trial, it emerged that Sergeant Cilliers had taken his wife\u2019s parachute into a bathroom a day before the jump, sabotaged it and then placed it in a locker so that only she would use it.As an experienced parachutist, Victoria Cilliers immediately realized when she jumped that something was wrong. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t feel right. The lines were twisted. I was spinning,\u201d she said.\u201cThose at the scene immediately realized that something was seriously wrong with her reserve parachute,\u201d said Michael Bowes, a lawyer for the prosecution. \u201cTwo vital pieces of equipment which fasten the parachute harness were missing. Their absence inevitably meant the reserve parachute would fail and would send her spinning to the ground.\u201dLeading up to that episode was a tale of infidelity, debts and deceit. According to testimony at the trial, the police discovered that Sergeant Cilliers was having affairs with two women \u2014 one of them a former wife, Carly Cilliers, and the other an Austrian lover, Stefanie Goller, whom he had met via a dating app.The prosecution said he told Ms. Goller he was separated from his wife and that the baby Victoria Cilliers was expecting had been fathered by another man.He had hoped that his wife\u2019s death would free him to pursue a new life with Ms. Goller and that an insurance payout would help wipe out growing debts, the prosecution said. During their affair, Sergeant Cilliers had taken Ms. Goller on vacations financed in part by money from his wife\u2019s bank account.He had also taken out so-called payday loans, which generally have high interest rates, and borrowed money from colleagues to finance a lifestyle punctuated by visits to prostitutes. \u201cI\u2019m a very sexual man,\u201d he told the trial, according to reporters who covered it.Mr. Bowes described Sergeant Cilliers as callous, describing how, after his wife\u2019s disastrous parachute jump, \u201che texts his mistress while at the side of his seriously injured wife, saying: I can\u2019t imagine anything like this happening to you; all I can think about is you.\u201dElizabeth Marsh, a defense lawyer, acknowledged that Sergeant Cilliers was \u201cno Prince Charming\u201d and \u201cdid not start to act in a panicked or guilty manner\u201d after his wife\u2019s fall.Sergeant Cilliers was also convicted on a lesser offense of endangering life by damaging the gas supply system at his home.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big Donors Form New Alliance to Seize House From Republicans", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMajor Democratic donors in New York have discreetly formed a new political alliance to raise roughly $10 million that would be injected into as many as two dozen key House battlegrounds in an effort to wrest control of Congress from Republicans.Admission to be an official partner in what\u2019s being called the House Victory Project comes with a $108,000 price tag. More than 80 people have each committed that sum, according to a half-dozen donors familiar with the group, whose existence has not previously been reported.The $108,000 pledge allows each donor to effectively give the maximum $5,400 contribution to 20 different House candidates. With nearly $9 million in commitments amassed so far, each Democratic recipient could see a windfall of as much as $432,000 \u2014 an amount that, for many House candidates, equals months of fund-raising in one fell swoop.Jane D. Hartley, a former ambassador to France under President Barack Obama, said that the donors were a \u201cvery diverse\u201d group that included philanthropists who have previously not engaged in political giving.\u201cMany have not been involved in politics in the past, but they\u2019ve said they can\u2019t sit out this election,\u201d she said.Ms. Hartley, who hosted an event in recent months to pitch donors on the idea, is one of five organizers of the project, donors said. The others include Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton; Roger C. Altman, the former deputy treasury secretary in the Clinton administration; and two investment bankers who are major Democratic fund-raisers, Deven J. Parekh and Blair W. Effron.Ms. Hartley, the only of the five to return calls for comment, declined to discuss how candidates would be chosen, but others briefed on the group\u2019s plans said they plan to stay mostly away from contested Democratic primaries and the ideological battles that are roiling the party across the country.Instead, the group is focusing on bolstering Democratic candidates in general election battleground races, with the goal of flipping 24 Republican seats to take the House in November.Donors who got pitches to contribute said the group was focused on quantitative criteria that included the results in the past election, such as if President Trump or Hillary Clinton carried a district, as well as the ratings of the Cook Political Report and Larry Sabato, a race prognosticator. Candidates have not been brought in for interviews.\u201cThe idea is to win 24 highly curated races,\u201d said Alan Patricof, a venture capitalist and Democratic donor, who said that many of the contributors involved have worked together for decades.Mr. Patricof said the goal was finding candidates with a \u201chigh probability of prevailing\u201d in November.Paperwork to form the House Victory Project was filed last month with the Federal Election Commission and it listed 10 initial Democratic House candidates: Tom Malinowski and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey; Jason Crow of Colorado; Susie Lee of Nevada; Brad Ashford of Nebraska; Angie Craig of Minnesota; Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida; Elissa Slotkin of Michigan; Elaine Luria of Virginia; and Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona.One donor, who was approached about joining but declined and requested anonymity to speak candidly about the effort, said the group was raising the political profiles in Washington of its leaders by bundling donations from others.\u201cThis is taking the Wall Street theory of \u2018other people\u2019s money\u2019 and applying it to politics,\u201d the donor said. \u201cThey want to be the ones to deliver the check, to be the players.\u201dCampaign bundlers \u2014 those who collect contributions from friends and associates \u2014 have risen to national prominence. One prominent bundler, Paul E. Singer, the Republican hedge fund manager, can raise six-figure sums for House candidates, and donates millions of dollars to national G.O.P. causes and candidates.For House candidates, large-scale direct campaign contributions are a hard commodity to come by.Federal election rules limit direct donations to candidates to $2,700 per donor for both the primary and general election, but joint committees, such as the House Victory Project, can bundle those contributions into one larger check.For three of the candidates \u2014 Mr. Crow, Mr. Ashford and Ms. Luria \u2014 the full $432,000 from 80 donors would represent more than they raised altogether in the first quarter of 2018. (During the primary, they would be eligible for the first half: $216,000.)The House Victory Project is continuing to look for more donors, which the group calls \u201cpartners,\u201d but its leaders are already happy with the pledge rate.\u201cThe response we\u2019ve been getting is just much more than we thought,\u201d Ms. Hartley said.The group continues to solicit new partners to grow those sums even more, but has consciously tried to keep a low profile, aware that the idea of New York donors pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into races in Arizona, Nebraska and Michigan may not play well locally.The House Victory Project will not have to disclose its donors until July.Advertisement"}

The phrase, often repeated in anger or haste, is clever, but it ignores political realities. We do not deserve the government we get if the government we get is the consequence of fear and uncertainty, poverty, weakened democratic institutions, systematic racism, gerrymandering and a system stacked in favor of those in power.Malaysia votes on May 9 and almost every projection has Barisan Nasional, the ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Najib Razak, claiming electoral victory for the 14th consecutive time. To be precise: This coalition or a predecessor has governed Malaysia (and before it, Malaya) for over 60 years, without a break. Barisan Nasional and Co. probably is the longest-ruling political alliance in the world.Yet 1MDB will play little to no part in Wednesday\u2019s election.Why? For one thing, from the outset Mr. Najib used his power and influence to interfere with investigations into the scandal. He replaced the attorney general who was getting ready to file criminal charges against him and sacked cabinet members who were openly criticizing the government\u2019s handling of the allegations. Four members of the parliamentary accounts committee charged with investigating the case were promoted to cabinet positions, and the committee\u2019s work was suspended.While all of this was happening, Mr. Najib was off doing statesmanlike things: hobnobbing with world leaders at important economic summits, negotiating trans-Pacific trade deals, golfing with President Obama, building ties with China and setting up Malaysia as a key regional force in the fight against terrorism.It must have helped that 1MDB was far too vast and far too complex a scandal for many people to fathom. In any event, the administration\u2019s strategy of information suppression and distraction worked. Because here we are, facing the mother of all general elections, and Malaysians still are not paying attention to this kleptocracy scandal, perhaps the biggest in the history of the world.This administration now has near-complete control over the government, the various bodies tasked with investigating the scandal and the media. We don\u2019t murder journalists in Malaysia yet, but we have become very good at making life difficult for them. Mr. Najib\u2019s administration has successfully wagged the dog and manipulated the electorate into thinking that the scandal doesn\u2019t matter. Come May 9, he may win yet another election in spite of it.About a month ago, a series of videos titled #namasayanajib, or #mynameisnajib, began appearing here as ads on YouTube. The videos feature a boy \u2014 who just happens to share our prime minister\u2019s first name \u2014 and his many adventures as he encounters various situations that allow him to display his virtues. He is hardworking. He is honest. He is enterprising. He is everything a good Malaysian should be.I don\u2019t know if Barisan Nasional ultimately is behind this thinly veiled propaganda. But the video series\u2019s 13 moralistic tales appear to be a mythmaking exercise designed to invite the public to associate Najib the prime minister with Najib the boy and make us feel like the country\u2019s leader is one of us. Maybe even a bit better.Which makes me wonder: If so, do Najib\u2019s sins then also become our own, especially if we re-elect him?Umapagan Ampikaipakan is the host of \u201cThe Evening Edition\u201d on BFM 89.9, Malaysia\u2019s only independent English-language talk radio station.Advertisement"}

For those who missed it \u2013 halfway through the call, CEO Elon Musk abruptly declared that our questions were \u2018boring\u2019 and \u2018not cool,\u2019 and pivoted to a 20-minute back-and-forth with a retail investor from YouTube. Beneath the bizarre theatrics, however, we see Tesla\u2019s Q1 as in-line with expectations on most metrics, including revenues, gross margins, and free cash flow.\u201dAdam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley:\u201cTo be clear. Tonight\u2019s conference call didn\u2019t go very well. Feedback we have received from investors during and following the call support this view. Irrespective of the Tesla CEO\u2019s annoyance with the genre of questions he was receiving from the analyst community, we note that an important part of Tesla\u2019s success has been its relationship with the capital markets in funding its ambitious plans.\u201dRyan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan:\u201cGiven that the market has seemed somewhat less focused on cash burn than we have been, initially we believed that the 1Q performance \u2014 combined with forceful management guidance for a strong 2H inflection in revenue, margin, and cash flow \u2014 would be enough to elicit a modestly positive reaction in the shares Thursday. Instead, we expect TSLA to fall today after CEO Elon Musk dismissed multiple analyst questions as \u2018dry\u2019 and \u2018boring\u2019 (including questions probing what we feel are key topics, such as profitability of the Model 3 and the company\u2019s capital requirements).\u201dAlexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Jaffray:\u201cManagement strongly rejected the need for new equity, while trimming its capex forecast and guiding for profitability in 2H. Model 3 choppiness notwithstanding, these results initially looked like a modest positive vs. bearish expectations. But then Elon Musk began dismissing analysts\u2019 questions and decided instead to field TWELVE questions from a YouTuber because it was \u2018way more interesting.\u2019 The unorthodox behavior sparked an after-hours sell-off. We still recommend TSLA, but in the next few months especially, we would expect significant volatility.\u201d\u201cIn March 2016, Iconix publicly announced a $169 million write down of Rocawear, and in March of this year, Iconix announced a further write down of $34 million.

The question remains: Is Mr. Conway sending signals that he is at odds with an administration where his wife is a key player, or is he just another lawyer watching a slow-motion legal car crash unfold from a safe distance? The Conways declined to comment, but several of Mr. Conway\u2019s associates stepped in to fill in the gaps.\u201cHe\u2019s one of my most conservative friends,\u201d said Lisa Blatt, a lawyer who has known Mr. Conway for six years. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t changed that much to me since before Trump was even a candidate.\u201dWith his Clinton-era background, Mr. Conway understands how volatile political climates work. Now at the white-shoe law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, he may have a better understanding than most of the political maelstrom that faces the White House legal team, especially as midterm elections approach. But he has in recent years focused on securities and antitrust cases, not criminal or campaign-finance law.\u201cGeorge would be spectacularly qualified to give legal advice to just about anyone on any topic,\u201d Mr. Grundfest said. Asked whether Mr. Conway\u2019s experience in Washington suited the president\u2019s current needs, Mr. Grundfest said, \u201cMy neighbor has a poodle smarter than some of the people on Trump\u2019s legal team.\u201d(Mr. Grundfest stressed that he had picked an intelligent dog breed.)Mr. Conway said in a statement last year that it was \u201cnot the right time for me to leave the private sector and take on a new role in the federal government.\u201d He added, \u201cKellyanne and I continue to support the president and his administration, and I look forward to doing so in whatever way I can from outside the government.\u201dIn the months since, the Conways have appeared to adjust to life in Washington, though they are hardly glued to each other\u2019s side. During the weekend of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, for instance, Ms. Conway attended a dinner hosted by David Bradley, the founder of Atlantic Media, solo. She later joined Mr. Conway at a party at the British Embassy.Whatever their purpose, Mr. Conway\u2019s messages have caught the attention of aides in the West Wing, according to a White House official. That official said some advisers were miffed by the tweeting, and considered Mr. Conway\u2019s public criticisms to be potentially harmful to Ms. Conway, who remains poised to assume more of the duties left behind by Hope Hicks, the departed White House communications director.But the president does not seem to share those concerns, according to a senior White House official familiar with his thinking. He continues to trust Ms. Conway, and he appeared to enjoy her response after the CNN journalist Dana Bash recently asked her to explain her husband\u2019s social media missives.\u201cIt was meant to harass and embarrass,\u201d Ms. Conway said of the question. She said that there had \u201cbeen a different standard\u201d for her than others when it came to scrutinizing her husband\u2019s opinions, and she chided Ms. Bash for pressing about \u201chow people\u2019s spouses and significant others may differ with them.\u201d\u201cLet me just tell you something,\u201d Ms. Conway said. \u201cBy definition, spouses have a difference of opinion.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly George Conway\u2019s attendance at a party at the British Embassy.

{"Headline": "Lanternflies Eat Everything in Sight. The U.S. Is Looking Delicious.", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo most people, the buds and sprouts of April are welcome heralds of spring. But to some farmers and scientists in the southeastern corner of Pennsylvania, these signs mark the beginning of a long season of dread.Their worry is Lycorma delicatula, the spotted lanternfly. It is an invasive pest with a voracious appetite and remarkable reproductive talents.Native to Asia, lanternflies first appeared in Pennsylvania in 2014. Despite a quarantine effort, they have also been discovered in small numbers in New York, Delaware and Virginia.In their native range, lanternflies feed primarily on one type of tree \u2014 Ailanthus, the tree of heaven. The trees are an invasive species, too, common across the continental United States, and so entomologists fear lanternflies one day may spread to far-flung corners of the country.A nationwide outbreak would be something of a disaster, some scientists believe. Among the lanternfly\u2019s more alarming qualities is an ability to feed on a huge range of plants, including many of commercial value.Lanternflies are believed to use at least forty species of native plants in the United States as hosts. They are particularly fond of grapevines, apple and stone fruit trees as well as a number of hardwood trees, like black walnut and maple.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it in hops, we\u2019ve seen it in some of the grain crops that are out there, soybean and what have you,\u201d said Fred R. Strathmeyer Jr., Pennsylvania\u2019s deputy secretary of agriculture. \u201cIt\u2019s able to feed on many, many different things.\u201dWhile it is too soon to gauge how much damage lanternflies might cause in the long-term, they can easily decimate certain crops in a single season.\u201cThey\u2019ve been appearing in grapes, and we have reports from growers last year of a 90 percent loss,\u201d said Julie Urban, a senior research associate at Penn State.Then there is the lanternfly\u2019s unusual ability to lay eggs on almost any surface. While other species tend to deposit eggs on a living plant or in soil nearby, lanternflies can place a bundle of eggs nearly anywhere \u2014 wheel wells, train cars, shipping containers.Agricultural inspectors in Pennsylvania have even started checking beehives for lanternfly eggs.\u201cMost pests deposit their eggs on their host plant, or very close, so they already have food available,\u201d said Surendra Dara, an adviser at the University of California Cooperative Extension.\u201cThose that have the advantage of being able to lay eggs on non-plant material obviously have a better chance of surviving and spreading,\u201d he added.To try to contain lanternflies, regulators have set up a quarantine zone in Pennsylvania that now spans over 3,000 square miles (up from 174 in 2016) and includes 13 counties, as well as Philadelphia.The state prohibits the moving of certain items within the zone, including firewood, outdoor furniture and construction debris. Officials also have launched a permit program for companies shipping goods out of the area.\u201cIt\u2019s not just an agriculture problem, this is truly an across-the-board commerce problem, because we are trying not to move it,\u201d said Mr. Strathmeyer. \u201cThis is everyday people, this is the trucking company, the U.P.S. driver, the delivery guy.\u201dMany scientists who have studied lanternflies fear that the pace at which populations have grown so far suggests an uphill battle ahead.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably eruptive in terms of its population,\u201d said Michael Saunders, a professor emeritus of entomology at Penn State. \u201cThe very first year we went out, in 2015, you had to really hunt for egg masses, and then over the next two years it was just spectacularly exponential in its growth.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been through a few waves of invasive species, and this is far and away the most incredible thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said.South Korea is the only other country in which the spotted lanternfly is an introduced pest.

The honeydew promotes the growth of mold, which can ruin produce and cover leaves, blocking out sunlight and killing plants.In residential areas, honeydew can coat yards and porches, and its sugary consistency attracts gnats, bees and other unwanted insects.\u201cI\u2019ve actually seen stalagmites of hardened honeydew on the ground,\u201d said Dr. Saunders. \u201cIf you\u2019re an entomologist, it\u2019s spectacular, but if you\u2019re a homeowner and you have these in your yard, it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201dLanternflies have mostly been contained in Pennsylvania so far, so some experts hope that they may still be eradicated through traditional means.Researchers have also begun studying the insect\u2019s natural predators in Asia, with an eye to possibly releasing them in the United States. Several species of parasitic wasps are under consideration as a method of biological control, though this strategy typically only becomes practical once an invasive species becomes established.\u201cBiocontrol is an option that you would take up after eradication has been ruled out,\u201d said Kim Hoelmer, a research entomologist at the Agriculture Department.Scientists are pondering more experimental solutions as well.\u201cRNAi is one of the ways to control insects in a target-specific manner with precision, without harming the environment,\u201d said Subba Reddy Palli, a professor of entomology at the University of Kentucky.While RNAi has proved ineffective against other types of insects, notably many species of butterflies and moths, early indications are that the spotted lanternfly may be susceptible.With more sophisticated solutions still years away, however, many of those working to halt the advance of lanternflies in the field are staying focused on the present.If trends continue, this season is expected to be an important predictor of how severe the problem could become.\u201c2018 is going to be a critical year for us to know whether we\u2019ll be able to really effectively contain, suppress and ultimately eradicate this pest or not,\u201d said Osama El-Lissy, a deputy administrator of plant protection and quarantine at the Agriculture Department.\u201cIt is pivotal, this spring.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Two Top Aides to Scott Pruitt Quit the E.P.A. Unexpectedly", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Two top aides to Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency chief who is facing an array of investigations related to his spending and management practices, have resigned amid widening scrutiny of their roles at the agency.Also departing was Albert Kelly, a longtime friend of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s and a former banker who received a lifetime ban from the finance industry last year following a banking violation. Mr. Kelly ran the agency\u2019s Superfund program, which oversees the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.When asked about the fund, Jahan Wilcox, an E.P.A. spokesman, said, \u201cE.P.A. does not set up a legal expense fund for any employee.\u201d The people familiar with Mr. Pruitt\u2019s legal defense fund said they did not know what legal or financial form the fund would take. Mr. Rizzi also said the creation of such a fund could cause further headaches for Mr. Pruitt should energy companies or other industries regulated by the E.P.A. contribute to it. \u201cThese funds raise a lot of uncertainties in the tax area and the ethical area,\u201d he said.The email was sent in August 2017, a few weeks after Mr. Pruitt had moved out of the apartment, but at a time when he still owed money to Mr. Hart\u2019s wife.Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, \u200bthe leading Democrat on the House committee that helps oversee E.P.A. operations, \u200bcalled the email \u201cfurther proof that Administrator Pruitt has consistently misled Congress and the public about the extent to which the special interests providing him with gifts have sought specific favors from E.P.A. in return.\u201dThe E.P.A. press office did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Williams & Jensen, the lobbying firm that Mr. Hart left last month, did not respond to a request for comment.As the investigations into Mr. Pruitt have grown, so has scrutiny of Mr. Perrotta and Mr. Kelly. Neither responded to emails or phone messages seeking comment on Tuesday afternoon.Mr. Pruitt on Tuesday praised his two former aides, while Democrats seized on their resignations to renew calls for Mr. Pruitt to step aside. \u201cScott Pruitt should be the next to go,\u201d Representative Donald S. Beyer Jr., Democrat of Virginia, said. \u201cAlbert Kelly was never qualified to run Superfund \u2014 his banking ban was a huge red flag,\u201d he added.Mr. Perrotta, known as Nino, is a former Secret Service agent with a background investigating the Gambino crime family. Officially, he led Mr. Pruitt\u2019s protective detail, but he played a larger role at the E.P.A. by arguing that the security needs of the agency justified some of its spending, personnel and management decisions. Mr. Perrotta emboldened Mr. Pruitt by signing off on security enhancements or travel-related expenditures to which other agency officials had objected, said Kevin Chmielewski, a political appointee who served as Mr. Pruitt\u2019s deputy chief of staff until \u200bbeing removed from his post this year after raising objections to some of the spending at the agency.Mr. Perrotta \u201chas been with the agency for a very long time, so he knew how to get things done for Pruitt,\u201d Mr. Chmielewski said.The House Oversight Committee is scheduled to hear from Mr. Perrotta on Wednesday as part of its investigation into Mr. Pruitt\u2019s alleged ethical lapses, in what is known as a transcribed interview. While staffers of the committee have spoken with at least one former E.P.A. staffer as part of their investigation into Mr. Pruitt, a transcribed interview, often conducted under oath, is a stronger step, creating a document that could be used as legal evidence.The panel also plans to summon five other current and former senior agency officials for similar interviews in the coming weeks, including Mr. Pruitt\u2019s chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, and a former top policy adviser, Samantha Dravis. The reason for the ban has not been publicly disclosed. An order from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said only that there was \u201creason to believe\u201d he was illegally involved in \u201can agreement pertaining to a loan.\u201dMr. Pruitt said Mr. Kelly \u201cwill be sorely missed,\u201d adding, \u201cIn just over a year he has made a tremendous impact on E.P.A.\u2019s Superfund program, serving as chair of the Superfund Task Force and presiding over the development of the steps necessary to implement the recommendations in the report.\u201dThe E.P.A., in a statement to The Times, said that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s business dealings with Mr. Kelly were \u201cethical\u201d and that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s stake in the shell company was \u201ca simple real estate investment.\u201dAt the E.P.A., Mr. Kelly pushed for more intensive cleanups of contaminated Superfund sites to pave the way for investment on the reclaimed land by private developers.Last week, a member of Congress pressed Mr. Pruitt about whether Mr. Kelly should disclose details of his \u201clifetime banking ban as a matter of transparency.\u201d Mr. Pruitt responded, \u201cI think Mr. Kelly, if he\u2019s willing to share that with you, he should do that.\u201dEric Lipton, Lisa Friedman and Kenneth P. Vogel in Washington and Steve Eder and Hiroko Tabuchi in New York contributed reporting.An earlier version of this article erroneously included a former policy adviser to Scott Pruitt among the people Mr. Pruitt blamed in congressional testimony for the public criticism he has faced.

{"Headline": "Too Bad Rudy Doesn\u2019t Lie as Well as Trump", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Litman is a former United States attorney and deputy assistant attorney general.Just last month, President Trump told the American people that he knew nothing about how Stormy Daniels received $130,000 in hush money. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, has insisted for months that he had kept Mr. Trump completely in the dark and that he had handled the entire matter on his own as a personal favor to the man for whom he would \u201ctake a bullet.\u201dEnter Rudy Giuliani. On Wednesday night, the former mayor of New York and Mr. Trump\u2019s latest legal fixer went on Fox News \u2014 where else? \u2014 to offer a new version of the Stormy Daniels affair. The president, Mr. Giuliani insisted, had in fact reimbursed Mr. Cohen the $130,000. Even the show\u2019s host, Sean Hannity \u2014 another Cohen client \u2014 appeared stunned.What in the world was going on?The most generous read of Wednesday night\u2019s showpiece is that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump have made a calculated decision that Mr. Cohen faces real legal peril for having given an illegal campaign contribution in the form of the Stormy Daniels payment, and that Mr. Trump might be subject to co-conspirator liability. The best defense against a Cohen conviction \u2014 or worse, a plea deal \u2014 on these grounds would be for Mr. Trump to take credit for the payment, since the candidate can give as much money as he wants to his own campaign.But whatever the plan, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments have turned the heat up on the president.Judging from Mr. Giuliani\u2019s contrived and ham-handed delivery, it seems likely that this was a highly coordinated affair. Indeed, according to Robert Costa of The Washington Post, Mr. Giuliani said the president was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with his remarks.In the middle of a friendly conversation with Mr. Hannity, Mr. Giuliani incongruously shifted the subject to the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. \u201cWhich, I mean, is going to turn out to be perfectly legal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat money was not campaign money. Sorry, I\u2019m giving you a fact now that you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not campaign money. No campaign finance violation.\u201d The former mayor continued, \u201cThey funneled through a law firm, and the president repaid it.\u201dHint for political fixers: Avoid using the word \u201cfunneled\u201d when explaining why your client didn\u2019t launder money. It tends to suggest that you are hiding the money\u2019s true source.Mr. Giuliani followed up with a boast that detractors have already panned as classic Rudy: \u201cEverybody was nervous about this from the very beginning. I wasn\u2019t. I knew how much money Donald Trump put into that campaign.\u201d Yet in the same breath, Mr. Giuliani asserted that Mr. Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t know about the specifics of it,\u201d just \u201cthe general arrangement, that Michael would take care of things like this.\u201dHe then veered into the preposterous, explaining that the Daniels payout was too insignificant to bear mentioning: \u201cLike, I take care of this with my clients. I don\u2019t burden them with every single thing that comes along. These are busy people.\u201dThe bottom line, according to Mr. Giuliani: Mr. Trump knew about the payment to Daniels and repaid Mr. Cohen. He needs to sell this story so that Mr. Cohen\u2019s payment was not a campaign contribution (more about that below) and that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t really know about the arrangement in advance, and so has minimal responsibility for what is turning out to be a colossal mess with Stormy Daniels.Good luck bearing up under an aggressive cross-examination on all this. It may, in fact, come to that, because among the many problems with Mr. Giuliani\u2019s story is that it makes him a witness to important facts in both the Cohen and Trump investigations.It also, of course, indicates that Mr. Trump was lying when he said he had no knowledge that Mr. Cohen had paid Ms. Daniels. Presumably the calculation of Team Trump is that his base exacts no cost for even the baldest of lies, even one offered as the final you-can-believe-me truth after months of prevarication.Moreover, if Mr. Giuliani believed that this labored account would put Mr. Trump and the campaign in the clear, he was most likely mistaken. Even if the $130,000 payment were construed as a loan, it would still amount to a campaign contribution and still need to be reported. It\u2019s true that the Federal Election Commission has historically gone lightly on such violations, but a knowing scheme to violate election laws would be a criminal felony. And assuming the charge would not fall under Robert Mueller\u2019s jurisdiction, the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York \u2014 where Mr. Giuliani is remembered as a headline grabber \u2014 are available to fill the breach.Ultimately, there seem to be two possible explanations for Mr. Giuliani\u2019s performance on Fox. The first is he was acting as a fully authorized agent for the Trump camp, which has made the calculation that some mixture of confusion and contrivance is the president\u2019s best bet for minimizing the damage to his presidency from the nettlesome Daniels affair. The second is that as the new legal boss, he had Mr. Trump\u2019s general O.K. and was freelancing in part and offering the latest in a series of partially baked solutions going back to Mr. Cohen\u2019s first story.Either way, and in keeping with the tradition of this White House, telling the truth to the American people seems to have played no role in the calculations.Advertisement"}

Voters in its middle-class suburbs and more affluent communities, in the hills of North Jersey, have sent Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen to the House every two years since 1994.While we have made no judgments about who would be the better candidate in the November general election, the most competitive primary race is among Democrats.Voters will find little significant policy differences between Ms. Sherrill and Ms. Harris, who are the leading candidates and hold traditional liberal views, including support for stricter gun control measures and Roe v. Wade.The primary race has been marked by insinuations from some of Ms. Harris\u2019s backers that local and national Democratic Party leaders rejected her in favor of Ms. Sherrill because Ms. Harris is African-American. We suspect it is Ms. Sherrill\u2019s military background and strong showing early in the race, drumming up support for months while Mr. Frelinghuysen was still expected to run, that made her so attractive to party leaders. But leaders of both parties should do far more to recruit and support black and Latino candidates, and pursue black and Latino votes with vigor. Democrats rely heavily on African-American voters, and even more so on black women, yet have done far too little to earn their votes.In New Jersey, it is clear that Ms. Harris and Ms. Sherrill are both capable of serving their constituents well. But we believe Ms. Sherrill is the strongest candidate, and endorse her with confidence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Jersey Town Actually Adds Beach Parking. And It\u2019s on the Beach.", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealt an abundance of space and sand, officials in Wildwood, N.J., have done what many towns up and down the Jersey Shore would consider unfathomable: turning part of its sizable beach space into sandy parking spots, even constructing a tunnel under the boardwalk to help cars reach the beach.\u201cThis area could potentially park, I mean, thousands of cars,\u201d Tom Miceli, supervisor of beach services for the City of Wildwood, said. \u201cThis is bigger than a mall parking lot, don\u2019t you think?\u201dWith the Memorial Day Weekend marking the unofficial start of the beach season, it also kicks off the perpetual battle over beach access in New Jersey, where towns along the 127-mile coast regulate parking spaces, meter rates, beach access points and, most contentiously, beach tag prices.But Wildwood, which is near the southern end of the Jersey Shore, is essentially turning the perennial battle on its head.Officials are using their vast wealth of sandy expanse to welcome any four-wheel-drive vehicles (not to be confused with all-wheel-drive, which will get stuck in the sand) to park on the newly accessible beach for $10 a day or $20 during special events like concerts. Nearby private lots can charge anywhere from $15 to as much as $30 on holiday weekends.The expansion centers on a new tunnel under the aged pine boardwalk that leads to a compressed slice of sand that will be set off by a rope and a sand berm.\u201cPeople are under the perception that when you drive through the tunnel, it\u2019s a free for all, and that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Pete Byron, the commissioner of the department of revenue and finance in Wildwood who came up with idea for the sandy parking lot, said.The town believes it could take in about $100,000 in new revenue just from parking, not to mention the surge local businesses could see from more visitors. (On Saturday, the beach was the scene of an altercation involving two Wildwood police officers one of whom was seen on a video punching a woman they were attempting to apprehend.)Some visitors viewed it as a much-needed alternative to the long journey across the sand. Kayla Cordero, 20, who lives in Philadelphia, said she had been coming to Wildwood all her life and was visiting with her 1-year-old daughter. As they sprinkled pepper on slices at the renowned Sam\u2019s Pizzeria on the boardwalk, Ms. Cordero pointed to her umbrella stroller leaning next to the table and said it was not the most optimal beach transportation for her daughter.\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s great to have the parking on the beach,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThen you\u2019ll only have to make the baby go a little bit.\u201dBut others found the notion of rows of cars lining the sand in front of the water jarring, if not potentially damaging to the surrounding area.\u201cI don\u2019t think there should be parking on any beach,\u2019\u2019 said Debbie Hirsch, 64, who was visiting Wildwood from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., with her husband, Raymond, and their dog. \u201cIt risks any wildlife that\u2019s growing over there.\u201d\u201cI just think it\u2019s weird to be looking out from the boardwalk to the ocean and you see a parking lot,\u201d Mr. Tittel said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know that I\u2019d like that experience.\u201dOther towns allow cars to park on the beach \u2014 Brigantine, just north of Atlantic City, has opened its beach to cars for years, though drivers must have yearly permits.But even as access grows in Wildwood, other towns can seem less accommodating. Ms. Greber, who bought her house in Harvey Cedars in 1994, suffered a stroke in 2008, leaving her unable to walk to the beach or propel a specially equipped wheelchair up the sand-clogged access ramps. Her husband had a heart attack and is unable to push her.So first she invested in a motorized wheelchair with beach tires, which cost her $4,000, but it, too, would get stuck in the soft shore sand. After extensive research she upgraded to a Kawasaki Mule, an all-terrain vehicle with a flat bed in the rear, which she paid $10,000 for in 2016 and regularly took to the beach that summer.\u201cI felt it was targeting me,\u201d Ms. Greber said.\u201cMy son-in-law surfs and my granddaughter is learning, and right now I can\u2019t go watch them,\u201d she said.The town argues that Ms. Greber does have options. \u201cWe believe that there are vehicles that are out there that our ordinance would fit and would be safe,\u201d Jonathan S. Oldham, the mayor of Harvey Cedars, said.About an hour north in Deal, two small kiosks that look like replicas of a municipal parking meter have been installed next to the stone steps off Monmouth Terrace, the sole evidence that the once-free beach now costs $8 on a weekday, and $10 on weekends.\u201cI grew up in New Jersey, so going to the Shore, this is sacred,\u201d said Katrina Plotkin, 21, who lives in Northport, N.Y., and was visiting friends in the area. \u201cWe try to do the beach the right way. We go out down the shore at the right bars, and you wake up and you go to the beach, and you want to go to a free beach.\u201dThe town hopes that charging to get on the beach might discourage some drivers and address its failed efforts to curb parking in nearby residential neighborhoods.\u201cNow that they\u2019re asking for money,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Plotkin said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll come back.\u201dBut in Wildwood, the combination of a free beach and a more convenient parking lot has some New Jersey residents planning to make it their summer go-to.\u201cYou go to Ocean City, there\u2019s barely any room to find a spot to beach out, but here it\u2019s huge,\u201d Chris Caron, a 28-year-old small-business owner from Williamson, said. \u201cIf you can park your car on the beach, why not?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Her campaign raised $57,500 leading up to the primary, twice as much as her opponent, with 84 percent of the donations from people who live outside Ohio, according to campaign finance records.\u201cFor others, especially those across the United States, I think they view me running as part of the anti-Trump movement that they want to support,\u201d Ms. Crooks, 35, said in an email on Wednesday.Her supporters in Ohio, she added, have been motivated by a wave of liberal enthusiasm and a desire to elect the first woman to represent the district. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s all of these things,\u201d she said.Yet, Ms. Crooks, an administrator at Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio, enters the general election for District 88 at a disadvantage.The Republican incumbent, Bill Reineke, whom she will face in November, won easily in 2014 and was re-elected in 2016 when he ran unopposed.

{"Headline": "U.S. Places New Sanctions on Venezuela Day After Election", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration placed new sanctions on Venezuela on Monday, seeking to block President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from selling off government debt to enrich himself the day after he claimed victory in what the United States government called a \u201csham\u201d election in his crisis-ridden country.President Trump signed an executive order imposing the new penalties, which would bar United States companies or citizens from buying debt or accounts receivable from the Venezuelan government, including Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the government-owned oil company that is the parent of Citgo Petroleum Corporation.The measures were devised to close off an \u201cavenue for corruption\u201d that senior administration officials said they had observed Mr. Maduro and members of his government using to enrich themselves. The officials, who described the sanctions on the condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to be named discussing them, declined to reveal any specific instances.The action comes as Venezuela reels from an economic collapse that has caused a humanitarian crisis, as citizens flee a country suffering from food shortages, soaring prices, a broken-down health system and a rash of crime.\u201cThe illegitimate result of this fake process is a further blow to the proud democratic tradition of Venezuela,\u201d Mr. Pence said in a statement, adding, \u201cThe United States will not sit idly by as Venezuela crumbles and the misery of their brave people continues.\u201dOne senior administration official said Mr. Maduro, afraid to risk real competition in the contest, had choreographed the election process to his advantage, stacking the courts and National Electoral Council with his cronies, banning opposition leaders and parties, cracking down on news media that was not sympathetic to him, and selectively parceling out food and money on Election Day to manipulate hungry Venezuelans into voting for him. The official said Mr. Maduro had set up tents just feet away from polling locations where voters had to scan \u201cfatherland cards\u201d to show they voted in exchange for cash or food.The sanctions imposed Monday, the third round that Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has placed on Venezuela, are intended to stop Mr. Maduro and his government from using a strategy they have pursued to raise cash as their ability to siphon money from the strapped economy weakens.The government has been selling off debt held by government entities, including accounts receivable, for a pittance of what it is worth, the officials said, pocketing the cash and leaving Venezuela\u2019s finances in shambles.The sanctions fall short of direct penalties on the oil sector, which the Trump administration has said would harm the Venezuelan people and American companies. They do not bar United States companies or citizens from selling oil products to or importing them from Venezuela.Last August, when Mr. Trump imposed his first financial sanctions on Venezuela, his administration provided an exemption for financing of petroleum imports and exports and an explicit carve-out for Citgo.At the time, the White House said Citgo\u2019s exemption was a bid \u201cto mitigate harm to the American and Venezuelan people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Gerber daisies and a half-dozen hydrangeas?\u201cYes, Cynthia is woman, and yes she represents a lot of our values, but we have a governor who literally created the party,\u201d Susan Zimet, the chairwoman of the W.E.P. told me.During the 2014 election, Mr. Cuomo drove around the state in a bus called the Women\u2019s Equality Express, which had a pink stripe adorning its side. Some found the entire enterprise craven and patronizing \u2014 and an obvious effort to peel off votes from the W.F.P., which had been fighting for paid sick leave and other causes vital to women\u2019s lives for many years. Others found it duplicitous, given the rampant culture of sexual harassment that had been permitted to fester for so long in the state capital.When it was founded, the W.E.P. was financed largely through a loan from Mr. Cuomo\u2019s 2014 campaign. A second loan, from his current campaign, came several months ago, according to Rachel Gold, the state\u2019s former deputy commissioner of labor and the party\u2019s treasurer. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the bandwidth to do fund-raising,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a website or a coffee mug.\u201d\u201cI see that Liuba is running a pretty remarkable campaign; I admire her,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Zimet told me. \u201cBut DuWayne came as a recommendation through our state committee person.\u201d This statement has all the passion of someone telling you that she chose her husband because of the prudent manner in which he managed his 401(k). Mr. Gregory had stood by the party for a long while.It seems like a strange moment \u2014 when the universe seems to be correcting for the countless errors of the patriarchy \u2014 to be rewarding apparatchik loyalty over feminist ambition. Will women voters feel exploited by what they might see as a ruse, and will that anger rebound in Ms. Nixon\u2019s favor? Women are tired of being used.It is true that Mr. Cuomo has supported a lot of legislation favorable to women. Yet he also enabled the so-called Independent Democratic Conference, a group of Democratic state senators that caucused with Republicans and stood in the way of the kind of progressive legislation that one expects in deep-blue states. The State Senate still has not passed the Reproductive Health Act, which would take state abortion law, which predates Roe v. Wade, out of the penal code. Doctors are often afraid to perform later-term abortions for fear of being prosecuted.The W.E.P. has been involved in many small, local races in the past few years. (\u201cIt can make a difference in a suburb of Syracuse,\u2019\u2019 as Ms. Gold put it.) This year the party says it has been inundated for requests for support from mayors, county legislators, family court judges \u2014 even from county coroners. Some of those requests are being made sincerely, one assumes, and some are being made by those who see an opportunity. Who knows what kind of causes a feminist coroner might champion?An earlier version of this article misstated the primary election results of Zephyr Teachout, a Democratic candidate for governor of New York in 2014. Ms. Teachout won a third of the votes, not nearly a third.Advertisement"}

So how did it become the biggest single-owner auction in history?Part of the answer is that so-called trophy art has become a lot more expensive.\u201cThe collection overall is very dowdy, very end of an era,\u201d said Wendy Cromwell, an art adviser based in New York. She added, however, that many of the works on offer Tuesday night appealed to new buyers. \u201cMillionaires are created every day in China, and they\u2019re eager to acquire things that smack of the great capitalists of American society,\u201d Ms. Cromwell said.That a nine-figure price could be regarded as a relative disappointment indicates just how far values have climbed since the Saint Laurent sale in 2009.The report estimated the world\u2019s ultra-wealthy had a total worth of $26.4 trillion.\u201cEconomic inequality has lots of down sides, but it has opened up the art market at the high end,\u201d said Evan Beard, a national art services executive at U.S. Trust, a wealth-management unit of Bank of America. For Mr. Beard, the influx into the market of new, finance-minded collectors from across the world has been unprecedented.\u201cThere\u2019s so much liquidity squashing around, it\u2019s driving up prices,\u201d he said.But art inflation is one thing, and the power of a name is another. It will never be possible to quantify exactly how much Rockefeller branding contributed to the success of the sale, but it was widely acknowledged as a significant factor.\u201cRockefeller is one of the few names that has become a metonym,\u201d Mr. Beard said. \u201cLike Medici or Rothschild, Rockefeller is a metonym for wealth. Every one of these works has a Rockefeller premium.\u201dThe auction slogan \u201cLive like a Rockefeller,\u201d cleverly prioritizing experience over possession, proved most effective for Christie\u2019s on Wednesday during the day sale of porcelain services. Seemingly hopelessly out of step with the informal eating habits of today, these opulent relics of a bygone lifestyle achieved a succession of prices that were multiples of their estimates, lifted by global internet bidding.\u201cIt was not a leading-edge collection, but it was a great name,\u201d said Ms. Cromwell, the New York art adviser.But the numbers would have been even bigger had the Rockefellers bought Pollock rather than porcelain.Advertisement"}

They have to contend with the repercussions of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran and the increasing likelihood of a trade war with China and the European Union. And all this is happening at a time when a boom in corporate earnings, the chief driver of the stock market, appears to be cooling.Up until January, investors were willing to pay high valuations for stocks because they expected corporate earnings to accelerate this year. But the best may already be behind us. Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, on Monday wrote that analysts now believe that earnings growth for this year likely peaked in the first quarter (at 23 percent over last year\u2019s first quarter.) After such peaks, the stock market tends to remain weak for a while, she added.Investors likely won\u2019t have a big new jump in profits to look forward to. Earnings are expected to grow 10 percent next year, according to estimates compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s. Without sustained support from corporate earnings, investors may be more willing to sell stocks in response to geopolitical events.And in the coming weeks, there will be plenty of potential trade war triggers. The Trump administration could decide to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from a number of countries, including those in the European Union, when exemptions expire at the end of this month. Proposed tariffs on $50 billion of goods from China could also be imposed this month, and the White House could release details on a second batch of tariffs on $100 billion of Chinese products.Since neither the European Union nor China looks close to caving to Mr. Trump\u2019s threats, global trade tensions look set to escalate and a full-blown trade war is possible.Investors may continue to hang tight, of course. The stock market is flat for the year, not a bad performance for a period in which the underpinnings of the international economic order are under assault.But that support will most likely convince him that he is on the right track \u2013 and he will press on with his hard-edged international policies. But more than at any time in his presidency, he should not expect the stock market to tag along.\u2014 Peter EavisDisney reported its strongest quarterly results in two years.

{"Headline": "Giuliani Says Trump Would Not Have to Comply With Mueller Subpoena", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rudolph W. Giuliani, reeling after a chaotic first week as President Trump\u2019s lawyer, tried again on Sunday to straighten out his client\u2019s story. But Mr. Giuliani raised new questions about whether Mr. Trump had paid hush money to other women and suggested the president might invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying in the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation.Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York City mayor hired by Mr. Trump to smooth communication between the White House and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, instead painted Mr. Mueller as an out-of-control prosecutor bent on trapping Mr. Trump into committing perjury. The president, he said, could defy a subpoena to testify.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said in a rambling, 22-minute interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d program. \u201cHe\u2019s the president of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.\u201dMr. Giuliani, who met with the special counsel\u2019s office shortly after joining the legal team last month, said he and another lawyer, Jay Sekulow, agreed that the president should not speak to Mr. Mueller. But he acknowledged that he had little, if any, control over the president, who said as recently as Friday that he still wanted to speak to the special counsel.\u201cHow can I ever be confident of that?\u201d Mr. Giuliani said, when asked whether Mr. Trump would not invoke his right to avoid self-incrimination. \u201cI\u2019m facing a situation with the president and all the other lawyers are, in which every lawyer in America thinks he would be a fool to testify, I\u2019ve got a client who wants to testify.\u201d\u201cI have no knowledge of that,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said when asked about other payments, \u201cbut I would think if it was necessary, yes.\u201dIf Mr. Trump were to invoke the Fifth Amendment, he would undercut his longstanding claim that he has nothing to hide about his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. During the presidential campaign, he ridiculed his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, when some of her aides invoked the Fifth Amendment during a congressional investigation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.\u201cThe mob takes the Fifth,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa in September 2016. \u201cIf you\u2019re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?\u201dAfter his interview, Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Trump at his golf club in Northern Virginia.Mr. Giuliani told the ABC anchor, George Stephanopoulos, that he was still getting up to speed on Mr. Trump\u2019s legal issues \u2014 a fact that became apparent as the interview went on. As was the case during his interviews last week, Mr. Giuliani seemed to speak largely off the cuff. He speculated freely and contradicted himself, sometimes from one statement to the next.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the amount of government misconduct is accumulating,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cVery embarrassing to my former Justice Department.\u201dMr. Giuliani created a furor on Wednesday when he contradicted the president about the payment to Ms. Clifford. Speaking on Fox News, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen has said he made to Ms. Clifford, to keep her from making public a story about an affair she claims she had with Mr. Trump \u2014 a claim that he denies. When asked in April by reporters traveling on Air Force One whether he knew about the payment, Mr. Trump said he did not.On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani said he was still trying to establish when Mr. Trump learned that Mr. Cohen had paid Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. But he added that as a legal matter, it did not matter since the payment did not violate federal campaign finance rules.Asked about the discrepancies between his account and the president\u2019s statement, Mr. Giuliani said: \u201cThose don\u2019t amount to anything \u2014 what is said to the press. That\u2019s political.\u201dMr. Giuliani did not shed much new light on the nature of the payments themselves. He said Mr. Cohen \u201cmade payments for the president, or he conducted business for president, which means he had legal fees, moneys laid out and expenditures.\u201d But he characterized the sum Ms. Clifford received as a \u201cnuisance\u201d payment.\u201cI never thought $130,000 was a real payment,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go away for $130,000.\u201dMr. Giuliani accused Ms. Clifford of trying to make as much money as possible from her notoriety, noting that she made a cameo appearance during the opening skit on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201dMr. Giuliani\u2019s admission on Wednesday caught Mr. Trump\u2019s staff off guard and prompted Mr. Trump to try to clarify the nature of payments he made to Mr. Cohen. The morning after Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Mr. Cohen \u201creceived a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.\u201dA day later, he told reporters gathered outside the White House that Mr. Giuliani did not know the particulars of the case, even after Mr. Giuliani told The Times on Wednesday night that he had spoken with the president before and after his interview on Fox News, and that Mr. Trump and other lawyers on the team were aware of what he would say.\u201cVirtually everything said has been said incorrectly, and it\u2019s been said wrong, or it\u2019s been covered wrong by the press,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019ll get his facts straight.\u201dSeeming to chastise Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump added: \u201cYou know what? Learn before you speak. It\u2019s a lot easier.\u201dSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal and political advisers believe Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments could put the president in legal jeopardy, since federal officials are required to report liabilities of more than $10,000 during the preceding year. Mr. Trump\u2019s last disclosure, which he signed last June, does not mention any debt to Mr. Cohen.On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani tried to clarify what Mr. Trump called a \u201cretainer.\u201d\u201cThe retainer agreement was to repay expenses, which turns out to have included this one,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.Appearing after Mr. Giuliani on the same program, Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, called Mr. Giuliani\u2019s interview an \u201cabsolute unmitigated disaster\u201d and \u201cone of the worst TV appearances by any attorney on behalf of a client in modern times.\u201d\u201cHe now expects the American people to believe that he doesn\u2019t really know the facts,\u201d Mr. Avenatti added. \u201cI think it is obvious to the American people that this is a cover-up, that they are making it up as they go along.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As U.S. and Chinese Teams Meet on Trade, One Side Has an Edge in Expertise", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China is struggling to find people in Washington who can provide insight into the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive moves on trade. One senior American trade insider tried to help \u2014 and wound up in Beijing with little to do but check out the pottery.That insider, Alan Wolff, a veteran senior adviser to the top United States trade representative and a frequent visitor to Beijing, came to China two weeks ago to speak at a conference on agricultural trade and sought to make contact with top Chinese policymakers.But they did not respond to his requests for meetings, and they said days later that they had not known who he was. Mr. Wolff, an admirer of ancient pottery, instead spent a quiet Saturday in a Beijing museum browsing 2,200-year-old bowls.As members of the Trump administration delegation arrived in Beijing on Thursday for two days of high-level talks, they sat across from Chinese officials with limited experience in trade matters.After a bureaucratic reshuffling, the members of China\u2019s new negotiating team have deep backgrounds in economics and finance, but they are less comfortable with the minutiae of trade laws. And although they are familiar with the American delegation\u2019s main players, they are less acquainted with who does what among lower-level advisers and officials when it comes to United States trade policy.Both countries have played down the possibility that the negotiations will resolve the simmering tensions between them. Still, Chinese officials\u2019 lack of experience in international trade law could make it even harder for the two sides to find common ground before the talks end on Friday.\u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where the Ministry of Commerce doesn\u2019t have all the people in place that it wants to have,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a former four-time chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, citing the Chinese agency that traditionally handles trade matters. \u201cI really think they are unprepared for the negotiation that is taking place.\u201dChinese officials dispute that characterization, saying the reorganization will not hurt a stance that they describe as tough but flexible.\u201cI don\u2019t think it is a problem, or that this process of organizational reform will affect the ability to negotiate,\u201d Li Gang, the vice president of the Chinese commerce ministry\u2019s research and training academy, said in a recent interview.The new team of top Chinese negotiators, few of whom come from the Commerce Ministry, is led by Liu He. Mr. Liu, an economist by training, is a close adviser and longtime friend of President Xi Jinping. Senior Chinese officials and their advisers spoke about economic policy at a three-day Tsinghua University seminar that ended on Monday. Most of them insisted on anonymity for reasons of diplomatic sensitivity.Those attending the seminar said that Chinese negotiators had a warm relationship with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who is a member of the American delegation and a former Goldman Sachs executive. He was described as easy to talk to.Chinese officials said they felt less of a connection to the rest of the group, which includes, among others, Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who was described as brusque by people on the Chinese side; Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser and longtime critic of China; Larry Kudlow, who leads the National Economic Council; and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary.Many of the negotiators representing the United States are more comfortable than their Chinese counterparts with the fine points of trade policy. Mr. Lighthizer, for example, has been immersed in trade issues continuously since the Carter administration, working closely throughout with Mr. Wolff, and has taken a harder stance.By contrast, after a series of bureaucratic reorganizations in recent months, many of China\u2019s top trade negotiators are now economists and bankers with little practical experience in trade matters. The Commerce Ministry\u2019s two main officials for trade talks with the United States, veterans who have negotiated with Washington since the 1990s, were each awarded ambassadorships last year and dispatched to Europe.One senior Chinese official at the seminar who insisted on anonymity said there was deep frustration among his colleagues that, when the two sides talked in the past, American negotiators continually raised details about Chinese trade practices and international trade laws, while those on the Chinese side preferred to discuss a coherent economic strategy.Chinese policymakers are also annoyed about the number of United States agencies involved in the talks. Officials in China are accustomed to dealing with the Treasury, which coordinated American economic policy toward Beijing for nearly two decades. They are less accustomed to dealing with the office of the United States trade representative, which has consistently tilted toward more assertive policies and has a prominent role under President Trump.The senior Chinese official said he missed the old Treasury-led team every day, and Chinese officials have suggested regularly this year that the United States revive that approach. Doing so could allow Treasury to take charge again, even though United States law says the trade agency should be in charge of trade issues.On the Chinese side, the rise of economists and bankers is part of a broad reshuffling meant to consolidate the Communist Party\u2019s political power.As part of the reorganization, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry was broken in March into three separate groups each focused on different issues. The ministry\u2019s office of trade negotiations still exists and has numerous trade lawyers, but people involved with the negotiations say the shuffling has robbed the office of resources and support.What the commission largely lacks are trade lawyers.Chances that the talks would yield major progress appeared slim on Thursday. China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, reiterated Beijing\u2019s stance that should a trade war break out, the country was better prepared thanks to its centralized leadership, strong domestic consumer base and greater desire to protect the current structure of trade.At the seminar over the weekend, Chinese officials also struck a defiant tone. Peng Guangqian, a retired major general who remains an influential military strategist, said, \u201cPresident Trump wants to curb our development.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Break, or Kickback? Energy Benefit Becomes a Lightning Rod", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut a growing chorus of public agencies complain that they were prevented from benefiting from this same incentive in their own building projects. Conflicting interpretations of the law and how it should be applied, they say, have caused taxpayer-funded schools, prisons, military bases and libraries throughout the nation to lose out on millions of dollars in savings.The issue has heated up as state and local governments, and other public entities, move more aggressively to claim a piece of this federal subsidy. Lobbyists and lawyers have joined the scramble as Congress revisits this incentive and decides whether to extend it along with a raft of other tax breaks left out of last year\u2019s tax overhaul.\u201cIt rarely gives the benefits to the parties you intended to give it to,\u201d he said, \u201cand more often rewards parties that you never intended to reward.\u201dThe law did not specify whether a public project or agency should get anything in exchange for the transfer. But taxpayer advocates argue that enabling a public entity to negotiate with a private contractor for a reduced fee or a rebate in return for signing away the 179D deduction was clearly the point.\u201cThe whole purpose of the tax deduction was to incentivize owners, and our situation as a governmental entity is no different from Apple or any other corporate entity,\u201d Philip Aldridge, vice chancellor for business development at the University of Texas, said. The University of Texas System and the University of Houston System have filed a lawsuit arguing that they were misled into transferring incentives worth millions of dollars without compensation.\u201cWe own the building, we financed 100 percent of the building, and we, as the owner, determined whether the building was going to be energy efficient or not,\u201d Mr. Aldridge said.\u201cGovernment can\u2019t give away things of value without being compensated,\u201d Mr. Duchac said.A few lawmakers have also warned federal officials that asking for fees in return for allocating the deduction might amount to a \u201ckickback.\u201dBut more and more state agencies, public entities and others are pushing back against that interpretation.The question of who deserves to benefit from the 179D tax deduction is particularly complicated because both contractors and governments are often unaware of it until after the project\u2019s completion.That\u2019s where the consultants come in.\u201cNot many know about this,\u201d said Barry Fischman, a partner at the accounting firm Marcum. Most of the time, he said, the deduction is sought when \u201cthe job is already done, finished and closed.\u201dNo matter that the tax break did not work as intended \u2014 since it did not act as an incentive to invest in energy efficiencies that wouldn\u2019t have been done anyway. It can still be claimed.Tax consultants, pointing out that recent tax returns can be amended, urge private contractors to take advantage of a windfall and request 179D transfers related to previous public projects.Public agencies, however, complain of simultaneously being told that they have no right to engage in a parallel look back and ask for a share of that money in return for the transfer.In a statement, Alliantgroup said: \u201cWe are disappointed that the University of Texas System and University of Houston System have been led into a frivolous lawsuit against Alliantgroup and our client.\u201dThe firm also noted that members of Congress and other government agencies had said 179D \u201cwas not intended to provide kickbacks to government entities who do not pay taxes in exchange for a tax-deduction allocation letter.\u201dSenator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, raised the issue of kickbacks, too, in 2016 when the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development asked for compensation in exchange for transferring its energy deductions from a completed project.A spokeswoman for Mr. Cardin said the senator\u2019s objection referred solely to public agencies demanding a fee for administering the confirmation letter, and not to \u201cusing 179D writ large as a way to negotiate a project\u2019s cost.\u201dOther schools have also taken issue with applications overseen by Alliantgroup. The University of Connecticut discovered that the firm had solicited a 179D transfer from unauthorized employees on behalf of different clients for the same project.\u201cI was dismayed,\u201d said Scott A. Jordan, the University of Connecticut\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cThere seemed to be a bounty sort of system where companies like Alliant were coming in and pressing owners to sign off on behalf of clients.\u201d The incident, he said, prompted the university to devise a formal policy on how to handle the incentive.As for the broader issue of who should benefit, Mr. Jordan pointed out that the university\u2019s board already required buildings to be energy efficient. \u201cIf we have already established policy, we don\u2019t need an incentive to do that,\u201d he said.But if the federal government is going to subsidize energy efficiency, he added, then \u201cthe owners should be the recipients of the subsidy and not the builder.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Before there was a hint of collusion with Russia, there were questions about Donald Trump\u2019s finances. In those more innocent days, the questions were mainly about propriety \u2014 why wouldn\u2019t he release his tax returns like other presidential candidates had? \u2014 and perhaps a hint of ox-goring: \u201cBillionaire? He\u2019s no billionaire!\u201dThis week it has become clearer that questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s finances, and those about whether his campaign cooperated with Russian hacking of the 2016 election, need to be asked in the same breath.Those corporations \u2014 AT&T, the pharmaceutical company Novartis and Korea Aerospace \u2014 paid the shell company, Essential Consultants, during last year. All do business with the federal government or can be affected by federal actions, such as possible controls on drug prices or the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against AT&T\u2019s proposed acquisition of Time Warner.It also contradicts what Eric and his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., said in the years before the word \u201cRussian\u201d became radioactive for them.Around the time Donald Trump said goodbye to American banks, he said hello to Mr. Cohen, a lawyer whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9, one might have expected, would have screamed, \u201cStay away!\u201d to a legitimate businessman.Even during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Cohen pursued plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow, coordinating with Felix Sater, a felon with ties to Russian mobsters who had worked on other deals with Mr. Trump.Mr. Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with Russians, and Mr. Manafort is under indictment on charges of financial crimes that involved Russians.Russians and cash \u2014 they\u2019ve been a part of Mr. Trump\u2019s life for years, and now they\u2019re elements of the investigation into whether his campaign conspired with Moscow to corrupt American democracy.

It\u2019s a likable memoir of how Jay and Mark Duplass blazed their idiosyncratic trail, and an inspiring how-to guide for anyone who might wish to follow it.Sure, there are also parts that seem extraneous or simply don\u2019t work, but the Duplasses never pretend to be masters of their craft. As they write in the book: \u201cIt seems that people like the Coen brothers have a specific vision of what their movies will look like from the moment they begin writing them, and then somehow are able to realize that vision and make those movies, for the most part, inspired and impeccably amazing. We, however, are not the Coen brothers.\u201dIn episodic chapters, the Duplasses recount their upbringing in Metairie, La., and boyhood rites of passage like getting cable TV and a video camera to shoot their first movies. There\u2019s a refreshing unpretentiousness to these sections: The brothers are unabashed fans of kitsch like \u201cThe Karate Kid Part II\u201d and the soft-rock duo Air Supply, and their close-knit kinship turns poignant when Jay has an emotional breakdown as a student at the University of Texas at Austin and Mark, still in high school, travels there to take care of him.Though their early, self-financed foray into grown-up moviemaking is a mediocre \u201cRocky\u201d knockoff called \u201cVince Del Rio,\u201d the brothers eventually earn acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival: first, in 2003, with a $3 short film called \u201cThis Is John,\u201d and then, in 2005, with \u201cThe Puffy Chair,\u201d a relationship road-trip feature.Initially, the Duplasses seem to be living the fantasy of every indie filmmaker: \u201cBuyers, agents, managers, producers and studio executives were all swarming us,\u201d they write. But they quickly realize that these industry big shots are interested in developing other ideas with them, not in acquiring the movie the Duplasses made using $10,000 borrowed from their parents. \u201cIn short,\u201d they write, \u201cwe seemed to be in demand, but we couldn\u2019t figure out how to actually make money.\u201dIt takes many months for the brothers to receive a legitimate offer for \u201cThe Puffy Chair,\u201d and while they are eager to accept it, for the amount of money alone, they somehow find the fortitude to resist, and end up agreeing to a different deal \u2014 one that provides no money up front but includes distribution from an upstart DVD-by-mail company called Netflix. It\u2019s a valuable lesson in patience that has continued to pay dividends for the Duplasses, who signed a four-picture deal with Netflix earlier this year.While I appreciated the brothers\u2019 honest tales of dealing with anxiety, filial conflict and failing equipment during their collaborations, I was less taken with a chapter in which they reproduce an early draft of one of their unfilmed story ideas, along with Jay\u2019s handwritten notes, though readers\u2019 interest in this sort of paraphernalia may vary.Other sections, in which they compile and consolidate lists of their Top 10 films of all time, or imagine elaborate back stories for strangers they see at airports, may seem charming to devoted fans but felt like filler to me.More worrisome were passages in which the brothers, for all of their enthusiasm and desire to get others to participate in cinema, seem unaware of their inherent privilege as white men from a comfortable background, and who, as siblings working together, have an irresistible gimmick.It\u2019s probably not especially helpful for struggling, financially strapped young filmmakers at the start of their careers to be told to buy a house as soon as possible and pay off the mortgage by renting out bedrooms to creative pals. And the brothers\u2019 advice to invest in the stock market \u2014 the Duplasses say they bought \u201ca slew of shares\u201d of Netflix in 2005 \u2014 isn\u2019t practical unless you possess a trust fund or a time machine.Still, it\u2019s hard not to root for the Duplasses in moments like the one when their sales agent tells them they\u2019re not allowed to attend the Sundance after-party for their film \u201cBaghead,\u201d lest it appear that they\u2019re not engaged in heated efforts to get the movie sold.In another passage, they find themselves fighting with studio executives who want them to reshoot a scene from \u201cCyrus,\u201d because they feel the apartment of its lead character \u2014 a depressed divorc\u00e9 \u2014 needs more throw pillows. After getting uncharacteristically loud and standing their ground, the brothers win the day. \u201cFrom that moment forward,\u201d the Duplasses write, \u201cthey pretty much let us do our thing. Which was a wonderful and terrible thing in the end.\u201dDave Itzkoff is a culture reporter at The Times.

Instead, it may soon play out in real life, with Comcast, led by Brian L. Roberts, trying to pry the bulk of 21st Century Fox away from Disney and its chief executive, Robert A. Iger. \u201cIt will be a bloody battle,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst.But Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, thinks it has a new opening.Cue the battle royale.Here is what you need to know as the tension mounts.How serious is Comcast about a potential hostile bid?At the same time, it\u2019s possible nothing comes of that maneuvering. Comcast, which declined to comment, is waiting for the outcome of the AT&T case to make up its mind.Exactly what are the Fox assets?Why does Comcast want the Fox assets so badly?It boils down to this: Comcast, like Disney, wants to add bulk as a counterattack against Netflix and other tech giants that have aggressively moved into the entertainment business.\u201cThere will only be a handful of global, scale players,\u201d Todd Juenger, an analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a research report on May 9. \u201cWe think Disney and Comcast increasingly view Fox as the seminal defining point, and this the moment in time, in determining which company ascends to that role.\u201dNBCUniversal has been white hot \u2014 revenue soared 21 percent in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier \u2014 and its portfolio includes the fastest-growing cable network (MSNBC) and the No. 1 cable entertainment network (USA). In the longer term, however, NBCUniversal likely needs a bigger content war chest to compete against Netflix, Amazon, Apple and their ilk.How is Disney likely to respond to a Comcast bid?Comcast has some deal baggage. A 2015 attempt to buy Time Warner Cable collapsed under pressure from regulators, who found that the combined company would have had the power and incentive to inhibit the future of streaming video.If the AT&T deal goes through, does that mean easy regulatory sailing for a potential Comcast-Fox union?No. Timothy Horan, an analyst at Oppenheimer who has expressed support for a Comcast move on Fox, wrote in a May 9 research note that approval for the AT&T deal would help open a regulatory path but that Comcast would still face a \u201cdifficult\u201d road.Antitrust experts note that Comcast-Fox would have more overlapping businesses than AT&T-Time Warner. Comcast-Fox would also control more of the overall entertainment supply chain \u2014 \u201ca content and distribution superpower like we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d as Mr. Nathanson put it in a phone interview.Comcast has a bigger broadband business than AT&T, which could raise government concerns that Comcast could use that power to hurt competitors, especially as the internet grows in importance as a video pipe, some analysts say.Comcast shares have dropped 24 percent since late January. Does the apparent lack of shareholder support for a Fox bid mean Comcast will back off?No. Comcast does not need shareholder approval for a cash offer. Moreover, Comcast executives probably see the decline as temporary and not entirely related to the hostile bid rumblings. Comcast\u2019s cable competitor Charter has seen its shares decline about 28 percent over the same period.Does Comcast have the money to make a hostile bid?The company would borrow to make a cash offer, and banks are willing. Comcast has healthy financials.It would, however, mean taking on an amount of debt \u2014 at least $164 billion \u2014 that Moody\u2019s last week called \u201cstaggering\u201d and said would probably imperil Comcast\u2019s A3 credit rating.\u201cThat sounds like a nearly impossible level of debt to sustain,\u201d Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research, wrote in a recent report. But he argued that it was not as scary upon a closer look. Given Fox synergies and cash flow, \u201cNet debt by the end of 2020 would drop to below $130 billion \u2014 essentially in line with a combined AT&T Time Warner.\u201dWhere does this leave Fox shareholders?In the catbird seat. Even if Disney ultimately wins \u2014 as Mr. Nathanson predicts \u2014 Comcast can drive up the price.He added, \u201cOur directors, though, of course, are aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.\u201dAdvertisement"}

According to federal law, hospitals are required to provide emergency care and to stabilize all patients regardless of a patient\u2019s ability to pay. A result is that hospitals provide billions of dollars in uncompensated care to uninsured patients every year.But when patients don\u2019t pay for their hospital care, those costs are shifted to government and private health insurers, who are charged higher rates by hospitals to make up for the losses they incur from nonpaying patients. In essence, this dysfunctional system is a camouflaged tax.A far better approach would be to eliminate the costly bureaucracy and replace it with a single-payer, \u201cHospital for All\u201d plan.THOMAS M.

Asking frightened patients to diagnose their illnesses without the benefit of training is absurd on its face.Anthem, like most health insurers, is obligated to maximize the wealth of its shareholders. The company has been very successful in this regard, generating profits of $3.8 billion in 2017, and paying an effective tax rate of 3.1 percent, according to Healthcare Finance.The practice of threatening not to cover an E.R. visit is consistent with this goal. What does it matter if a few patients die or are injured because they are afraid of getting hit with a large medical bill? Profits jumped by 55 percent in 2017!When third-party payers are driven to be profitable, these types of incentives result.

It did warn that its financial results may be affected, depending on the outcome of the investigation.The announcement helped drive Symantec\u2019s shares down by a third in Friday\u2019s trading.The fact that the audit committee is involved and that Symantec said its annual financial filing might now be delayed, suggests the company\u2019s book-keeping is under the spotlight. The issue may, of course, end up being minor. But until Symantec, which declined to comment, provides details, outsiders will look for red flags. Here are some:\u2014 Peter EavisThe deal could come as early as next week, Bloomberg reports. The N.F.L. owners would have to approve the transaction, and Mr. Tepper would have to sell his stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers.Add Randall Stephenson, the telecom giant\u2019s C.E.O., as another corporate chieftain who regretted getting involved with President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.Mr. Stephenson sent out a memo to employees about the company\u2019s $600,000 contract with Essential Consultants, the shell company that Mr. Cohen had created (and which was also used to pay $130,000 to Stormy Daniels).In the memo, the AT&T C.E.O. said, \u201cThere is no other way to say it \u2013 AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake,\u201d though he added that the company followed the law.Yet it also said that its legislative affairs team would now report to the telecom\u2019s general counsel, David McAtee. The team\u2019s senior executive vice president, Bob Quinn, will be \u201cretiring.\u201dHere\u2019s the full text of the memo, which was obtained by DealBook:Our company has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons these last few days and our reputation has been damaged. There is no other way to say it \u2013 AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake.To be clear, everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate. But the fact is, our past association with Cohen was a serious misjudgment. In this instance, our Washington D.C. team\u2019s vetting process clearly failed, and I take responsibility for that. Here is more information on this issue, if you\u2019re interested.For the foreseeable future, the External & Legislative Affairs (E&LA) group will report to our General Counsel David McAtee. Bob Quinn, Senior Executive Vice President - E&LA, will be retiring.David\u2019s number one priority is to ensure every one of the individuals and firms we use in the political arena are people who share our high standards and who we would be proud to have associated with AT&T.To all of you who work tirelessly every day to serve customers and represent the brand proudly, thank you. My personal commitment to you is \u2013 we will do better.RandallIn a separate document, the company discussed several other points about the hiring of Essential Consultants\u2014 including the fact that Mr. Cohen approached AT&T:Michael Cohen approached our External Affairs organization during the post-election transition period and said he was going to leave the Trump Organization and do consulting for a select few companies that wanted his opinion on the new President and his administration \u2013 the key players, their priorities, and how they think.The company also noted that it had hired \u201cpolitical consultants\u201d in the past, especially at the beginning of new administrations.\u2014 Michael de la MercedSymantec said the investigation was in its early stages and warned its \u201cfinancial results and guidance may be subject to change based on the outcome.\u201dIf Symantec\u2019s stock closes at its current levels, it would mark its worst single-day decline in 17 years and second worst fall in its history.First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done!

Global told the NYT: \u201cLike any deleveraging campaign, it is not painless.\u201dThe push into credit cards is fraught for Goldman, whose track record in consumer finance is scarcely two years old. Credit cards are a cutthroat business dominated by larger rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Yields are falling. And Goldman lacks much of the infrastructure to be able to issue credit cards and process payments to merchants.An earlier version of this briefing incorrectly said China\u2019s debt was 256 times the country\u2019s gross domestic product.

The front end had been badly crumpled in an accident, and Ms. Jones did not have the money to fix it.Her car wasn\u2019t going anywhere. But she was.Ms. Jones, 24, put on a cap, gown and high heels on Wednesday afternoon and walked past the hobbled Jetta on her way to graduate from Georgia State University. Her sister would be giving her a ride to the ceremony.For decades, Georgia State was downtown Atlanta\u2019s rather unremarkable commuter school, founded \u201cas a night school for white businessmen,\u201d as the college\u2019s spokeswoman, Andrea Jones, says, and kept racially segregated until the 1960s.But the college has been reimagined \u2014 amid a moral awakening and a raft of data-driven experimentation \u2014 as one of the South\u2019s more innovative engines of social mobility.By focusing on retaining low-income students, rather than just enrolling them, the college raised its graduation rate to 54 percent in 2017 from 32 percent in 2003. And for the last five years, it has awarded more bachelor\u2019s degrees to African-Americans like Ms. Jones than any other nonprofit college or university in the country.Obie Clayton, a sociologist at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college with a history that dates to the 1860s, said his administration has been borrowing elements of Georgia State\u2019s undergraduate advising program, which monitors the daily progress of more than 40,000 undergraduates, uses data analysis to predict potential academic problems, and encourages advisers to swoop into students\u2019 lives at the first sign of trouble.The innovations have attracted visitors from hundreds of colleges eager to replicate the school\u2019s successes. They have come from the Netherlands, from South Africa, and from across town. \u201cI think everyone in higher education is paying attention\u201d to Georgia State, Dr. Clayton said. \u201cEspecially at Clark Atlanta.\u201dMs. Jones and her sister drove through the working-class subdivision, past rows of clean carbon-copy townhouses whose gabled roofs seemed like arrows pointing incessantly upward. Fay Jones, their mother, rode with them. She had worked her whole life as a cook, and raised her children in a single-parent household, just as her own mother had done in Montgomery, Ala.Her daughter had decorated her mortarboard with a blank notebook and the words, \u201cI am the author of my own life.\u201d\u201cA lot of times we feel like we\u2019re a product of our environment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I just feel like we have to use the tools we have around us to create our own environment.\u201dShe decided years ago that life was not to be wasted. She learned she had stomach cancer at age 10, and did not beat the disease until age 13. Some of the friends she made in the hospital died.Her grades in high school were good and she considered applying to Clark Atlanta, where the civil rights leaders Ralph David Abernathy Sr. and Hosea Williams had studied, but she was scared off by the private-school tuition. So she enrolled at Georgia State.Analyzing her background, administrators there identified her as \u201cacademically at risk\u201d and required her to enroll in a seven-week summer session, where she was introduced to the college\u2019s tutoring, advising and financial literacy programs.The summer session is one of several experiments that have stuck at Georgia State, part of a broader vision generally credited to the university president, Mark P. Becker, a statistician who began his academic career at a community college, and Timothy M. Renick, a religious studies professor whose job title is now senior vice president for student success.When Mr. Becker took office in 2009, the college seemed adrift. \u201cThere was a period when Georgia State lacked an identity,\u201d Mr. Renick said.He said Georgia State found its \u201cmoral compass\u201d in the fact that Atlanta\u2019s working class had been hammered by recession, producing rising numbers of applicants who met the federal definition of low-income students.\u201cWe really became comfortable with saying we\u2019re not about being the next University of Georgia or Chapel Hill,\u201d Mr. Renick said. \u201cRather than trying to find a way to get students other than the ones that enroll at Georgia State and then find a way to serve them, why don\u2019t we just find new ways to support the students who we do enroll, and who come to us in great numbers?\u201dTo prevent dropouts, Georgia State has developed a series of linked programs meant to provide the kind of safety net for poor students that wealthier students usually get from their families. For example, in 2011 the administration began disbursing microgrants of a few hundred dollars at a time to help students deal with unpaid tuition and fee balances, citing a California State University finding that only 30 percent of students who stop attending for a semester ever graduate.Shantil Jones met her adviser, Christopher Almond, at the summer program, and he monitored, counseled and prodded her for the rest of her college career. Advisers like Mr. Almond start each morning checking to see if any of their undergraduates have tripped one of the 800 alerts that could signal potential academic trouble, based on reams of previous student data. It could be something as small as a single poor quiz grade.Ms. Jones welcomed the help. Few in her family had ever been to college. She was working up to 20 hours a week at part-time jobs, and her bus ride to campus took an hour.When she faltered in prerequisites for an accounting degree, Mr. Almond helped her find a new major, criminal justice. When her grade-point average dipped and she lost her state-funded Hope Scholarship, he helped her figure out ways to try to get it back again (she never did). The school also gave her several microgrants over the years.Her phone is still full of her adviser\u2019s emails: \u201cI checked your grades as soon as I got to work,\u201d Mr. Almond wrote in May 2015. \u201cCongratulations on an outstanding job. I am very proud of you.\u201dMr. Almond, 53, is a soft-spoken man who graduated in 1990 from Morehouse College. His mother was a postal worker, and his father was not in the picture when he was a child. His own journey from matriculation to graduation was a complicated one that took eight years.\u201cThis is personal for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those rare things in life where you get to work for an organization whose mission and vision is so much aligned with your own personal mission.\u201dGeorgia State\u2019s graduation ceremony took place in the Atlanta Braves\u2019 former stadium, bought by the college in 2016 and converted into a football field festooned in royal blue, the school color.Ms. Jones took her place with others from her graduating class \u2014 strangers, mostly, from an array of backgrounds, some with stories that could be the plots of novels. Dulce Arizmendi, 22, earned a business degree even though her mother, the only parent who raised her, was deported to Mexico in her junior year (\u201cGracias mami,\u201d her cap declared). Abraham Chung, 28, lived in Georgia until he was 5, then moved to South Korea after his father was the victim of an Atlanta jewelry-store robbery.

{"Headline": "Canada Blocks Chinese Takeover on Security Concerns", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Canada has blocked a $1 billion takeover of a construction company by a state-controlled Chinese company over national security concerns, a rare move by a government that until now has largely welcomed such deals despite growing skepticism over Chinese money elsewhere.The government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said late on Wednesday that it stopped the deal for the Aecon Group, a construction company that helped to build the landmark CN Tower in Toronto, following a review that began earlier this year.The deal became politically charged after members of Canada\u2019s opposition party raised concerns about Aecon\u2019s access to government contracts \u2014 particularly in the nuclear power industry \u2014 and the Chinese company\u2019s ties to the Chinese state.\u201cAs is always the case, we listened to the advice of our national security agencies throughout the multistep national security review process under the Investment Canada Act,\u201d Navdeep Bains, the Canadian minister of innovation, said in a statement.A spokeswoman for Aecon said the company was \u201caware of the government\u2019s decision and will be issuing a response in due course.\u201dChinese companies are increasingly facing hurdles as they go overseas to spread their wealth and acquire technology. Governments from Germany to the United States and Canada are pushing back, often citing national security concerns.These companies have faced the greatest test in the United States, where a series of deals have been blocked by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a federal body that reviews proposals by foreign-owned entities to buy American companies.The overseas unit of the China Communications Construction Company, a publicly listed company in which the Chinese government is a majority owner, made a bid for Aecon in October in a deal that Aecon said would help it to expand overseas.On Wednesday, the government said it blocked the deal that based on its findings \u201cin order to protect national security,\u201d without elaborating.\u201cOur government is open to international investment that creates jobs and increases prosperity, but not at the expense of national security,\u201d Mr. Bains said.The Canadian government did not give details about its decision, but one of the biggest hurdles facing the deal, according to analysts, was Aecon\u2019s contract for Canada\u2019s Candu nuclear reactors, which generate electric power.Earlier this year, Canada\u2019s Conservative Party called for a review of the deal and raised concerns about Aecon\u2019s contracts with both the military and the nuclear industry. Members of Parliament also cited bribery allegations against one of CCCC\u2019s units in Bangladesh. In January, the finance minister of Bangladesh said it was blacklisting China Harbour Engineering Company, a subsidiary of CCCC, after allegations arose that it tried to bribe an official.CCCC is controlled by the Chinese state, but it is publicly listed and has shareholders that include the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, BlackRock and Vanguard, Mr. Beck and Mr. Lu wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Trade, the U.S. and China Consider the Unthinkable: Breaking Up", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The economic relationship between China and the United States has defined the modern era. It helped lift hundreds of millions of people in China out of poverty. It gave affordable iPhones and other gadgets to American consumers, handed big profits to American companies and delivered 1.3 billion hungry customers to American farmers.Now some people in both countries want to tear it apart.As a top Chinese economic policymaker meets with the Trump administration this week in hopes of heading off a potential trade war, some officials in both countries are planning for a time when the world\u2019s two biggest economies do not need each other quite so much any more. They are seeking nothing less than a fundamental rethinking of a trade relationship that encompasses more than $700 billion in goods and services that flow between the countries every year.Full disengagement is impossible, leaders on both sides acknowledge. But the plans being developed in Beijing and Washington anticipate a time when the economic engines of China and the United States are not so closely linked, particularly in high-tech industries.\u201cIn the next step of tackling technology, we must cast aside illusions and rely on ourselves,\u201d President Xi Jinping of China said last month after visiting a new computer microchip factory in the country\u2019s center.Beijing has Made in China 2025, a plan that calls for the country to become largely self-sufficient and globally competitive in 10 advanced manufacturing sectors now dominated by the West. These include commercial aircraft, robotics, 5G mobile phone communications and computer microchips.China currently depends on the United States and its allies for those elements of a high-tech future. Washington showed that last month with its move to deny American-made components to ZTE, bringing the Chinese company\u2019s factories to a halt.But Washington is also worried about China\u2019s efforts to build homegrown champions. The Trump administration blocked the chip maker Broadcom\u2019s proposed acquisition of Qualcomm, a rival, this year, over concerns that the deal would give China\u2019s Huawei an advantage in 5G technology.The United States has outlined its own strategy of sorts to wean itself from China. Should the Trump administration enact its threatened tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese-made goods, the thinking goes, American corporations would begin to reduce their reliance on Chinese-made small components, machinery and other dull-but-essential parts in the global supply chain.President Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs are partly targeted at industries where customers would have an easier time switching to a supplier based in either the United States or a friendly ally like Germany, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico or India. In most of the initial product categories the administration has identified for tariffs, less than half of the goods imported by American companies come from China.Levi\u2019s has a plan for protecting itself should tensions escalate further. If the Trump administration imposes a levy on clothes made in China, the company could sell American consumers jeans made in Vietnam, Cambodia or one of the three dozen or so other countries where it has suppliers.\u201cIt\u2019s a shell game,\u201d said Chip Bergh, the chief executive of Levi\u2019s. He added, \u201cWe\u2019ll probably still be making a lot of product in China but it just won\u2019t be coming to the U.S.\u201d He noted that jeans made in China could be sold to consumers in Mexico instead.The tariffs are also geared toward the products that will shape the future. China exports almost nothing now in some categories that the Trump administration carefully included in its list for planned tariffs, like electric cars and satellites. But China\u2019s leaders hope that with government nurturing, such industries will soon become big exporters.American laws and World Trade Organization rules allow countries to impose tariffs on subsidized goods from overseas that harm domestic industries. But the Trump administration is trying to pre-empt Chinese exports of subsidized high-tech goods to the United States by imposing tariffs in advance.United States trade officials are counting on tariffs to have long-lasting effects. Decades-old levies on imported pickup trucks, for example, help explain why essentially all pickups sold in the United States \u2014 even those made by Japanese companies like Toyota \u2014 are made in America.American trade policy \u201cwill respond to hostile economic competitors, will recognize the importance of technology, and will seek opportunities to work with other countries that share our goals,\u201d Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, recently told the Senate Finance Committee.ZTE\u2019s punishment, in particular, exposed big gaps in China\u2019s economic prowess.\u201cIt seems likely that the current trade dispute, and the ZTE sanctions in particular, will spur the Chinese government to double down on its economic autarky model, where they seek self-sufficiency in a wider array of technology-based products,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington policy research group backed partly by Western technology companies.The Chinese and American plans both face long odds.At first glance, China\u2019s might seem to have a better chance of success. The country\u2019s state-controlled banking system can steer huge loans at very low interest rates to any industry the central government chooses. Local governments have also been urged to promote targeted industries, which they can do through subsidies like providing downtown land at virtually no cost. Semiconductor factories are now rising in major cities all over China, posing a formidable challenge to the industry\u2019s global players.But China has a long way to go. It trails the United States significantly in crucial areas like microchips, software design and high-end precision manufacturing. As one example, semiconductors designed in the United States make up half the chips China buys every year. American companies can already design and will soon be manufacturing semiconductors with circuits just one-fifth of the size of Chinese circuits.But the United States faces its own challenges. Washington could find it extremely difficult to lure back factories that moved to China over the years. Chinese workers may be more expensive to employ than they once were, but they are still paid a quarter or less than American workers. China has also become a vast new market in its own right \u2014 one that companies are loath to leave \u2014 and has invested huge sums in highways, bullet trains and other systems that make connecting buyers and sellers cheap and easy.And some industries simply may never come back. For example, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs will not touch the consumer electronics industry, in an acknowledgment that the business of making iPhones and Xboxes will stay in China for the foreseeable future.\u201cThey were very bullish on India,\u201d Mr. Fadnavis said, \u201cand now I\u2019m getting more and more inquiries from the U.S.\u201dBut politics, not economics, have played a major role in those decisions, and progress has been slow. Despite a plan to build factories employing 50,000 people in the western Indian state of Maharashtra by 2020, Foxconn now has 16,500 workers in all of India. In China, it has one million.\u201cWe are continuing to invest in expanding our presence and capabilities in locations throughout China,\u201d Foxconn said in a statement.Jie Zhao, a public policy specialist at Fudan University, predicted that increased economic self-reliance in the United States and China would not come quickly, but that it may lie ahead anyway.\u201cNeither China nor the U.S. can eliminate the economic interdependence of each other at this moment in time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut reducing their dependence could be an option for getting ahead in the technological competition and world-power reorganization.\u201dNatalie Kitroeff contributed reporting from New YorkAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "National Democrats Wade, Uninvited, Into New York House Race", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYRACUSE, N.Y. \u2014 As a first-time Democratic congressional candidate, Juanita Perez Williams would seem to check off many of her party\u2019s most prized boxes: female, person of color, military veteran and, as the runner-up in last year\u2019s mayoral race in Syracuse, local name recognition.Those attributes have not been lost on national party leaders, who were looking for a formidable candidate to challenge the Republican incumbent, John Katko, in the 24th Congressional District in Central New York, a key battleground race.Her candidacy, however, has not come without controversy: Well before Ms. Perez Williams officially kicked off her campaign last month, another Democrat, Dana Balter, was already the established choice of four Democratic county committees.The June 26 primary between Ms. Balter and Ms. Perez Williams illustrates the national Democrats\u2019 sense of urgency in devoting attention and resources to races they deem winnable. But in the case of the 24th District, the party\u2019s priorities do not always jibe with the interests of those closer to the scene.Indeed, the leaders of the local Democratic committees issued a joint statement that accused the D.C.C.C. of failing to take \u201cinto account the work happening at the grass roots this year,\u201d adding that they stood behind Ms. Balter and against the Washington \u201cmeddling that has hampered far too many races thus far.\u201dThat sentiment, as well as Ms. Balter\u2019s popularity, were on full display at a recent town-hall meeting that she held two weeks ago in the faded city of Auburn.\u201cI\u2019m disgusted,\u201d Laurel Ullyette, an attendee, said of the D.C.C.C.\u2019s involvement in the race. She said that she had \u201cnever been so impressed so quickly by someone\u201d as Ms. Balter, describing her as \u201cknowledgeable, committed, passionate and articulate.\u201dMs. Balter deftly handled questions on topics ranging from gun control to the North American Free Trade Agreement to blue-green algae; at evening\u2019s end, she received a standing ovation from the scores of voters who turned out.The county committees believed that Ms. Balter\u2019s energy \u2014 and her army of 800 volunteers \u2014 were just the thing to unseat Mr. Katko, a two-term Republican, in a swing district that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and where registered Democrats edge Republicans.But now, rather than rally around Ms. Balter and fulminate over Representative Katko\u2019s record, local Democrats find themselves instead doing battle with their national party.By any measure, Ms. Perez Williams, a Navy veteran and a lawyer, does have far more government and political experience than Ms. Balter, a Syracuse University professor and an activist. Last year, Ms. Perez Williams won a three-way Democratic primary in this city\u2019s mayoral race, eventually losing by a yawning margin in the general election to an independent, Ben Walsh.She served as Syracuse\u2019s corporation counsel, and also served stints in the state\u2019s education and labor departments, as well as in the attorney general\u2019s office.\u201cAs a veteran and prosecutor, Latina and mom \u2014 with deep roots in the Syracuse region \u2014 Juanita has spent her life fighting for working people,\u201d the D.C.C.C.\u2019s chair, Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, said in a statement. \u201cJuanita will run a competitive campaign based on creating jobs, investing in infrastructure and providing access to affordable health care.\u201dFor now, Ms. Balter seems to be taking the high road. \u201cI think it was not a great move,\u201d she said, referring to the D.C.C.C., \u201cbut we will make the most of the opportunities it presents.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Perez Williams, the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants, asserts her right to run in the primary. Yet she acknowledges critics of her candidacy. \u201cI understand their concerns,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cBut it\u2019s about the voters and who has the most experience \u2014 who has been battle-tested. Dana herself has said that primaries are healthy.\u201dSome political observers say that the national Democratic campaign committee\u2019s involvement was unfortunate given its timing.\u201cI understand why the D.C.C.C. did what they did,\u201d said Luke Perry, director of the Utica College Center of Public Affairs and Election Research. \u201cBut if you are going to intervene in a primary, do so early \u2014 particularly before the county committees act. Sweeping in at the last minute is a slap in the face to the local Democratic volunteers.\u201dWhoever emerges victorious in the Democratic primary, Mr. Katko, 55, will be a difficult foe. He has positioned himself as a moderate in the House, where he voted down legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. And in an era of political standoffs, he is a relentless booster of bipartisanship.\u201cI\u2019ve had 26 bills pass the House and on every single bill, the first person is a Democrat,\u201d he said, referring to legislation he has co-sponsored relating to antiterrorism and the opioid crisis, among other things. \u201cI don\u2019t introduce a bill unless I have a Democratic co-sponsor. I think I\u2019m showing how bipartisanship works.\u201dStill, he appeared reluctant to criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s tumultuous tenure in the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s got a long way to go,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to judge a president.\u201dIn a contest that often turns on money, Mr. Katko has a war chest that dwarfs those of his Democratic challengers. Ms. Balter has raised only $193,000, compared to his $1.4 million. Ms. Perez Williams\u2019s candidacy is too nascent for her fund-raising to be reflected on the Federal Election Commission website.\u201cSomeone like John Katko, who is a moderate Republican, can have crossover appeal, particularly with independents,\u201d Mr. Perry observed.Whether the Democrats can upend the electoral math that overwhelmingly favors incumbents remains to be seen. Ms. Balter, for one, seemed to put a positive spin on her relatively small bank account, calling money the root of all that is wrong with Washington.\u201cUntil we get big money out of politics, we\u2019re not going to be able to make progress on all the other issues,\u201d she said, citing campaign finance reform as her top legislative goal. \u201cWe need to make sure that politicians are voting in the interests of their constituents, not their donors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Firm Tied to Russian Oligarch Made Payments to Michael Cohen", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA shell company that Michael D. Cohen used to pay hush money to a pornographic film actress received payments totaling more than $1 million from an American company linked to a Russian oligarch and several corporations with business before the Trump administration, according to documents and interviews.Financial records reviewed by The New York Times show that Mr. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and longtime fixer, used the shell company, Essential Consultants L.L.C., for an array of business activities that went far beyond what was publicly known. Transactions adding up to at least $4.4 million flowed through Essential Consultants starting shortly before Mr. Trump was elected president and continuing to this January, the records show.Among the previously unreported transactions were payments last year of about $500,000 from Columbus Nova, an investment firm in New York whose biggest client is a company controlled by Viktor Vekselberg, the Russian oligarch. A lawyer for Columbus Nova, in a statement on Tuesday, described the money as a consulting fee that had nothing to do with Mr. Vekselberg.Other transactions described in the financial records include hundreds of thousands of dollars Mr. Cohen received from Fortune 500 companies with business before the Trump administration, as well as smaller amounts he paid for luxury expenses like a Mercedes-Benz and private club dues.References to the transactions first appeared in a document posted to Twitter on Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, the adult film star who was paid $130,000 by Essential Consultants to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. The lawyer\u2019s seven-page document, titled \u201cPreliminary Report of Findings,\u201d does not explain the source of his information but describes in detail dates, dollar amounts and parties involved in various dealings by Mr. Cohen and his company. Most of the transactions involved two banks: First Republic Bank and City National Bank.The Times\u2019s review of financial records confirmed much of what was in Mr. Avenatti\u2019s report. In addition, a review of documents and interviews shed additional light on Mr. Cohen\u2019s dealings with the company connected to Mr. Vekselberg, who was stopped and questioned at an airport earlier this year by investigators for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel examining Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Taken together, The Times\u2019s findings and Mr. Avenatti\u2019s report offer the most detailed picture yet on Mr. Cohen\u2019s business dealings and financial entanglements in the run-up to the election and its aftermath. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating Mr. Cohen for possible bank fraud and election-law violations, among other matters, according to people briefed on the investigation. Stephen Ryan, a lawyer representing Mr. Cohen, declined to comment.Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, is suing Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump to break her nondisclosure agreement related to the $130,000.It is unclear whether that or any of the other transactions were improper, but Mr. Avenatti has asserted that Mr. Cohen\u2019s use of Essential Consultants potentially violated banking laws. The financial records indicate that at least some of the money that passed through Essential Consultants was from sources and in amounts that were inconsistent with the company\u2019s stated purpose.Among the other payments to Mr. Cohen\u2019s company described in the financial records were four for $99,980 each between October and January by Novartis Investments S.A.R.L., a subsidiary of Novartis, the multinational pharmaceutical giant based in Switzerland. Novartis \u2014 whose chief executive was among 15 business leaders invited to dinner with Mr. Trump at the World Economic Forum in January \u2014 spent more than $10 million on lobbying in Washington last year and frequently seeks approvals from federal drug regulators. Novartis said in a statement that its agreement with Essential Consultants had expired.In addition, Korea Aerospace Industries paid Mr. Cohen\u2019s company $150,000 last November, according to the records. The company, an aircraft manufacturer, has teamed with the American defense contractor Lockheed Martin in competing for a multibillion-dollar contract to provide trainer jets for the United States Air Force that is expected to be awarded this year. A representative for Korea Aerospace declined to comment.Mr. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s lawyer and longtime fixer, met with a Russian oligarch at Trump Tower to discuss Russia and was later paid by a company connected to him.AT&T made four payments totaling $200,000 between October 2017 and January 2018, according to the documents. AT&T, whose proposed merger with Time Warner is pending before the Justice Department, issued a statement on Tuesday evening confirming that it made payments to Mr. Cohen\u2019s firm.\u201cEssential Consulting was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThey did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.\u201dThe consulting deal was worth $1 million and was supposed to last for a year, according to documents reviewed by The Times. But Columbus Nova decided to end the agreement midway through after it yielded a few investment ideas but no actual deals.A person close to Mr. Intrater said that the executive had no idea Essential Consultants was used for the separate payment to Ms. Clifford, and that he hired a number of other consultants at the time for similar prices.\u201cColumbus Nova is an investment management company solely owned and controlled by Americans,\u201d said Richard Owens, a lawyer for Mr. Intrater and Columbus Nova, adding that Mr. Vekselberg has never owned the firm. \u201cAfter the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.\u201cReports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved in or provided any funding for Columbus Nova\u2019s engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue,\u201d Mr. Owens said. \u201cNeither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else outside of Columbus Nova was involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Vekselberg did not respond to a request for comment.In addition to questioning Mr. Vekselberg, Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have also interviewed Mr. Intrater, though there is no indication that either man is suspected of wrongdoing, The Times reported last week.The person close to Mr. Intrater said that he was encouraged to attend the inauguration by an American friend, unrelated to Mr. Cohen, and that he had wanted to use the trip as an opportunity to meet with business associates in Washington.Renova has had a financial relationship with VTB, one of the largest state-owned banks in Russia, according to documents that were part of the \u201cPanama Papers\u201d leak of files from an offshore law firm. The documents show that Mr. Vekselberg\u2019s companies received at least $350 million in loans or investments from VTB and a subsidiary, VTB Capital. The current state of the debt is unclear, though one document suggests it was discharged in 2010.Mr. Cohen created Essential Consultants in Delaware less than two weeks before he completed his deal with Ms. Clifford, who is now contesting her contract with Mr. Cohen as invalid. Mr. Cohen initially said he paid her out of his own pocket by way of a home equity line of credit.But last week, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York said that Mr. Trump had reimbursed Mr. Cohen through several $35,000 monthly transactions that amounted to more than $400,000 \u2014 covering the payment to Ms. Clifford and, he said, other \u201cincidental expenses.\u201dReporting was contributed by Matt Apuzzo, Emily Flitter, Adam Goldman, Sharon LaFraniere, William K.

{"Headline": "Patagonia v. Trump", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "The outdoor retailer has supported grass-roots environmental activists for decades. Now it is suing the president in a bid to protect Bears Ears National Monument.Supported byVENTURA, Calif. \u2014 The offices of Patagonia occupy a low-slung complex of stucco buildings in this sleepy beachside town in Southern California. There are solar panels and picnic tables in the parking lot, day care with a jungle gym by the main lobby and easy access to the beach, where employees surf during lunch break. It is a corporate Eden of sorts, where idealistic Californians run a privately held company that sells about $1 billion of puffy down jackets and organic cotton jeans each year.But on an unseasonably hot and windy Monday morning in early December, Patagonia headquarters were transformed into something that quickly resembled a war room. There were emergency conference calls with Washington lawyers. Court filings were prepared. Web designers remade the company\u2019s home page.It wasn\u2019t a business crisis that had mobilized the company, however. It was politics.Mr. Trump said the decision was about reducing federal overreach. \u201cSome people think that the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd guess what. They\u2019re wrong.\u201dYet to the tribal groups and conservationists who had been monitoring the situation, including Patagonia, the decision realized some of their worst fears: that the Trump administration would be waging an assault on public lands, and potentially opening up protected areas to drilling and mining.Patagonia was as ready for this moment as any company could be. For more than 45 years, the company has mixed business and politics to a degree unusual in corporate America. While companies are expected to weigh in on everything from gun control to transgender rights these days \u2014 and many do so uncomfortably \u2014 Patagonia has been unapologetically political since the 1970s.It bills itself \u201cthe Activist Company\u201d and publicly advocates for environmental protection, fair trade and stricter labor standards. It supports thousands of grass-roots environmental activists, and has been involved with Bears Ears since 2012. But until December, Patagonia had never tangled with a president.That Monday morning, about 50 Patagonia employees gathered in a conference room to watch Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. The mood was somber. Then, within an hour of the president\u2019s remarks, Patagonia updated the home page of its website. Instead of promotional images advertising colorful products, there was a stark message against a black background: \u201cThe President Stole Your Land.\u201dAt the same time, Patagonia\u2019s legal team set into motion a plan that had been in the works for months: It would sue the president.Working with a handful of local groups and the law firm Hogan Lovells, Patagonia filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Washington. The lawsuit named as defendants Mr. Trump, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, the secretary of agriculture, the director of the Bureau of Land Management and the chief of the Forest Service. And the argument was simple: The Antiquities Act of 1906 gave presidents the power to create national monuments. But it did not grant the power to reduce them.\u201cFor as much authority as it gave to the president to create these monuments, Congress gave the president no authority to revoke or modify those monuments,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cCongress is the sole authority that can undertake such changes.\u201dThe barbs only stiffened Patagonia\u2019s resolve. The company\u2019s founder went on CNN and called the Trump administration \u201cevil.\u201d And Rose Marcario, Patagonia\u2019s chief executive officer, made the protection of Bears Ears one of her top priorities.\u201cWe\u2019ve always given to grass-roots organizations; it\u2019s part of our D.N.A.,\u201d she said in a recent interview at company headquarters, an American flag flying outside her window. \u201cBut the fight got a lot more urgent after the election. This was totally unheard-of.\u201dIt would have been enough for one day if Patagonia had just been caught up in a public spat with the president. But hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, a more urgent crisis emerged: A brush fire was reported in Santa Paula, Calif., a small community not far from Patagonia\u2019s headquarters.The hot, dry Santa Ana winds blowing that day whipped the fire into an inferno, and much of Ventura was soon evacuated. At the very moment Patagonia was preparing to sue the president, its campus was shut down indefinitely and employees fled their homes.\u201cWe did a lot of scenario planning for the lawsuit,\u201d said Corley Kenna, Patagonia\u2019s head of communications. \u201cWe didn\u2019t put on the list that life-threatening fires would be happening at the same time.\u201dPatagonia was founded by Yvon Chouinard, an enigmatic mountain climber with an interest in Zen Buddhism and a passion for the environment. In 1957, he taught himself to blacksmith, and began making and selling climbing gear that was less damaging to the rocks he and his buddies were scaling in Yosemite National Park.Within a few years, he had set up shop in Ventura and was doing a brisk business selling clothing for outdoor enthusiasts. He eventually called the company Patagonia, a homage to the vast mountainous region at the southern tip of South America, where he had recently traveled.Patagonia developed a cult following and expanded its offerings. But for the most part, the company was a means to an end, a source of funds that enabled Mr. Chouinard and his friends to surf, climb and travel their way around the world.That changed in 1972, when Mr. Chouinard attended a City Council meeting to hear about development plans along the Ventura River. Under a proposal being considered, the flow of the river would have been changed, and a prized surf break could have been ruined.At the meeting, it looked as if the development would proceed. Then a young environmental activist, Mark Capelli, took the floor. He presented a slide show and argued that the proposed changes would harm the birds, water snakes and muskrats in the estuary. The development was halted, the river was protected, and the surf break was preserved.Mr. Chouinard befriended Mr. Capelli and began to support his work, giving free office space to his nascent organization, Friends of the Ventura River, and helping to fend off several more attempts to develop the river.That set the template. Patagonia would offer small grants to local activists, give in-kind support through marketing know-how and business savvy, and amplify their message with customers. Mr. Chouniard also resolved to give one percent of Patagonia\u2019s sales to support environmental activism.\u201cPatagonia has established a unique role in the political and policy ecosystem, and are willing to be very public about their advocacy,\u201d said Neil Kornze, who was a director of the Bureau of Land Management under President Barack Obama and now runs an environmental consulting firm. \u201cThey are a group of avid environmentalists who just happen to sell coats.\u201dBusiness is booming under Ms. Marcario. A former private equity executive who walked away from finance to study Buddhist meditation in India for two years, Ms. Marcario joined Patagonia in 2008 as chief financial officer, drawn to the company\u2019s environmental activism.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m not on Wall Street right now making a ton of money,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of worried about the planet.\u201dShe was named chief executive in 2014, and has overseen Patagonia\u2019s continued expansion. Revenues and profits have quadrupled over the past 10 years, according to the company.And the company maintains a team of 18 people focused on supporting activism and distributing grants. Since 1985, Patagonia has given away some $90 million to environmental causes.\u201cScience without activism is dead science,\u201d Mr. Chouinard said in a recent interview. \u201cWe want to fund the little activist organizations that are out there on the front lines, the grandmothers in front of the bulldozers.\u201dIn 2012, one of the little activist organizations that Patagonia supported for the first time was Friends of Cedar Mesa, a small nonprofit organization advocating for the protection of a wide swath of sensitive desert in southern Utah, including the area that would become Bears Ears.At the time, Republicans in Utah, notably Representative Rob Bishop, were intensifying efforts to reduce federal protections of some lands in the state. Doing so could open the door for more oil and gas drilling and uranium mining, bringing in additional state tax revenue.\u201cPatagonia has been interested in this area for a long time,\u201d Mr. Ewing said. \u201cMore than any company I\u2019ve ever seen, they put their money where their mouth is.\u201dAs Patagonia learned more about Bears Ears, which was a favorite of rock climbers, it came to appreciate the area\u2019s significance. Sacred land to tribal groups and home to Hopi and Navajo ruins and petroglyphs carved into rock walls, it was a largely unspoiled terrain that could be threatened by expanded drilling and mining.\u201cAs we got more involved, we recognized the cultural and spiritual importance of the place,\u201d said Lisa Pike Sheehy, Patagonia\u2019s vice president of environmental activism. \u201cThis was a place that should have been protected 50 years ago.\u201dIn total, Patagonia has spent some $2 million on efforts to protect Bears Ears, including making grants to nonprofit groups, producing films and other marketing materials, and buying television ads. And at least for a brief moment, they worked.\u201cWe never got the chance to celebrate the monument being created,\u201d Mr. Ewing said. \u201cThe writing was on the wall. There wasn\u2019t ever a moment when we thought the monument was safe.\u201dInside Patagonia, Ms. Marcario and her staff knew their resolve would soon be tested. On the morning after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Ms. Marcario sent out an all-staff email. \u201cDefending our air, soil and water has never been more important,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn the last few years, our voice and reach has grown louder and stronger \u2026 we won\u2019t stop.\u201dDuring a monthslong public comment period, the Interior Department received more than two million submissions, the majority of them supporting the continued protection of public lands. Patagonia said its customers had submitted more than 150,000 comments.During the first months of the new administration, Ms. Marcario and another Patagonia employee, Hans Cole, made numerous attempts to meet with Mr. Zinke as part of outdoor industry delegations, according to internal Interior Department emails reviewed by The Times. No meeting with Mr. Zinke ever took place, but Mr. Cole joined two meetings with Interior Department staff.Around this time, Patagonia also began planning for its eventual lawsuit. It enlisted Hogan Lovells, which tracked developments on the issue and organized a weekly conference call for the eventual plaintiffs.The retailers added an economic argument to the campaign to protect Bears Ears: Outdoor recreation contributes more than $12 billion annually to the Utah economy, spending that could be jeopardized if public lands are developed.That evening, Ms. Marcario was driving north along the California coast, returning home from a business trip. As she approached Patagonia\u2019s headquarters, she could see flames encircling Ventura.\u201cI saw the whole ridge line on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized we wouldn\u2019t be able to go back to the office.\u201dPatagonia enacted its emergency plan overnight. Employees were instructed to stay away from campus, and the company offered to pay for accommodations for anyone who had to evacuate.A skeleton crew stayed behind at Patagonia, putting out spot fires as they flared up on campus. The fire spread, surrounding Ventura and consuming hospitals and apartment buildings on the outskirts of town.\u201cThere was ash falling like rain,\u201d Ms. Marcario said. \u201cIt was something I have never seen before.\u201dMr. Zinke hit back. \u201cYou mean Patagonia made in China?\u201d he said on a press call, accusing the company of playing politics in a gambit to sell more clothes. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful and appalling that they would blatantly lie in order to gain money in their coffers.\u201dThen on Fox Business Network, Mr. Zinke took issue with Patagonia\u2019s activism. \u201cThey should focus on how to bring manufacturing back to this country, rather than lying to the public about losing federal land,\u201d he said.As Patagonia and Trump supporters traded barbs, the blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, became the largest wildfire in modern California history. Burning for more than a month, it destroyed more than 1,000 structures and forced the evacuation of some 100,000 people. Downtown Ventura and the Patagonia campus were spared, but five employees lost their homes.With the fire still burning out of control on Dec. 6, Ms. Marcario was working from her home in Montecito, 30 minutes north of headquarters. Friends and employees who had fled were staying with her, though Ms. Marcario would later be forced to evacuate, too.\u201cThen in the middle of what felt like the apocalypse, across my inbox comes an email,\u201d she said. \u201cPatagonia versus Donald Trump, et al.\u201dMs. Marcario placed a call to her executive team and informed it that she had approved the lawsuit. Patagonia was suing the president.Since that week in December, the feud between Patagonia and the Trump administration has continued to simmer.\u201cThe decision was nothing more than a political favor,\u201d Ms. Sheehy, the company\u2019s vice president of environmental activism, wrote in a blog post. \u201cThe redrawing of boundaries was deliberate, and directly influenced by an industry that spends millions of dollars lobbying the government to get what it wants.\u201dThe Trump administration has not formally responded to the lawsuit filed by Patagonia and the other plaintiffs. Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said in an email that claims that the redrawing of boundaries was motivated by oil and gas interests were \u201cpatently and demonstrably false.\u201dMs. Marcario draws a link between the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels and the Thomas Fire, which some climate scientists believe was made worse by climate change.\u201cThese are climate disasters, and they\u2019re going to get worse and worse,\u201d Ms. Marcario said. \u201cWe have an administration that isn\u2019t paying any attention to that.\u201dPatagonia\u2019s lawsuit against Mr. Trump is currently tied up in the courts. It has been consolidated with two other cases filed by separate groups, and the government has asked a judge in Washington to transfer the case to Utah. There is no deadline for that decision, and until then, all proceedings in the case are stayed. Hogan Lovells, which has 25 lawyers working the case on a pro bono basis, has billed $1.7 million in hours to date.In the meantime, the area originally protected by Bears Ears National Monument is available for commercial use, including drilling and mining, though there hasn\u2019t yet been any new development.At Patagonia, Ms. Sheehy said that while the company would see its suit against the president through to the end, it had an expansive time horizon when it came to environmental protection.\u201cThese are all long fights,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in this for 50 years, 100 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Both Sides Say Yes, but for Different Reasons", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoNever mind that he was thinking of something different than his adversaries when they use the same phrase. Mr. Trump was referring to what he deems a deep-state conspiracy to get him. His detractors are referring to the various scandals swirling around Mr. Trump.Depending on what is eventually proven, the core scandal could rival Watergate, in which a \u201cthird-rate burglary\u201d of Democratic National Committee headquarters ultimately revealed a wide-ranging campaign of political sabotage and spying to influence the 1972 presidential election and undercut perceived rivals. In the current case, a hostile foreign power sought to sway the 2016 election and there is evidence that at least some people in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle were willing to collaborate with it to do so.The president has advanced the premise in sometimes sensational and uncorroborated ways, as when he accused Mr. Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower, an assertion dismissed by Mr. Trump\u2019s own Justice Department. But questions persist about the F.B.I.\u2019s use of a dossier financed by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democrats to obtain a secret warrant against an adviser to Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump\u2019s theory of the case has been bolstered by some investigators who have gotten in trouble. Two former members of the team working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, wrote text messages that expressed political views critical of Mr. Trump. Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director, was fired for not being forthcoming with an inspector general looking into his conduct.Among the most prolific purveyors of bigger-than-Watergate comparisons has been Mr. Trump.The Trump team members said the meeting did not yield the dirt on Mrs. Clinton that they had hoped for, but they were willing to meet with visitors advertised as working on behalf of the Russian government to get it. They have argued that there was nothing wrong with this because any campaign would be eager to obtain damaging information about an opponent.In marking the anniversary of Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment, Mr. Trump was returning to his argument that the inquiry had now gone on too long, a complaint made by other presidents under scrutiny. But it can be much worse. The Watergate investigation took more than two years from the burglary to Mr. Nixon\u2019s resignation. Whitewater lasted six years and Iran-contra seven.An exception was Kenneth W. Starr\u2019s investigation into Mr. Clinton\u2019s false statements under oath about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, an inquiry that took just eight months. But speed was not much comfort to Mr. Clinton since it ended with an impeachment referral to Congress.Advertisement"}

The governor strongly endorsed proposals to expand and strengthen training for school officials, create threat assessment and mental intervention programs, and evaluate entrances and exits to make schools more secure. Discussion of guns and gun laws was reserved for the session on Wednesday.Mr. Abbott announced the discussions immediately after the shooting at Santa Fe High School, south of Houston, touched off another wave of grief and fear \u2014 just six months after another mass shooting at a Baptist church in the Texas town of Sutherland Springs left 26 people dead and 20 others injured.The governor\u2019s critics have derided the meetings as inadequate given the enormity of the problem, but the quick response represented the conservative Texas leadership\u2019s most extensive undertaking yet to confront the pattern of mass shootings that has plagued states across the country \u2014 few more painfully than Texas.\u201cEvery single time there is a shooting, everyone wants to talk about what the problem is. By now, we know what the problem is: The problem is that innocent people are being shot,\u201d Mr. Abbott said before the meeting, which proceeded behind closed doors.Two more sessions are planned through Thursday, with more than 60 participants. Tuesday\u2019s session, which also featured experts in school safety and threat assessment, focused on how to make schools safer.Wednesday\u2019s meeting will feature the Texas State Rifle Association, a nearly century-old organization that is the state affiliate of the National Rifle Association, and a representative from Texas Gun Sense, a gun legislation reform group. It is rare, in Texas, for gun-rights groups and gun-control organizations to sit at the same table together and have a conversation about guns. Usually, the only time their members get close to one another is when they are testifying for or against gun-related legislation at the Capitol.Alice Tripp, legislative director for the Texas State Rifle Association, said she planned to do \u201ca lot of listening\u201d at Wednesday\u2019s session.\u201cI\u2019m listening for what\u2019s missing,\u201d she said, defending Texas\u2019 pro-gun environment. \u201cNo matter what it is, it\u2019s got to work.

And they have criticized the fact that this week\u2019s round tables are being held behind closed doors.\u201cEven Donald Trump kept a town hall at the White House open to press following the Parkland shootings,\u201d Manny Garcia, deputy executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, said in a statement, referring to the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead.The mayor and the police chief in Houston, the state\u2019s largest city, have been outspoken in recent days, criticizing the failure of elected officials to act swiftly. The mayor and the chief have not been invited to any of Mr. Abbott\u2019s round tables.The Houston police chief, Art Acevedo, who is also the first vice-president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, posted a comment on Facebook that was praised by gun control advocates, writing that the proper response to the latest mass shooting was not prayers, study and inaction, but \u201cprayers, action and the asking of God\u2019s forgiveness for our inaction.\u201dThe Houston mayor, Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, called on state lawmakers to enact gun-control laws and finance the installation of metal detectors in public schools.Dave Montgomery reported from Austin, and Manny Fernandez reported from Santa Fe, Tex.Advertisement"}

The country was brimming with oil and gas, and yet battles over proposed pipelines had limited the ability of producers to get those resources to market.The Trans Mountain expansion will nearly triple the capacity of the existing pipeline that runs from the province of Alberta to the west coast of British Columbia. In early April, Kinder Morgan Canada suspended most work on the project, despite having spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it and receiving approvals from Canadian regulators. It cited grass-roots resistance and opposition from British Columbia\u2019s provincial government as the primary reasons.I was the United States consul general in Calgary in 2013 when Kinder Morgan first announced this project. At the time, the high price of oil was spurring big investments in Alberta\u2019s oil sands, also known as the tar sands, the extensive deposits of crude oil in the province\u2019s northeast. The Trans Mountain expansion would largely follow the route of the existing pipeline, theoretically minimizing environmental and community concerns. Kinder Morgan also had a reputation as a company willing to go the extra mile in its outreach to communities. Many assumed it would move along without much trouble.When I lived in Calgary, the words \u201csocial license\u201d dominated conversations about fossil fuels development. In other words, what combination of deeds and words from the oil and gas industries would persuade society to allow them to expand as much as they wanted? Now one of the questions being debated is whether oil and gas should be allowed to expand at all.Traditional considerations like jobs and royalties now compete with the fear of oil spills, pollution and of course, climate change. There is no more telling example of the impact of these environmental concerns than Kinder Morgan selling its prized Trans Mountain pipeline.Companies that focus exclusively on high carbon energy production increasingly will find themselves on the wrong side of a shifting society. Their social license is being withdrawn. This will not happen overnight, but there is no doubt it is happening.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disarray Plagues U.S. Companies\u2019 Efforts to Win Tariff Exemptions", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For several weeks this spring, a handful of employees at a Texas steel manufacturer stopped producing pipes used to drill thousands of feet below the earth\u2019s surface to concentrate full time on another task: trying to win the company an exemption from President Trump\u2019s metals tariffs.Borusan Mannesmann Pipe U.S. filed 19 separate requests with the Commerce Department asking it to exempt the multiple shapes, sizes and forms of steel pipes that it imports from its parent company in Turkey and then finishes at a plant in Baytown, Tex. Until it gets an answer, the 60-year-old business is paying significantly higher prices for imports of the raw material and is putting off any major projects.In the two months since the Trump administration\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs went into effect, the Commerce Department has been deluged with more than 8,200 exemption requests from companies that import foreign metals. With just a handful of countries temporarily exempted from Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, companies are scrambling to win exemptions for every screw and spring they import, with each width and length requiring stand-alone filings. One company alone has submitted 1,167 of the filings, according to government officials.The imposition of tariffs was supposed to help protect American companies from foreign competition. But they have also created a chaotic, time-consuming process and provoked deep uncertainty among executives, who are delaying investment, expansion and hiring as a result.The disarray stems from the sheer vastness of the administration\u2019s attempt to reshape the rules of global trade in a matter of months, as it threatens a trade war with China and races to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement.This week, the administration will hold three days of public hearings on its plan to impose tariffs on roughly $50 billion in Chinese goods and may also welcome top Chinese leaders to continue trade talks. And it faces a looming deadline to wrap up the Nafta talks in time for the deal to be approved by the current Republican-controlled Congress.Those affected by the steel and aluminum tariffs say the administration\u2019s aggressive approach could backfire on American companies and workers.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict what could happen to us and these families if the exemption process doesn\u2019t go in our favor,\u201d said Joel Johnson, the chief executive of Borusan Mannesmann\u2019s United States operations, which employ 264 people. \u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but for sure we won\u2019t be hiring more people. We might have to reduce our existing base because we won\u2019t have that material coming in.\u201dThe Commerce Department has yet to grant any company an official exemption. A department official said that the agency was making \u201can unprecedented effort to process the requests expeditiously\u201d and that companies with a valid need for foreign products should rest assured that their needs will be met.To deal with the flood of applications, the department has added about a dozen workers dedicated to processing the applications, bringing the total number to 19. So far, the department says it has reviewed most of the filings, but only 1,700 had been posted online as of May 8 \u2014 and that is just an early step in a lengthy process. Domestic steel and aluminum companies have 30 days to file an objection to any application. Government officials then have 60 days to make a final decision.\u201cWe knew that the process was going to be messy,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIt just prolongs this pain of not knowing what is going to happen.\u201dMr. Johnson said the potential for permanent tariffs on the raw materials his company imports from Turkey had \u201cput our customers into full panic mode. They need our product to extract oil and gas.\u201dWithout a supply of unfinished steel from its parent company, the United States plant, which uses a special heating process to ensure that the finished pipe is strong and resilient, may not make sense to continue operating. American competitors may be reluctant to supply the company with unfinished products that will ultimately end up competing with their finished pipes. Mr. Johnson says its American operations may face a $25 million to $30 million hit annually to bring in the materials it needs.Its vendors are already worried. Automation Engineering Company, a South Carolina company that provides equipment to Borusan to move pipes within its factory, sent a letter to the Commerce Department on Tuesday saying that Borusan\u2019s business helped support 75 jobs in its own factory.Borusan Mannesmann has filed for a two-year exemption for products from its parent company in Turkey, arguing that imports are what allows its American factory to thrive. If it wins an exemption, Mr. Johnson said, the firm will invest $50 million to $75 million to build another factory in Baytown, which would employ upward of 170 people.The tariffs\u2019 most ardent proponents, including some domestic steel and aluminum makers, have argued against granting many exemptions, saying they will create loopholes that ultimately make the measures less effective at defending American industry. The administration, in imposing the tariffs, said national security was at risk from foreign metals that were weakening American manufacturers.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has said the department will grant exclusions that \u201cfurther hone these tariffs\u201d to protect national security while also minimizing the impact on American industries.Companies have been appealing to the Commerce Department with a variety of arguments, including that they depend on some foreign goods but ultimately strengthen the American economy.Union Pacific, the railroad giant, filed an exemption for a specialized longer steel rail from Japan that it says is not available in the United States. While the company buys some American-made rail, the longer Japanese rail is safer because it requires less welding and reduces the potential for derailments on its highly trafficked routes, the company says.Even if the Commerce Department is sympathetic to those arguments, other American companies have a chance to scuttle any exemption. Under the process, domestic manufacturers can make filings saying they can or would be able to make an imported product, potentially giving them an influential voice over competitors seeking exemptions.In April, Orrin G. Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Ron Wyden, the Democratic ranking member, sent a letter to Mr. Ross urging him to improve the process, saying it has lacked \u201cbasic due process and procedural fairness for stakeholders, especially American small businesses.\u201d They also expressed concern about whether the Commerce Department was taking steps to prevent the program \u201cfrom being abused for anticompetitive purposes.\u201dBecause steel and aluminum are used in so many products, the effects will be felt not just among direct importers, but their customers as well, said Teresa Fort, an economist at Dartmouth College\u2019s Tuck School of Business. \u201cIt will go down through the chain,\u201d she said.The Federal Reserve\u2019s April \u201cBeige Book\u201d included a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis about a manufacturer of tractor-trailers that said it could not increase prices fast enough to keep up with its rising material costs. And the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reported that a local toy manufacturer said that tariffs had raised threefold the price of a type of thin-gauge foil produced only in China. \u201cThese tariffs are now killing high-paying American manufacturing jobs and businesses,\u201d the company said.Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Schneiderman\u2019s Replacement Matters", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are a variety of ways that Mr. Trump might seek to frustrate the federal investigations: He could have the special counsel, Robert Mueller, fired. Or he could fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation as well as the one into Mr. Trump\u2019s attorney, Michael Cohen. If Mr. Rosenstein were removed and replaced with a Trump crony, that individual could choke off both. Or the president could issue broad pardons for himself and his associates.New York has other laws that might apply as well, such as those barring conduct involving \u201cintent to defraud more than one person\u201d or \u201cto obtain property from more than one person by false or fraudulent pretenses.\u201d And Mr. Cohen\u2019s payments to other women, and his other business practices, are also reportedly under scrutiny, with new revelations coming by the day. They could substantiate additional New York state offenses.If it were as simple as that, any qualified replacement for Mr. Schneiderman would do. But there are complexities that will require the new attorney general to have constitutional and criminal law expertise.The Legislature must also select someone who has the gravitas to work with federal prosecutors. To continue with the example of Mr. Cohen, the new attorney general should be someone who can make the case to the Department of Justice to focus its case against Mr. Cohen on just a few of the potential claims, such as Stormy Daniels-related campaign finance violations. That would leave other, separate offenses under New York law, such as bank fraud, for state prosecutors to pursue \u2014 another important exception to double jeopardy limits.There is reason to believe the new attorney general will find a receptive audience. The guilty plea by Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, covered such narrow terrain, omitting many other allegations against him, such as charges related to work he allegedly did for the Turkish government. That may have been to leave room for the states to prosecute his alleged uncharged offenses should Mr. Trump pardon him.Of course, the legal hurdles would be lower still if the Legislature amended the New York double jeopardy statute to expressly exclude jeopardy in cases in which presidential pardons are issued. In that case, a pardon would be the functional equivalent of an appellate reversal of a case: It would allow the investigation and prosecution to start again from scratch in New York. Working with the Legislature on this will be another important task for the new attorney general, and it argues again for someone with profound analytical depth.Other attorneys general across the country will also have important roles to play if Mr. Trump executes a pardon strategy, or succeeds in eviscerating the federal investigations through firings or otherwise. But because Mr. Trump and his circle have so many interests in New York, the state has emerged as a key player. For the moment, the office is in good hands under the acting head, Solicitor General Barbara Underwood. But with legislators preparing to install an interim replacement, they must select somebody with the reputation and the collegiality to help lead the multistate effort.It will be tempting for the Legislature to move fast and appoint a placeholder, and let voters work things out at the polls in November. But a great deal could happen between today and the swearing-in of a newly elected attorney general in 2019. The crisis could strike at any moment, and if it does the people of this state \u2014 and the nation \u2014 will be looking to the New York attorney general for leadership. The Legislature must choose someone who is ready for that weighty role, right now.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the acting head of the New York attorney general\u2019s office. She is Barbara Underwood; not Lockwood.Norman L. Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, where Noah Bookbinder, a former federal corruption prosecutor, is the executive director.

{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s Strong Quarter Is Shadowed by Comcast\u2019s Maneuvers for Fox", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Walt Disney Company reported its strongest quarterly results in two years on Tuesday, streaking past Wall Street expectations for profit and revenue growth thanks in large part to the success of \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d But that strong performance was shadowed by maneuvering by Comcast to upend Disney\u2019s pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets.Comcast declined to comment.He never mentioned Comcast during the call, and pre-empted any analyst queries about 21st Century Fox. \u201cWe are still deep in the regulatory process so I can\u2019t share any more information or engage in further speculation about the deal, except to say that we strongly believe in the value of those assets,\u201d he said.Many analysts have recoiled at such a bid, which could leave Comcast with more than $170 billion in debt \u2014 a sum that would make it one of the largest corporate debtholders in American history. \u201cWe do not believe Comcast needs another media asset,\u201d Gregory Williams, a Cowen and Company analyst, wrote in a research note.At the very least, the possibility of a Comcast bid seemed to hang over Disney shares, which edged slightly down despite the strong quarterly report. \u201cThe stock is going to be pretty sideways until this gets resolved,\u201d said Robin Diedrich, an analyst at Edward Jones.For the quarter, Disney reported net income of $2.94 billion, or $1.95 per share, an increase from $2.39 billion or $1.50 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected per-share profit of $1.69. Disney\u2019s revenue totaled $14.55 billion, a 9 percent increase; analysts expected $14.08 billion.But the quarter also served as a reminder of how volatile the movie business can be \u2014 even for Disney, which has dominated Hollywood in recent years. Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d released by Disney on March 9, was a financial debacle, costing at least $200 million to make and market and taking in just $127 million worldwide. After theater owners get their cut, Disney will be left with roughly $60 million.But Disney\u2019s theme park division had another sizzling quarter. Operating income jumped 27 percent, to $954 million. Walt Disney World in Florida benefited from higher ticket prices and hotel room rates; a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday helped increase attendance by 5 percent. Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland also had improved results.Disney\u2019s biggest unit, Media Networks, which includes ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel, reported revenue of $6.14 billion, a 3 percent increase. But operating profit declined 6 percent, to $2.08 billion, because of higher costs \u2014 notably spending on unprofitable streaming services like ESPN+ and Hulu \u2014 and subscriber declines at ESPN. Ongoing struggles at Freeform, a channel aimed at young adults, also dented the results.ESPN+ was introduced in the quarter and represents one of the ways that Mr. Iger is trying to lessen the Magic Kingdom\u2019s reliance on the atrophying cable television business. The app-based service costs $5 a month and includes thousands of sporting events not shown on television, along with exclusive programming like the \u201c30 for 30\u201d sports documentaries and a basketball analysis show hosted by the former Lakers star Kobe Bryant.Mr. Iger said he was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by the early response to ESPN+ but declined to provide subscriber numbers. \u201cMost importantly, the technology is working,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to improve it.\u201dEarlier on Tuesday, Disney added live mixed martial arts matches to the ESPN+ portfolio under a deal with U.F.C. Kevin Mayer, chairman of Disney\u2019s international and direct-to-consumer division, cited U.F.C.\u2019s \u201centhusiastic, growing fan base\u201d in announcing the multiyear deal, which analysts estimated would cost Disney roughly $150 million a year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Usually Reliable and Cooperative, Centrist House Republicans Rebel", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Centrist House Republicans have always been like the dependable partner in a turbulent relationship \u2014 slightly dull, predictable, the one who remembers family birthdays and pays the bills. It was members of the hard-right caucus who provided the exciting but volatile side, always threatening to break things off unless they got their way.Now the centrists, with their political careers squarely on the line in the midterm elections this fall, are finally putting their foot down. In a marked departure from their usually cooperative nature, a bloc of mainstream House Republicans is challenging both the hard right and their leadership by demanding an immigration vote that they say is long overdue and essential to their electoral well-being.\u201cWe are generally people who like to work collaboratively, who are patient and willing to listen,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, an at-risk centrist Republican from South Florida. \u201cBut I think most of us aren\u2019t willing to accept an institution where member suppression is a goal of the leadership. We have grown impatient.\u201dFrustrated by years of Republican House leaders refusing to consider legislation on immigration because of fierce resistance from the far right, Mr. Curbelo initiated a seldom-used procedural maneuver known as a discharge petition to try to force the House to vote on a series of immigration proposals. The goal is to resolve uncertainty surrounding undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.It was a confrontational move because it represents an attempt to strip control of the House floor from his own party\u2019s leadership. The tactic, which requires the signed consent of a majority of the House, rarely works except as a political stunt because party leaders can dissuade potentially mutinous members with threats to punish those who sign on. But there have been notable exceptions, including the 2001 enactment of the sweeping campaign finance bill that followed a successful discharge petition to overcome a leadership blockade.The internal momentum for an immigration vote has alarmed the hard-right, often uncompromising members of the House Freedom Caucus. They correctly fear that a combination of Democrats and Republicans could propel a measure protecting the undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers to passage if it reaches the floor.Unhappy with the way things were shaping up, Freedom Caucus members expressed their displeasure last week by helping defeat an unrelated but politically consequential farm bill in a major embarrassment for Speaker Paul D. Ryan. That outcome also raised new questions about Mr. Ryan\u2019s ability to hold on to power given his lame-duck status.\u201cWe clearly have members at opposite ends of our spectrum who are frustrated with one another,\u201d Mr. Ryan acknowledged on Tuesday.But the centrists are not backing down. With nearly two dozen Republicans and most Democrats signing on, backers remain just short of the goal of 218 signatures to force action. But they say they have more than enough commitments to put the petition over the top if the leadership does not acquiesce and assure a vote on immigration policy.\u201cModerates are united on this,\u201d said Representative Leonard Lance, an endangered New Jersey Republican who said this was the first time as a member of the majority party that he had signed a discharge petition. \u201cThis issue should be addressed.\u201dParty leaders say that approving legislation protecting undocumented immigrants participating in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program would be a political mistake and sap conservative enthusiasm heading into a difficult November midterm election environment.But the Republicans most at risk this year aren\u2019t conservatives in deep-red districts. It is the more centrist Republicans in swing districts who face significant challenges. They need independent and moderate Republican voters to survive. An immigration vote could be a big boost, particularly in regions with large Hispanic populations such as California, Florida, Texas, New York and New Jersey, the very places where Democrats are confident they can make major inroads into the Republican majority.Republicans say they need something to counter Democratic energy.\u201cVoters need to see action, and Republicans need to prove we are capable of leading on tough issues,\u201d said Sarah Chamberlain, the president of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a group of centrists that styles itself as the \u201cgoverning wing\u201d of the party. \u201cWe need to work together as one team if we want to keep the majority in G.O.P. hands.\u201dHer group is backing about 75 House members and is now playing in primary elections around the country. In recent head-to-head contests, Republican candidates supported by the organization defeated four candidates backed by the Freedom Caucus \u2014 two each in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The group believes that it can hold contested swing seats by placing moderate Republicans on the ballot, arguing that conservatives would most likely fall to a Democrat in those communities.Mr. Curbelo admits it feels a little out of character for him to be fomenting an insurrection.\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of revolutions,\u201d said Mr. Curbelo, who is Cuban-American. \u201cMy family had to flee one. But we\u2019ve worked very hard to come here and represent our communities, and I\u2019m not here to pass the time.\u201dHe and others say the brewing fight extends beyond immigration to the central question of how House Republicans govern and whether the party will continue to allow its agenda to be dictated by one wing.\u201cThis is about whether members are going to sit back and allow a minority of the majority to suppress other members,\u201d he said. \u201cWe simply want the opportunity, not a guarantee. We just want the opportunity to advance our ideas and to convince our colleagues that our ideas should be supported.\u201dImmigration has divided Republicans for years, and a successful outcome now in the heat of a midterm seems unlikely even if the moderates get their vote.But given the makeup of the districts where the midterm elections will be decided, simply holding the vote could be a selling point for some centrists. And it will be the electoral success or failure of embattled centrists, not House conservatives, that will determine whether Republicans are able to hold the House in November.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Go All-Out to Avoid Disaster in California House Races", "Date": "2018-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIRVINE, Calif. \u2014 National Democrats, confronting mushrooming political chaos across Southern California, are pouring millions of dollars into congressional races to avert a self-inflicted disaster that could undermine their chances at taking control of the House.After months of optimism that the state\u2019s June 5 primary would position them to pick off seven Republican-held districts in November \u2014 a substantial down payment on reclaiming the House \u2014 Democrats are now trying to ensure that they do not hurt themselves because of their unusually crowded slates of candidates.With so many Democrats running, the party\u2019s fear is that the vote will be splintered, allowing Republicans \u2014 who have fewer candidates \u2014 to dominate some primaries. The party and allied groups are spending more than $4 million on just three campaigns, intervening in one contest to prop up a favored candidate; attacking a Republican from the right in another; and even reminding people not to waste their votes on \u201cghost candidates\u201d who have dropped out yet remain on the ballot.As any progressive activist will explain through gnashed teeth, the head-snapping scramble is because of the state\u2019s \u201ctop two\u201d open primary system, which allows the two leading vote-getters \u2014 regardless of political parties \u2014 to advance to the general election.The \u201ctop two\u201d system was meant to create incentives for political moderation in a state where about a quarter of the voters are independents, but it has created immense stakes for Democrats: They need to win 23 seats to take back the House, and party officials believe the path runs through the seven competitive California districts, all of which Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Gail Reisman, a retired gerontologist and Toronto native who lives in Representative Dana Rohrabacher\u2019s district, said after attending a candidate forum Tuesday. \u201cIf we have two Republicans running I think I\u2019m going back to Canada.\u201dAfter three of the Democrats opposing Mr. Rohrabacher had taken a turn speaking at the forum, held at a synagogue, the moderator briefly came back on stage to alert the audience that the parking lot was so crowded the police intended to ticket those cars parked more creatively than legally.The overflow of Priuses and Mercedes was a particularly vivid reminder of the California candidate logjam. Confusion and frustration among Democrats here only seems to grow by the day, as the state and national party back different contenders and spending sprays forth like an out-of-control garden hose. Some voters are not sure whom to back to feel confident that a Democrat will advance past June 5, and they increasingly worry that Republicans will foil the party\u2019s chances to stop President Trump\u2019s agenda in the House next year.The painful twist is that what seemed like the Democrats\u2019 most valuable asset in the midterm campaign \u2014 the wave of liberal activism unleashed by President Trump \u2014 has metastasized into a mortal threat because of the glut of candidates.Nowhere is the danger more acute than in a pair of contiguous districts that stretch from Orange County\u2019s Seal Beach down the Pacific coastline to the cliffs of La Jolla.It is here where national Democrats, deeply concerned their voters are scattered among little-known House candidates, are staging a rescue mission to ensure they are not locked out this fall in Mr. Rohrabacher\u2019s district and the one farther south held by Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican who is retiring.Opposition research and hard-edge direct mail pieces are flying between candidates, too, some of them tinged with accusations of #MeToo impropriety. But surveys show many of the candidates bunched together in the teens and few operatives have a firm grasp for what will unfold.Actual policy issues are largely secondary: The differences between the Democratic hopefuls are a matter of degree, with all of them vowing a progressive agenda on health care, the environment and gun control while taking aim at Mr. Trump. The Republicans are focused on gains in the economy, a gas tax repeal measure and warning the largely moderate and center-right voters in the districts that Democrats are turning sharply to the left.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party\u2019s arm in House races, is most concerned that two Republicans might prevail in the primary for Mr. Rohrabacher\u2019s seat. The committee has broken with the state Democratic Party to endorse a candidate, Harley Rouda.Meanwhile, the main House Democratic \u201csuper PAC\u201d is pouring over $600,000 into commercials in the Los Angeles market, which reaches 27 congressional districts, to try to drive down Republican candidate Scott Baugh\u2019s share of the vote against Mr. Rohrabacher, in hopes that a Democrat can finish in the top two and face the incumbent in November.And the national campaign committee is supplementing the air attacks with a ground game that includes alerting voters about five \u201cghost candidates\u201d who remain on the 16-person ballot.The national party\u2019s involvement has angered Hans Keirstead, a stem-cell scientist who has the support of the California Democratic Party and is now scorning the national campaign committee after a mutual flirtation for much of the last year.An official with the national campaign committee said they did urge Mr. Keirstead to offer evidence refuting the charges, but they did not demand the students appear on camera.Mr. Keirstead, citing favorable polling figures, said he was not dropping out. But the candidate logjam is exasperating area activists who have been organizing for a year and a half against Mr. Rohrabacher, a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump.\u201cI get anxious just thinking about it,\u201d said Tara Steele, a marketing executive active in the Newport Beach Democratic Women\u2019s Club. \u201cIf the disorganization of the Democratic Party is the reason he gets re-elected, it will be incredibly disheartening.\u201d\u201cIt feels like they got a million dollars\u2019 worth of concern and they\u2019re dropping it right on top of my head,\u201d he said.In Mr. Issa\u2019s district, the airwaves are so saturated that when officials for one statewide campaign inquired about buying more commercials this week in San Diego, they were told there was no advertising time left.But to the frustration of some of the Democratic candidates, the national campaign committee has not taken sides in Mr. Issa\u2019s district.\u201cI\u2019m pissed off that they gave Harley that and they aren\u2019t giving me that,\u201d said Doug Applegate, who is running again after nearly defeating Mr. Issa in 2016, referring to a spending push House Democrats are doing jointly with Mr. Rouda.Mr. Applegate, a retired Marine officer, notes that his former wife has denied he ever abused her and he has a ready response: \u201cBelieve the woman.\u201dHe ventured on more dangerous ground, though, when he was asked in an interview about one of his top Democratic rivals, 29-year-old Sara Jacobs.\u201cI think she\u2019s extremely bright, she\u2019s going to be real capable,\u201d he said, before invoking his time in the Marines. \u201cI like 20-year-olds. I put my life in the hands of 20-year-olds. But they were more experienced, knew their area of position better and were probably more competent with their weapon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s much easier for people to believe that it\u2019s some man, my grandfather, behind the scenes pulling strings than me because of my gender,\u201d she said.Ms. Jacobs\u2019s California-based pollster, Amy Levin, urged Democrats to rally behind the only woman their party is fielding in Mr. Issa\u2019s district.\u201cOur polls and others show that Democrats need to man up and get behind the woman so we don\u2019t lose this seat in June,\u201d Ms. Levin said.\u201cWinning back the House without California is not impossible but will be very, very difficult,\u201d said Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat who represents the Palm Springs area.Many California Republicans also believe the open primary law, which was adopted in a 2010 referendum, has proved to be a political science experiment gone terribly awry.\u201cI hate the top-two,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader and California\u2019s most prominent Republican.In the tradition of many reforms enacted by voters in the state that helped pioneer direct democracy, the move to do away with partisan primaries has triggered a host of unforeseen consequences.\u201cIt has created mass confusion,\u201d said Dave Gilliard, a longtime Republican strategist here. \u201cAnd the people who have been empowered are not people from the districts. It has really just increased the power of outside forces.\u201dIt is, however, the people from the districts who are the most frustrated.When one of the lagging Democrats, Omar Siddiqui, took his turn on the microphone at the candidate forum, applause filled the synagogue when he was asked if he would consider dropping out.And when Mr. Siddiqui defended himself by citing an internal campaign poll, in which he said he would gain support once voters learned more about him, one woman in the audience warned against Democratic wishful thinking.\u201cIn one week?\u201d she yelled out.An earlier version of this article misstated a distinction of Sara Jacobs\u2019s candidacy. She is the only Democratic woman in her race, not the only woman.Advertisement"}

Surveillance cameras arrived first, pointed at the doors to rent-regulated apartments. Then came the construction workers, who gutted empty units and sent a dust cocktail of lead-based paint, brick and who knows what else throughout the building.Worried, a pregnant woman and her husband left, dooming their apartment to the demolition derby. Violations were issued; violations were dismissed. And on a Friday morning in early August 2016, Temma Tainow, who had lived in the West Village building for 34 years, was jarred awake by what sounded like an explosion. She stumbled into her kitchen and screamed. A leg dangled from a hole punched through her ceiling.\u201cI think it is imprinted on my brain forever: looking up and seeing five men staring down through the hole,\u201d recalled Ms. Tainow, 70, a tiny therapist with a halo of reddish-brown hair who speaks deliberately and walks with a slow limp. \u201cIt\u2019s been awful. It\u2019s been a nightmare. It\u2019s exactly what the owner wants.\u201dArticles in this series examine New York's broken system for protecting tenants and affordable apartments.Across much of New York City, construction scenes like these play out regularly at buildings with rent-regulated apartments \u2014 the city\u2019s largest stock of affordable housing, where rents are set at a prescribed level and are supposed to increase only a small amount each year.In neighborhoods already gentrified or in the throes of gentrifying, a relatively new class of mega-landlords has driven up rents by exploiting enforcement gaps in a web of city and state agencies. By churning through enough tenants and claiming enough renovations, landlords can raise the rent enough \u2014 beyond $2,733.75 a month \u2014 to wrest an apartment from regulation\u2019s grip and into the free market.New York\u2019s housing system can be complicated to navigate. Here\u2019s a quick primer on what your rights are and how to exercise them.New York\u2019s housing system can be complicated to navigate. Here\u2019s a quick primer on what your rights are and how to exercise them.New York is among the global boomtowns, like London, Los Angeles and San Francisco, where skyrocketing rents \u2014 and the struggle to shelter those who can\u2019t afford them \u2014 have struck a deep political chord. But New York grapples with its own peculiar contradictions.It has the nation\u2019s largest rent-regulation system. On paper at least, it still has some of the most robust tenant protections, bolstered by new city laws designed to fight tenant harassment and give poor tenants free legal representation in housing court.Yet without more fundamental change \u2014 especially in the basic laws governing rent increases \u2014 regulated apartments in New York are in danger of vanishing, one by one.In some ways, this is an age-old story: New York has been in some form of housing crisis for a century. Landlords and tenants have battled for at least that long. But over the last 25 years, the balance of power has been reordered by a confluence of factors: that progressive weakening of the rent laws, an immensely profitable free market driven by a surging local economy, and the evolution of the rental real estate business, with mom-and-pop operations increasingly subsumed by Landlord Inc.In the face of these changes, the regulators are simply overmatched.The regulatory apparatus is fractionalized, divided among three city and state agencies. It is also essentially passive, The Times found. So state regulators, relying on outdated technology, do not systematically check whether a landlord found to have overcharged one tenant regularly does the same to others. City regulators do not investigate whether an owner who has illegally gutted apartments in one building might be doing the same elsewhere. And if building inspectors fail twice to get inside to investigate complaints of illegal construction, they don\u2019t return a third time; the complaint is tossed out.The New York Times would like to hear from people who live in New York City about their experiences dealing with rent overcharge or illegal construction.New York Times reporters would like to hear from you. We may contact you to learn more about your story.Required fields are marked with an asterisk.First and last preferred, please.Street address, city and state (or borough), please.Thank you for your submission.The Times interviewed more than 200 tenants, housing activists and government employees; reviewed thousands of pages of court records and building permits; and examined several government databases. In place of regulatory muscle, The Times found, the system relies on trust: trust that landlords do the right thing, trust that architects and engineers submit accurate permit applications, trust that landlords report rental histories correctly, trust that eviction suits are legitimate.It also places the burden of investigation on tenants. They must ask for their apartments\u2019 rental histories and determine their accuracy, complain about building permits, and sue over harassment. Holding on to an affordable apartment can turn into a part-time job, not to mention a full-time obsession.Agencies rarely take action unless someone complains, and it can take time. In 2015, tenants who filed rent-overcharge complaints waited nearly two years on average for a resolution.11E11A11B11C11D11FEleventh Floor10A10B10C10F10D10ETenth9A9B9C9D9E9FNinth8A8C8F8B8D8EEighth7A7B7F7C7D7ESeventh6A6B6C6E6D6FSixth5A5B5E5F5C5DFifth4C4B4D4E4A4FFourthThird3C3E3F3A3B3D2B2C2D2E2A2FSecond1A1D1E1F1B1CFirst11E11A11B11C11D11FEleventh Floor10A10B10C10F10D10ETenth9A9B9C9D9E9FNinth8A8C8F8B8D8EEighth7A7B7F7C7D7ESeventh6A6B6C6E6D6FSixth5A5B5E5F5C5DFifth4C4B4D4E4A4FFourthThird3C3E3F3A3B3D2B2C2D2E2A2FSecond1A1D1E1F1B1CFirst11E11A11B11C11D11FEleventh Floor10A10B10C10F10D10ETenth9A9B9C9D9E9FNinth8A8C8F8B8D8EEighth7A7B7F7C7D7ESeventh6A6B6C6E6D6FSixth5A5B5E5F5C5DFifth4C4B4D4E4A4FFourthThird3C3E3F3A3B3D2B2C2D2E2A2FSecond1A1D1E1F1B1CFirstEleventhFloor11E11A11B11C11D11FTenth10A10B10C10F10D10ENinth9A9B9C9D9E9FEighth8A8F8B8C8D8ESeventh7A7B7F7C7D7ESixth6A6B6C6D6E6FFifth5A5B5C5E5F5DFourth4C4B4D4E4F4AThird3C3E3F3A3B3DSecond2A2B2C2D2E2FFirst1A1D1E1F1B1CThe New York Times used rent-registration records and interviews to trace the gradual loss of regulated apartments in the building between 1996 and 2018.

| Source: Note: Rents are approximate and rounded to the nearest dollar.To breach the $2,733.75 threshold, mega-landlords and aspiring ones tend to follow the same playbook: After buying a building, they try to get tenants in regulated apartments to leave, often offering buyouts or harassing them with poor services or eviction suits. Once an apartment is empty, they tack on allowed vacancy increases. They often also perform renovations, enabling them to raise the rent even further while annoying the remaining neighbors, sometimes to the point of prompting them to leave.Some landlords willfully flout the rules, The Times found. Applying for construction permits, they say buildings have no occupied apartments when they do. They inflate the cost of renovations or claim the work will be only minor when it is major. Or they falsely claim to have performed renovations, knowing that the state asks for proof only when a new tenant complains. If regulators catch on to one trick, landlords find another. It\u2019s like a giant game of Whac-a-Mole. Punishment, if there is any, is seen as the cost of doing business, often a minor fine in the course of a multimillion-dollar development deal.In 2007, a developer named Ben Shaoul and his partners, private equity firms, bought 17 East Village buildings for $97.5 million. They then included false statements on almost every building permit application, enabling them to skirt tenant-protection requirements.In an interview, Mr. Shaoul said his company renovated buildings left untouched for decades and deregulated them properly.\u201cThe idea was to increase rents,\u201d Mr. Shaoul said, adding that his company no longer purchased buildings with regulated apartments. \u201cThat was the business plan. That was the intent. It\u2019s America.\u201dIn late 1992, Steven Croman, only 26, bought his first tenement building, a five-story walk-up at 221 Mott Street.The block was a slice of old, but ever-evolving, New York. Though still considered part of Little Italy, the neighborhood was by then largely Chinese. Eighteen of its 36 buildings had rent-regulated apartments, 261 units in all.Beginning in the 1920s, New York experimented with regulation to battle a chronically low vacancy rate. Advocates argued that regulation maintained a stable housing stock and limited runaway rents. Landlords countered that regulation increased rents of unregulated apartments, restricted building upkeep and discouraged new construction.By the 1980s, the city had two types of regulated apartments: rent-controlled and rent-stabilized. Rent-controlled apartments, with strict rules and extremely low rents, were being phased out, so most regulated apartments were stabilized, with annual increases set by a board and a menu of tenant protections. Many were stabilized according to the traditional criteria: built before 1974, with six or more units. Others, stabilized through tax-benefit programs, often had much higher initial rents and could be deregulated after a certain time.But these were generally small landlords, limited in what they could legally accomplish.Mr. Croman had good timing. New York was emerging from the dark days of the 1970s and \u201980s, when boarded-up buildings pockmarked many neighborhoods. Rents climbed with demand.He bought more buildings. Almost organically, a similar class of landlords rose up, always looking for buildings with regulated apartments.Some were family businesses that preferred to hold on to their buildings, banking on a return over time.Others had a more corporate face, along with investors. Some got mortgages based not on a building\u2019s current rent roll but on its potential earnings. Some flipped buildings quickly, emptying and renovating as many regulated apartments as possible before selling to the next company, remaking neighborhoods from the inside out.One fairly recent example: In June 2013, BCB Property Management bought 1059 Union Street, in the fast-gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights, for $8.2 million. Twenty-eight of the 32 apartments were rent-stabilized, tax bills show.And while the raw number of regulated apartments has stayed roughly even, that figure hides a particular churn. Traditional regulated apartments pushed into the free market have been replaced by apartments added through tax-break programs, which are often much more expensive. In 2016, the median legal rent of newly registered stabilized apartments was $2,750 \u2014 roughly the median asking rent for all New York apartments on the rental website StreetEasy. In Brooklyn, the median rent of a newly stabilized apartment was almost $3,300.Frieda Taplitz bought 25 Grove Street for $52,500 in 1957. The building \u2014 red brick, tenement-style, built in 1886 \u2014 was a family investment: A Taplitz always lived there. Repairs and modest improvements, such as a new chimney and a new stairway enclosure, were done. Major renovations weren\u2019t. Rents remained low. Tenants like Temma Tainow stayed for decades, and for the most part, the tenants and the Taplitzes got along. Only three complaints were recorded, all in the mid-1990s.In the fall, construction crews arrived.For a landlord seeking to free apartments from regulation, that bureaucratic limbo makes it easier to do rent-enhancing renovations hidden from city inspectors\u2019 scrutiny.So landlords may lie on permit applications, saying that major construction is only cosmetic work, which demands far gentler oversight. They may begin work without obtaining permits at all. Whatever the violation, the median building fine between 2013 and 2017 was $800, pocket change for developers. The city\u2019s finance department does little to ensure that fines are collected. The buildings department does little to ensure that violations are fixed.Most permit applications for apartment renovations get only a cursory review. That is because architects and engineers are allowed to \u201cself-certify\u201d that they follow the rules, letting them quickly obtain permits for what they say is minor work. A self-certified permit is often approved within days. Applications that are actually reviewed \u2014 those for more extensive work \u2014 can take months.A buildings department spokesman, Joseph Soldevere, said self-certification helped make construction easier, faster and cheaper. Adding more red tape would simply drive illegal work further underground, he said, adding that the agency routinely audited self-certified applications, about one in every six last year.But a comparison of building permits, violations and apartment listings indicates how willfully some owners flout the rules.At 165 Avenue A, one of the East Village buildings purchased in part by Mr. Shaoul\u2019s company, two architects submitted eight self-certified permits for apartment renovations between 2007 and 2011. Both claimed the work would not change occupancy. One, Ken Hudes, whose firm, Atelier New York Architecture, has become a favorite of mega-landlords, said his work would involve only minor partition changes.But the work was considerable: Apartments were gutted and converted from one- and two-bedrooms to four-bedrooms.Mr. Hudes denied any wrongdoing. In an email, he said his team turned nonfunctioning apartments into beautiful homes, adding, \u201cTenants and landlords love our work.\u201dJust as permits are easily granted, complaints are often closed for the most basic reason: Inspectors are allowed to dismiss them if they fail twice to get inside. With regulated apartments, that has led to the dismissal of almost 3,000 complaints a year \u2014 even allegations of tenant harassment. Without other evidence, Mr. Soldevere said, the buildings department has little choice but to close complaints when inspectors are refused entry or when a building is locked.The fine was paid. But the apartments are still marketed as having four bedrooms. In November, Apartment 8 was advertised for $5,500 a month. A spokeswoman for Kushner Companies declined to comment.In short order, the architect, Mr. Hudes\u2019s partner, Jonathan Miller, submitted two self-certified permits, saying workers would do only minor work in four units. Within hours, each permit was rubber-stamped. City inspectors then responded to the initial complaint, dismissing it.Landlords are often tipped off to potential problems by complaints automatically logged on a public website. Only then do they file permit applications \u2014 akin to getting a driver\u2019s license after being accused of speeding.\u201cI\u2019m not even as angry at the landlord as I am at the city,\u201d said Collette Stallone, 63, a tenant. \u201cThey\u2019re allowing this.\u201dMr. Sanieoff declined to comment. His lawyer, Joseph Buckley, denied any wrongdoing.Tenants soon complained of excessive dust, of illegal construction, of sloppy work. A drill punctured Ms. Tainow\u2019s ceiling. A saw came through another tenant\u2019s floor.Photographs showed a thick layer of dust inside apartments. Ms. Tainow developed a raspy cough.\u201cI was wearing a mask all the time, even when I was sleeping,\u201d said Humberto Torres, 56, who has asthma and lives across the hall.Photographs later documented that the work was hardly minor: entire apartments taken down to the studs; one-bedroom units altered to have two.On Jan. 13, 2016, the owner and contractors were hit with four violations. Three of them \u2014 for working without permits and lying on one application \u2014 led to fines of $4,000. The fourth \u2014 for excessive dust in Mr. Torres\u2019s apartment \u2014 was deemed \u201cimmediately hazardous.\u201dViolation hearings are usually cozy affairs, with a city hearing officer, a buildings department lawyer and a representative of the building or construction firm. Tenants are not invited. Landlords routinely get the benefit of the doubt.At the dust-violation hearing, Abe Sicker, representing the construction company, argued that the violation\u2019s class should be reduced. \u201cIt is annoying, the dust,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut an immediately hazardous violation?\u201dThe hearing officer agreed \u2014 and then some. She dismissed the violation altogether.\u201cAll he was seeing was dollar signs,\u201d said Cynthia Wilkie, 62, who lived in one of the two occupied apartments at 632 Sterling Place.What happened next shows the flimsiness of the rules and paperwork designed to protect tenants in regulated apartments during construction.On the application, Mr. Sussman needed to check \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on two boxes: Was the building occupied? Did it have rent-regulated units? He checked \u201cno\u201d on both.Mr. Soldevere said examiners had determined that the protection planned for tenants was appropriate for the proposed construction.As with lying about the extent of construction, lying about occupancy or regulatory status is a crime and may mean that owners are compromising safety. If a building has tenants, a tenant protection plan is required to safeguard them.\u201cIt\u2019s not just a bureaucratic check-the-box, not-check-the-box thing,\u201d said Brandon Kielbasa, a tenant organizer with the Cooper Square Committee. \u201cThe consequences are that tenants are put in really dangerous situations or psychologically harassed out of their homes.\u201dYet as at 632 Sterling Place, many architects and engineers submitted tenant-protection plans with few protections, often simply cut and pasted from the building code. And falsified permits are not uncommon, a review of thousands of permits shows. Hundreds of owners lied about both occupancy and regulated apartments.Until recently, the review showed, the city largely ignored the boxes altogether. It didn\u2019t track whether an owner lied about occupancy or whether a building had regulated apartments, considering tax bills unreliable because they were self-reported. Only in December 2016 did the state agency that monitors regulated apartments agree to tell the buildings department whether a building had any.Architects and engineers are rarely held responsible for falsified permits. They are licensed by the state, which seldom punishes anyone. Those disciplined by the city often voluntarily surrender self-certification privileges to avoid more formal punishment. The reasons are never made public.In December, Mr. Soltanizadeh, who had faced up to four years in prison, pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct \u2014 the equivalent of a ticket. He is still licensed, although he gave up his self-certification privileges a year ago.His lawyer, Paul Greenfield, said Mr. Melamed, who spent 20 days in jail and paid $200,000 in restitution, was to blame for the falsehoods.At 632 Sterling Place, after agreeing to buy the building in late 2014, Mr. Sussman had pushed tenants to leave, eventually offering buyouts. Two tenants agreed to move, including a woman with dementia. The other woman said she never received any money.But moving made no sense to Ms. Wilkie, who had lived there for 22 years and paid about $850 a month for the three-bedroom apartment she shared with her brother, daughter and two grandchildren. Ms. Wilkie had diabetes and had undergone double-bypass heart surgery. Her daughter, Wendy, 33, was blind and in a wheelchair because of childhood brain cancer. Ms. Wilkie\u2019s brother had lost his right leg to diabetes.Her neighbor, Arnold Brathwaite, 68, a retired veteran, also wanted to stay.By early 2016, the building started coming down around them, despite the cookie-cutter protection plan. The heat was turned off. The second and third floors were gutted. A staircase was removed. A hole was cut into the roof. Debris was piled in corners, against walls. Dust was everywhere.On Aug. 10, 2016, inspectors issued 10 major building violations. Still, that meant only $23,250 in fines. Neither Mr. Sussman nor the architect was fined for lying.Mr. Sussman, the managing member of the limited liability company 632 Sterling L.L.C., did not respond to requests for comment.Because the building was so unsafe, the city moved the tenants to a Days Inn in Queens, filled mainly with other refugees from damaged apartments, their rent now paid by taxpayers. Ms. Wilkie, her daughter and granddaughter shared a cramped room with two queen-size beds. The hotel\u2019s single, shared microwave became their kitchen.With help from the Legal Aid Society, Ms. Wilkie and Mr. Brathwaite sued to fix the building on Sterling Place.That case will take years. Mr. Brathwaite eventually settled, accepting another apartment from Mr. Sussman. Ms. Wilkie decided to fight.Her family stayed at the Days Inn for more than a year, until the city tried to move her to a homeless shelter in November. To avoid that, she temporarily rented an apartment in Brownsville, a Brooklyn neighborhood still ungentrified, with a bathroom too small for Wendy\u2019s wheelchair. The monthly rent is $2,110, almost triple what she paid before.There is one more line of defense: the state\u2019s Division of Housing and Community Renewal, designated overseer of the rent laws, watchdog against rent fraud, guardian of the $2,733.75 threshold for traditional regulated apartments.Many housing advocates argue that rent fraud is rampant in New York. How widespread such overcharges are, though, is impossible to judge, because the state agency doesn\u2019t collect much of the necessary information. When it does, it is barred from making the data public.Yet it is clear that the agency is often helpless in the face of the myriad subterfuges that some landlords deploy to manipulate rent system guidelines.The agency, for example, requires landlords to report all regulated rents annually, along with vacancy increases and money spent on apartment improvements. But it does not require proof of that spending, unless a tenant files an overcharge complaint, which is rare. Nor does the agency check for a building permit when a landlord claims a rent increase for improvements. A missing permit could indicate that work was illegal, minor or never done.So just as they may lie about the extent \u2014 or even existence \u2014 of improvements to avoid oversight, landlords may claim whatever type and quantity of work is needed to free an apartment from regulation.If the state agency consistently comes up short, it is, perhaps unintentionally, frank about its limitations.On rental histories, the agency admits that it does not \u201cattest to the truthfulness of the owner\u2019s statements or the legality of the rents reported in this document.\u201d On some rental histories, it misspells its own name: \u201cCommuntiy,\u201d instead of \u201cCommunity.\u201dFor an agency created to protect tenants, it often ends up sheltering landlords. In the name of protecting tenants\u2019 privacy, the agency is barred from releasing rental histories, except to the tenant. It is even barred from reporting how many regulated apartments are in a building.In an attempt to quantify rent-rule violations, at least in microcosm, lawyers at the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation, an advocacy group, investigated the rental histories of the 92 apartments at 560 Audubon Avenue. The study, part of a pending 2016 lawsuit alleging rent overcharges, found unexplained rent jumps in 58 apartments and registered rents that didn\u2019t match leases in 33. Thirteen tenants signed riders certifying that their apartments had been \u201ccompletely renovated in a good workmanlike manner.\u201d No renovations had been completed.In court filings, the owner, Hayco Corporation, denied overcharging tenants.The state housing agency is hamstrung, too, by archaic technology. So if a tenant wins an overcharge case, the agency\u2019s 1980s computer system cannot automatically review the landlord\u2019s other apartments for possible violations. In fact, the agency does not look for overcharges, even in the same building.\u201cIt\u2019s like prescribing a Tylenol to a patient that has brain cancer,\u201d said Aaron Carr, founder of the Housing Rights Initiative, which investigates rent overcharges for possible class-action lawsuits.The agency has had to do more with less: In 2017, only 27 examiners looked at overcharge complaints. In 2007, there were 37.In 2012, Mr. Cuomo also set up a Tenant Protection Unit, which undertook the first-ever audits of owners who had reported significant increases for apartment improvements, recovering $4.5 million for tenants. The unit says it has returned 67,000 apartments to the regulated rolls.But tenant advocates called that figure illusory, saying owners were merely allowed to register their apartments as stabilized, but at their current higher rents, without penalties, \u201cratifying their earlier fraud,\u201d said Edward Josephson, litigation director for Legal Services NYC.The state refused to give any information about those apartments, which in any event would barely stem losses. The city now has 6,500 fewer stabilized apartments than in 2011, according to state numbers.The tenant protection unit has enemies. Real estate industry groups sued, challenging its existence. Though the suit was dismissed, they have appealed. State lawmakers, who still rely heavily on industry donations, have consistently denied the unit\u2019s budget request. The state housing agency funds it. Its commissioner, RuthAnne Visnauskas, said she hoped lawmakers would increase the unit\u2019s funding \u201cso that we can do even more.\u201dRecently the unit audited 560 Audubon, looking at three apartments and ordering rent reductions after no proof of improvements was provided. Investigators neither fined the landlord nor examined other apartments there.\u201cI was gobsmacked,\u201d said Matthew Chachere, a lawyer with Northern Manhattan.In 2016, the state started requiring landlords to give new rent-regulated tenants explanations of their rent, and to provide more proof of apartment improvements. But tenants rarely check explanations, and the government rarely investigates the authenticity of landlords\u2019 proof.Christopher Leahy, a landlord and contractor who has testified as an expert witness for tenants, believes some landlords claim improvements and then fabricate evidence if tenants file overcharge complaints.The landlords \u201ckeep doing it because they so often get away with it,\u201d he said. \u201cMost tenants don\u2019t complain.\u201dThe proof was riddled with problems. The check copies were so tiny as to be illegible. One company, Pinpoint Builders, claimed to have done $20,000 of the work. But the address on its letterhead \u2014 5041 16th Avenue in Brooklyn \u2014 did not exist. The new bathroom tiles it claimed to have installed were cracking.Another company, Yankels Demolition and Rubbish Removal, charged $4,000 for \u201crubbish removal\u201d but classified it as an apartment improvement, yielding a $100 monthly rent increase. The company also claimed to have redone the closets. The apartment has no closets.\u201cThat really upset me,\u201d Mr. Pavoni said.Watermark defends the rent increase. The company said Pinpoint was now based out of another office and blamed tenants for the cracked bathroom tiles. As for the closets, Watermark said they were included in the original work order, then omitted.In January, the state housing agency ruled in Watermark\u2019s favor, saying it had never received Mr. Pavoni\u2019s mailed response. He has appealed.The vanishing affordable apartment is having an extended political moment.But the buildings department will be the primary enforcer, and its commitment is unclear.Last week, after questioning by The Times, the department appeared to have changed its mind: Mr. Soldevere said funding had been requested for two new employees for the advocate\u2019s office. In addition, he said that because of the new laws, the agency planned to hire more than 70 new employees to focus on tenant protection and set up a quick-response unit for complaints of work without permits.\u201cWe won\u2019t tolerate landlords who use construction to harass tenants,\u201d he said, adding that since September, the department had issued 547 violations for lying about occupancy and regulation on permits.The Times identified 370 that had been resolved. Out of $1.8 million in fines, about $280,000 has been paid; the median fine was $2,400.With the new scrutiny, some large landlords have stopped lying on permit applications, a review of hundreds of applications shows. They have amended their playbook.But while they are now more likely to check the boxes saying that buildings are occupied with regulated apartments, their tenant protection plans are still pro forma and vague. In the first three months of 2018, Mr. Plotkin of Atelier filed at least 55 identical plans \u2014 475-word statements that used phrases from the building code and garbled statements like, \u201cNoise will kept to a minimum during working while ongoing construction is taking place.\u201dMr. Croman did not go to Rikers. Instead, he ended up at the Manhattan Detention Complex in Chinatown \u2014 more convenient for family and friends.He is to be released next month. His company still owns its buildings, though the state monitors them, as part of his settlement. And his buildings and contractors have continued to rack up violations; as of April, they owed almost $875,000, records show. Since his arrest, 123 of 139 permit applications identified by The Times were self-certified.A spokesman for his company, Sam Spokony, declined to answer questions but said the company was \u201cdiligently implementing\u201d the settlement, \u201cin line with our ongoing focus on using best practices to provide quality housing for our residents.\u201dAt 25 Grove Street, a few regulated tenants eventually sued, winning a temporary rent reduction. After the worker fell through Ms. Tainow\u2019s ceiling in August 2016, the hole was immediately patched. A few hours later, as Ms. Tainow sat at her computer, workers punched another hole, this time in her living room ceiling, sending another large chunk of drywall onto the floor. Ms. Tainow started screaming. Neighbors called an ambulance: Her blood pressure had shot up to a dangerous 190/130.Despite the two cave-ins, a building inspector wrote up only one Class 1 violation, the most serious kind, for a \u201clocalized collapse of ceiling\u201d in the living room and cracks in Mr. Torres\u2019s apartment across the hall.At the hearing, Mr. Sicker, again representing the construction company, argued that the violation class should be reduced. An engineer\u2019s report about the living room, he said, showed \u201cthere was nothing really there.\u201dNo photographs were provided. Vivian Currie, the buildings department\u2019s lawyer, described the two ceiling collapses as \u201ca small localized area,\u201d explaining that he had hesitated calling the building inspector to testify because it would have taken time. \u201cYeah, I mean, to avoid getting the inspector, you know, we will move to amend.\u201dMs. Tainow was not mentioned. Mr. Sicker won his reduction. The fine was halved, to $5,000.January 2017 brought another complaint about illegal construction. After learning about the complaint, Mr. Sanieoff, the landlord, texted the rental agent, Alice Bahar, blaming Ms. Tainow and describing her as \u201ca piece of garbage!\u201dThe complaint was closed because inspectors failed twice to get inside.For all its problems, 25 Grove is hardly a blip in the world of rent regulation. Tenants complained to their local officials, with little response. Their lawyer wrote to the attorney general\u2019s bureau investigating landlords, which sent back a form letter: \u201cBecause of the volume of complaints, the limits of our resources, and the constraints of our jurisdiction, the bureau cannot act on or otherwise investigate every complaint.\u201dEven after Mr. Sussman practically dismantled Ms. Wilkie\u2019s building, the attorney general\u2019s office declined the case. \u201cI\u2019m pretty upset that the office didn\u2019t think there was a basis for prosecuting him,\u201d said Stephen Myers, Ms. Wilkie\u2019s lawyer.Mr. Sanieoff has expanded. His companies bought two more properties, including 37 King Street, a half-mile from 25 Grove, purchased in November for $17.5 million. The advertisement for the building proclaimed, \u201cTremendous value can be captured through the destabilization and renovation of the residential units that remain untouched for years.\u201dJessica Silver-Greenberg, Grace Ashford, Sarah Cohen, Agustin Armendariz and John Krauss contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Sergei Skripal Was Retired, but Still in the Spy Game. Is That Why He Was Poisoned?", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRAGUE \u2014 The aging Russian spy had been a free man for only a few years when he turned up in Prague for a secret meeting with his former adversaries. He looked ill, but acted jovial, drinking with his Czech hosts and joking that his doctor had prescribed whiskey for high blood pressure.Then he got down to business, rattling off information about Russian spycraft and the activities of former colleagues that might give the Czechs an edge over their foes.But in the years before the poisoning, Mr. Skripal, a veteran of Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, the G.R.U., apparently traveled widely, offering briefings on Russia to foreign intelligence operatives, according to European officials, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. The meetings were almost certainly approved and possibly facilitated by the British authorities as a way to both educate their allies and provide Mr. Skripal with income.He met with Czech intelligence officials on several occasions and visited Estonia in 2016 to meet with local spies.Such visits were neither illegal nor unusual for defectors. But they meant that Mr. Skripal was meeting with intelligence officers working to thwart Russian operations in Europe, opening the possibility that his poisoning was a narrower act of retribution.There is no way to know for certain whether Mr. Skripal\u2019s travels made him a target, or even if the Russian government knew about them. The trips were kept secret, known only to a select few intelligence agents. Not a single official from the spy services in the Czech Republic or Estonia would discuss the details publicly.Asked whether Mr. Skripal had met in recent years with intelligence agents in Spain, where he had once worked as a double agent, a spokesman for the country\u2019s foreign intelligence service, CNI, said the question \u201cis a red line we cannot cross.\u201dMr. Skripal arrived in Prague in 2012 shortly after his wife, Lyudmila, succumbed to uterine cancer. He was grieving, but nevertheless in good spirits when he met with officers from at least one of the Czech Republic\u2019s three intelligence services, according to a Czech official with knowledge of the meetings. Some details of the visit were first reported over the weekend by the Czech weekly Respekt, and were confirmed independently by The New York Times.\u201cGreat Britain is known as a country with high quality information services,\u201d he said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. \u201cI would never expect that the British would send some kind of problematic man. There was a reason for it, probably.\u201dDuring the brief visit, Mr. Skripal drank, he joked, and he provided Czech intelligence with information about G.R.U. officers operating in Europe. His information was dated; he retired from the G.R.U. in 1999. Even so, the Czech officers found his knowledge to be valuable. Many of the G.R.U. agents he worked with in the 1990s were still active, the official said. Though Mr. Skripal\u2019s health was poor, the official said, his mind was clear.Mr. Skripal was so helpful that Czech intelligence officers continued to meet with him, the official said, making several trips to Britain in subsequent years, though the exact dates are unclear.Officials were more circumspect about Mr. Skripal\u2019s visit to Estonia, with one describing it as \u201cvery sensitive information.\u201d A senior European official with knowledge of the trip confirmed that the former Russian agent met secretly with a select group of intelligence officers in June 2016, though it is not clear what they discussed. The British intelligence services helped facilitate the meeting, the official said.A spokesman for the British Home Office also declined to comment.Russia\u2019s relations with Estonia and the Czech Republic, two former Communist Bloc countries, are freighted with the legacy of the Cold War. Estonia in particular moved aggressively to assert its independence after breaking with the Soviet Union in 1991, often provoking Russian ire. Ferreting out Russian spies is a source of national pride.\u201cEstonia has the best counterintelligence in Europe,\u201d said Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who was Estonia\u2019s president for a decade and left office in 2016. \u201cWe\u2019ve caught as many spies as Germany.\u201dNothing about Mr. Skripal\u2019s travels appears all that uncommon. John Sipher, who retired from the Central Intelligence Agency in 2014 and once ran covert operations against the Russians, said the United States routinely deployed Russian defectors to lecture the intelligence services of its allies, though their meetings with other agencies would be kept secret to avoid angering Moscow.\u201cThere is a bit of a game where, O.K., the guy spied for us, we got what we wanted, and now that we\u2019re out, we\u2019re not going to rub your nose in it,\u201d he said.Sharing knowledge and experience is often the only way a former spy can make a living, experts said. Mr. Ilves, the former Estonian president, called it the \u201cspook version of a lecture tour.\u201dFor former double agents, retirement can be dull and anticlimactic. The British government provides a stipend, but in the past defectors have protested that it is too small. In the late 1990s, a former spy named Victor Makarov filed a complaint against the British intelligence services over his miserable living conditions and eventually ended up camping outside Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s residence in protest.Others have resorted to creative and illegal means to augment their pensions. Oleg Gordievsky, a senior K.G.B. officer whose defection in 1985 was a serious blow to the Soviet government, hosted a game show for a time. Mikhail Butkov, another K.G.B. defector, was imprisoned for three years for creating a fake business school and defrauding would-be students out of 1.5 million pounds.\u201cIt\u2019s psychological \u2014 they\u2019ve been in the limelight, and they\u2019re not important anymore,\u201d said Stephen Dorril, the author of numerous books about Britain\u2019s intelligence services.Mr. Skripal appeared to be enjoying a comfortable, though modest, retirement. In Salisbury, the cozy cathedral town where he lived, the former Russian intelligence officer belonged to the Railway Social Club, drove a dark red BMW and owned a tidy red-brick home on Christie Miller Road.Still, it was clear that he remained under Russian scrutiny. In 2013, the G.R.U. hacked into his daughter\u2019s email accounts, according to the British government. And in 2014, his case was profiled in a Russian documentary series about the lives of Russian traitors called \u201cThe Price of Military Secrets\u201d that was financed by the Moscow government.The Kremlin would probably not consider sharing outdated information with foreign intelligence services to be much of a threat, said Mr. Sipher, the retired C.I.A. officer. But it would be a different matter if Mr. Skripal was being used for other purposes, like recruiting new Russian agents.\u201cIf he was pitching other Russians, that would put him higher on the list,\u201d Mr. Sipher said. \u201cOr if he got too close to something that was really sensitive to the Russians.\u201dMichael Schwirtz reported from Prague, and Ellen Barry from London and Salisbury, England.

{"Headline": "As Nicaragua Death Toll Grows, Support for Ortega Slips", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANAGUA, Nicaragua \u2014 It has been two weeks since lethal clashes between protesters and pro-government forces erupted in Nicaragua, and the number of deaths is still not clear. But this much is: It keeps climbing.By Friday, the toll of students, counterprotesters, bystanders and police officers who died in five days of student-led demonstrations against President Daniel Ortega\u2019s government had risen to at least 45 and was expected to climb further. In this Central American country of six million people, that tally makes this the deadliest unrest by far since nearly three decades of war ended in 1990.Government agencies tightly controlled by Mr. Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, have vowed to set up truth commissions and investigations. The question of whether anyone ordered the killings is poised to become a major issue in coming peace talks between the government, the Catholic Church, the business sector and the university students. The challenge is the most critical threat to Mr. Ortega\u2019s presidency since he was re-elected in 2007.\u201cHe has two options: dead or alive,\u201d Rosa D\u00edaz said of Mr. Ortega after her 29-year-old son\u2019s dead body turned up at a hospital following a particularly brutal night of protests in the capital, Managua. \u201cBut he has to leave office.\u201dMs. D\u00edaz said the police pressured her to waive the right to an autopsy on her son, Jos\u00e9 Ad\u00e1n Bones, and she agreed because she was grieving and thought she would not be able to afford the forensic exam.The uprising began on April 19, led by university students in Managua protesting against an unpopular social security decree that would have forced workers to pay more and retirees to receive less. The students were already worked up over a fire at a nature reserve that the government had failed to control.The response to the crackdown was intense, and the protests quickly broadened to encompass a much wider set of grievances with the Ortega couple\u2019s rule and the steadily increasing concentration of power in their hands. Even government concessions, including the rescinding of the social security reform, did not quell the unrest.Protesters turned out around the country, blasting the president\u2019s control of the Supreme Court, the National Assembly and the elections council. The violence escalated when the student protests were met not just by the riot police, but also by swarms of young men in white and pink T-shirts declaring their membership in the Sandinista Youth \u2014 a pro-government organization that has been harassing demonstrators and sometimes throwing stones at them. Videos showed the police handing the young men rocks.The vice president\u2019s office, which controls news media access, did not respond to repeated messages seeking comment. But Bayardo Arce, one of the original Sandinista commanders and a top adviser to Mr. Ortega, acknowledged in an interview with Univision that the police \u201clost control\u201d during the protests.Vilma N\u00fa\u00f1ez, formerly a Sandinista, founded the center, which has chronicled abuses by Mr. Ortega\u2019s government. By her tally, 45 people have died so far in the unrest \u2014 24 students, two police officers, a reporter and 18 others.\u201cThey didn\u2019t just use the police here,\u201d she said. \u201cThey used strike forces.\u201d\u201cThe order was definitely to kill,\u201d Ms. N\u00fa\u00f1ez added, \u201cnot to stop the protest.\u201dMs. Murillo, who is also vice president, blamed the students for the bloodshed. She said some people were killed by shotguns fired from inside the Polytechnic University, a focal point for the protesters, and accused the opposition of disseminating \u201cfake news\u201d by exaggerating the number of killings.\u201cThose tiny, petty, mediocre beings, those beings full of hate, still have the nerve to invent dead,\u201d Ms. Murillo said in an address shortly after the unrest erupted, referring to the protesters. \u201cFor those crimes, we demand punishment,\u201d she said.Mr. Ortega was president during the 1980s, when the United States financed a war aimed at ousting him. He agreed to elections in 1990 and lost, but then returned to office in 2007 after he maneuvered changes to an election law that allowed him to take office with less than 50 percent of the vote.Since then, he has faced international condemnation for chipping away at democracy. In 2008, he was accused of orchestrating rampant voter fraud in municipal elections, which gave him control of cities around the country. He stacked the Supreme Court and used that majority to get rid of the constitutional ban on term limits. He used legal ploys to eliminate opposition parties, and took control of most of the country\u2019s television stations. All of this fed the resentment that boiled over into the current uprising.Mr. Ortega\u2019s socialist Sandinista Front party said several members of the Sandinista Youth had died in the unrest. The party defended the police, saying they acted prudently because \u201cthe destruction of the country could not be allowed.\u201dOpposition members fear the killings will become another example of impunity in Central America, where a number of governments have never been held to account for crimes over the past several decades.Now the families of the dead must rely on the police, prosecutors and the judiciary \u2014 all firmly under Mr. Ortega\u2019s control \u2014 to investigate.In an annual report, the Permanent Committee on Human Rights showed photos of prominent law enforcement authorities, including the chief of the Supreme Court, waving the black-and-red Sandinista flag.That, said the group\u2019s leader, Marco Carmona, does not exactly inspire confidence.\u201cWe cannot trust that there will be an objective investigation, a professional investigation, nor can we trust that the judicial authorities are going to be faithful in their application of the law,\u201d said Denis Darce, who runs training projects at Mr. Carmona\u2019s group. \u201cCitizens will be practically defenseless.\u201dMr. Bones, the young man who was killed, lived outside Managua and was visiting relatives in the capital when he went missing for several days. His bullet-riddled body suddenly appeared at a hospital morgue near one of the protest sites, where he apparently got caught in the cross-fire.\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask us any questions about him because they already knew how he died. They knew those shots came from them,\u201d his sister, Migdalia Bones, said of the police. \u201cThen a man at the hospital came up to me and whispered: \u2018Go to the human rights office.\u2019\u201dBecause his body did not appear for days after the protests and his family has not made the trek to Managua to file official complaints with human rights agencies, Mr. Bones\u2019s name does not appear on the official list of the dead that rights groups have compiled.Even as bodies were buried without autopsies, the attorney general\u2019s office held a news conference asking families to file written complaints and present any evidence they had.\u201cThis has been handled in a way that is cruel and perverse,\u201d said Ms. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, the founder of the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights. Next, she said, the government will start rounding up innocent people so authorities can appear to be working on the cases.\u201cNow comes the witch hunt,\u201d she said.The National Assembly, which is controlled by the Sandinista Front party, said it had formed a truth commission. The government Office for the Defense of Human Rights has also created a \u201cvictims committee\u201d to record complaints.On Monday, the government held a \u201cpeace and dialogue\u201d rally to prove it has supporters, too, using the motto of the Sandinista Party to promote peace talks led by the Catholic Church.\u201cWhere are these 63 dead? I have seen like 12 or 15. Let\u2019s say there were 20; I haven\u2019t seen them,\u201d said Leonardo Lo\u00e1isiga, 50, an attendee, referring to one widely cited, unconfirmed death toll. \u201cShow me those 63 dead.\u201dBut the killings have also soured some loyal Sandinistas like Ms. D\u00edaz and the family of 16-year-old Jesner Josu\u00e9 Rivas, who died in the turmoil.\u201cNicaragua is being left without university students because the government of Nicaragua is killing them,\u201d said Norlan Rodr\u00edguez, whose nephew Jesner died a few blocks from a store that was being looted. \u201cI am a Sandinista, and have been so since I was a little kid. But they killed my boy and I will never give those people my vote again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Risk to the Economy \u2014 A Slowdown in Lending: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A slowdown in lending could pose a threat to the economy.\u2022 Could oil prices return to $100 a barrel next year?\u2022 Walmart\u2019s journey to its biggest deal.\u2022 How Michael Cohen made $2 million as a gatekeeper.\u2022 The latest fallout from Trump\u2019s foreign policy.With tax cuts done and deregulation proceeding, some expect the United States economy to grow more quickly than it has in recent years.Borrowing allows companies and individuals to finance purchases that they might not otherwise be able to afford. When borrowing surges, new money circulates through the economy, creating demand that needs to be met with higher production.Lending has certainly not fallen off a cliff like it did during the Great Recession, but it is growing quite a bit slower than it has in recent years. If it doesn\u2019t pick up, that could dampen growth some expect.In March, bank loans to companies (commercial and industrial loans, in the Federal Reserve\u2019s statistics) rose 2.5 percent from a year ago. That is well below the 7 percent average monthly growth rate of the past three years. Real estate and consumer loans also grew below their three-year average rates.Tough comparisons are in part to blame for the lackluster growth. This year\u2019s borrowing is being compared with totals notched up during a surge in lending. And since that boom petered out in early 2017, growth rates in credit may soon look better.But something else may hinder a strong revival in borrowing. Companies may have taken on so much debt that they may not want to borrow much more, or their creditors may not be as willing to lend. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Wednesday noted that the \u201cnet leverage\u201d of investment-grade corporations is now at its highest level since 2002. Debt, after subtracting cash holdings, is 1.82 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the companies, excluding financial firms and corporations in the energy, utilities and metals sectors.Of course, we may now just be in a lending lull that will soon give way to a rebound. But the longer credit growth remains subpar, the less likely a Trump boom becomes.- Peter EavisAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch argue that there is a risk of that happening.They cite collapsing production in Venezuela, continued production restraint by OPEC and Russia, and the rising tensions in the Middle East, which seem set to worsen in the wake of President Trump\u2019s decision to walk away from Iran nuclear deal.The analysts raised their forecast for Brent, the global benchmark for oil, to $70 a barrel this year and to $75 a barrel next year and that there was a possibility of oil going to $100 a barrel.Why the risk of $100 a barrel? There could be a greater than expected drop in Iranian oil exports and OPEC and Russia could continue to curb production. The BofA analysts write:\u201cIf a new Iran deal is not reached in the next six months or OPEC/Russia extend production cuts into 2019, global oil markets would likely tighten further.\u201dAnd United States shale likely will not make up for the falloff in productionBrent last saw $100 a barrel in September 2014.On the earnings call for his Third Point Reinsurance, Mr. Loeb said:Over the past two years, markets were boosted by positive surprises in growth and benign inflation, but during the first quarter, uncertainty returned in each of these areas. Investors have become increasingly concerned about multiples, particularly since after many years of low rates, there\u2019s finally an alternative to equities in the form of relatively riskless 2-year money.We\u2019ve also seen manufacturing indices start to decline from elevated levels.As the markets today grapple with multiples and which inning of the late cycle we\u2019re in, we\u2019re watching closely to see if a recession, which we don\u2019t think is close, might be getting closer.Historically low yields have push investors into increasingly risky assets since the financial crisis and provided crucial support for the stocks. Now that two-year Treasuries yield is more than 2.50 percent, that critical pillar of the nine-year bull market has been weakened somewhat.By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.Down the road: Flipkart and its remaining investors still hope the company will go public someday. Walmart is on board.He didn\u2019t join the White House. But President Trump\u2019s fixer brought in huge payouts from Squire Patton Boggs, AT&T, Novartis and others with the prospect of access to power.\u2022 AT&T told employees that it paid $600,000 for antitrust insight into antitrust matters as it sought backing for its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner.\u2022 Novartis was worried about Mr. Trump moving against the Affordable Care Act and promising to cut drug prices.Here are the details from the WSJ:\u2022 It will carry the Apple Pay brand.\u2022 It will replace rewards-card partnership with Barclays.\u2022 It could be issued next year.ContextThe move comes as Apple has become more focused on bolstering revenue from its services business.

{"Headline": "New Jersey Emerges as a Liberal Bulwark Under Murphy", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA recently adopted equal pay law has put New Jersey at the forefront of national efforts to narrow the gender wage gap. The state\u2019s new automatic voter registration law ranks among the most sweeping in the country, while its funding of Planned Parenthood, package of gun control laws, renewable energy legislation and a measure to provide state financial aid to immigrants who came to the United States as children are all part of the progressive playbook.In a state whose political profile has been marked by scandal and dominated most recently by a bellicose Republican governor, the first few months of Gov. Philip D. Murphy\u2019s Democratic tenure have seen an abrupt ideological makeover as New Jersey lurches to the left, joining the ranks of the most liberal states in the nation.His aggressive steering reflects the mandate Mr. Murphy believes he was given last year by his lopsided victory.But his policies have also left Republicans and even moderate Democrats with a case of whiplash and raised serious questions about how Mr. Murphy will pay for his agenda in a state saddled with severe financial difficulties. New Jersey owes its state-run pension system $119 billion, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings, one of the largest debt obligations in the country, which has contributed to 11 credit downgrades in the past decade. The state also has the nation\u2019s highest property taxes, with many residents facing higher bills under the recent federal tax overhaul, while it has consistently underfunded local school districts.At the same time, Mr. Murphy\u2019s $37.4 billion budget comes with $2.7 billion in new spending, including proposals to make community colleges tuition-free for many families, to expand prekindergarten and to significantly increase funding for the state\u2019s beleaguered public transit system. But to pay for all this, Mr. Murphy is counting on initiatives that so far have been coolly received by some leaders in the Democratic-controlled Legislature \u2014 notably $1.7 billion in new taxes, including a levy on the wealthy, and the legalization of recreational marijuana, which would also add to the state\u2019s coffers.Mr. Murphy defended his blueprint, saying it was motivated not by politics but by a desire to make New Jersey a fairer state. \u201cYou can\u2019t make economic progress without social progress, and social progress can\u2019t be achieved without economic progress,\u201d he said in an interview, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t wake up every day to be liberal for the sake of being liberal.\u201dBut Mr. Murphy\u2019s approach has provoked fierce backlash from many Republicans.\u201cHe\u2019s not liberal; he\u2019s extreme,\u201d said Jon Bramnick, the Republican minority leader in the State Assembly. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a problem with people who are somewhat liberal, though I may disagree with them. But this is not a liberal agenda. This is an extreme left-wing agenda that is sending people out of the state who might have stayed.\u201dGurbir Grewal, who achieved a milestone as the first Sikh in the country to become a state attorney general, has joined numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration, including challenges to the travel ban and to a prohibition on transgender people in the military.Taken together, the state is undergoing a rapid transition from eight years of Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and a friend of President Trump who clashed often with the Legislature. It is becoming, much like California and New York, a liberal bulwark against the White House.As the Trump administration and congressional Republicans sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act and then cut the budget for advertising enrollment periods, Mr. Murphy signed an executive order to promote enrollment in New Jersey.\u201cGovernor Murphy is a gift from the heavens, from my vantage point,\u201d said Mr. Bhalla, a Democrat. \u201cHe has taken the reins from Day 1 on everything from protecting residents from the inimical policies coming from Washington, whether it\u2019s related to tax policy or a host of civil rights issues that impact this highly diverse state.\u201dMr. Murphy\u2019s ability to drive the state in a more liberal direction is partly driven by the ascendancy of Democratic voters \u2014 Democrats make up 36 percent of registered voters, while Republicans represent 21 percent \u2014 and an electorate that soundly rejected Mr. Trump at the polls.\u201cIs this kind of extreme politics good for Republicans?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt is.\u201dWhile New Jersey has become increasingly blue over the years, it has tended to be more moderate than other Democratic-leaning states with wide swaths of the state, including counties along the shore, remaining Republican strongholds.Still, even as the state veers left, there are some measures that New Jersey residents simply will not stomach, particularly if they are forced to pay even more in taxes. And without new revenue or painful cuts, Mr. Murphy will be hard pressed to realize his far-reaching goals.\u201cThe reason why Phil Murphy can make this a liberal laboratory here in New Jersey right now is because there\u2019s no strong organized opposition to him,\u201d said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. \u201cBut he could be in for a rude awakening when we get to the issue of core taxes and property taxes.\u201dMr. Murphy said he was willing to negotiate any part of his proposed budget, which must be signed by June 30, but he believes government is essential to the lives of his constituents. Having grown up in the 1960s, Mr. Murphy said that the era of his childhood, when \u201cthe government put a lot of wind in your sails,\u201d helped cement his view that raising taxes and investing more in government was the best use of people\u2019s money.\u201cI\u2019m not making light for those $85, or any one of those $85, but I will say this: I do believe with all my heart that if we get towards fully funding public education, pre-K, community college, triple our investment in New Jersey Transit,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s money really well spent and that family will benefit multiples of that $85.\u201dStill, the budget negotiations are likely to be contentious, and Mr. Murphy may well have to make compromises that could anger his base or run counter to campaign promises.\u201cPhil\u2019s got a lot of good will,\u201d said Howard Dean, the former presidential candidate and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who recruited Mr. Murphy to be the finance chairman for the party. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal because he\u2019s going to need all the political capital he can get.\u201dMr. Murphy\u2019s team believes that his victory margin of more than 14 percentage points gives him potent political leverage.The governor also plans on using the momentum that his early tenure has generated to help the party in the midterms by raising money for candidates or by energizing voters. He hosted one of the first fund-raisers to support the re-election of Senator Robert Menendez, seeking to ensure that no credible threat to Mr. Menendez\u2019s seat emerges despite the ethical cloud hanging over the senator\u2019s head.And while some party leaders have started traveling the country to support Democratic challengers, Mr. Murphy said he does not plan for now to throw his political weight or hefty personal fortune behind many candidates outside New Jersey. He did endorse Levi Sanders, the son of Senator Bernie Sanders, for Congress in New Hampshire \u2014 but only, Mr. Murphy said, because of his friendship with the younger Mr. Sanders, who campaigned for him for governor.He was emphatic about not paying attention to an increasingly acrimonious contest across the Hudson River between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon, the actress challenging Mr. Cuomo in the Democratic primary. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it for one second,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated where Levi Sanders is running for Congress. He is running in New Hampshire, not Vermont. An earlier version also misstated the current sales tax in New Jersey. It is 6.625 percent, not 6.875 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australian Archbishop Philip Wilson Guilty of Sexual Abuse Cover-Up", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 An Australian archbishop was convicted on Tuesday of covering up a claim of sexual abuse dating back decades, and now faces a prison sentence of up to two years.Philip Wilson, the archbishop of Adelaide, is the highest-ranking Catholic official in the world to be convicted of concealing such crimes.Archbishop Wilson, 67, was accused of covering up abuse by a priest, Jim Fletcher, in the state of New South Wales in the 1970s.The case against the archbishop was especially surprising, given his reputation for acknowledging and apologizing to the victims of pedophile priests.As the bishop of Wollongong, a town about 50 miles south of Sydney, he issued a formal apology to the diocese\u2019s victims.Archbishop Wilson came under scrutiny in 2010 on accusations of covering up two old cases of sexual abuse against children. In 2015, police formally charged him with concealing a serious offense regarding child sexual abuse.Peter Creigh, a former altar boy, testified that he told archbishop, then a parish priest, in 1976 that Father Fletcher made him strip and kneel as the priest masturbated in front of him.Mr. Creigh was 10 years old at the time.Prosecutors said the archbishop was repeatedly told of sexual misconduct by Father Fletcher, but failed each time to turn over to the authorities \u201cinformation that might be of material assistance.\u201dThe archbishop, who was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, testified that he had no memory of the conversation with Mr. Creigh.Father Fletcher died in 2006, just a year after being sentenced for the rape of a 13-year-old boy in the late 1980s.Archbishop Wilson, who vehemently denied the accusations against him and made four attempts to have the charges dismissed, faces a maximum sentence of two years.The outcome was closely watched by survivors of sexual abuse, who said the decision should spur the church to take further action.\u201cThis conviction in an Australian court signals that it\u2019s time for the Vatican to show it is serious about acting on child sexual abuse, and accept Wilson\u2019s resignation,\u201d said Chris MacIsaac, a spokeswoman for Broken Rites, a victims\u2019 advocacy group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sweeping Plan to Fix the Subways Comes With a $19 Billion Price Tag", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA sweeping proposal to overhaul New York City\u2019s subway and improve the broader transit system is expected to cost more than $19 billion, according to two people who were briefed on Tuesday, and goes far beyond the emergency repair plan that was unveiled last summer after the subway fell into crisis.The proposal by the subway\u2019s new leader, Andy Byford, will be announced on Wednesday in a highly anticipated presentation before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s board.Mr. Byford has warned that the subway needs major upgrades to reverse its precipitous slide and the work will require short-term pain for millions of subway riders. His plan will focus on speeding up the rollout of a new signal system to replace the subway\u2019s current antiquated equipment, according to the two people who were briefed on the plan on Tuesday and did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.Mr. Byford wants to install new signals on significant parts of the system over the next five years, the people said. That is a far shorter timeline than previous estimates from subway officials who have said that modernizing signals across the system could take nearly 50 years. The existing signals break down on a regular basis and some are so old that replacement parts are no longer manufactured.The signal work would require some stations to be closed on nights and weekends, but Mr. Byford decided against closing full lines because it would be too difficult on busy routes like the Lexington Avenue line in Manhattan, one person said. The proposal will also cover improvements to buses and paratransit services and could depend on changes to labor and procurement rules so that the work could be done more quickly.Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the M.T.A., the state-controlled agency that oversees the subway, said on Tuesday afternoon that the cost estimates for Mr. Byford\u2019s plan were not yet done and would be completed as part of the next capital plan.\u201cAny estimates are premature and are inevitably inaccurate,\u201d Mr. Lhota said in a statement. \u201cThe point of tomorrow\u2019s presentation is to show we can and we will modernize the N.Y.C. Transit System.\u201dIn the first five years, officials would upgrade signals on subway lines that carry roughly half of the system\u2019s daily riders, including parts of the 4, 5 and 6 lines and the A, C and E lines, according to an official with knowledge of the plan. The agency would also move quickly to install elevators at 50 additional stations in the next five years to make the subway more accessible.Mr. Byford\u2019s proposal is a road map for moving toward a modern and reliable subway, said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group.\u201cWe were looking for an honest accounting of what it would take to fix the subway and the M.T.A. is producing an honest accounting,\u201d Mr. Raskin said. \u201cThe plan will require significant funding, political will and sacrifice from riders, but the reality is we need to make those things happen because we need to fix the subway.\u201dAs the subway descended into crisis last summer, officials started to implement a roughly $800 million short-term rescue plan. Mr. Byford\u2019s proposal is aimed at making more comprehensive upgrades, from station bathrooms to elevators, and could involve major disruptions on a system that serves more than five million riders each day.Changes to the signal system and new safety rules have increased delays, an issue that won\u2019t be easy for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to fix.The debate over funding for the subway modernization plan could again pit Mr. Cuomo against his frequent political nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio. Mr. Cuomo called on Mr. de Blasio to pay about $400 million toward the short-term subway plan, which he eventually agreed to do under pressure.Mr. Byford\u2019s plan is much more expensive. The authority\u2019s current five-year capital plan is about $33 billion and that covers not just subways and buses, but also funding for two commuter railroads, bridges and tunnels and expansion projects.Eric Phillips, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said the city was not willing to help pay for Mr. Byford\u2019s plan. He said the authority should use its existing resources and the state should approve a new revenue source, like the millionaire\u2019s tax that Mr. de Blasio has proposed.\u201cWhile the devil is always in the details, early reports suggest the M.T.A. is finally focusing on the infrastructure riders need to get around,\u201d Mr. Phillips said in a statement.\u201cOur bottom line is that the plan needs to be expeditious and realistic and we made it clear to the chairman that before it is finalized, the M.T.A. must bring in the top tech experts in the nation. Because if we can experiment with self-driving vehicles, there must be an alternative technology for the subways,\u201d Ms. Lever said in a statement.Mr. Byford, who previously led Toronto\u2019s transit system, is widely respected by industry veterans and is viewed as meticulous and independent.Still, his accelerated timeline for upgrading signals may face skepticism because of the agency\u2019s track record. There have been serious delays in installing a new signal system, which is known as communications-based train control, or C.B.T.C.Of New York\u2019s 22 subway lines, only the L train has the advanced signal system. An effort to install the technology on the No. 7 line is years overdue.Mr. Byford has said he hoped the No. 7 line signal upgrades would finally be completed this year.Advertisement"}

She was 79.The cause was liver cancer, her son William Whittleseysaid.As a guardian of the conservative flame, Mrs. Whittlesey sometimes vexed her more pragmatic and less ideological administration colleagues as she aggressively helped cobble together what became known as the Reagan coalition.Between two separate terms as ambassador to Switzerland, she was director of the president\u2019s Office of Public Liaison from 1983 to 1985 and the only woman among the most senior White House staff members.Mrs. Whittlesey enlisted the support of evangelicals and other religious conservatives, disaffected blue-collar Democrats, the National Rifle Association and an array of other groups she believed had been insufficiently integrated into Reagan\u2019s 1980 presidential campaign. Within the administration she echoed their concerns about a cultural and moral decline in the nation.She won no fans among feminists.Mrs. Whittlesey scheduled a screening of the anti-abortion film \u201cThe Silent Scream\u201d at the White House, opposed the Equal Rights Amendment and warned that feminism was a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d for women, having the effect, she said, of curtailing their legal rights in child custody and alimony cases.\u201cRonald Reagan,\u201d she once said, \u201chonored the role of full-time homemaker and her rights in Social Security and income tax in the face of elite feminists\u2019 demeaning of full-time mothers.\u201dMrs. Whittlesey acknowledged that she had faced discrimination as a woman. In her last year at law school in the early 1960s, she said, she was advised not even to bother sitting for interviews when firms came to recruit. Later on, though, she said, her ideological leanings isolated her more than her gender.\u201cI find myself in many closed rooms filled with men,\u201d she was quoted as saying by the Washington Post columnist David S. Broder in his book \u201cChanging of the Guard: Power and Leadership in America\u201d (1980), \u201cbut I\u2019m rarely invited to women\u2019s movement functions, because I am pro-life and do not endorse feminist ideology of victimhood.\u201d (In 1986 she became the first woman to be accepted as a member of the venerable Union League Club in Manhattan.)Mrs. Whittlesey often invoked John Quincy Adams\u2019s admonition that \u201cwe do not go abroad for monsters to destroy\u201d and later expressed skepticism about invading Iraq. But she was gung-ho against Communism during the Cold War.In the liaison office, she organized the White House Central American Outreach Group to document the Marxist orientation of the Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua.Later, while acknowledging that she had worked closely with Lt. Col. Oliver L. North on the White House staff, she denied any connection with the Iran-contra scandal, in which the administration secretly sold arms to Iran and used the proceeds to finance rebels seeking to oust the revolutionary Sandinista government. Colonel North was a central figure in the affair.During her first term as envoy there, she began negotiations on an agreement regarding insider trading that pierced the secrecy of Swiss banks. She also became embroiled in a minor scandal over the mishandling of private contributions to an entertainment fund for the embassy, but the Justice Department cleared her of wrongdoing.She was born Faith Amy Ryan on Feb. 21, 1939, in Jersey City to Martin Roy Ryan, a railroad billing clerk, and Amy Jerusha (Covell) Ryan, a teacher and nurse\u2019s aide who worked in a factory during World War II. She grew up in Teaneck, N.J., and Williamsville, N.Y., near Buffalo.She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in history from Wells College in Aurora, N.Y., in 1960 and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.A former Kennedy Democrat, Mrs. Whittlesey was elected to the Pennsylvania Legislature as a Republican from Delaware County in 1972. Four years later, at the national convention, she bolted party regulars who were behind President Gerald R. Ford to support Reagan in his ultimately unsuccessful bid for the nomination. (More recently, she was an early supporter of Donald J. Trump.)She also endured her share of personal tragedy. Both her husband, Roger Weaver Whittlesey, and their elder son, Henry, struggled with depression. Both committed suicide, Mr. Whittlesey in 1974 and Henry in 2012. Mrs. Whittlesey lost her right eye to cancer in 1994 and part of a lung in 2001.In addition to their son William, Mrs. Whittlesey is survived by a daughter, Amy Whittlesey O\u2019Neill; 10 grandchildren; and a brother, Thomas Martin Ryan.\u201cWhile some might criticize her persistence as toughness, Faith portrayed this strength of purpose as an essential ingredient of her political survival,\u201d Thomas J.

Long, a friend from Dartmouth who lost in a landslide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a Democrat. He then reimbursed the donors in cash.His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, defended the illegal donations as \u201can act of misguided friendship.\u201dMr. D\u2019Souza and his lawyer have said that he was politically targeted because of his opposition to President Barack Obama, a claim that Judge Berman called \u201cnonsense.\u201dAfter graduating in 1983, he worked at Policy Review, a conservative journal in Washington. He worked for the Reagan administration as an adviser in 1988.He has written more than a dozen books. His first, \u201cIlliberal Education,\u201d was published in 1991, lifting him to national notoriety with his criticism of political correctness on college campuses.Mr. D\u2019Souza, a frequent guest on Fox News and conservative radio, has often singled out President Barack Obama for criticism. His 2010 book, \u201cThe Roots of Obama\u2019s Rage,\u201d argued that Mr. Obama was carrying out the anticolonial agenda of his Kenyan father.The commentator\u2019s appearances at colleges have also stoked controversy. Speaking at Stony Brook University in April, he joked about the Holocaust.In February, Mr. D\u2019Souza was disinvited from a speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference after mocking the Parkland, Fla., shooting survivors on Twitter.But, Mr. Panero added, \u201cI think the rewards of playing to the crowd, of throwing out red meat, have become too great.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Keeps Xi Jinping Awake at Night", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 As the leader of the world\u2019s most populous country and biggest communist party, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has plenty to worry about, and a new book sheds light on what probably keeps him up at night.The recent trade dispute between China and the United States has brought new attention to China\u2019s zeal to become technologically self-reliant. The book shows that Mr. Xi was determined that China master its own microchips, operating systems and other core technologies well before this recent quarrel. In two speeches \u2014 in July and August 2013 \u2014 Mr. Xi pointedly said that Western domination came thanks to technology.\u201cAdvanced technology is the sharp weapon of the modern state. An important reason that Western countries were able to hold sway over the world in modern times was that they held the advanced technology. You cannot buy the truly core technologies. It\u2019s been aptly put that \u2018The sharpest weapon of a state should not be revealed.\u2019\u201d\u201cOur technology still generally lags that of developed countries, and we must adopt an asymmetrical strategy of catching up and overtaking, bringing our own advantages to bear. In core technological fields where it would be impossible for us to catch up by 2050, we must research asymmetrical steps to catch up and overtake. Internationally, if you don\u2019t have the advantage of core technologies, you don\u2019t have the political momentum. We must make a big effort in key fields and areas where there is a stranglehold. The same applies to the military.\u201dSince the introduction of the internet, Chinese Communist Party leaders have worried about its deployment as a means of subversion and spying. A speech on propaganda that Mr. Xi gave in August 2013 suggested he was alarmed by the United States\u2019 surveillance capabilities that were exposed by Edward Snowden.\u201cThe internet has become the main battleground of struggle over public opinion. Some comrades have said that the internet is the \u2018biggest variable\u2019 confronting us, and if it\u2019s mishandled it will become a \u2018peril weighing on our minds.\u2019 Western anti-China forces have constantly and vainly tried to exploit the internet to \u2018topple China,\u2019 and years ago some Western politicians declared that \u2018with the internet, we have a way to deal with China\u2019 and \u2018socialist countries will throw themselves into the arms of the West, and it will start from the internet.\u2019 To judge from the United States\u2019 Prism, XKeyscore and other surveillance programs, the capabilities and scale of their internet activities far, far exceed what everyone had imagined. Whether we can stand our ground and win this battle over the internet has a direct bearing on our country\u2019s ideological and political security.\u201dChina has been spending heavily to upgrade its military. In a December 2014 speech, though, Mr. Xi warned Chinese military officials that they risked being eclipsed technologically by the United States.\u201cA new technological and industrial revolution is brewing, a global revolution in military affairs is accelerating, and the pattern of international military competition is experiencing historic changes. The United States is the leader of the pack in this revolution in military affairs, and in many areas it holds the initiative, and it is also striving to gain new advantages in military technology. The United States is accelerating development of global rapid-strike offensive capabilities, and some advanced weaponry has technologically broken through spatiotemporal boundaries. Once they are deployed for actual combat, they will fundamentally transform the traditional array of offense and defense in warfare.\u201dChina\u2019s leadership has become increasingly forthright about the need to defuse financial risks from growing debt, and comments Mr. Xi made in December 2016 explain why.\u201cCurrently, financial risks are volatile and frequent. Although systemic financial risks are generally under control, risks are accumulating from nonperforming assets, liquidity, bond defaults, shadow banks, external shocks, a property bubble, government debt, and internet financing, and the financial markets are also in a mess. Some financial risks are longstanding, lurking sources of infection that are concealed very deep but may erupt in a flash. The United States subprime crisis erupted in a night. If we\u2019re going to have big trouble in the future, it could well be in this area, and this demands high vigilance.\u201dMr. Xi has stepped up the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to reduce smog, soil contamination and other pollution. Remarks that Mr. Xi made in May 2013, when China was in the midst of a smog crisis, showed how alarmed he was about public anger and protests, which Chinese officials call \u201cmass incidents.\u201d\u201cThe public is highly concerned about environmental problems, and the position of ecological issues in the public\u2019s happiness index is inevitably going to become increasingly prominent. As the economy and society develop and as people\u2019s living standards rise, environmental problems are often most liable to trigger mass discontent, and if they\u2019re mishandled they are often most liable to trigger mass incidents.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Excerpts From the Art Leaders Network Conference", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it comes to Berlin it\u2019s the historic density of the city that is attracting talent over time and always has been. I was born and raised in West Berlin, and I was 10 when the wall came down.And I think this iconic, symbolic moment of the Iron Curtain being torn apart in Berlin touched people across the globe, and still gives them the shivers when they come to Berlin and see the historic dimension here.I think this is very much some of the advantage of Berlin when it comes to showing the roots of the cultural city here.Director, UCCA, BeijingI moved to Beijing in 2001. I arrived the week before 9/11, right out of college to study Chinese. What\u2019s allowed Beijing to become a global art center in these past 18 years: It\u2019s about the fact that there is a significant community of artists, but it\u2019s also about an ecology that kind of builds on itself year after year.So if you look around today you have institutions, you have auction houses, you have galleries, you have media, you have critics, you have independent curators, and you have collectors. And you need all of these ingredients, and they tend to impact each other in a sort of positive feedback loop.President and chief executive, Pace GalleryWhy are art galleries expanding, why are they opening galleries all over the world? It\u2019s driven by the community dynamics that they don\u2019t want to come to us. They don\u2019t want this exclusive experience.They\u2019re very happy to come to us, but they want to see us come to them. So we started going to Palo Alto about almost 15 years ago.And from our lessons \u2014 like our lessons in Beijing and around the world \u2014 you realize that you must become part of that community. You have to have something to offer that community.It is about connecting with the artists, connecting with historians, and also seeing how the galleries connect with a broader public. Because that\u2019s what in particular in a place like Palo Alto or a place like Shenzhen the interest is in \u2014 how do we touch millions and millions of people, which is something that the art world historically hasn\u2019t put a huge focus on. So that becomes extremely important.Director, Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonRight from the beginning, museums like the V&A had this very popular, democratic, civic function. And arguably they slightly lost their way in the mid-20th century, when they became very introverted, scholastic, overly academic in terms of their approach to the public. So we are going back to our founding mission.But the tactic we take is that we don\u2019t give an inch on curatorial excellence, that actually what the public comes to museums and pays quite large sums of money to see is the insides of curatorial talent and skill alongside the collections. We will move heaven and earth to make it as accessible as possible.But you\u2019ve got to have the balance. We cannot be a theme park. We cannot be a venue-for-hire. Scholarship and curatorial scholarship has to absolutely be at the heart of it. Owner, David Zwirner GalleryThe primary motivation to grow is to further the artists\u2019 audience. So what we do as a gallery, first and foremost, we are representing artists and artist estates. And our job is to bring that work to not just those places that are already familiar with it, but also the places that are not familiar with the work.You need more touchpoints where you can inform people about what the artists are doing that we represent.And of course, ideally, you do that in a gallery setting where you present an exhibition.But art fairs are very important, and, you know, it\u2019s a great way to get to know new people and to present one\u2019s program across the world.The audience is actually changing. The socioeconomic mix is totally different. It\u2019s much younger than it used to be. And subsequently, different types of people are coming into the gallery, and that\u2019s a beautiful thing.Of course, the gallery is for free, so people should come.Chief executive, ColnaghiI was reading some materials prepared for the panel this morning and noticed that in 2017 the highest-attended exhibition globally was ancient Buddhist sculptures in Tokyo \u2014 nearly 12,000 people a day coming to see ancient Japanese sculptures.So in a way I think that we don\u2019t have a job to do that is engaged in singling out the old versus the new. We have a job to do in terms of defining access and inclusion across the entire spectrum of our programmatic mission fulfillment.And so our ability to tell expansive stories in the ancient world, in the old master world, and the contemporary world, I think the obligation is exactly the same.But I also think that in general times \u2014 and I know that there are certain people here in the audience that have dealt with this \u2014 experience has also become more interesting than possession. That is a challenge \u2014 how do we as, in my case a dealer, find people that actually still want to possess something? Chairman, Americas, Sotheby\u2019sForty percent of our new clients in the recent years are under 40 years old, so it\u2019s a very young demographic. About 40 percent of their spend is on Western art. And that\u2019s really interesting to us.The billionaires in Asia tend to be about 20 years younger than billionaires in the West, so that\u2019s also another kind of support statistic for a much younger demographic.Chairwoman, Qatar Museums board of trusteesI think with the National Museum of Qatar we\u2019ve been always reluctant to announce an opening date just because of the complexity of the museum. It\u2019s finished in terms of building. The construction is complete. The collection is in place.If a museum in the West is delayed, nobody really talks about it or cares. The moment a museum in the Middle East is delayed, it\u2019s front page headlines. So for us, we want to make sure that we open it correctly as opposed to opening it on the day that we have previously announced.So we\u2019re not challenged by the idea of reflecting on our project and deciding when to really open it. I think, currently, we\u2019re looking at opening the building in March of \u201919 \u2014 so from December to March is not really that much of a delay.President and chief executive, Metropolitan Museum of ArtThe Metropolitan went through a process of careful review of our facilities and developed a master plan about five or six years ago and within that plan we identified a lot of deferred maintenance issues that had to be addressed, that had built over the course of five decades. I\u2019m talking about over $800 million dollars\u2019 worth of deferred maintenance.And we needed a plan to deal with what we already had and the consequence of expansion over the course of the last five decades that was very extensive.The modern and contemporary art facilities we have now are not worthy of the rest of the Metropolitan. It\u2019s not substantial enough for our existing collection and it has all kinds of infrastructure problems. So I think one of the lessons in this discussion is, what does it take to actually produce an expansion project?One has to be as thoughtful and focused about priorities, to be a good client for the architect and for ourselves and I think when we began this project several years ago we had lots of good ideas. That\u2019s great. But if you have too many of them, the project gets increasingly complex, increasingly expensive, increasingly unwieldy. Our budgets are now in order and we have a very good plan.Founding partner, Diller, Scofidio + RenfroMy studio took on the MoMA expansion project because we knew that MoMA really, really needed to transform. It needed to expand to show more of its collection because a lot of its collection is behind closed doors.Secondly, it\u2019s interface with the city was really not very good. How could MoMA be better in its current manifestation and how could it show more work in better ways, in deeper ways? The whole variety of work, things that it was not able to show because of limitations.So, you know, I\u2019ve been doing this with all my heart and I have full belief that the project is going to be a big improvement.ArtistAlmost everything in the studio is influenced by computers nowadays. The artists who work there work with computers; the architects are trained on computers. So it\u2019s hard to imagine running the studio without technology, so to speak.We have a number of things going on in the research which are related to technology, such as playing with VR. And we\u2019re very active on the social media. And it turns out that, for instance, the home page, when we finally got around to checking how many people actually visit the home page, there\u2019s more people visiting the home page than going to the exhibitions.So some years ago we took the home page much more seriously, realizing, my God, this is our space, this is a way to have a dialogue with people that is otherwise not really appreciated. So gradually we have become incredibly influenced by technology.ArtistFor me, the art I love is always political. Picasso is very political to me. All those important artists, they always have very political opinions. Duchamps is very political to me. He became very intellectual.If you talk about Medieval art or Renaissance, good art always has to have a strong content, giving new definition to aesthetics \u2014 you know, having a strong moral manifesto and always having a strong philosophy behind it.Managing partner, Klaris Law; chief executive, KlarisIPThere\u2019s a number of ways that VR can be used. One is, artists adopting a new medium. But what I can imagine is that this world will draw from moviemakers, from photographers, from VR people, young people who grow up in a space. And so as you look at the categories of artists you also have to look at the way the different fields monetize their content, right?I mean, in the art world traditionally you take an object and you sell it for a given price, and that exchange is it. And then that object gets sold again to another person at another time, and that\u2019s it. The artist gets paid only the first time.However, in the movie business the relationship with your art might change very much. You might get paid every time the thing is sold or distributed. It might be a piece of VR that\u2019s going down on Netflix, and in your home you\u2019re wearing your goggles. So the artist could be getting a royalty as opposed to a single-sale payment.Partner, Khora ContemporaryI think we are moving in the direction of virtual reality, in general, technology, being part of our everyday life. We see now how museums have embraced VR, we saw the Tate with the Modigliani show, where they reproduced Modigliani\u2019s studio, which was quite talked about and popular, and drew quite a lot of younger crowds, who maybe were not familiar with the artist.You have virtual museums where private collectors put their artworks into a virtual world so you can approach the works and see them in a virtual space, without having to actually physically go to the museum.I always ask myself how would my kids want to experience art. What would draw them to a museum? In our family we all come from the art world, so it forces them to look at art. But they perceive art in a completely different way if it\u2019s done with the aid of technology, whether we like it or not. And I think this is the future, and this is an opportunity for us to draw the younger generations to museums, to art galleries.Director of the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkI think the real issue for all of us in the museum world is to learn to think digitally, so that what we\u2019re talking about is not simply the transformation of certain kinds of stories into different formats, or the use of new technologies to deliver those stories, but to fundamentally rethink how we think, to move away from the kind of analogue art history that we were all taught \u2014 hierarchical, sequential, to a more networked reconsidered manner of actually presenting works of art, so that we begin to move into a realm where the way in which we look at art, the way in which we display art, actually is no longer so analogue.And I think one of the great advents of digital technology is that it has begun to teach us how to imagine different relationships between objects and between viewers and objects.I think one of the reasons we\u2019ve seen our demographics change dramatically from an average age of a little over 50 to an average age of under 40 has been because we\u2019ve recognized what people who are younger want to do when they go to a museum. They want to be with each other, and talk, and think, and text, and create a kind of continuum of experience.Chief executive, PhillipsEssentially it is a very collaborative business. I mean, we\u2019re all sitting here in this room, we all know each other. We\u2019re sitting here with museum directors, gallery owners, auction house people. There\u2019s a huge amount of shared resolve I suppose, and shared experience.And all that comes together quite often to create business opportunities in our world. And I\u2019ve always believed that the most successful people in our business are the people who do collaborate \u2014 legally of course, for most \u2014 and there are huge opportunities for dealers to work with auction houses.Capital and finance and the amounts of money that are now required \u2014 I mean, most dealers find it very difficult to get anywhere near because of the sums of money required. Auction houses are a source of funding for deals, etc., etc.So, yeah, we are in a different world, and I think inevitably we\u2019ve been collaborating more and more closely for some time.Chairman of Christie\u2019s AmericasI think that we\u2019re both competitors and collaborators. I would draw a distinction though between the secondary market and the primary market. I agree that the primary market is no place for auction houses, and that it requires a completely different structure in order to build the careers of artists.I think when it comes to the secondary market it is very much a place for auction houses in the guise of private sales, and that there should be no distinction, and that the global footprint of either the great galleries or the auction houses provide equally good distribution options for the clients.Sometimes we compete, and sometimes we collaborate. But at the end of the line it\u2019s two very different professions.Being a gallery, being in auction houses have two different motivations, two different goals. But I think there are places where it\u2019s a very fruitful collaboration.Excerpts from the Art Leaders Network conference have been condensed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canadian Government to Buy Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain Pipeline", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 The Canadian government on Tuesday said it would buy an oil pipeline to the country\u2019s west coast, ensuring that its widely protested expansion will go forward.Environmentalists and some indigenous groups have strongly opposed the expansion of the pipeline, citing environmental concerns. The province of British Columbia is trying to block it in the courts.But the oil industry and the Alberta government argue that the expansion would bring needed jobs and help the economy.The purchase of the pipeline, for 4.5 billion Canadian dollars, puts the government squarely on the side of the oil industry.Over the past few years the pipeline has prompted large protests in British Columbia, and dozens of people have been arrested for breaking a court order limiting demonstrations near Kinder Morgan\u2019s tanker terminal in Burnaby, British Columbia.John Horgan, the premier of British Columbia, said the province would not back down from its court action challenging the federal government\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction.\u201cToday\u2019s announcement by the federal government does not reduce the risk of a diluted bitumen spill,\u201d Mr. Horgan said at a news conference, using the technical name for the petroleum from oil sands. \u201cI will continue to do my best to protect B.C.\u2019s interests.\u201dThe expansion will put a second pipeline alongside about 610 miles of the 715-mile Trans Mountain pipeline, which opened in 1953. It will increase the system\u2019s capacity to 890,000 barrels a day, from 300,000, at a cost of $7.4 billion.Most of the oil sent through the Trans Mountain pipeline heads to the United States either through a spur pipeline or aboard tankers. Supporters of the expansion argue that it will open Asia as a second market for Canadian oil.Mr. Horgan\u2019s opposition to the pipeline appears rooted, at least partly, in political calculations in British Columbia. His government needs the support of three lawmakers from British Columbia\u2019s Green Party to stay in power. They all adamantly oppose the pipeline.British Columbia\u2019s opposition led Kinder Morgan to suspend nonessential spending on Trans Mountain last month. The company also said it would give up on the expansion if British Columbia did not stop its efforts to halt the plan by this Thursday.Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, has fired back at Mr. Horgan. She briefly stopped wine imports from British Columbia and this month signed a law allowing her government to suspend oil and gas supplies to its neighbor, a move British Columbia is also contesting in court.On Tuesday, Ms. Notley appeared to take credit for the action by Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government.\u201cWe said we would get the pipeline built and we are getting it built,\u201d she said in Edmonton, wearing a button supporting the project and surrounded by members of her caucus. \u201cThis deal and this pipeline will unlock investment in our oil sands.\u201dMr. Morneau, the federal finance minister, said the government would eventually sell the pipeline, in its expanded form, back to the private sector. The government has suggested that it might even turn a profit.Polls indicate that Canadians over all are split about the pipeline and the expansion plan.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals currently enjoy considerable support in the Vancouver area, but his party has long been unpopular in Alberta \u2014 a bastion of conservative politics in Canada, Ms. Notley\u2019s left-of-center government notwithstanding.Keith D. Brownsey, a professor of political science at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, said he expected the Liberals might lose seats in British Columbia in next year\u2019s election because of the Trans Mountain deal.But he said the decision to buy the pipeline will benefit the party on the whole, particularly when combined with its climate remediation steps and its strengthening of environmental oversight of proposed energy projects.\u201cMr. Trudeau has probably saved his political career,\u201d Mr. Brownsey said. \u201cYou may or may not agree with getting more oil to market. But what good is the federal government if they can\u2019t expand an existing pipeline along an existing right of way? He can now say the federal government has done something.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that most Canadian oil is sent to the United States by ship. Generally speaking, only oil sent through the Trans Mountain pipeline is sent by ship to the United States.Follow Ian Austen on Twitter: @ianrausten.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pimping Out Miss Venezuela", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Abbady grew up in Venezuela.The mission of the whole Miss Venezuela enterprise was, of course, to see the winner crowned Miss Universe. Since the Miss Universe pageant began in 1952, Venezuela has won seven times (second only to the United States), a much-touted accomplishment.It was perhaps only a matter of time before the country\u2019s beauty-queen industry, its mythmaking machine, broke down. This spring, the Miss Venezuela Organization temporarily suspended pageant operations after accusations that organizers had procured young women as sexual companions for wealthy sponsors, including officials at the highest levels of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government.In November, the Venezuelan news website Efecto Cocuyo published a series of investigative reports into the pageant abuses.Shortly after, the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reported on a money-laundering scheme involving officials in the Venezuelan state-owned oil company and their associates, one of whom was linked to a former pageant contestant and a $1 million deposit she made in an Andorra bank.This led to a backlash on social media, in which many former contestants accused one another of complicity in the corruption for having received cash, apartments and other gifts from men in or close to the Maduro regime. Other contestants, most of whom competed in the last five to 10 years, began giving interviews about their experiences of harassment and worse.Ib\u00e9yise Pacheco, a journalist and the author of a novel based on the intersection of beauty pageants, prostitution and government corruption, said she had talked to former contestants who ranged from willing participants in the sexual schemes to those who were \u201cpractically slaves.\u201d Indeed, Efecto Cocuyo reported on one young woman who fled the country after a sponsor whose advances she rejected threatened to kill her.At the center of the scandal is Osmel Sousa, director of the Miss Venezuela Organization for nearly 40 years, who stepped down in February. Venezuelans are used to seeing photographs of the nation\u2019s \u201cbeauty czar\u201d dwarfed by his towering queens. Some of those former contestants say Mr. Sousa or his assistants pressured them to act as escorts or concubines for politicians and businessmen in exchange for money to finance their pageant runs. Mr. Sousa has also been accused of being paid by the men for his role in arranging these transactions.Some women resisted; many others complied. A few married their patrons. Debora Menicucci, now 26, met Mr. Sousa when she was 13, and went on to represent Venezuela in the 2014 Miss World pageant. Around that time, Mr. Sousa reportedly introduced her to her future husband, Maikel Moreno, 25 years her senior. He is a lawyer who went to prison for murder in the 1980s and who now, as president of Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court, is known for imposing harsh sentences on opposition members.Mr. Sousa, who claims a friendship with Donald Trump, the former Miss Universe owner, and is known for flaunting cellphone pictures of the two of them together, denies any knowledge of, let alone involvement in, the abuse and corruption. In a statement on his Instagram account in March, he wrote, \u201cMy only riches are the memories, my millions are the applause and my greatest satisfaction was the success and exposure the event gave to innumerable Venezuelan women.\u201dAlthough the exploitation of pageant contestants seems to have become more extreme in recent years, sex was always part of pageant culture. Rumors had circulated for decades that contestants were being pressured to provide sexual favors to \u201cdark saints\u201d in return for money to pay for the wardrobe, diction classes, dental work, breast implants and other cosmetic surgeries matter-of-factly required of would-be Miss Venezuelas.Despite deepening poverty and the scarcity of basic supplies and medicine, Venezuela has one of world\u2019s highest rates of cosmetic procedures per capita. For Miss Venezuela aspirants, the surgeries are considered part of the project of transformation and self-sacrifice. According to Efecto Cocuyo, the months of preparation can cost up to $32,000.In her 2015 memoir, \u201cStraight Walk: A Supermodel\u2019s Journey to Finding Her Truth,\u201d the actress Patricia Vel\u00e1squez, a 1989 Miss Venezuela runner-up, described entering the contest at 18. She had hoped a win could help her family, who lived in a run-down building that rarely had running water. She wrote, \u201cI quickly learned that getting into the Miss Venezuela contest meant I would have to start prostituting myself in order to find a sponsor.\u201dShe found one, a man roughly 20 years older, who paid for her expenses, including breast implants and an apartment in Caracas \u2014 \u201csort of my boyfriend, but not one I ever told anyone else about.\u201d Ms. Vel\u00e1squez\u2019s story received little notice at the time, but she is now belatedly acknowledged as a whistle-blower whose book has helped substantiate the first-person accounts of recent months.A less acknowledged aspect of her memoir is the way it reveals the pageant\u2019s fraught racial history. She is of Wayuu descent, and one of the few indigenous or African-Venezuelan women to have had success in the competition. Her book includes a description of being told by Mr. Sousa that she\u2019d need surgery on her eyes, presumably to make her look more Caucasian.\u201cI understood the breast implants,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat didn\u2019t change me.\u201d But \u201cmy eyes made me who I was \u2014 part of being Wayuu, and common, and indigenous.\u201d She refused: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to let go of my roots and be an outsider in my own body.\u201d Her eyes untouched, she performed well at the pageant and went on to a successful modeling and acting career.In a March radio interview, Maria Gabriela Isler, Miss Universe 2013, said she repeatedly resisted demands from men she called \u201csharks\u201d during her pageant days, but does not fault the women who gave in. \u201cYou\u2019re 18, from the hinterlands of the country, and they offer you villas and castles,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t think about what\u2019s good or bad or the future. You think about what\u2019s within reach.\u201dThis desperation increased as the economic situation in the country worsened. While middle- and upper-class Venezuelans have emigrated, young women from low-income backgrounds have flocked to regional pageant castings, desperate for any opportunity to help their families.\u201cWe are living in a country where people will sell themselves for a bar of soap,\u201d Esteban Vel\u00e1asquez, a pageant coach, told Efecto Cocuyo.In the United States, events like the Miss U.S.A. contest are largely seen as an anachronism, fodder for feminist scorn or amusement. But in Latin America, beauty pageants are a bid for relevance on the world stage.It was Americans, in fact, who helped introduce the pageant in Venezuela. Miss Venezuela began as a 1952 beauty contest sponsored by the airline Pan American and a swimsuit company. It took place at the Valle Arriba Golf Club, a gated playground for expats and oil executives in Caracas.Oil and beauty have been intertwined ever since. As Ra\u00fal Gallegos put it in his 2016 book, \u201cCrude Nation: How Oil Riches Ruined Venezuela,\u201d oil wealth \u201chas nurtured a culture where looks have paramount importance.\u201d That\u2019s an understatement in a country where oil tankers were named for beauty queens.Now the oil wealth is gone, and the Miss Venezuela bubble has finally burst. The pageant scandals have shaken Venezuelans who\u2019ve already watched their country unravel in the decadence and strife of the governments of Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. There\u2019s the sense that life is now a matter of just surviving the daily social unrest and the food and medicine shortages that are sending a flood of refugees to Colombia and Brazil. Many are asking, \u201cNow this?\u201dBut of course, it\u2019s a grimly familiar pattern. Men who abuse power think they can do it everywhere. The last two decades in Venezuela have seen the creation of a puppet National Assembly and Supreme Court loyal to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and Mr. Maduro; the end of term limits; the nationalization of private enterprise; and, above all, the rise of an elite governing class living on oil wealth. It\u2019s no surprise that the men who\u2019ve taken so much from their country assumed they could take its beauty queens, too.\u201cAs a Venezuelan,\u201d Ms. Pacheco said, \u201cit\u2019s painful to see an institution we were all so proud of come down like this.\u201dMs. Machado, through tears, said the pageant had been \u201cour last glory,\u201d now contaminated by \u201ca revolutionary cancer.\u201dIt would take much more than that to bring down Miss Venezuela. A 16-year-old contestant in that 1972 pageant reportedly asked Mr. Sousa what feminists were. The \u201cbeauty czar,\u201d then just starting his career, responded, \u201cUgly women who don\u2019t bathe.\u201dIt\u2019s bittersweet now, and a bit horrifying, to think back on generations of Miss Venezuela enthusiasts, myself among them, who were swept up in the pageant\u2019s brand of nationalism. My parents were expats, and still a Miss Venezuela viewing at my house was a giddy affair of marathon snacking and catty laughter. Like most fans, we weren\u2019t aware of how much the women were chiseled to meet Euro-American beauty standards, let alone subjected to more sinister treatment.Ms. S\u00e1ez went on to become a popular mayor of the municipality of Chacao in Caracas, where my family lived. I once caught sight of her in the lobby of a government building greeting mostly male fans. She looked like nobody I\u2019d ever known, in school or life. She was svelte, gracious \u2014 the only queen in the room, the queen I\u2019d never be. But somehow, watching as she smiled humbly at the crowd of men in suits around her, I didn\u2019t mind.An earlier version of this article included outdated information about Osmel Sousa, former director of the Miss Venezuela Organization.

{"Headline": "9 Things to Know About Jerusalem as U.S. Embassy Opens", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The historic opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem on Monday seals the Trump administration\u2019s recognition of the holy, and hotly contested, city as the capital of Israel.For many Jewish Israelis, the move is a long overdue expression of reality in the city. But the recognition upends decades of American foreign policy and an international consensus that holds that it prejudges negotiations over the final status of the city. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem, with its holy sites sacred to Christians, Muslims and Jews, as the capital of a future Palestinian state and vehemently oppose the American decision.The Talmud teaches that \u201c10 measures of beauty were given to the world; Jerusalem received nine while the rest of the world received one.\u201dEarthly Jerusalem is complicated. Here are nine things worth knowing about the city.Tel Aviv was the first seat of government for the embryonic State of Israel.Under the United Nations partition plan of 1947 to create a Jewish state and an Arab state from Mandatory Palestine, Jerusalem, with its holy sites, was designated as a \u201ccorpus separatum\u201d \u2014 a separate, international entity under the auspices of the United Nations. Zionist forces conquered West Jerusalem during the 1948 war, after five Arab armies attacked the newly declared state. The Arab, eastern part of the city came under Jordanian control.West Jerusalem, which had been under siege during the hostilities, was not set up to serve as a capital and remained a relative backwater. There was no mention of Jerusalem in the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel signed by the state\u2019s founders on May 14, 1948, in the old Tel Aviv Museum.A report issued on Sunday by Israel\u2019s state comptroller, the government watchdog, chided the government for failing to carry out its own development plans going back to 2005 to strengthen Jerusalem.One goal was moving about 140 branches of 25 government ministries and offices to Jerusalem, along with their 2,700 employees. These include branches of the prime minister\u2019s office and the ministries of health, finance, transportation, culture and sports, education and welfare. The decision was made 11 years ago.A 2015 deadline for the move was missed and reset for 2019. The state comptroller, Yosef Shapira, a retired judge, said that, too, was unlikely to be met.\u201cIn order to bring about a significant change in the status of Jerusalem, it is not enough to make solemn declarations, but actions must be taken,\u201d Mr. Shapira wrote.The report was released to mark the 51st anniversary, according to the Hebrew calendar, of Israel\u2019s capture of East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war.Jerusalem, the largest city in Israel, has a population of close to 900,000, about 10 percent of the total number of residents of Israel, according to the latest figures released by the national Central Bureau of Statistics.Jews make up 62.3 percent of the city\u2019s population, down from 69.5 percent 20 years ago. The Palestinian population has grown to 37.7 percent from 30.5 percent in 1998.Still, experts say Jews have been the largest religious group in the city for the last 150 years. Given the high birthrate among strictly Orthodox Jews, the character of Jewish Jerusalem is changing.Of 77,000 pupils in the city\u2019s Hebrew-language elementary schools, about 50,000 are now studying in the ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, system, which is ambivalent, at best, about Zionism. About 14,000 study in modern Zionist Orthodox schools. Only about 13,000 study in secular schools.After Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 war, it vastly expanded the city boundaries and set about building huge Jewish housing developments in the newly won territory, which most of the world considers occupied. About 200,000 Israeli Jews now live in those neighborhoods, or settlements, among at least 320,000 Palestinians.The vast majority of East Jerusalem\u2019s Palestinian inhabitants are permanent residents of Israel, can work anywhere in the country and are eligible for Israeli social benefits. But they are not full citizens of Israel.While the Palestinian residents may apply for citizenship, few do for political reasons and even fewer are approved.The day after the United States Embassy opens in Jerusalem, Palestinians will mark the 70th anniversary of what they call the Nakba, or the catastrophe, of 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in what is now Israel and became refugees.By the end of 1949, about 40 Palestinian villages in the Jerusalem area, with a total population of more than 70,000, were emptied of their inhabitants. About 45,000 Palestinians lost their homes in urban areas on the west side of the city, according to the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s Negotiations Affairs Department.\u201cWe are still living that Nakba,\u201d said Fuad Hallaq, the department\u2019s Jerusalem adviser, during a recent tour of the area around the new embassy.About 76 percent of the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem live below the poverty line compared with about 23 percent of Jewish residents. In the Arab neighborhoods, the average monthly income is 40 percent lower per person than in the Jewish neighborhoods of the city.According to a study by Israel Kimchi of the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Studies, the churches in Jerusalem hold some 5,000 dunams (approximately 1,235 acres) of land in prime areas of the city, including in the so-called Holy Basin around the Old City and in prestigious neighborhoods like Rehavia, Nayot and Talbieh.Deals were made to transfer the rights to the land where the Israeli Parliament and the president\u2019s official residence are, but according to Mr. Ramon, the researcher, part of Parliament\u2019s grounds may still be church property.In recent years, he said, private promoters and companies have managed to buy land, or lease rights for an additional 200 years, from Christian bodies, particularly the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, leading to some uncertainty in the real estate market.For a period in the 1960s and \u201970s, about 18 foreign embassies were in Jerusalem, mostly representing African and Latin American countries. El Salvador and Costa Rica were the last of the group to leave the city, in 2006, reopening their embassies in Tel Aviv. Now, Guatemala, which moved to the Tel Aviv area in 1980, when Israel passed a law formalizing the unification of Jerusalem and effectively annexing the eastern part, is relocating to Jerusalem on Wednesday. Several other countries have announced their intention to move back.In December, Israel\u2019s minister for transportation, Israel Katz, said he wanted to put Mr. Trump\u2019s name on a proposed new train station in the Old City.Myra Noveck contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oxford Lifts the Veil on Race, Wealth and Privilege", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The 19th-century poet Matthew Arnold spoke of its \u201cdreaming spires.\u201d The honeyed stonework of its colleges has drawn the global elite of learning to its quadrangles and tranquillity, as have Ivy League universities.Yet the University of Oxford has long been roiled by questions of race, inequality and privilege swirling through British society, from the mean city streets and neglected social housing projects to the glittery, obsessively chronicled romances and rigmarole of the royal family.For some, the figures showed only halting progress: About 3 percent of the British population is black, according to the most recent census, but only 1.9 percent of the roughly 3,200 students admitted to Oxford in 2017 identified as black Britons.That was an increase of less than a percentage point from 2013, when 1.1 percent of British undergraduates at Oxford identified as black, a subset of what the university called \u201cblack and minority ethnic\u201d students, including those of Asian and mixed heritage, whose share of admissions rose to 17.9 percent last year, from 13.9 percent in 2013.David Lammy, a Labour lawmaker and former education minister who has campaigned against what he has called \u201csocial apartheid\u201d at Oxford, said the latest figures showed that the university was \u201can institution defined by entrenched privilege that is the preserve of wealthy white students from London and the Southeast.\u201dThe statistics do offer some startling insights: In a breakdown of undergraduate admissions to the 29 individual colleges that form the backbone of Oxford\u2019s academic structure, eight \u2014 including some of the most prestigious \u2014 failed to admit a single black Briton in one or more of the years from 2015 to 2017.That appeared to compound other inequalities, such as the preponderance of students from fee-paying private schools \u2014 known in Britain as public schools \u2014 in the south of England among the annual intake of more than 3,200 undergraduates. And among the slowly increasing number of successful applicants from state schools, the statistics were skewed because they did not show how many undergraduates had been educated at state-financed grammar schools, which have selective entrance criteria.Oxford\u2019s intake displayed a geographic imbalance between the north of Britain and the more affluent south, where the bulk of national wealth is concentrated.\u201cOxford reflects the inequalities \u2014 socio-economic, ethnic and regional \u2014 that exist in British society,\u201d Louise Richardson, the university\u2019s vice chancellor, said in a foreword to the report.\u201cThe picture that emerges,\u201d she said, \u201cis of a university which is changing: evolving fast for an institution of its age and standing, but perhaps too slowly to meet public expectations. It is a picture of progress on a great many fronts, but with work remaining to be done.\u201dIn a section titled Key Points, the report focused on progress in admissions, including \u201cmore women admitted than men in 2017\u201d and higher proportions of undergraduate admissions among groups that were traditionally disadvantaged.Yet, according to the Cherwell article, \u201c17 of the top 20 schools for Oxford admissions in 2017 are fee-paying, while the other three are prestigious grammar schools.\u201d Additionally, the newspaper said, state-educated students tended to apply to the most oversubscribed subjects, lowering their prospects, while applicants from private schools tended to apply to less sought-after courses, such as classics or modern languages.At the heart of the debate is a perceived contest between demographics and academic excellence. Critics such as Mr. Lammy, the Labour lawmaker, argue that a student from a low-income area who gets good grades on the national A-level exams at the end of high school \u201cis more talented than their contemporary with the same grades\u201d at a top fee-paying school such as Eton or Harrow. \u201cAnd all the academic evidence shows that they far outshine their peers at university, too,\u201d he said.In an effort to help disadvantaged applicants, Oxford announced on Wednesday that it would increase to 1,350, from 850, the number of would-be undergraduates it admits to one-week summer courses to help them apply.The debate in Britain seems more passionate than those in Germany and Italy. In France, however, diversity in higher education is an issue in the so-called grandes \u00e9coles \u2014 highly selective schools that train the country\u2019s top civil servants, politicians, business leaders and engineers.While France does not practice affirmative action based on race, some schools have put in place admission programs that target young people from disenfranchised and poorer neighborhoods, which often have higher concentrations of immigrants.But President Emmanuel Macron has resisted proposals to create a separate academy to offer students from poor neighborhoods an education matching that of the elite institution currently training top administrators, which has been criticized for lacking diversity.Rather, the French leader announced measures to focus on helping students secure internships or apprenticeships and on combating discrimination in the jobs market.Reporting was contributed by Aurelien Breeden from Paris, Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome, and Melissa Eddy and Christopher F.

One way to put the nominal mortgage rate in context is to adjust for inflation. Subtracting April\u2019s inflation rate of 2.5 percent from the current mortgage rate gives a \u201creal\u201d mortgage rate of around 2.1 percent. That compares with the average real rate of 2.25 percent for the past seven years. The mortgage rate would need to rise 0.15 percentage point to reach that level.Another exercise is to compare the current mortgage with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The difference between the two interest rates on Thursday was 1.5 percentage points, which is smaller than the seven-year average of 1.72 percentage points. Trading at that \u201cspread\u201d would push the current mortgage rate 0.22 percentage point higher to 4.83 percent.Economists expect the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to keep rising, to 3.24 percent in December, according to estimates compiled by The Wall Street Journal.Adding the average seven-year spread of 1.72 percentage points to that forecast gets the mortgage rate within spitting distance of 5 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisBoth sides claimed a victory of sorts, but only one thing was clear: They will all be spending a lot of time in court.Ms. Brennan has resisted doing so, pointing out that the rate the Postal Service charges Amazon and others is bound by contracts, the Washington Post writes.ContextMany have pushed back against Mr. Trump\u2019s comments.

{"Headline": "6 Takeaways From Tuesday\u2019s Primary Elections", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrimary elections in four Republican-leaning states rattled Congress on Tuesday night, as voters ejected a sitting member of the House and set up intense campaigns for the Senate in several battlegrounds.Voters nearly always dislike Congress, but Tuesday was a vivid illustration of just how toxic the taint of Washington may be in 2018.The night was a near-wipeout for members of the House seeking higher office. Three Republican lawmakers lost campaigns for the Senate: Luke Messer and Todd Rokita in Indiana, and Evan Jenkins in West Virginia. A fourth, James B. Renacci of Ohio, won the Senate nomination but drew less than half the primary vote despite facing relatively unknown opponents and campaigning with President Trump\u2019s loud support.A populist-oriented swing state that Mr. Trump won easily in 2016, Ohio could have been welcoming ground for fiery rebels on the left and the right. But Trumpian politics fizzled in several important primaries, and voters chose a thoroughly conventional pair of candidates for governor in Mike DeWine, a Republican, and Richard Cordray, a Democrat.But the failure of insurgents in both parties may signal that this quintessential Midwestern swing state has not yet been remade in the president\u2019s image.Senator Manchin, a conservative-leaning Democrat, has led a relatively charmed political life, twice winning races for governor and for the seat he holds now. But West Virginia continues to drift from its New Deal Democrat roots, and Mr. Manchin may face the most difficult race of his career.Also worrisome for Mr. Manchin were the number of Democratic voters who supported his primary opponent, who ran a nominal campaign. He lost about 30 percent of the vote and did even worse in some of the state\u2019s coal counties, which are full of the sort of ancestral Democrats he will need to hold onto in November.Voters seemed to listen: The controversial coal baron finished third in what was largely a three-person race, taking just 20 percent of the vote.Less immediately consequential, but still significant, was the role Democrats played in the state\u2019s Republican primary, as a liberal super PAC linked to Washington strategists aggressively attacked Representative Jenkins. They feared that the Democrat-turned-Republican with a base in the state\u2019s coal counties would be the strongest candidate against Mr. Manchin, and they wound up helping lift Mr. Morrisey to the nomination.When Mr. Trump won the presidency, the Republican Party was fractured and important conservative leaders still opposed him. On Tuesday, not one Trump critic won a Republican primary. The major Republican candidates cast themselves as Trump allies and in some cases explicitly invoked him as a role model.In Indiana, Mike Braun, a wealthy former state legislator, won the Republican Senate primary by branding himself as a Trump-like businessman and outsider. In Ohio, Mr. Renacci won the Senate primary with Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement. And Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to Mr. Blankenship in West Virginia may have helped doom him.Even the more traditional Republicans mimicked Mr. Trump: Mr. DeWine\u2019s campaign accused his primary opponent, Mary Taylor, of failing to back the president sufficiently in 2016. At one point, while attacking Ms. Taylor\u2019s ethics, the DeWine camp tweeted #LockHerUp.And Ms. Taylor, Ohio\u2019s lieutenant governor, attempted political contortions to campaign as a Trump loyalist without disavowing the current governor, John Kasich, a Republican who is a fierce Trump critic.Republicans may be more careful about embracing Mr. Trump in bluer states. So far, though, they are assembling a 2018 slate tied closely to him in every important race.Advertisement"}

In the span of less than 24 hours, he spoke with Fox News, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Hill and ABC News.In doing so, he appears to have created two new legal problems for his client, President Trump.First \u2014 although it\u2019s received less attention than the Stormy Daniels payment \u2014 Giuliani added to the already strong evidence that Trump has obstructed justice. Trump has offered conflicting explanations for why he fired James Comey, the former F.B.I. director.

When those in power fail to lead, brave Americans show us how the abuses hidden from public view can be obdurately dragged out of the shadows and exposed.Johnston Regional Airport is such an effective and exemplary target because it seems to be a modest and inoffensive place to those who pass its gates. My wife and I often drove by it for years without once suspecting that behind those discreet, unexceptional fences men had been kidnapped, blindfolded, shackled, humiliated, stripped, diapered, held without charges and thrown into a plane that would take them to clandestine prisons thousands of miles away where they would endure unspeakable pain.It is that veil of secrecy that the North Carolina activists want to tear down by continuously reaching out to people of faith, military veterans, youth, civil libertarians, academics and community groups, asking them to take action.They hope also to educate the public through protests at the airport and petition drives, the hosting of national and international expert speakers and the publication of op-eds and letters to the editor.Most notably, they have met dozens of times with elected county, state and federal officials, demanding that authorities acknowledge publicly North Carolina\u2019s role in these abductions and the specific individuals who have been harmed.Above all they want the state to investigate Aero Contractors\u2019 role in specific renditions. Thus far, according to Christina Cowger, the coordinator of \u201cNorth Carolina Stop Torture Now,\u201d \u201cmost elected N.C. officials have instead engaged in denial and buck-passing.\u201d Some have even spoken of Aero Contractors as \u201cgood corporate citizens.\u201d Nevertheless, the activists are undaunted and promise to keep demanding accountability.At a time when the United States is overflowing with initiatives aimed at remembering a painful and unfair past \u2014 marking the places where lynchings occurred, where native lands were usurped, where Japanese-Americans were interned \u2014 installing some sort of monument at places like the Johnston Regional Airport would help to remind Americans of the suffering inflicted in their name at an ordinary place that is not remote from their everyday lives.Such a memorialization does not depend on whether or not Ms. Haspel is confirmed as the head of the C.I.A. In front of the airport used by her agency to commit crimes against humanity, there should exist lasting proof of what transpired on those grounds, a challenge to Americans to never let it happen again.Ariel Dorfman, an emeritus professor of literature at Duke University, is the author of the play, \u201cDeath and the Maiden\u201d and the novel \u201cDarwin\u2019s Ghosts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Single-Payer Health Care in California: Here\u2019s What It Would Take", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf wholesale opposition to President Trump is one litmus test for progressive Democrats, another \u2014 as the governor\u2019s race in California is proving \u2014 is health care.All the leading Democratic contenders in the June 5 primary have pledged support for a single-payer system run by the state. The front-runner, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco, has made it the centerpiece of his campaign.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to wait around on universal health care and single-payer in California,\u201d he has declared.\u201cVoters are thinking about the fundamental values associated with single-payer,\u201d said Kelly Hall, an independent health consultant who works with the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers in California, which has endorsed Mr. Newsom. \u201cAlmost zero voters have thought about the policy implications.\u201dIn this case, \u201cimplications\u201d could be another word for booby traps. Even a state as big, wealthy and liberal as California \u2014 with the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and nearly 40 million people \u2014 would find itself hamstrung by money, a legal and regulatory thicket, and highly motivated opposition.Visionary thinking is needed to create an independent, state-run system that\u2019s responsible for every resident\u2019s health care and prescription drugs \u2014 but so is getting the authority, financing and political support.Any state trying a go-it-alone strategy will face challenges possibly more vexing than the ones Congress would confront in passing a nationwide law.To redirect Medicare funds, California would require a federal waiver \u2014 something unlikely to be granted by any administration.Medicare is popular, and federal officials are unlikely to allow a state to engineer a wholesale Medicare takeover. Californians might not be too happy, either. Once California \u2014 and not the federal government \u2014 were to be the single payer, then the current Medicare program would no longer be an option. If would be replaced by a new California version.A bigger stumbling block comes from employer plans, which cover roughly 43 percent of Californians. Federal law, in effect, prohibits states and localities from dictating how private employers that self-insure should structure their plans. So employers unwilling to take part in a California-run insurance system wouldn\u2019t have to.Officials could try to persuade them by offering cheaper coverage and fewer administrative headaches. But if, say, Google and Disney want to stick with the coverage they have, they can. Changing that law would require an act of Congress.Let\u2019s, for the moment, magically eliminate the legal and regulatory roadblocks: Poof! California transfers its share of Medicaid and Medicare money to its own single-payer system, and it convinces every private employer to drop its existing coverage and join.Broader health coverage could also help reduce pricey emergency-room visits and improve preventive care, which could head off more serious illnesses and higher costs down the road.About half that sum could come from existing Medicare and Medicaid dollars, according to the analysis. What employees and employers currently spend would cover another $100 billion to $150 billion. But the remaining $50 billion to $100 billion would require new taxes \u2014 such as a 15 percent payroll tax on earned income.Ardent proponents, like the California Nurses Association, are undeterred. \u201cIt really is about the political will,\u201d said Catherine Kennedy, a longtime nurse who lives in Carmichael, outside of Sacramento. \u201cWe can find the money.\u201d\u201cI do support a single-payer system,\u201d said Steven Cohen, a retired engineer, who lives with his wife, Terri, a retired schoolteacher, in Valencia. Even though he is on Medicare, Mr. Cohen, 71, said a recent switch in his medication for rheumatoid arthritis caused his out-of-pocket drug costs to rise sharply. The insurance and pharmaceutical industries now have too much clout, he said.When asked if he would still support single-payer if it meant higher taxes, however, Mr. Cohen said no: \u201cRaising taxes to offset the cost of health insurance is not the best approach.\u201d And he is unwilling to trade his Medicare coverage for a state-based version, \u201cunless it changes for the better.\u201dOf course, changing the message \u2014 and the details \u2014 can similarly drum up support, or flop those who previously flipped, but the variability shows how quickly voters can turn.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the organization that conducted a survey on public attitudes toward a single-payer national health plan. It was the Kaiser Family Foundation, not Kaiser Permanente. The earlier version also misstated an estimate of the cost of a proposed California bill that would offer free medical care for every resident. It was $331 billion, not $331 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Uncertainty Lingers, Italy\u2019s Populists May Give Talks Another Shot", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNor was the fact that Mr. Mattarella had only days ago called on Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund official and spending hawk, to form a technical government to guide Italy to a new election.Mr. Cottarelli, who is unlikely to win a confidence vote in Parliament, had informal morning and afternoon meetings with Mr. Mattarella in the Quirinal Palace. But instead of presenting a list of cabinet picks, he apparently decided to hold off to see if the parties that won a majority of the votes in elections in March could find a way out of their impasse, according to the Italian news agency ANSA late Tuesday night.The developments for which Mr. Cottarelli was waiting were still developing Wednesday afternoon, but they seemed to reflect a significant shift of power within the populist alliance.Nevertheless, he met with Mr. Mattarella, the president he had only days earlier called responsible for the darkest night in Italian democracy.In one of his now regularly scheduled Facebook Live video streams after the meeting, Mr. Di Maio proposed that Paolo Savona, the eurosceptic economist whom Mr. Mattarella found objectionable as finance minister, take on another position in the cabinet and that an unidentified new choice \u201cof the same caliber\u201d take the position of finance minister.He said that his party was on board with this solution, and \u201cnow it depends on the other political force,\u201d meaning the League. \u201cIf they are O.K. with it,\u201d he said, the alliance would ask Mr. Mattarella to allow their alliance\u2019s original choice for prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, to try to form a government.With his support skyrocketing over the course of the more than 85 days of negotiations, he continued to call for new elections as he hit the campaign trail in Pisa, Genoa and other Italian cities on Wednesday, assuring his supporters that one way or another, the League would end up in the government.But simultaneous negotiations with the Five Star Movement seemed to center on a top official in his party, Giancarlo Giorgetti, taking the position of prime minister. Some analysts speculated that Mr. Salvini coveted the position himself, and that he had the leverage of Mr. Savona, and his own popularity, to force the Five Star leadership to accept.The Five Star Movement, reluctant to give up its primacy in the alliance, after winning nearly a third of the Italian vote, is resisting, according to reports in the Italian press. And Mr. Mattarella, who is very much an audience of one for all of the political performances, would also have to sign off.The very notion of a government taking power in Italy seemed to assure the markets after Italian bonds, especially short-term ones, plummeted in the markets. The fears of new elections leading to an exit from the euro prompted the most significant dip in two-year yields in more than 20 years.Central to the populists\u2019 case for receiving a mandate from Mr. Mattarella is their assertion that they never wanted to leave the euro. \u201cIf the markets fear that Italy leave the euro, it\u2019s because someone put around that rumor that this government wanted to leave the euro, but our will was never that,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said Tuesday night. \u201cWe have never conspired to leave the euro, never!\u201d he said in his Facebook post.But the internet is rife with examples of Mr. Di Maio, his party\u2019s co-founder Beppe Grillo, and other top Five Star officials calling either for a referendum on the euro or for leaving the currency outright.In one video, a dejected young Italian looks sadly at the euro in his hand and tosses it into a fountain. He then imagines all the buying power he\u2019d have with a 1,000 lire bill. Then the camera focuses on high-heeled boots moving toward him on the cobblestones, and scans up to reveal a top Five Star official, Paola Taverna, appearing like a fairy godmother. She turns the euro in his hand into that 1,000 lire bill, and tells him that the Five Star Movement can make his dreams come true and it is \u201cpossible to leave the euro.\u201d A thousand lira would be valued at a fraction of a euro.Mr. Salvini said this week that neither he, nor his pick for finance minister, wanted to leave the euro. But in prior interviews, Mr. Salvini has clearly stated he wanted Italy out of the euro and has even failed to rule out leaving the European Union.In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Salvini said: \u201cLeave the euro? Surely yes. Tomorrow morning. Once the monetary sovereignty is retaken, one can make a last attempt to renegotiate all of the treaties, Maastricht, Schengen, Dublin and Lisbon.\u201d Those treaties are the lifeblood of the European Union.Amid a remarkably fluid and high-stakes situation, Italian analysts contemplated a variety of outcomes. Anything seemed possible for the moment, and if Mr. Mattarella decided that the country should go to new elections, either this summer or in early fall, it was not clear what the alliances would be.If Five Star and the League entered into new elections as an alliance and vowed not to leave the euro, which is still relatively popular in Italy, they were nearly assured a landslide victory.The League would also have the flexibility to reunite with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in the center-right coalition with which it ran in March, but this time its nearly 30 percent of the vote, according to recent polls, would make it the undisputed leader of that alliance.Speaking at one of his many campaign events across Italy on Wednesday, Mr. Salvini told an adoring crowd, \u201cMy patience is at the limit.\u201d He was not alone.Advertisement"}

One reason may be to assuage lawmakers who do not favor making concessions on ZTE to China. As Shawn Donnan of the FT wrote:Another possible reason for re-introducing the $50 billion of tariffs: China is not giving as much ground as the Trump administration wants on a wide range of trade issues. By rolling out the threat again, the U.S. may hope to extract more concessions in negotiations before they wrap up.This appears to be the first time the administration has set itself some sort of deadline for imposing the tariffs against China.Imagine it is the second half of June and China has not agreed to significant, concrete concessions. Mr. Trump could choose to impose the tariffs, an unmistakably hostile act that would mark the beginnings of a trade war with China, which has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs.So far, the public has not been able to tell what the Trump administration really wants. In two weeks, that may be possible.\u2014 Peter EavisThe $66 billion union of the two can move forward, after the department imposed what it called the biggest-ever divestiture of assets for a merger approval.What\u2019s notable about the announcements is that they fall in line with the antitrust philosophy of Makan Delrahim, the department\u2019s antitrust chief. They emphasize \u201cstructural\u201d changes to the company \u2014 as in sales of businesses \u2014 rather than \u201cbehavioral\u201d remedies, in which companies agree to change their conduct.To Mr. Delrahim\u2019s mind, the behavioral approach, which was used in Comcast\u2019s takeover of NBCUniversal, makes the Justice Department an ongoing regulator. That\u2019s something that he has said the department would not do.What Mr. Delrahim said of Tuesday\u2019s agreement:\u201cThis comprehensive structural solution to significant horizontal and vertical competition concerns\u2014the largest merger divestiture ever required by the United States\u2014preserves competition in the sale of these critical agricultural products and protects American farmers and consumers,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. \u201cWe commend the parties for working with the Antitrust Division to resolve our concerns on behalf of American consumers.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedHis suggested fix for the refugee crisis: no defined quotas for the numbers of immigrants that nations should accept, and an E.U.-led \u201cMarshall Plan for Africa\u201d that would help African governments to provide education and employment for citizens so as to reduce emigration.But that runs counter to the E.U.\u2019s current austerity drive, so Mr. Soros also suggests a way to help it spend more:Without going into the details, I want to point out that the proposal contains an ingenious device, a special-purpose vehicle, that would enable the E.U. to tap financial markets at a very advantageous rate without incurring a direct obligation for itself or for its member states; it also offers considerable accounting benefits. Moreover, although it is an innovative idea, it has already been used successfully in other contexts, namely general-revenue municipal bonds in the US and so-called surge funding to combat infectious diseases.Finally, to keep nations like Britain from leaving the E.U., Soros argues that the bloc must restyle itself as a club that it\u2019s attractive to belong to:Such a Europe would differ from the current arrangements in two key respects. First, it would clearly distinguish between the EU and the eurozone. Second, it would recognize that the euro has many unsolved problems, which must not be allowed to destroy the European project.All this, Mr. Soros argues, could create a union where countries are both able to assert their sovereignty while also collaborating on joint goals more effectively.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation\u2019s government says it may ban the social network for an entire month, and authorities around the world will be watching to see how the experiment plays out.But with governments in America, Europe, and the rest of the world all struggling to work out how to police the social network, the results could prove fascinating \u2014 and postnatally influential \u2014 around the world.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeMaking smartphones that do more might not necessarily encourage people to buy a new one. But it could nevertheless help Apple become the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar company.People already use their iPhone to download new apps, pay for things, subscribe to music and video services, and more \u2014 and Apple takes a small but important slice of those software purchases, payments and subscriptions (though, in the final case, only if they're bought through the app store.)The company also makes a healthy revenue from its own services, such as Apple Music and iCloud. In total, the FT notes, Apple\u2019s revenue from these kinds of services has doubled in four years, and Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, hopes that the company will generate $50 billion per year from them by the end of 2020.Fast forward to the next iPhone, due out later this year. We don\u2019t yet know what it will do, but it sounds like it could help you swipe your way into the office. It might have extra augmented reality features, which could, for instance, power new kinds of online shopping. Improved processors could help it perform more complicated artificial intelligence tasks that new apps could make use of to automate your workday tasks. Some of those advances would likely also give rise to new software features that might trickle down into current top-of-the-range iPhones.Would those features make people head out to upgrade their phone? Perhaps. Would they allow both in-house and third-party developers to build new services that Apple can skim money off of?

Some, including Facebook and Google, have included implicit bias training.

{"Headline": "John McCain Isn\u2019t Ready to Wave a White Flag Just Yet", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain wasn\u2019t interested in getting the last word on his decades at the center of American political life. He was interested in getting thousands of them.In a new 380-page memoir written as he confronts brain cancer and his mortality, the occasionally ornery maverick Republican from Arizona looks back on a series of major episodes from both his own history and the United States\u2019.He recounts his presidential runs, his leading roles in fights over immigration, campaign finance, health care and foreign policy. He takes a few shots at President Trump, talk radio \u201cblowhards\u201d and House backbenchers. He says he would like Americans to \u201crecover our sense that we are more alike than different.\u201dTrue to his nature, John McCain is not one to go quietly.\u201cIt should be required reading for anyone who wants to lead in a democracy,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and Mr. McCain\u2019s best friend in the Senate. He sees the book as a call to arms around the idea that \u201cAmerica\u2019s values make us better than our enemies.\u201dMr. Graham visited Mr. McCain on Tuesday in Arizona, where they watched their favorite western, one that features an idealistic senator: \u201cThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\u201d Mr. Graham found Mr. McCain upbeat and gaining strength.\u201cI hope he has another run in him,\u201d said Mr. Graham, reflecting a sentiment shared widely in Washington.Written with his frequent collaborator Mark Salter, a former aide and longtime adviser of Mr. McCain\u2019s, the book is titled, \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d in a nod to the long naval tradition of the McCain family.It is reminiscent of the 2009 valedictory \u201cTrue Compass,\u201d written by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who died of cancer shortly before its publication. The form of glioblastoma that claimed Mr. Kennedy and is now putting Mr. McCain in peril is just another of the ties between two larger-than-life figures in a Senate that has fewer and fewer of them.In the pages of his memoir, Mr. McCain doesn\u2019t surrender to the disease, but he clearly accepts that his time may be short.\u201cLike my friend Ted, I might have fought my last immigration battle,\u201d Mr. McCain writes, noting that though he sponsored a new measure with a Democratic colleague, \u201cI\u2019m not as sure that I\u2019ve sufficient time left to see it all the way through. That, alas, isn\u2019t my call to make.\u201dOne question arising from Mr. McCain\u2019s illness and his extended absence from Washington is what will become of the Senate with fewer members with the force of personality, political standing and will to bring increasingly polarized lawmakers together on major issues?Mr. McCain notes in his book that Mr. Kennedy \u201cgave value no other senator had\u201d when developing legislation because of his outsize influence on Democrats and his overall level of respect in the institution.Mr. McCain achieved that stature, as well, as one of the few senators able to command the attention of members of both parties on big topics.Casting about the Senate, it is hard to identify others who today hold similar potential to move colleagues away from hardened positions. Mr. McCain might not always triumph, but he knew how to force the issue on subjects many in the chamber would just as soon avoid for political reasons.But even Mr. McCain struggled with the new tribal politics, tempering some of his more moderate instincts when he faced challenges from the right in his recent re-election campaigns.It is only now, with no more campaigns ahead of him, that he is truly liberated from conventional political considerations. \u201cI\u2019m freer than colleagues who will face the voters again,\u201d he says in the book. \u201cI can speak my mind without fearing the consequence much. And I can vote my conscience without worry.\u201dDays later, he cast a dramatic post-midnight, thumbs-down vote that blocked a desperate effort to deliver on a major Republican campaign promise by overturning the health care law.\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel that dramatic to me at the time,\u201d Mr. McCain says. He admits to feeling bad about disappointing his fellow Republicans. \u201cIt was a hard vote that I didn\u2019t make easily, but not one I would hesitate to make again.\u201dIt was at its heart a vote for a return to what\u2019s known in Congress as \u201cregular order,\u201d a less partisan, more civil and results-driven process during which lawmakers from both parties cooperate to produce a consensus product. Mr. McCain notes gleefully in the book that he was once attacked by an opponent as a \u201cchampion of compromise.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re damn right, I\u2019m a champion of compromise in the governance of a country of 325 million opinionated, quarrelsome, vociferous souls,\u201d he writes. \u201cThere is no other way to govern an open society, or more precisely, to govern it effectively.\u201dMr. McCain, who has an explosive temper, has long been one of the more prickly members of the Senate. But as in his relationship with Mr. Kennedy, he was usually able to put aside hard feelings. For instance, he enjoyed multiple nasty exchanges over the years with Harry Reid of Nevada, the former Democratic leader, but says, \u201cI could never quite sustain a permanent dislike for the guy.\u201d As for Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, Mr. McCain said reports of friction between them are overblown (though Mr. McConnell did take his fight against his colleague\u2019s signature campaign finance law to the Supreme Court).Mr. McCain doesn\u2019t seek sympathy and says he hopes those who mourn his passing, \u201cand even those who don\u2019t,\u201d should lead \u201clives as lucky as mine.\u201dMost of Mr. McCain\u2019s Senate colleagues consider themselves lucky to have shared their service with him and worry about the consequences of the loss of such a unique political figure.Advertisement"}

In the latest attack, on government offices in the eastern city of Jalalabad on Sunday, at least 12 people were said to have been killed.In Zabul Province, also in the south, a week of heavy fighting left 70 police officers dead, local officials said. In Farah Province, in the west, at least 15 officers were killed in four recent attacks, according to provincial officials. And in the northern province of Baghlan, a senior security official said that at least 44 soldiers and police officers were killed last week when insurgents seized control of a district government compound.The fighting in Jalalabad, in Nangahar Province, continued late into Sunday, with an additional 42 people wounded, according to Attaullah Khogyani, the spokesman for the governor. He said the fighting ended when police officers killed the last of five gunmen who had holed up in the office of the province\u2019s finance director; a sixth assailant had died earlier when he detonated explosives in the car he was driving. Mr. Khogyani added that the government building had caught on fire during the fighting.The provincial finance director, Abdullah Raqibi, was not in his office at the time of the attack, officials said.In Helmand, Maj. Abdul Qadir Bahadurzai, a spokesman for the Afghan National Army\u2019s 215th Corps there, said that one of its Mi-17s, a Russian-made military helicopter, made a forced landing because of technical problems early Sunday in the district of Nahri Saraj. He said that all of those on board had been rescued by another helicopter. The Mi-17 is generally used as a troop transport by the Afghan Army.A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, claimed the insurgents had shot the helicopter down, killing many of the Afghan Special Forces soldiers who the Taliban said were aboard. Mr. Mujahid posted what we he said was a video of the crash on his Twitter account.In Zabul Province in southern Afghanistan, Taliban insurgents overran four police outposts on Friday, killing 20 officers, according to Atta Jan Haqbayan, head of the provincial council. The insurgents remained in control of the bases they had captured, he said. That brought to 70 the number of officers killed in the past week in at least four districts across Zabul, Mr. Haqbayan said. He added that 80 insurgents were believed to have been killed as well.In Farah Province, in western Afghanistan, insurgents mounted at least four separate attacks on police outposts on Thursday, killing 18 officers and wounding many others, said Dadullah Qani, a member of the provincial council there. Nasir Ahmad Mehri, a spokesman for the provincial governor, put the number of police officers killed in the fighting at 15.Details of the attacks in Zabul and Farah were confirmed only on Sunday.A senior security official in Baghlan Province said that the Tala Wa Barfak fight had cost the lives of 44 Afghan soldiers and police officers, with another 36 soldiers and officers listed as missing, out of a total of 150 who had been trying to defend the area. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because his account contradicted the government\u2019s version.Officially, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Radmanish, said 10 soldiers had been killed in Tala Wa Barfak, adding that government forces would soon retake the district. \u201cWe are working to fix the roads,\u201d he said. \u201cThe enemy dug tunnels and ditches on the roads to Tala Wa Barfak so that our vehicles cannot cross. Once we fix those roads we will take back that district, too.\u201dThe Afghan interior minister, Wais Ahmad Barmak, acknowledged in a recent news conference that Taliban offensives were underway in many parts of the country.He said the difficulty in responding was partly because of the season. \u201cSometimes, the bad weather causes problems for us, we can\u2019t deploy reinforcements and can\u2019t conduct airstrikes,\u201d Mr. Barmak said. \u201cWe have been fighting five or 10 terrorist groups, and now these groups are supported by several countries, so whether we like it or not, the graph of threats goes up.\u201dHe added that the government believed it had the conflict under control. \u201cWe are standing against them firmly and are fighting them off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a war situation.\u201dThat was not the view of many officials in beleaguered provinces around the country. Mr. Haqbayan of Zabul Province complained that the fighting there was so intense that the provincial police chief was briefly besieged by insurgents last week, who attacked a district he was visiting. \u201cIf the central government keeps ignoring Zabul Province the way they have been doing, the Taliban will get the upper hand in several more districts,\u201d Mr. Haqbayan said.Officials in Farah Province had a similar complaint and blamed their recent defeats on a lack of resources. Mr. Qani, the provincial council member, said it appeared that the Taliban had been diverting resources from Helmand to neighboring Farah, adding that the central government had not responded in kind.\u201cResidents of the province are worried about the security situation, which is getting worse day by day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lack of forces to fight against the Taliban, and also the foreign forces are not helping our Afghan forces any more.\u201dZabihullah Ghazi reported from Jalalabad and Rod Nordland from London.

The recordings now circulating have surfaced before, they said, but failed to incite the outrage that has now led to Mr. Patterson\u2019s removal.\u201cI\u2019ve known about them for years,\u201d said Rachael Denhollander, of Louisville, Ky., a Baptist who was the first woman to speak out publicly against Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, the former Michigan State University physician convicted of molesting members of the Olympics gymnastics team. \u201cBut it took this new climate and this kind of public pressure to make something happen, which is in itself disturbing.\u201dMr. Patterson is credited with orchestrating a takeover of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, from its centrist leadership in the 1980s, and pushing it to the right. Key elements of his platform were banning ordination for women and re-establishing traditional gender roles, including the teaching that wives should submit to their husbands.In late April, Mr. Patterson said in a statement that he regretted that the way he expressed his conviction that abused women should avoid divorce \u201chas brought hurt,\u201d but declined to apologize for the stance.\u201cI wish to apologize to every woman who has been wounded by anything I have said that was inappropriate or that lacked clarity,\u201d Mr. Patterson said in that statement.About 15 million people are part of the Southern Baptist Convention; proceeds from its 46,000 churches help finance six seminaries, including the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. Scholars of conservative Christianity cautioned against reading Mr. Patterson\u2019s abrupt retirement as a signal of a broader progressive shift.But the move, said Molly Worthen, a historian of religion at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, sends a message to young evangelicals that even one of the \u201ctitans of Southern Baptist patriarchy\u201d is not invulnerable to public pressure on gender issues.Mr. Patterson had been scheduled to deliver a high-profile sermon at the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s annual meeting next month in Dallas. It was not immediately clear whether he would still do so.\u201cThere is no triumph here,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis hard but necessary decision is a step toward the corporate repentance and healing needed in the S.B.C.

The video demonstrated how easy it is to use current technology to create powerful and persuasive lies, now also known as fake news.When this video magic is coupled with the ability of companies like Facebook to micro-target each of us and select the news we see, the implications for the future of our democracy seem dire. Fake news and microtargeting can be combined to create a kind of advertising that\u2019s like an evil version of Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, and we are being exposed to more of these pernicious morsels every year.But two lessons from the history of advertising suggest that the fake news phenomenon is likely to change significantly in the years to come. Prospects are gloomy for the near future, as this kind of advertising extends beyond politics. History also suggests, though, that the danger will probably recede over time as people grow accustomed to the ads, which will cease to work as effectively.First, in all likelihood, fake news will spread, despite efforts to rein it in. So far, most attention has focused on efforts to meddle in American elections. That is no small threat.Yet, based on the historical record, far more effort goes into persuading Americans to buy things than to elect politicians.We are already seeing technology being used to shade the truth in advertising that targets consumers.I did a Google search for \u201cbest inflatable kayak\u201d and was confronted by a blend of results that can be hard for a consumer to decipher. As expected, the choices that popped up included paid ads for kayaks that were being sold and some real reviews of kayaks. But there were also as a series of seemingly objective product-review sites that, on closer inspection, mainly contained product descriptions and links to buy items like kayaks from Amazon and other vendors.Such blurring of the distinctions between expert reviews and explicit ads provides a ripe circumstance for the rise of advertising that is less than totally transparent.The fake expert recommended that students try to refinance their loans, which was helpful to the business of LendEDU. Drew Cloud has disappeared, and LendEDU has apologized for its deception, but the problem is certain to continue.Expect to hear from the Drew Clouds of kayaks, mutual funds, laundry detergent and anything you might spend money on. Fake celebrity endorsements, altered product videos, bogus reviews and testimonials can\u2019t be far off.We have relied on the law to protect us from advertising fraud but, as we learned after the last election cycle, the more numerous and micro-targeted the ads become, the harder they are to monitor. That\u2019s a recipe for more trouble.Voters get lots of robocalls around election time, but the volume is modest compared with the number of calls about credit cards, vacation deals and loans.Given the trends, the future looks grim. But before abandoning hope, remember that the history of advertising also teaches that when people get used to ads, the ads stop working.As with special effects in movies, consumers become desensitized to ads the more they see them. The scary creatures from 1950s films, the shark in \u201cJaws\u201d or the spaceships from science-fiction movies of the 1990s now often look like jokes.That\u2019s why political consultants say straightforward TV ads no longer work. People tune them out.As technology develops, the same wearout effect is likely to occur with advertising based on fake news. As we are inundated with new, targeted, deceptive ads, we may get sick of them and, perhaps, stop finding them persuasive.

In the face of a challenge to European democratic values from Poland and Hungary, Brussels is naturally turning to money to get at least some leverage over the popular, populist governments there.The struggle at the heart of the European Union has infused what would normally be a humdrum moment in the life of its bureaucracy \u2014 the publishing of its proposed long-term budget on Wednesday \u2014 with novel importance.How the European Union disperses its money will be hashed out over months \u2014 debated, amended and approved by the leaders of the member states and by the European Parliament, too.But suddenly at stake in the tedium is whether the money that richer states transfer to poorer ones \u2014 long seen as a means of democratizing former dictatorships, like Portugal, Spain or Greece \u2014 is instead enabling new ones, namely in Poland and Hungary, among the top money-getters in the European Union.But both countries have been criticized for increasing state control over the news media and especially the judiciary, which goes to the heart of European commitments to freedom of the press, the rule of law and democratic transparency.The means to influence or punish member states for violations of European principles are very weak, however. Real censure is subject to veto, making it difficult for Brussels to challenge democratically elected leaders, even when their practices in office are suspect.So the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s bureaucracy, is considering tying new aid to the credibility of the judiciary in member states, on the principle that oversight of European Union spending must depend on the rule of law and independent judges.Such a change would attempt to skirt contentious judgments about \u201cvalues\u201d and instead shift the debate to sound financial management. Importantly, the finance rules work on a form of majority voting, eliminating the veto.Fines would be considered approved unless the European Council, made up of the heads of government, votes to repeal them.And even if those fines and aid reductions are passed, governments that are punished would still be liable to fulfill their budget obligations to fund agricultural and investment subsidies out of their own tax receipts.That all may be too clever to survive the long process of approval. And even if successful, it would not take effect until at least 2021. But it is an effort to hit countries that have flouted European values and norms in the pocketbook.All this is cresting because the European Union is beginning to debate its budget framework for 2021 through 2027, a budget that will have to deal with a significant reduction in funds given Britain\u2019s intention to leave the bloc and stop paying into its budget after a transition period that will end in December 2020. Currently, about 10 percent of the European Union\u2019s budget comes from Britain.That money reflects the bloc\u2019s extraordinary commitment to aiding the development of its newer and poorer members, measured by gross domestic product per capita. It is also important to those countries\u2019 growth and the popularity of their governments.Recipient countries argue that much of that money is spent on buying equipment and services from some net-contributor states, like Germany and France, and returns to them in the form of markets and profits.\u201cDon\u2019t try to suggest that the E.U. cohesion fund is a gift for central and eastern member states,\u201d he said here last year.There are expected to be other contentious proposals, too. The distribution of regional support would be based not just on national income per capita but on other indicators like youth unemployment and migration burdens.That is a clear effort to help older members like Italy and Greece that have borne the brunt of refugee and migrant flows, and other southern countries like Spain and Portugal, where youth unemployment is high.Cohesion funds for newer member states could be cut by as much as 6 percent to make room for these other kinds of aid.Get the Morning Briefing in your inbox. What you need to know to start your day, each weekday morning.Of course, the talk of cuts also comes in the context of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, along with its hefty contributions.Some countries, like France, Germany, Poland and Hungary, have said that they would increase their future contributions to Brussels to help make up for Britain\u2019s departure.Other countries, like the Netherlands, have said that they do not want to contribute more, but that the bloc\u2019s budget should absorb the loss of Britain by shrinking and becoming more efficient.But the commission itself is expected to propose a larger budget than the current one, and aim for an overall amount of 1.13 to 1.18 percent of the bloc\u2019s gross national income, compared with 1.03 percent when the current framework was approved.But the prevailing mood, led by the Commission vice president, Frans Timmermans, is that the challenge of Poland and Hungary cannot go unmet, and that other countries flirting with forms of \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d like Slovakia and the Czech Republic, should see consequences.In an unusually explicit Twitter thread after the Czech elections last autumn, Juho Romakkaniemi, the former head of the cabinet of another European Commission vice president, Jyrki Katainen, asked: \u201cHow long the other MS [member states] are willing to pay large sums for cohesion if it leads to divergence?\u201dMr. Romakkaniemi noted that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were among the highest net recipients of European Union funds, while their governments indulge in euroskeptic politics. \u201cMy fear is that the populistic path leads to divergence from the E.U. core values of freedom and Rule of Law \u2014 until a breaking point,\u201d he said.\u201cThis would be a very sad and dangerous development,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I can see big risks here. It is not too late to reconsider this path carefully.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could a Colonial-Era Golf Club Solve Hong Kong\u2019s Housing Woes?", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHong Kong JournalHONG KONG \u2014 The Hong Kong Golf Club is a 129-year-old enclave of privilege whose quiet fairways once catered to the city\u2019s British colonial rulers, but whose parking lot is now filled with the Teslas and Porsches of its wealthy Chinese elite.More recently, this sprawling golf club, with 54 holes, has become something else: the focal point of a raging, citywide debate about how to use Hong Kong\u2019s scarcest and most valuable resource, land.\u201cGolf is a plaything of the Brits,\u201d said Ng Cheuk-hang, 23, a spokesman for the Land Justice League, an activist group that wants the golf course redeveloped into low-rent public housing.\u201cIt\u2019s not a grass-roots sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sport for the people, and it creates a lot of social injustices.\u201dYoshihiro Nishi, 51, the president of the Hong Kong Golf Association, a group representing four private golf clubs in Hong Kong, thinks the activists are unnecessarily politicizing the issue.\u201cAll the members of the Hong Kong Golf Club understand the housing needs in Hong Kong,\u201d said Mr. Nishi, who works as a private banker by day. \u201cWe just want to make sure that we get to say what we want to say. Don\u2019t turn it into a little bit of fight between the haves and don\u2019t-haves.\u201dThe problem is that property prices in Hong Kong have soared to the highest levels in the world; blue-collar and middle-class families are priced out of the market. And so the city is searching everywhere for places to build \u2014 the edges of public parks, a few remaining farms, land reclaimed from the sea and so-called brownfield sites, like former container yards.It\u2019s an affordable-housing crisis whose effects have rippled across the broader economy and inflamed political tensions in a society already divided over Beijing\u2019s refusal to allow free elections.Much of this mountainous, densely populated territory of more than seven million has already been filled with high-rises, shopping centers and concrete sprawl. Hong Kong\u2019s golf courses and other private recreation clubs \u2014 long given special treatment as the city strove to be an attractive hub for global bankers and executives \u2014 are increasingly seen as one of the quickest solutions to the land shortage.But as the golf courses and clubs face growing calls to be redeveloped into public housing, they also are facing angry protests linking the crisis over land use to the city\u2019s broader problems of economic inequality and declining social mobility.In late March, protesters stormed the Hong Kong Golf Club, in the far-flung suburb of Fanling just two train stops from the Chinese border. Chanting \u201cLand for all!\u201d and \u201cWe want public housing! Take back the golf course!\u201d they marched down the neatly manicured lawns before occupying a putting green.When protesters reappeared a month later, they scuffled with security guards who barred them from entering. A golfer who was not a member of the club was seen grabbing a protester by the neck and throwing him to the ground.The dispute has been exacerbated by Hong Kong\u2019s political paralysis.Bitter infighting between its unelected, Beijing-backed leadership and the pro-democracy opposition has left the city\u2019s government unable to tackle tough problems, chief among them the lack of affordable housing. The prohibitive property prices, while a boon for the elite, have hurt the rest of the economy by raising costs for small businesses and start-ups.The activists seemed to get support from a recent government report proposing that the 425-acre golf course be partly or fully redeveloped for housing and other public uses. According to the report\u2019s estimates, the course is big enough to hold 13,200 apartment units, housing 37,000 people.The club is one of six golf courses and 24 private sports clubs on special government leases. Some of the others, including the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club and the Hong Kong Cricket Club, also date to the 19th century, and used to serve a mostly white, colonial clientele.Together, the clubs occupy 828 acres of land \u2014 about the size of Central Park in New York City \u2014 and serve about 56,000 members. They rent their land from the government through the special leases, so-called private recreational leases, that offer often below-market rates, drawing accusations that the government is \u201csubsidizing the rich.\u201dThe private recreational lease policy is a holdover from Hong Kong\u2019s colonial days, when recreational facilities were few and far between. A policy document from 1979 said the private clubs \u201cprovide an important outlet for the upper middle class and business circles.\u201d\u201cWe are lacking in golf facilities severely,\u201d said Arnold Wong, 44, the previous captain of the Hong Kong Golf Club, an elected position in which he represented its members. Mr. Wong, the co-founder of a restaurant company, pointed out that Hong Kong has fewer 18-hole courses than Singapore, which has a smaller population.\u201cIn terms of golf facilities, we are already lagging way behind as a major financial city,\u201d he said.As the debate has grown, the government\u2019s Home Affairs Bureau has proposed changes to the leasing policy, like charging the golf clubs higher rent.Last year, the Hong Kong Golf Club paid 2.5 million Hong Kong dollars (about $320,000) to the government in rent, a mere 3 percent of actual market rental value. Even so, the club had a deficit of the equivalent of $1.27 million in 2016, according to its annual report, suggesting that substantial increases in rent would pose a financial challenge.As the largest of Hong Kong\u2019s private clubs, the Hong Kong Golf Club represents the upper-class elite of the city. A corporate membership can be bought for some $2 million. Individual memberships have a one-off entrance fee of around $64,000, and monthly dues of several hundred dollars, but require personal connections and patience for a waiting list that is years long.For most of its history, the club had the word \u201cRoyal\u201d in its name, and members were predominantly British expatriates. Today, most of the 2,660 members are Hong Kong Chinese, many of whom got rich in real estate or finance after the economy took off in the 1970s. More recently, wealthy Chinese mainlanders have joined in growing numbers.The club opens its gates to nonmembers on most weekdays, though the fee of about $140 per 18-hole round puts it out of reach for many in Hong Kong, where the median monthly income is around $2,150. In recent years, the club has invested in community outreach, like teaching golf to underprivileged students and training talented young golfers.Yet as Hong Kong feels increasingly divided between rich and poor, the debate surrounding the golf course speaks to more fundamental questions about the future of this city, and whether it will be affordable to all, or just a playground of the rich.Some of the most vocal opponents of the course are young social activists who call land ownership the biggest dividing line between Hong Kong\u2019s haves and have-nots.Yam Chun, 24, a community organizer for the Concerning Grassroots\u2019 Housing Rights Alliance, sees the golf course as the epitome of inequitable use of land.Born to a working-class family, she said she grew up in cramped subdivided flats and old tenement buildings while her family sat on a long waiting list just to get into public housing.\u201cWhen my family and I were still waiting for public housing, I thought to myself, does Hong Kong really not have enough land?\u201d she said. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve grown up, I realize that the real problem is the unfair distribution of land.\u201dSome experts say that while the dispute has exposed deeper anxieties caused by Hong Kong\u2019s economic rise, the golf course is not big enough to solve the housing issue.\u201cThe golf course problem is just pure political populism,\u201d said Richard Wong, professor of economics at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cThe golf course is peripheral, completely peripheral, to the solution to this problem,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic.\u201dStill, symbols can be important, and some argue that getting rid of the golf course would hurt Hong Kong\u2019s competitiveness.\u201cAs an international financial city you do need to balance housing needs with sporting needs,\u201d said Mr. Wong, the club captain. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a walled city of just concrete, with no facilities, no attractions to other investors, foreigners, expats, people of different backgrounds.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Instead, she said she felt emotionally bullied by an artist who never acknowledged her as a creative partner.\u201cI want them to know what happened in the past between me and Araki,\u201d Kaori said last month. \u201cI was not allowed to speak out. People should know, and they should look.\u201d Mr. Araki declined repeated requests to comment.Maggie Mustard, co-curator of the Museum of Sex exhibition, said Kaori\u2019s allegations were forcing a new conversation about models\u2019 rights.\u201cThis gives us the opportunity to talk about what happens to a muse \u2014 and I use that word with air quotes \u2014 when she doesn\u2019t have a contract or a sense of economic or legal agency about how her image was used,\u201d Ms. Mustard said in a telephone interview.Ms. Mustard added that she had spoken with Kaori and would incorporate her comments into the exhibition\u2019s programming materials. Already, the wall text mentions another model\u2019s anonymous allegations of inappropriate sexual contact by Mr. Araki, noting that \u201cthe controversy surrounding Araki\u2019s work has almost exclusively been about reception and meaning, and far less about the issues of consent and the potential abuses of power that can be at the foundation of artistic practice and artistic production.\u201dArt historians argue that it might be time for artists to rethink the basis on which these relationships are built. Models should have \u201cmore agency in terms of authorship of the work itself,\u201d said Rebecca Zorach, a professor of art history at Northwestern University.\u201cThe art world has a tendency to erase women as makers, and historically it just happens over and over again,\u201d she said.In Japan, Kaori\u2019s disclosures come as women are just starting to raise questions about male power, sexual harassment and assault.For models working in Japan\u2019s art world, it is difficult to make demands of a male artist.Kaori, who trained in Paris as a dancer, began posing for Mr. Araki after meeting him at a party in 2001.She said he paid her 100,000 yen (about $930) to pose in the studio wearing a kimono or performing dances that Mr. Araki would photograph. For nude projects, he took her to so-called \u201clove hotels\u201d and paid her about 50,000 yen for each assignment.But she said he also called her for impromptu, unpaid sessions where he took photos while she walked in a park or sat in a bar at his command.It was not enough to make a living. Asked how she supplemented her income, Kaori demurred. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say,\u201d she said.In public, Mr. Araki described her as his \u201cmuse,\u201d but she said he did not tell her when or where the work would be published or exhibited, and she had no say in how the images were composed. \u201cFor him, a muse means someone who doesn\u2019t speak or have any of her own opinions and just keeps obeying his orders,\u201d she said.Early on, the two did have a consensual sexual relationship, Kaori said.During one photo session, she balked when he snapped Polaroid pictures of her and sold each individually without paying her any royalties. \u201cThat money that he earned is based on my contribution,\u201d Kaori said.\u201cHe says, \u2018I am Araki, and you must be happy and honored that I am taking a picture of you,\u2019\u201d she said.Kazuko Ito, a lawyer whom Kaori consulted last November, said Kaori told her that after nude photos appeared without her permission, a stalker broke into her home. Kaori asked the lawyer for help obtaining some rights to the photos, but Ms. Ito said that such disputes were very rare in Japan and that she was unlikely to win in court.Ms. Ito said she had heard similar complaints from other models for Mr. Araki.Kaori described one incident when foreign photographers came to observe Mr. Araki as he took pictures of her. She did not want to appear nude in front of strangers, she said, but Mr. Araki told her, \u201cThey aren\u2019t here to photograph you, they\u2019re here to photograph me.\u201dBut when pictures from that session came out in print, Kaori appeared in them, naked. \u201cHe invited many photographers into the studio and he ordered me to spread my legs in front of that big audience,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that.\u201dStill, it took her a long time to quit as Mr. Araki\u2019s model. She started working with him when she was young, and he was already famous. When he was hospitalized, she did not want to abandon him.\u201cLooking back now, everything was excessive and extreme,\u201d she wrote on her blog. \u201cSomething in me was numb. He asked me to do abnormal things, and I did them as if they were normal.\u201d At one point, she became suicidal.By 2015, the relationship had soured so badly that Mr. Araki insisted she sign a document vowing not to defame him or his business. In 2016, Kaori, who by then was running her own ballet school, stopped working with him.When she requested that he stop republishing or exhibiting some photographs of her, he warned in a March 2017 letter that she had no rights. \u201cAll models should understand the potential for unlimited use of the work,\u201d he wrote in the letter, seen by The New York Times. \u201cI will decide which publication, which exhibition, when to publish and what kind of products I will give permission to use my work. It\u2019s all up to me.\u201dKaori is not the only model to have objected to Mr. Araki's distribution of photos. In an interview, another woman who occasionally modeled for him between 2003 and 2013, who requested anonymity because she did not want her family to know she had posed, said that when friends discovered nude photos of her online that she had not known about, she asked Mr. Araki to take them down. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the internet,\u201d he told her.The model said a gallery that represents Mr. Araki, Taka Ishii in Tokyo, eventually removed the images from various websites.As for Kaori, she had started to move on with the support of a new partner. But when #MeToo began and the Museum of Sex mounted its Araki retrospective, they inspired her to go public.Many of the comments on her blog offered encouragement and called her courageous. \u201cIt must have been a horrible experience,\u201d one commentator wrote.Kaori said she did not expect an apology from Mr. Araki, and she is not asking the Museum of Sex to remove the three photos of her it is displaying.The work, she said, should serve as a reminder. All she wants, she said, is for visitors to \u201cknow my sad background and experience.\u201dHisako Ueno and Shiho Takezawa contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But the channel has doubled-down on tough-edged conservative opinion, hiring the hard-right commentators Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin and changing its \u201cFair and Balanced\u201d slogan to \u201cReal News, Real Honest Opinion.\u201dThe announcement on Thursday included the news that Jay Wallace, another longtime Fox News executive who also started in 1996, was promoted to president and executive editor of Fox News.

It is a short drive from Lake Managua and several universities.The 4,305-square-foot home has four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, as well as separate caretaker\u2019s quarters with a bedroom and a bathroom. It sits on a fifth of an acre of sloping, walled-off property, and features a landscaped yard and an expanded courtyard with a 20-by-13-foot pool and a barbecue area, all of which are connected to the main level of the house.\u201cEverything is open,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said. \u201cThere are large glass doors, and you can open up the entire living area.\u201dA floating staircase leads to the top floor, which has an open office area and four bedrooms, two of them (including the master) with terraces that look out to the courtyard. The master suite, which has a large concrete bathroom with a soaking tub, is in a separate wing.Throughout the house are concrete walls and ceilings, porcelain tile floors and Brazilian wood details. The minimalist furnishings are included in the asking price.The neighborhood of Villa Fontana Sur is filled with similarly high-end homes, and is at the southwestern end of Managua, a city with a population of about 1.5 million. It is about five miles south of Lake Managua and less than two miles from the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de Nicaragua, the main state-funded public university. Augusto C. Sandino International Airport is about a half-hour drive, while San Juan del Sur, a popular beach community on the southwestern Pacific Coast, is about two and a half hours away.MARKET OVERVIEWThose who buy in Nicaragua are drawn to the country\u2019s tropical climate and diverse landscape of beaches, lakes, rain forests and volcanoes, along with its modern and colonial cities. And home prices are typically lower than those in neighboring Central American countries.Higher-end homes usually start at around $200,000 near the beach and slightly less in the cities, and can often be bought for under $1 million, Mr. Stott-Jess said.\u201cSimilar properties in Costa Rica can be as much as 50 percent higher,\u201d he said.While Nicaragua\u2019s housing market stalled after the 2008 global financial crisis, it has gradually improved in recent years. Mr. Stott-Jess said that sales in the luxury sector across the country are up around 3 percent to 4 percent so far this year, while prices are roughly 10 percent higher. And the government has been encouraging foreign real estate investment, with tax incentives through its residency program and ongoing upgrades to infrastructure, including roads, airports and telecommunications.WHO BUYS IN NICARAGUAMost foreign buyers are from the United States, Canada and Europe, real estate professionals said, with some buyers from Costa Rica and other neighboring countries. And foreigners who buy in Nicaragua tend to be looking for vacation or retirement homes, as well as investment properties to hold and develop.Most foreign buyers, particularly those with families, are interested in beach communities like San Juan del Sur, Mr. Stott-Jess said. Cities like Managua are more popular with retirees and professionals working remotely, or with those who have business in the country, he said: \u201cThey like to be close to amenities like good infrastructure, movie theaters and health care.\u201dBUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate in Nicaragua, with the exception of properties close to the borders, said Javier A. Quinto, a real estate lawyer with Consortium Legal in San Juan del Sur. And foreigners have the same property rights as Nicaraguans, he said.Local financing is available for foreign buyers, Mr. Quinto said, although loan terms are usually less attractive than those in the United States.It is crucial for buyers to hire an experienced local lawyer to conduct the necessary due diligence, he said, which includes reviewing the title deed, or escritura, to ensure that there are no liens against the property or issues with ownership. Home inspections are also encouraged.Buyers can grant power of attorney to a lawyer to represent them at the closing and finalize the deal, which is transacted in the local currency. The entire buying process usually takes two to three months, Mr. Sanchez said.WEBSITESLANGUAGE AND CURRENCYSpanish; Nicaraguan c\u00f3rdoba (1 c\u00f3rdoba = $0.032)TAXES AND FEESSellers typically pay the sales commission, which ranges from 5 percent to 10 percent of the purchase price.Buyers are responsible for several transaction fees, including a federal transfer tax of 1 percent to 4 percent of the assessed value of the property after it is registered.

{"Headline": "Does Giuliani Have a Plan, or Is This Just a Freakout?", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistUntil Wednesday night, Donald Trump and people in his orbit insisted that the president had known nothing about the $130,000 hush money payment to the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels made by his lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, days before the 2016 election. Last month on Air Force One, a reporter asked Trump about it directly: \u201cDid you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?\u201d His response was a categorical no.This denial was always implausible, and now we have new evidence that Trump was lying. On Wednesday evening, Rudy Giuliani, whose appointment to Trump\u2019s legal team was announced two weeks ago, appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show and casually admitted that Trump had repaid Cohen for the money he gave to Daniels \u201cover a period of several months.\u201dI suspect the answer is a combination of the three. But their motivations are less important than the information they\u2019ve provided us. Whether they realize it or not, experts say they appear to have admitted that Trump and Cohen broke the law. The question is whether the impunity that Trump has enjoyed so far will hold or whether this farce of a presidency will, at long last, begin to crumble under the weight of its own sleaze.But as a legal matter, Trump seems to be in more trouble than he was 24 hours ago. Norman Eisen, chairman of Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, was almost giddy when I spoke to him on Thursday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the unraveling of a corrupt regime by the force and power of the law, and the people who are the handmaidens of the law,\u201d he said.As Eisen points out, Giuliani in his Hannity appearance was trying to argue that Cohen had not violated campaign finance law by spending $130,000 of his own money on behalf of Trump\u2019s presidential bid. But he did it in a staggeringly clumsy way that implicated Trump himself. \u201cWhat Giuliani did that was so stunning was, in stumbling away from the campaign finance violation, he bumbled into potentially criminal federal nondisclosure by his client,\u201d said Eisen.That\u2019s because, Eisen said, if Trump either repaid Cohen or was in the process of repaying him, he would have been legally obligated to include that information on his federal financial disclosure forms. Additionally, he said, Trump could be implicated in a criminal cover-up of Cohen\u2019s campaign contribution. Candidates are allowed to spend unlimited personal funds on their own political campaigns, but that\u2019s not what appears to have happened in this case. \u201cWhat happened here is that somebody else made a $130,000 contribution and Trump later repaid it and covered it up,\u201d Eisen said. \u201cThat is not permitted.\u201dPerhaps Giuliani knew that information demonstrating a link between the Daniels payment and the Trump campaign was about to surface. That means there are two possibilities for Giuliani\u2019s bizarre media jag. Either he was acting purposefully, because even worse news for his client is on the way, or he was acting haphazardly, because he\u2019s a has-been who has joined a White House in chaos. Neither possibility bodes well for Trump, who now faces the absurd but fitting possibility of being brought down not through exposure of his collusion with Russia but by the fallout from a single sordid sexual encounter.\u201cThey say that every case is a fight for credibility,\u201d Avenatti said. \u201cThere\u2019s little question, in light of what we\u2019ve seen over the last 18 hours, that their credibility on these issues has been destroyed.\u201d Trump\u2019s voters might not care, but hopefully judges and juries will.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Michael Cohen\u2019s Rolodex, an Investor Tied to Russia Saw Pay Dirt", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring an impromptu meeting at the Polo Bar in Midtown Manhattan just weeks before the 2016 election, Michael D. Cohen and Andrew Intrater struck up a conversation about investing in the taxi business.\u201cIt was really a pleasure to meet you last night,\u201d Mr. Intrater wrote in an email to Mr. Cohen the next day. \u201cI learned a lot about the taxi business and the possibilities which are now out there. Maybe something interesting will emerge.\u201dColumbus Nova was a surprise addition to the list: It had little business before the Trump administration. Some details of the firm\u2019s relationship with Mr. Cohen, and the full extent of what he promised or performed, remain unclear.But two people authorized to speak on Columbus Nova\u2019s behalf said that Mr. Intrater was impressed with Mr. Cohen after watching a stream of wealthy donors greet him at the inauguration. Mr. Intrater, who paid $250,000 to attend the event, expected Mr. Cohen to open his Rolodex of Republican donors to recruit new deals and investors for Columbus Nova, the people said. After signing the contract with Mr. Cohen, Mr. Intrater emailed him to say, \u201cReally looking forward to blowing it out!!\u201dLittle in the way of deals ever materialized. Columbus Nova declined the few investments Mr. Cohen proposed \u2014 including alcohol-infused ice pops, distressed taxi medallion loans and an oil and gas operation in the United States \u2014 and Mr. Cohen was unable to provide the kind of investors Columbus Nova was seeking, according to documents and the people connected to the firm, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential. After seven months and $580,000 in payments, Columbus Nova parted ways with him.A review of the emails and documents \u2014 as well as interviews with people connected to the men \u2014 show that Mr. Cohen and Mr. Intrater were more closely linked than previously known. And the payments Columbus Nova made to Mr. Cohen, combined with Mr. Intrater\u2019s donations to pro-Trump causes, help explain why their dealings have drawn the attention of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel examining Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the potential flow of foreign money into the campaign.Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have interviewed Mr. Intrater twice, focusing in part on his dealings with Mr. Cohen, according to a person briefed on the interviews. At a New York-area airport earlier this year, the investigators stopped Mr. Vekselberg and sought to question him. There is no indication that Mr. Intrater or Mr. Vekselberg are suspected of wrongdoing, or that their dealings with Mr. Cohen were improper.\u201cColumbus Nova has cooperated with all requests for documents and information from federal authorities,\u201d said Richard Owens, a lawyer for Mr. Intrater and the firm.Lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Vekselberg did not respond to requests for comment.Columbus Nova, like several other businesses that retained Mr. Cohen as a consultant, paid him through a shell company that Mr. Cohen had previously used to send $130,000 to Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress who performs as Stormy Daniels, to keep her quiet about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. (The president denies the affair.) Columbus Nova has said it had no idea that the shell company, Essential Consultants L.L.C., had been used for the payment to Ms. Clifford.Mr. Cohen and Mr. Intrater both happened to be dining at the Polo Bar on October 20, 2016, with other guests when a mutual friend brought them together, the people connected to Columbus Nova said. After Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise election victory a couple of weeks later, Mr. Intrater called Mr. Cohen to congratulate him.They kept in touch over the next several weeks and became friendly, occasionally meeting for drinks, texting and chatting about the taxi business. They also agreed to sit together at one of the dinners on Inauguration Day in January 2017. Mr. Intrater\u2019s $250,000 donation to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee entitled him to two tickets, which he and Mr. Vekselberg used to attend the event.By the time of the inauguration, Mr. Intrater and Mr. Cohen were already discussing a potential consulting arrangement with Columbus Nova. But the visit to Washington, where Mr. Intrater saw Mr. Cohen shaking hands and snapping photos with wealthy real estate investors and other businessmen, sealed the deal, according to the people connected to the firm.At the time, Mr. Vekselberg was making fewer new investments in Columbus Nova-managed funds, according to the people connected to the company, leaving Columbus Nova to recruit new investors and deals.Documents show that Mr. Cohen presented Columbus Nova with a potential $500,000 investment in an ice pop maker that was co-founded by an old friend of his and specialized in alcohol-infused treats. Mr. Cohen also proposed an oil and gas deal in the American Southwest and a plan to buy distressed taxi medallion loans in Chicago.While these business discussions unfolded, Mr. Cohen, a deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, solicited campaign donations from Mr. Intrater, who then attended a fund-raising dinner for the Trump Victory fund in Washington last June that Mr. Cohen helped organize. Mr. Intrater paid $35,000 for a ticket.At the dinner, Mr. Intrater met some of the wealthy investors whom he had hired Mr. Cohen to introduce Columbus Nova to, according to the people connected to the firm. Afterward, Mr. Intrater hitched a ride back to New York on the private jet of another wealthy donor.But Mr. Intrater wanted more: He was hoping Mr. Cohen would take him on a so-called roadshow that would link him with investors, according to the people connected to the firm. By late last summer, that had not happened, and Mr. Intrater suspended his payments to Mr. Cohen.Still, Mr. Intrater attended a September 2017 fund-raising dinner for Mr. Trump at the famed Manhattan restaurant Le Cirque. Although many donors forked over tens of thousands of dollars or more to join the dinner, which Mr. Trump attended, Mr. Cohen provided Mr. Intrater with a complimentary ticket, the people connected to Columbus Nova said.Over the years, Columbus Nova\u2019s private equity funds have invested in a cross-section of media companies \u2014 including Gawker Media and Napster \u2014 as well as commercial real estate in the United States, among other things, securities filings show.As recently as last year, Renova Group\u2019s Russian website featured a corporate flow chart listing Columbus Nova as its \u201cinvestment fund.\u201d The site has since been taken down.Ever since the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Mr. Vekselberg and Renova, its investments in Columbus Nova funds have been blocked. Columbus Nova, however, is not subject to the sanctions and continues to operate.Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet the Members of the \u2018Shadow N.S.C.\u2019 Advising John Bolton", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrawn from the world of conservative politics, international consulting and defense contracting, and working out of the downtown Washington offices of Mr. Bolton\u2019s political organizations, the group of advisers provided advice on National Security Council operations, while helping to vet prospective new hires for views that would be compatible with his own.One of Mr. Bolton\u2019s longtime associates, Charles M. Kupperman, a former Reagan administration official and defense contracting executive, has taken a temporary leadership post on the National Security Council, while at least three others \u2014 Frederick H. Fleitz, Sarah Tinsley and David Wurmser \u2014 are believed to be under consideration for posts.Mr. Bolton\u2019s relationships with most of the associates date back decades, to his days working in positions related to foreign policy in the Reagan administration. But he continued working with them in the dozen years since he has been out of government, serving as an adviser to Mr. Wurmser\u2019s company, according to its website, while relying on Mr. Kupperman, Ms. Tinsley and several other associates to help run a constellation of conservative political organizations that he founded to advance his foreign policy views and political prospects.The activity brought Mr. Bolton into regular contact with some of the biggest donors on the right, while giving him a platform to explore his own possible presidential campaign in 2016 and to be an advocate for confrontational strategies in dealing with Iran, North Korea and Russia.Mr. Bolton\u2019s continued reliance on longtime associates in either informal or temporary capacities at the National Security Council has raised concerns among government watchdog organizations and agency veterans and scholars. They say it creates questions of conflicts of interest and an echo chamber of identical views with little room for dissent at the agency charged with coordinating policy throughout the government\u2019s military, foreign policy and intelligence communities and synthesizing the best advice for the president.\u201cVery much like the president, Bolton has picked a small coterie of people from past lives who look more like cronies and buddies than they do the array of senior experts on different issues that past national security advisers have brought in,\u201d said David J. Rothkopf, a former Clinton administration official who wrote a definitive history of the National Security Council.People familiar with Mr. Bolton\u2019s cadre of advisers say that arguably the most influential among them is a low-profile 64-year-old consultant named Matthew C. Freedman, who has been close to Mr. Bolton since the two met in the early 1980s at the United States Agency for International Development, and over time has taken on the role of unofficial chief of staff in Mr. Bolton\u2019s government and political ventures.Mr. Freedman interviewed prospective N.S.C. hires from Mr. Bolton\u2019s Washington political office and reviewed information provided by the National Security Council about its structure, while providing advice to Mr. Bolton about prospective hires and changes, according to people familiar with the arrangement.While serving as an informal adviser, Mr. Freedman continued working as a subcontract consultant with the United States Navy and a special government employee with the United States Army, while also running Global Impact.Robert Palladino, a spokesman for the National Security Council, defended the role played by Mr. Freedman and Mr. Kupperman, and said they performed an invaluable service for Mr. Bolton as he was assuming the leadership of the agency by helping him sort through more than 500 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from people interested in working for the agency.\u201cConsulting with trusted colleagues, such as Mr. Freedman and Dr. Kupperman, not only makes practical sense, it also makes strategic sense, as Dr. Kupperman and Mr. Freedman both share a conviction to which Ambassador Bolton subscribes: \u2018Peace Through Strength,\u2019\u201d Mr. Palladino said in a statement.He added that \u201cno classified information was ever provided to Mr. Freedman\u201d while he worked from Mr. Bolton\u2019s political office. \u201cThe information shared with Mr. Freedman was downloaded from public websites or created from publicly available information.\u201dHe pointed out that unofficial advisers like Mr. Freedman are not covered by conflict-of-interest rules. And even though temporary employees like Mr. Kupperman are covered by ethics rules and are required to disclose their outside interests to their agencies, those disclosures are not made public.The lack of transparency \u201cmeans we have no way of knowing whether these individuals are accessing information that could prove useful for their own private government consulting activities,\u201d Mr. Shaub said.Also complicating Mr. Bolton\u2019s transition back into government has been the network of advocacy groups Mr. Bolton championed that are linked to major donors, political figures and interest groups seeking to influence the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy.Ms. Tinsley, Mr. Marquis and Christine Samuelian, a longtime assistant to Mr. Bolton who has joined him as an aide at the National Security Council, also helped run a pair of political action committees fronted by Mr. Bolton that have raised more than $24 million since 2013 \u2014 including $5 million from the hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer \u2014 to support hawkish candidates.Mr. Marquis, 35, and Ms. Tinsley, 64, declined to comment. So did Mr. Freedman; Mr. Fleitz, 56, a former chief of staff to Mr. Bolton when he was under secretary for arms control in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration; and Mr. Wurmser, 56, who served as a special assistant to Mr. Bolton in the Bush State Department and also as an aide to Vice President Dick Cheney.\u201cThese subject-matter experts will continue to serve the new national security adviser in support of the president\u2019s national security objectives,\u201d he said, adding that their presence will help ensure that \u201cfor any given national security issue, the president is provided with a full range of options.\u201dBut Max Stier, the head of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal work force, said that changes in personnel and approach accompanying each new leadership circle at the National Security Council \u201ccreate real risk for our country because of the lack of continuity.\u201dUnder previous presidents, he said, \u201cYou see this happening at the beginning of an administration. You just don\u2019t see this happening three times in the first 16 months.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Web of Slip-and-Fall Cases Puts a New Spin on an Old-Fashioned Scheme", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt sounded like an old school slip-and-fall scam with a modern-day financial twist.Neighborhood scouts lined up victims willing to fall in potholes or deliberately trip outside of restaurants, bodegas and dry cleaners. Doctors treated patients for broken limbs, busted knees and internal injuries, including some that were fake. Sometimes they performed unnecessary procedures that drove up the potential value of the personal injury lawsuits that followed.Lawyers filed those suits in state courts. Behind the scenes, their fees and the doctors\u2019 were \u201cusually paid for\u201d by specialized finance firms, which provide high-interest loans to plaintiffs.A federal indictment, which laid out those details, portrays a complex scheme, a sort of insurance fraud on steroids that lasted for five years and cost insurers and property owners $32 million. A group of five men orchestrated the fraud, recruiting people to stage so-called slip-and-fall accidents, and then organizing the legal and medical appointments that followed, the indictment says. Along the way, the group enlisted doctors, lawyers and finance companies.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged the five men with carrying out \u201ca widespread mail and wire fraud scheme.\u201d No doctors, lawyers or finance companies have been accused of wrongdoing. It is possible that the finance firms and other players were unwitting partners in the activities.The indictment offers insight into the unregulated and opaque world of the litigation-finance business.Such finance firms, many of them backed by hedge funds and private equity companies, typically bankroll lawsuits with large cash advances. The goal is to profit on the advances, some of which come with interest rates as high as 100 percent, from the proceeds of any settlements or jury verdicts.But the level of due diligence performed by the firms before providing the cash advances is unclear. According to the authorities, one of the men who orchestrated the fraud \u201cassisted in procuring the funding\u201d for the plaintiffs\u2019 medical treatment and \u201cfraudulent lawsuits,\u201d contacting the finance firms via email and cellphones. In one instance, he illegally used another person\u2019s identification to \u201cobtain the litigation loans.\u201dThe primary litigation-finance firm involved in the scheme was Fast Trak Legal Funding, according to four people familiar with the indictment who were not authorized to talk about nonpublic aspects of the case.A lawyer for Fast Trak, Larry Hutcher, said the firm had done nothing wrong and had potentially lost money through its involvement with the suits connected to the indictment.\u201cOur client has nothing to hide and is fully cooperating,\u201d Mr. Hutcher said.\u201cOur client is confident that they have acted properly in all cases and in all instances,\u201d he added. \u201cIf there was a fraud, we are a victim of this fraud.\u201dThe alleged slip-and-fall scheme has echoes of that approach. In the indictment, the authorities accuse the group of men of telling people that their personal injury suits would be dropped if they did not get medical treatments or surgeries. As an incentive, the people were \u201coffered a payment after the completed surgery.\u201dIn the indictment, prosecutors said Mr. Kalkanis, who is charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud, was the scheme\u2019s \u201corganizer and leader.\u201d He is accused of working with four younger men who acted as \u201cscouts,\u201d recruiting plaintiffs and helping to transport them to appointments with doctors.The group also coached the plaintiffs on how to fake their injuries convincingly, according to prosecutors. Mr. Kalkanis, the prosecutors contend, also connected the plaintiffs with the litigation-finance firms.Slip-and-fall cases are common in large cities, and the business of litigating such claims has a long history of abuse, with insurance companies spending large sums of money to detect fraud. But federal authorities say that the conduct they uncovered in this instance was more brazen than typical personal injury schemes.In an unusual move, prosecutors identified eight doctors and lawyers by name in a court document, and specified that the defendants in the case should not contact them without their counsel present. It is unclear why the authorities attached the condition to the defendants\u2019 bail; the doctors and lawyers in question are not accused of wrongdoing.The extent of the alleged fraud and the network of players involved may not yet be fully known. Court filings and interviews with three people familiar with the indictment suggest that others connected to the alleged scheme are already cooperating with prosecutors and that hundreds of personal injury lawsuits could be at issue.Defense lawyers who represent insurance companies have begun scouring their files in search of cases that may be connected to the alleged scheme. Christopher Fusco, a lawyer whose firm mainly represents insurers, said he found at least eight cases that seem suspicious because of the lawyers and doctors involved.\u201cWhile I can\u2019t comment on specific litigation, if fraud is suspected in a case, we may move for a stay while the criminal allegations play themselves out,\u201d Mr. Fusco said.James Monroe, another lawyer who represents plaintiffs, said his firm was trying to get out of a number of cases it had recently taken on from one of the lawyers identified by prosecutors.Prosecutors have not identified specific lawsuits as bogus. But a review of personal injury cases filed by two of the lawyers named by prosecutors \u2014 Marc Elefant and George Constantine \u2014 include some with plaintiffs who have checkered backgrounds.In one case, a woman testified in a deposition that she had previously been convicted of driving the getaway car in an armed robbery. In another, the plaintiff said he had served time in state prison for murder.Michael Bachner, a lawyer for Mr. Elefant, said his client \u201cprovided legal services only for clients he appropriately believed under all the circumstances were injured in accidents.\u201dMr. Constantine, who mainly practices in State Supreme Court in Queens and has filed dozens of slip-and-fall suits in New York state courts, did not return repeated requests for comment.Edward Sapone, a lawyer for Mr. Kalkanis, said his client \u201ctrusted that attorneys and funding companies carefully vetted the lawsuits.\u201d Mr. Kalkanis, he added, \u201ctrusted that surgeons reviewed objective tests and looked inside injured bodies.\u201dThe authorities have provided the defendants with emails, boxes of documents and several consensually recorded phone calls, presumably made by cooperating witnesses, said two of the people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak about information that has not been made public.As prosecutors move ahead with their case, some of those cited in the court filings continue to go about their business. On Tuesday, Mr. Constantine was in a Queens courtroom. He was arguing against an insurance company in a slip-and-fall lawsuit.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated whose lawsuits litigation-finance firms support with large cash advances. It is plaintiffs\u2019 suits, not defendants.Reporting was contributed by Robert GebeloffAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Viktor Vekselberg, Russian Billionaire, Was Questioned by Mueller\u2019s Investigators", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When the United States sought to punish Russia last month for its election interference and other aggressions, it targeted some of Russia\u2019s wealthiest men, imposing sanctions on those viewed as enriching themselves off President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government.Now it turns out that one of the men, Viktor F. Vekselberg, was also singled out in another of the efforts to confront Russia\u2019s election interference: the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Federal agents working with Mr. Mueller stopped Mr. Vekselberg, a billionaire businessman, at a New York-area airport this year, searched his electronic devices and questioned him, according to people familiar with the matter. They confronted him after he stepped off a private plane about two months ago, according to one of the people.There is no indication that Mr. Mueller suspects Mr. Vekselberg of wrongdoing. But Mr. Vekselberg attended the presidential inauguration last year, and the interest in him suggests that the special counsel has intensified his focus on potential connections between Russian oligarchs and the Trump campaign and inaugural committee.Another potential area of interest for Mr. Mueller is Mr. Vekselberg\u2019s business in Cyprus, the Mediterranean nation considered a magnet for Russian money. Mr. Vekselberg has controlled a company that has been the largest single shareholder in the Bank of Cyprus. Around the same time that Mr. Vekselberg was investing in the bank, Mr. Trump\u2019s future commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross, was its vice chairman.A spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment; a lawyer and a spokesman for Mr. Vekselberg did not respond to requests for comment. Previously, the spokesman confirmed that Mr. Vekselberg attended Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in as president.Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have questioned Mr. Intrater, according to a person briefed on the matter, though there is no indication that he is suspected of wrongdoing. A person close to Mr. Intrater said that he was encouraged to attend the inauguration by an American friend, and that he had wanted to use the trip as an opportunity to meet with business associates in Washington. Documents the person provided indicated that Mr. Intrater intended to hold business meetings during the weekend of the inauguration.Mr. Vekselberg, who has a net worth estimated at more than $13 billion by Forbes, has primarily made his fortune in oil and metals. And as his wealth has risen, he appears to have maintained strong ties to the Kremlin.Mr. Vekselberg is among the select Russian oligarchs who made their fortunes in the early post-Soviet period and managed to retain wealth under Mr. Putin while others went to prison or into exile. In 2010, Dmitri A. Medvedev, the Russian president at the time, appointed Mr. Vekselberg to help lead a technology-business project near Moscow.The Trump administration\u2019s decision to target Mr. Vekselberg and the Renova Group with sanctions underscored his perceived closeness to the Kremlin. The sanctions \u2014 against seven of Russia\u2019s richest men and their companies as well as 17 top government officials \u2014 were aimed at penalizing those seen as enriching themselves from Mr. Putin\u2019s government.And during a thaw in United States-Russian relations \u2014 the so-called reset orchestrated by Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state \u2014 Mr. Vekselberg was appointed to help attract Silicon Valley investors to the technology park outside Moscow, known as Skolkovo.Mr. Vekselberg also donated to Fort Ross, a state park in California that is the site of a 19th-century Russian settlement, to keep it open during the state\u2019s financial crunch in the recession.After making his fortune in aluminum and oil in Siberia in the 1990s, Mr. Vekselberg, together with partners, closed in 2003 what was at the time the largest private transaction in Russian history by forming a joint oil-pumping venture with the British company BP, called TNK-BP.But soon, BP executives came to suspect the Russian partners had close ties to the F.S.B., the main successor intelligence agency to the K.G.B., and other Russian security services. The F.S.B. classified oil field maps and closely tailed British employees. Once, during a business dispute with the Russians, BP\u2019s office in Moscow was raided by police officers armed with assault rifles.Amid this conflict with BP, one of Mr. Vekselberg\u2019s partners, German Khan, turned up for a dinner with a BP executive at a remote hunting lodge in Russia with a chrome-plated pistol, according to a State Department cable published by WikiLeaks. Mr. Khan confided to the executive that he considered the 1972 film \u201cThe Godfather\u201d a \u201cmanual for life.\u201dAdam Goldman reported from Washington, and Ben Protess and William K.

The next step is to do the same with science and technology. We must cast away false hopes and rely on ourselves.\u201dZTE\u2019s moment of crisis, if it leads to the company\u2019s collapse, could also show how the tech cold war might ripple around the world.Several employees described the situation inside ZTE on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals from their employer. A company spokeswoman declined to comment.In response to the sanctions issued last month, ZTE said it had worked to improve its compliance practices. It has requested a stay on the export ban and has sent additional information to the Commerce Department in support of its argument.\u201cZhongxing\u201d means \u201cChina Prospers.\u201d The company\u2019s controlling shareholder is Shenzhen Zhongxingxin Telecommunications Equipment, which is nearly half-owned by two Chinese state entities. Several members of the firm\u2019s board also have leadership roles at Zhongxingxin. ZTE says Zhongxingxin does not interfere in its business decisions. Unlike China\u2019s state-controlled enterprises, which are often run by Communist Party officials who jump from company to company, most of the top executives at ZTE are veterans with technical backgrounds.\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily impressive, what they\u2019ve done in the U.S.,\u201d said Avi Greengart, a consumer tech analyst with the research firm GlobalData. \u201cSo many Asian companies either said they would come to the U.S. and then had to pull back \u2014 like Xiaomi, like Huawei. Or they invested in the U.S. and weren\u2019t able to make it work.\u201dZTE\u2019s secret, Mr. Greengart said, was a light touch. The company\u2019s American managers have had significant leeway in tailoring their products to the local market. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way many of its competitors work,\u201d he said.The company was, for instance, quick to spot that Americans were gravitating toward larger phones. It offered inexpensive devices with big screens \u2014 if not those with the highest resolution \u2014 and fingerprint readers at a time when such features were considered premium.Some of the company\u2019s deals with cash-stricken governments have attracted accusations of corruption and overbilling. On the whole, though, ZTE is known in Africa for high quality and good service, said Dobek Pater, a telecom expert at the research firm Africa Analysis.\u201cThe initial perception \u2014 of Chinese companies coming in and being very secretive and not wanting to have much to do with the locals \u2014 has changed over the past decade,\u201d he said.In Iran, it was secrecy of another kind that got ZTE into trouble.\u201cAt home, they might have been doing some things not according to standards, and then, when it came time to internationalize, they might not have done so entirely properly,\u201d said Gu Wenjun, chief analyst at ICwise, a semiconductor market research firm in Shanghai.\u201cFor other companies thinking about how to follow the rules and manage internal risks, I think this is going to serve as a wakeup call,\u201d Mr. Gu said.At the very least, the sanctions against ZTE appear to be supercharging Beijing\u2019s determination to upgrade China\u2019s microchip makers, which have struggled to keep up with global industry leaders despite state support.Chris Lane, a telecom analyst in Hong Kong with Sanford C. Bernstein, believes that China now has the resolve to whip its semiconductor industry into world-leading shape, even if it takes a decade to do so.\u201cThey\u2019re going to pour billions of dollars into preventing this from ever happening again,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the long run, strategically, this might be worse for the U.S. than the current situation.\u201dLate last Friday, ZTE management sent an email to staff members updating them on the company\u2019s efforts to reconcile with Washington.\u201cEven the longest road has an end,\u201d the email concluded. \u201cEven the longest night ends in day. Let us stay resolute and confident, and, full of hope, greet the coming dawn!\u201dElsie Chen contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s Fixer, Built a Shadowy Business Empire", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe was a personal-injury lawyer who often worked out of taxi offices scattered around New York City.There was the one above the run-down auto repair garage on West 16th Street in Manhattan, on the edge of the Meatpacking District before it turned trendy. There was the single-story building with the garish yellow awning in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge. There was the tan brick place on a scruffy Manhattan side street often choked with double-parked taxis.And then there was his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower overlooking Fifth Avenue, right next to the one belonging to Donald J. Trump.Before he joined the Trump Organization and became Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer and do-it-all fixer, Michael D. Cohen was a hard-edge personal-injury attorney and businessman. Now a significant portion of his quarter-century business record is under the microscope of federal prosecutors \u2014 posing a potential threat not just to Mr. Cohen but also to the president.Mr. Cohen\u2019s businesses are private entities, making it difficult to get a full picture of their finances and operations. But a New York Times review of thousands of pages of public records, and interviews with bankers, lawyers and businessmen who have interacted with Mr. Cohen, reveal the degree to which he has often operated in the backwaters of the financial and legal worlds.While he has not been charged with a crime, many of his associates have faced either criminal charges or stiff regulatory penalties. That includes partners in the taxi business, doctors for whom he helped establish medical clinics and lawyers with whom he worked.He has spent much of his personal and professional life with immigrants from Russia and Ukraine. His father-in-law, who helped establish him in the taxi business, was born in Ukraine, as was one of Mr. Cohen\u2019s partners in that industry. Another partner was Russian. And Mr. Cohen used his connections in the region when scouting business opportunities for Mr. Trump in former Soviet republics.More recently, Mr. Cohen and his father-in-law lent more than $25 million to a Ukrainian businessman who has a checkered financial record and a history of defaulting on loans. And Mr. Cohen long held a small stake in his uncle\u2019s catering hall, which was frequented by Russian and Italian mobsters.In addition to his legal and taxi businesses, Mr. Cohen has had a seemingly charmed touch as a real estate investor. On one day in 2014, he sold four buildings in Manhattan for $32 million, entirely in cash. That was nearly three times what he paid for them no more than three years earlier.\u201cThis is the type of person you\u2019d see most bankers steer clear of,\u201d said Ben Berzin, a retired executive vice president and senior credit officer at PNC Bank who clashed with Mr. Trump in the early 1990s over loans to the future president\u2019s troubled Atlantic City casinos. The speed with which Mr. Cohen successfully flipped real estate stands out, Mr. Berzin said. \u201cYou have to ask what\u2019s going on.\u201dMr. Cohen, after being sent a detailed list of questions about his business interests, responded in a text message, \u201cYou need to do real fact checking as your questions are totally inaccurate.\u201d Neither he nor his lawyers have offered further comment.But the president has long entrusted Mr. Cohen to represent him in matters both public and deeply private: real estate negotiations from Fresno, Calif., to the Republic of Georgia, and the hush-money payment to an adult-film actress who said she had had an affair with the future president. Or, as Mr. Trump put it, \u201cthis crazy Stormy Daniels deal.\u201dThe $130,000 payment to the actress is in a way emblematic of Mr. Cohen\u2019s many business dealings. Its provenance is murky, obfuscated by a private agreement, pseudonyms and evolving explanations. President Trump said this past week that he had paid Mr. Cohen a retainer that was used to reimburse the $130,000, directly contradicting his earlier statements that he knew of no payment to Ms. Daniels.Within the Trump Organization, it was Mr. Cohen\u2019s job to deal with Mr. Trump\u2019s thorniest problems. But now, whatever problems investigators find in Mr. Cohen\u2019s own array of businesses could double back on Mr. Trump.\u201cMy cousins are all either lawyers or doctors,\u201d Mr. Cohen told The New York Times last year.One of those relatives was his uncle Dr. Morton W. Levine. Uncle Morty, as he was known to his family, had no children of his own, and he and Mr. Cohen were close. He even let his nephew drive his Bentley.Dr. Levine, a family practitioner, provided medical assistance to members of the Lucchese crime family, \u201cwhich aided their illegal activities,\u201d according to a sworn affidavit in 1993 from an F.B.I. special agent. The agent was involved in the investigation of the Lucchese underboss, Anthony (Gaspipe) Casso, who \u201cregarded Levine as someone who would do anything for him,\u201d according to the affidavit. That account was buttressed by testimony from a longtime Lucchese associate in an unrelated 2006 federal trial. In 1992, Dr. Levine bought Mr. Casso\u2019s home while Mr. Casso was a fugitive. Dr. Levine has acknowledged in court documents that Mr. Casso was a patient. But he said he did not know that the house belonged to Mr. Casso and denied any wrongdoing.Dr. Levine also owned El Caribe, a Brooklyn catering hall that for decades was the scene of mob weddings and Christmas parties. Two of New York\u2019s most notorious Russian mobsters once maintained offices there.Dr. Levine had crossed paths with Mr. Trump years before his nephew went to work for him. The doctor was part of an investment group with some garment executives that unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s 1989 bid for the Atlantis Casino in Atlantic City.Dr. Levine declined to comment.Mr. Cohen began his professional legal career at a personal injury firm in 1992, the year after he graduated from Cooley Law School in Michigan. His boss at that first job would later plead guilty to bribery.Mr. Cohen\u2019s marriage in 1994 gave him entree to communities of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.His new father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, had emigrated from Ukraine in 1975. By the time of the wedding, Mr. Shusterman had landed in serious legal trouble. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to evading federal reporting requirements for large cash transactions, admitting that he had cashed $5.5 million worth of checks to evade disclosure laws. Mr. Shusterman cooperated with prosecutors in a related case and was sentenced to probation.In the years after his marriage, Mr. Cohen began doing business with Ukrainian and Russian immigrants. They hailed from New York, Chicago and Florida, in neighborhoods like the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn and parts of Miami like Sunny Isles, known as the Russian Riviera, communities through which a vein of organized crime ran.In 1999, Mr. Cohen would find himself in the middle of a Sunny Isles real estate deal involving a hockey player and a purported figure from the Russian underworld.Nearly 20 years later, the details of the transaction remain unclear, but Mr. Cohen received a check for $350,000 from a Russian player for the Montreal Canadiens that was part of a deal involving an apartment in Sunny Isles.The player\u2019s agent later testified that the money was intended to go to Vitaly Buslaev. Mr. Buslaev, who has been identified by multiple Russian media outlets as a Mafia figure, was a friend of one of Mr. Cohen\u2019s business partners, according to two people who knew both men.Mr. Cohen said in an interview last year that he did not know Mr. Buslaev. He declined to identify the person to whom he sent the $350,000, saying only that he had honored the athlete\u2019s request. \u201cThe money went to where it was directed to go,\u201d he said.Mr. Cohen\u2019s ventures with business partners from the former Soviet Union continued, including a 2003 investment in a Florida casino boat with several Ukrainian immigrants that failed. After that, he helped members of his own family set up an ethanol production business in Ukraine.It was through his wife\u2019s family that Mr. Cohen would be introduced to the taxi business, which would ultimately allow him to pull in millions of dollars.Mr. Cohen\u2019s father-in-law, Mr. Shusterman, initially found work as a taxi driver after arriving in the United States. By 1993, he accumulated nine taxi medallions \u2014 the coveted metal placards that permit people to own or operate cabs \u2014 then worth roughly $1.5 million.Mr. Shusterman circulated among his fellow taxi operators, trying to help Mr. Cohen find work. He introduced his son-in-law to Ilya Palinsky, a longtime fixture in the business. Mr. Palinsky said his impression of Mr. Cohen was that \u201che talks a lot, screams, you know. He\u2019s a hyper guy.\u201dNot long afterward, Mr. Cohen began building his own taxi business, even as he was taking on personal injury work as a lawyer.He partnered with Symon Garber, another Ukrainian-born businessman, who was borrowing large amounts of money to finance taxi businesses in both Russia and the United States. A lawyer for the two men said in a court filing that he had helped them lay the groundwork for a planned taxi business in Moscow in the mid-1990s, although it never materialized.Mr. Cohen borrowed from a half-dozen banks and credit unions to buy taxi medallions. Then he used the medallions as collateral to borrow more money to buy more medallions, former colleagues said. He quickly amassed 30 medallions, each then worth about $250,000, but racked up millions in debt.Together, the two men managed 260 cabs in the late 1990s and early 2000s, some for other owners. Drivers paid them $100 a shift. Millions of dollars in cash flowed in. Mr. Cohen at some point began carrying a licensed pistol in an ankle holster.During Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, Mr. Cohen pursued plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow with Felix Sater, a Russian immigrant and friend of Mr. Cohen, who had worked on other real estate development deals with Mr. Trump and had explored possible ventures in Russia. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen worked with Mr. Sater even after his role in a stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals was revealed. (Mr. Sater pleaded guilty and became an informant for the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies.)While juggling his Trump duties, Mr. Cohen turned over management of his cabs to Mr. Garber in 2006 and received as much as $1 million per year, legal records show. After a falling-out with Mr. Garber, Mr. Cohen became partners with Evgeny Freidman, known as Gene, an immigrant from St. Petersburg, Russia, who had assembled a large taxi fleet.Both of Mr. Cohen\u2019s taxi partners had a history of legal run-ins. Each has been made to pay more than $1 million for overcharging their drivers, according to the New York State attorney general. Former business partners also accused each of them of forging signatures, stiffing lawyers and dodging debt collection efforts.The Chicago authorities found that Mr. Garber and his taxi businesses used 180 unauthorized cars as taxis in that city; he agreed to pay a fine of nearly $1 million.In 2016, a federal judge found that Mr. Freidman had transferred more than $60 million into offshore trusts to avoid paying debts. Last April, New York City regulators barred him from continuing to manage medallions. He currently is awaiting trial in Albany on charges he failed to pay $5 million in taxes.Despite the prohibition issued by city regulators, Mr. Freidman is still managing Mr. Cohen\u2019s medallions, both men have said.\u201cCohen associated himself with the most reckless and greedy players in the industry,\u201d said Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the Taxi Workers Alliance, a group that represents cabdrivers. \u201cThey have simultaneously worked to inflate the value of their medallions and rip off their drivers.\u201dPatrick J. Egan, a lawyer for Mr. Freidman, said his client denies all the allegations against him. Mr. Freidman, he said, has been the victim of \u201cfabricated claims\u201d by former colleagues and politically motivated prosecutors.Mr. Garber did not respond to requests for comment.From 2009 to 2014, Mr. Cohen \u2014 by then a trusted member of the Trump Organization \u2014 plowed $5.7 million into 22 Chicago taxi medallions, records show.The investments were ill timed. The ascent of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft decimated the value of medallions. Since 2014, Mr. Cohen\u2019s companies have been falling behind on taxes. Over all, his taxi businesses in New York and Chicago owe more than $375,000 for a variety of tax, insurance and inspection problems, according to records. Fourteen of his 54 cabs were suspended.But even as the industry has buckled, Mr. Cohen has continued to use his medallions as collateral to borrow money. In December 2014, with his medallions worth $35 million, he took out loans totaling at least $20 million from Sterling National Bank and Melrose Credit Union, according to a banker who reviewed the transactions. (Documents related to both lenders were among the materials sought by federal prosecutors in their search warrants.)In 2016, Mr. Cohen went so far as to dabble in financial engineering. He spoke to investors about pooling distressed loans that financed taxi medallion purchases, repackaging them and selling them to investors, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. He also explored buying up such loans at a bargain price in anticipation that their value would recover, the person said. The outcome of those discussions was not clear.The financial maneuvering has continued even after the federal search warrants were executed. On April 24, Mr. Cohen refinanced all 16 of his taxi company medallion loans. The transactions, with Sterling National Bank, appeared to extend the due dates on the loans by four years, according to public filings on the refinanced loans. And they added a new, unusual source of collateral: If Mr. Cohen were to default, Sterling would have the right to any money that Mr. Freidman owes Mr. Cohen.Many of Mr. Freidman\u2019s taxi companies have declared bankruptcy. Asked about the loans, Mr. Freidman\u2019s lawyer said his client had \u201cno assets\u201d that could be used as collateral.Spokesmen for Sterling and Melrose declined to comment.It was unclear what Mr. Cohen has done with all the money he has borrowed in recent years. But he received some of the funds around the time that he and his father-in-law, Mr. Shusterman, lent a combined $26 million to a Ukrainian immigrant and taxi-fleet operator named Semyon Shtayner, real estate records show.The transactions were unusual: Mr. Shtayner has had nearly $1.7 million in judgments and liens against him over the years, yet Mr. Cohen made large loans backed by collateral that appears to be worth less than the value of the loans.Since 2012, Mr. Cohen has lent $6 million to Mr. Shtayner, whose family owns Chicago Medallion Management Corporation, which manages more than 300 cabs in that city \u2014 including those owned by Mr. Cohen. The only collateral on the loans appears to be the Shtayners\u2019 condominium in Sunny Isles, purchased in 2009 for $2.35 million.Nevertheless, Mr. Cohen and his father-in-law were willing lenders to Mr. Shtayner, who recently entered the marijuana cultivation business in Nevada.Since last summer, Mr. Shusterman has lent $20 million to Mr. Shtayner\u2019s wife, Yasya, and two limited liability companies she controls.\u201cThis is a business exchange, that\u2019s it,\u201d Yasya Shtayner said in a brief phone interview, when questioned about the loans from Mr. Cohen. Asked whether she had a lawyer who could speak on her behalf, she said yes. Then she hung up.After he had built a taxi operation and a personal injury legal practice, there was another element to Mr. Cohen\u2019s business dealings, this one involving doctors and companies that operated on the fringes of the medical field.Starting in 2000, Mr. Cohen set up a series of companies in New York City. There were two medical practices, an acupuncture office, two medical billing companies, two management companies and a transportation company.The ventures were noteworthy, in part, because they were created at a time when countless phony companies were cropping up to exploit so-called no-fault auto insurance laws in New York and other states. Hundreds of doctors, businesses owners and others would eventually be criminally charged or accused of fraud by insurance companies.There is no evidence that Mr. Cohen or the companies he created were part of such schemes. Nor is there evidence that Mr. Cohen did anything other than register the companies with state authorities.The no-fault insurance schemes, which were often masterminded by organized crime figures from the former Soviet Union, all followed a basic template. Staged or exaggerated car accidents were used to generate a tidal wave of \u201cpatients.\u201d Transportation companies then took the patients \u2014 often low-level criminals \u2014 to what in many instances were sham medical clinics, diagnostic testing offices, and acupuncture and physical therapy offices. Billing companies were created to collect money from insurers, and management companies then siphoned the funds out to the scheme\u2019s operators. Some operators were so bold that they sued insurers that had stopped paying after they realized they were being defrauded.Mr. Cohen\u2019s role, if any, in the operation of the companies he helped set up was unclear. The only people listed in the incorporation papers as having roles in the businesses are the two doctors, Aleksandr Martirosov and Zhanna Kanevsky, who were each affiliated with a medical practice.But both of those doctors were accused of insurance fraud in connection with different medical practices they operated.Dr. Martirosov was arrested and charged with insurance fraud and grand larceny in 2003. A little more than a year earlier, Mr. Cohen had registered Avex Medical Care in Dr. Martirosov\u2019s name.In 2005, Dr. Kanevsky was indicted on state racketeering charges, the result of a lengthy wiretap investigation into phony accidents and medical claims. Mr. Cohen had registered Life Quality Medical Care on Dr. Kanevsky\u2019s behalf in April 2002.Dr. Kanevsky pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud in the second degree. A man who answered two phone numbers listed in her name said \u201cno comment\u201d and hung up.The charges against Dr. Martirosov were later dropped. He did not respond to calls for comment or a message left at his home. The same year he was arrested, Dr. Martirosov was named in a civil racketeering lawsuit brought by the insurance company Allstate, in connection with his work for another medical business. The suit accused dozens of doctors and business owners of trying to defraud insurers. Dr. Martirosov denied wrongdoing.Avex Medical Care continued to operate after Dr. Martirosov\u2019s arrest. The company later sued insurers at a frenetic pace that averaged almost one lawsuit a week from 2003 to 2008. The suits targeted insurers that had balked at paying for treatments for accident victims.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Mr. Cohen\u2019s personal injury practice filed hundreds of lawsuits largely stemming from auto accidents. For part of that time, a bustling bullpen of clerks and paralegals worked the phones at his Long Island City office. They sought settlements with insurers and churned out suits on behalf of clients, many of whom were referred to clinics that were later caught up in no-fault insurance fraud investigations.During his time working at the Trump Organization, Mr. Cohen became a minor real estate baron in his own right.While his business is dwarfed by Mr. Trump\u2019s assemblage of properties, it is not insignificant. From 2011 to 2015, limited liability companies connected to Mr. Cohen purchased at least five buildings in Manhattan, public records show.Like many of Mr. Cohen\u2019s business dealings, the transactions were unconventional. His companies would buy a building, often in cash. Soon after, they would flip the building in another all-cash deal for four or five times the previous purchase price. The buyer was generally another limited liability company.In October 2011, for example, a limited liability company listing as its address Mr. Cohen\u2019s apartment at Trump Park Avenue purchased a building on Rivington Street on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side for $2.1 million. In 2014, Mr. Cohen sold the building for $10 million in cash \u2014 nearly five times what he paid three years earlier.That same day, Mr. Cohen sold three other Manhattan buildings, also entirely for cash. In total, the four buildings sold for $32 million \u2014 nearly triple what Mr. Cohen had paid for them in the span of no more than three years.Richard K. Gordon, director of the Financial Integrity Institute at Case Western Reserve University\u2019s law school, said that such real estate transactions \u2014 large profits, achieved quickly, involving cash purchases by L.L.C.s \u2014 should raise red flags.\u201cIf I were the bank, I\u2019d either refuse his business up front or rate him extra high risk,\u201d said Mr. Gordon, who once led anti-money-laundering efforts for the International Monetary Fund.Mr. Trump is closely monitoring the investigations into his longtime counselor. In recent weeks, he has moved to simultaneously embrace Mr. Cohen and keep him at arm\u2019s length.A few days later, Mr. Trump asserted that the investigation was unrelated to Mr. Cohen\u2019s work for him.The president added: \u201cI hope he\u2019s in great shape.\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "Who Is Rod Blagojevich? And How Does He Know President Trump?", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Blagojevich\u2019s expletive-filled remarks about his role in choosing a new senator \u2014 caught on government recordings of phone calls \u2014 became punch lines for late-night television.\u201cI\u2019ve got this thing, and it\u2019s golden,\u201d he was memorably quoted as saying, using profanities. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just not giving it up for nothing. I\u2019m not going to do it. And I can always use it. I can parachute me there.\u201dIn the years since, Mr. Blagojevich\u2019s name has faded some. (So, court appearances show, has his trademark pouf of black hair.)About a month after Mr. Obama was elected president in 2008, Mr. Blagojevich, the sitting governor of Illinois, was arrested early one morning at his Chicago home. The accusations were stunning: Prosecutors said Mr. Blagojevich (pronounced bluh-GOY-uh-vich, though plenty of people, even in Illinois, still just call him \u201cBlago\u201d) had not only tried to crassly benefit from making an appointment to Mr. Obama\u2019s vacant Senate seat, but also sought millions of dollars from people who had state business in all sorts of other scenarios. Federal prosecutors said the conduct was so abysmal that it \u201cwould make Lincoln roll over in his grave.\u201dBack when Mr. Blagojevich was awaiting trial, he did something lots of legal experts warned was a risky and unwise idea: He went out and talked about his innocence. A lot. He hosted a radio show. He agreed to appear in a spoof of his own political career (\u201cRod Blagojevich Superstar!\u201d). He sang \u201cTreat Me Nice,\u201d a song Elvis Presley was better known for, at a Chicago block party.\u201cI feel badly for him,\u201d Mr. Trump said later on the show. \u201cHe tried, but I feel badly. It\u2019s pretty sad.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something I would love to see \u2014 for his children, for his family,\u201d Mr. Adam said. \u201cHe got to know him and Donald Trump was someone who was fond of him. We got so much heat for letting him go out and do that stuff back then. How ironic if that turns out to be his saving grace.\u201dIf the rest of the world has forgotten about Rod Blagojevich, Illinois, it seems, has not. Some political leaders and people involved in his case had sharp critiques at the prospect of a commutation.\u201cHe did infinite harm to the government of Illinois,\u201d Pat Quinn, the lieutenant governor who took over as governor when Mr. Blagojevich was removed from office, said on Thursday. \u201cWe had a lot of remedial work to do after he left, including passing strong ethics laws and campaign finance laws \u2014 he didn\u2019t do Illinois any good.\u201d Mr. Quinn said that Mr. Blagojevich still had not taken responsibility for his conduct.Randall Samborn, a former spokesman for the federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Chicago, said he did not question the president\u2019s authority to grant a commutation, but he said that giving one in this case would upend the legal process and system, which had considered numerous elements of Mr. Blagojevich\u2019s case over nearly a decade.\u201cIt conveys a message that the facts and the law don\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cThat you just have to be the beneficiary of creating an impression of unfair treatment regardless of the merit of that.\u201d\u201cI just hope and pray that he will make that effort to commute his sentence,\u201d said Mr. Burris, a Democrat and former state attorney general who is now a lawyer in Chicago. A pardon, he suggested, would be more appropriate. Mr. Burris, who said he has not kept in touch with Mr. Blagojevich, said he was unconvinced that a commutation would materialize because the president\u2019s \u201cmind goes from one thing to the next.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giuliani Appears to Veer Off Script. A Furor Follows.", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rudolph W. Giuliani has been President Trump\u2019s lawyer for only a few days, and already he is causing political explosions.[Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.]\u201cI want to clarify something,\u201d Mr. Hannity said, offering a do-over to Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, failed presidential candidate and longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s. Instead of taking a mulligan, Mr. Giuliani repeated the assertion.It was another high-profile, slightly off-kilter moment for Mr. Giuliani, who has lived a life full of them.From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress.A veteran of the no-holds-barred world of New York tabloids that Mr. Trump also inhabited for decades, Mr. Giuliani was an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. He was also a forceful critic of Hillary Clinton, a longtime political rival and Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2016 presidential race.Those aspirations never materialized. Mr. Giuliani was passed over for both jobs \u2014 not once, but twice for each position.Still, Mr. Giuliani has never wavered in his support for his fellow New Yorker. And when Mr. Trump was seeking a new lawyer \u2014 a high-wattage TV combatant who would not wilt under the pressures of the news media or legal adversaries \u2014 Mr. Giuliani seemed a natural pick.But Mr. Giuliani has historically been something of a loose cannon who is not used to having his words carefully managed. (Just ask his campaign handlers from 2008, who were constantly frustrated by his freestyling ways.)So it may have surprised nobody when Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments on Wednesday night on Fox News set off a frenzy on Twitter. Almost instantly, people were reposting video of Mr. Trump on Air Force One last month saying he knew nothing about the payments.Asked about his remarks after finishing the Fox News interview, Mr. Giuliani said that what might have seemed to some viewers \u2014 including, perhaps, Mr. Hannity \u2014 like a slip of the tongue, was actually a planned disclosure.\u201cThat removes the campaign finance violation, and we have all the documentary proof for it,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said, explaining that the president and his other lawyers were well aware of what Mr. Giuliani intended to say on the program. He insisted he had spoken with the president before and after the interview on Fox News. Mr. Giuliani also dismissed the social media furor. There was no cause for concern.But it may take some time to determine if he was correct.Late Wednesday night, Common Cause, a government watchdog group, said Mr. Giuliani\u2019s remarks bolstered its lawsuit accusing the president and his campaign of breaking the law by failing to disclose a contribution to his campaign.\u201cGiuliani seemingly thought he was doing President Trump a favor \u2014 but instead made Trump\u2019s legal problems much, much worse,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, the group\u2019s vice president for policy and litigation.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Biggest Trend in Fashion May Be Getting Rid of Your Fashion", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnbuttonedHow the drive to dress for the cameras took over one man\u2019s life, and why he decided it was time to stop.Forget fringe and feathers; forget saying no to fur. It is possible that the biggest trend in fashion is about to become getting rid of all of your \u2026 fashion.\u201cI hope so,\u201d said Mr. Silver, who had a wardrobe of \u201cthousands\u201d of pieces scattered between his homes in Los Angeles, New York and Pennsylvania, including, he said, \u201c50 man furs in storage in L.A., and I don\u2019t even wear fur. It\u2019s what I spent money on instead of buying a house in Malibu.\u201dHe still loves clothes, but he has some new mantras, and he regards them with the same passion he once regarded a hot pink Jil Sander by Raf Simons suit. Specifically: \u201cIt\u2019s chic to repeat\u201d and \u201cThe best new clothes are old clothes.\u201d\u201cOwning Decades was like opening a weird Pandora\u2019s box for me,\u201d Mr. Silver said. \u201cI was obsessed with clothes growing up, but it was the store that made me a collector. I looked for pieces that represented a season, or told the story of the time we were living in. But then it took over my life.\u201d It was the joint chronological landmarks of the store turning 21 and a looming 50th birthday (Mr. Silver turns 49 later this month) that served as motivation, he said, \u201cto liberate myself from all these possessions.\u201d Many of the sellers cited personal, emotional reasons for divesting themselves of their clothes: Ms. Guinness sold hers in part as a reaction to the end of her marriage to Spyros Niarchos; Ms. Della Russo did so after the deaths of her mentors Manuela Pavesi and Franca Sozzani, and the beginning of a new relationship. And many, though not all, attached the proceeds of the sale (or at least a portion) to a charity, almost as a form of penance for the indulgence.Instead, the sales by Mr. Silver and his ilk seem more purely related to the current consumer culture. They are products of the way in which visual consumption and the need to fill the digital void with More Crazy Outfits! and Even Wilder Looks! have begun to drive actual consumption to unsustainable levels. Not in the ecological sense, though that is part of it, but in the psychological sense.It\u2019s a peculiarly contemporary vicious cycle: If your personal brand and your professional brand are increasingly interchangeable, and part of that brand is dressing in a seriously eye-catching way, and that kind of dressing then causes photographers to seek you out and take pictures, that in turn creates pressure to dress more crazily and change more often and get more stuff, which gets more pictures and so on and so on ad infinitum.\u201cThe expectation that whenever I showed up, I would wear something that turned heads or dropped jaws was really strong,\u201d Mr. Silver said. \u201cEvery Met Gala had to be a bigger fashion moment, which in turn encouraged me to be extra social and go out like crazy. It was like performance art, but at a certain point I felt like my wardrobe took over my authenticity.\u201dValerie Steele, the director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, said in an email that auctions used to sell only 18th-, 19th- and early-20th-century pieces. \u201cBut now \u2018vintage\u2019 means anything more than three seasons old, and even less sometimes,\u201d Ms. Steele wrote. \u201cThere is no incentive for collectors waiting until their clothes have \u2018aged\u2019 into fashion history, especially when the latest fashions are on display in museums. And it\u2019s certainly true that people (and heirs) increasingly seek to monetize fashion collections.\u201dAnd it\u2019s not like he won\u2019t have anything left. There are still 300 pairs of shoes, he said, \u201cand suits in 50 shades of gray from pretty much every designer you can name,\u201d since gray suits have become his new uniform. But, Mr. Silver said, \u201cit feels great to be free from the pressure to figure out who\u2019s the hottest new designer or what\u2019s the most important new silhouette.\u201d It\u2019s a monster of our own creation. But there seems to be a growing (and welcome) consensus that it\u2019s time to cut off its head.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of a museum. It is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, not the Los Angeles Contemporary Museum of Art.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Auction Buyers Are Catching on to African-American Art", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor many, this sale was by far the most significant moment in the latest biannual series of auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art in New York. But what did it signify?As Mr. Levin suggested, there were plenty of other results last week that suggested a surge in demand for African-American art. Sotheby\u2019s Wednesday evening contemporary sale began with five works by leading African-American artists sold to raise money for a new building at the Studio Museum in Harlem.The auction market is belatedly reflecting re-evaluations that have been going on for some time in the museum world. Driven by seismic shifts in cultural politics, scholars and curators have challenged the fixity of the West\u2019s artistic canon, rehabilitating neglected talent from a range of communities and cultures.\u201cThis has meant looking beyond figures such as Pollock, Rothko, Warhol and Lichtenstein toward African-American artists working in the same period,\u201d added Mr. Godfrey, who co-organized Tate\u2019s \u201cSoul of a Nation\u201d exhibition. He said that it was part of Tate\u2019s \u201ccuratorial vision\u201d to \u201crethink narratives of art history.\u201dMr. Godfrey added that when acquiring works by living artists such as Mr. Bradford and Mr. Marshall, \u201cWe learn that Jack Whitten was as important to Bradford as Jacques de la Villegl\u00e9, or that Charles White was as significant for Marshall as Velazquez.\u201dBut these biannual seasons of New York auctions rely on individual trophies to set the tone, and the headlines. This time round, apart from Mr. Marshall\u2019s \u201cPast Times,\u201d there was little that generated any serious salesroom excitement.\u201cThe weight of expectation, hype and marketing is distorting the market,\u201d said Hugo Nathan, co-founder of Beaumont Nathan, an art advisory company based in London. \u201cThe results feel disappointing, and yet the prices are still huge.\u201d\u201cThe financial deals have pushed the numbers to a point where there\u2019s not a lot of room left on the upside,\u201d said Neal Meltzer, an art adviser based in New York.By contrast, at Phillips contemporary sale on Thursday, the 1984 Basquiat acrylic and oilstick on wood slat painting, \u201cFlexible,\u201d fresh from the artist\u2019s estate, sold to a telephone bidder for $45.3 million, double the estimated price.Two lots earlier, Pat Steir\u2019s radiant 1992 drip painting, \u201cElective Affinity Waterfall,\u201d sold for $2.3 million, an auction high for this long-overlooked American painter. The 12-foot-wide canvas \u2014 offered, like the Basquiat, without a guarantee \u2014 was valued at $600,000 to $800,000. It had been owned by the foundation of the New York philanthropists Manuel D. and Rhoda Mayerson since 1994, when not many people had heard of Ms. Steir \u2014 or, indeed, Mr. Marshall.The principles of the auction market remain the same. But at least the names are being freshened up.Advertisement"}

But she spent nearly as much time driving a car as she spent programming one. Millions of people moved from home to work every day in her city of more than 20 million; her daily commute to work could at times run to three hours or more.Ms. Negm is the new face of tech entrepreneurship in the Muslim world. And she is not alone.This intersection of STEM education and rising entrepreneurship has created the conditions for women in Muslim-majority emerging markets to catch the wave of technological change sweeping the world. But they have done so in a way that looks very different from the West \u2014 and very different from the generations of women before them. They are using technology to trump culture and then changing culture from within.Often young female entrepreneurs are tapping into a market in which they have a comparative advantage: other young millennial women like them who have newfound disposable income.For their grandmothers and mothers, work outside the home was often inaccessible. But the 50 million Muslim women who have joined the work force \u2014 online and offline \u2014 in the last 15 years have led the greatest migration from home to work ever seen in their countries. The economic opportunity unleashed by the combination of education, ambition and technology is massive. The combined income of working women across the Muslim world is already $1 trillion.As more women create entrepreneurial ventures, generating jobs and income for ever-larger segments of the population, governments can facilitate this new avenue of growth for their economies. The social payoff, in the form of women\u2019s empowerment, breaking stereotypes and stronger communities, may be even greater. And as digital platforms and tools make economic activity more easily visible and measurable, policymakers have an opportunity for smarter regulation.Laws are often behind the economic realities of female (and male) citizens. While most emerging markets in the Muslim world have high internet and mobile penetration rates, women still tend to have less digital access than men. While public transport infrastructure in many Muslim emerging markets needs overall improvement, it also needs to take into account women\u2019s concerns around safety and harassment to truly open up mobility options for them.Governments across the economies of the Muslim world will need to reconsider policies in a range of areas \u2014 digital inclusion, labor, parental leave, child care, taxation, safety, access to finance and transport \u2014 and apply a gender lens to developing new areas to fully unleash the potential of their female work force, including entrepreneurs.Globalization and technology have at times had a harsh impact on parts of the working class in the United States and elsewhere in the developed world in recent years. On the other side of the world, those same forces have empowered millions of women, with far-reaching consequences for their families, communities and countries. If the image of a typical entrepreneur in Silicon Valley is a young man in a hoodie, in many urban areas of the Muslim World, it could easily be a young woman in a hijab. The passion, energy and desire to solve local problems are the same. Their governments should now recognize and back these new employers, consumers and taxpayers for the genuine economic force that they are.Saadia Zahidi is head of the Center for the New Economy and Society at the World Economic Forum and author of \u201cFifty Million Rising.\u201dAdvertisement"}

One reporter, Chloe Melas of CNN, said that, during an interview last year about \u201cGoing in Style,\u201d when she was six months pregnant, Mr. Freeman looked her up and down and told her, \u201cYou are ripe.\u201d A camera caught Mr. Freeman saying \u201cBoy, do I wish I was there,\u201d directed toward Ms. Melas. CNN aired the video with the remark on Thursday.\u201cRight when I walked into the room, he began to make sexually suggestive comments to me,\u201d Ms. Melas, one of the authors of the CNN report, said on air Thursday. \u201cAs an entertainment reporter for over a decade, it was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201dMs. Melas then began looking for other women who had had similar experiences. An article on CNN\u2019s website said that the network had spoken with 16 people, eight of whom accused Mr. Freeman of inappropriate behavior.In a statement after the article was published, Mr. Freeman, 80, said: \u201cAnyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy. I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected \u2014 that was never my intent.\u201dMr. Freeman has, at least until now, been one of the most revered actors of the modern film era. He won an Oscar for best supporting actor in 2005 for his role in \u201cMillion Dollar Baby\u201d and has been nominated for four other Academy Awards. He is often cast as a grandfatherly figure of wisdom and decency and has been referred to as having a \u201cvoice of God,\u201d one heard in numerous voice-over roles and commercials.Some of the inappropriate behavior reported by CNN took place at Revelations Entertainment, the production company Mr. Freeman founded along with the producer Lori McCreary two decades ago, and where staff members described the work environment as toxic for women. According to CNN, one manager said that Mr. Freeman would \u201ccome over to my desk to say hi, and he\u2019d just stand there and stare at me. He would stare at my breasts.\u201dMs. McCreary would make snide remarks to women who could not stay late because they had to go home to their families, CNN reported, citing two former senior-level employees of the company. Ms. McCreary, who is co-president of the Producers Guild of America, did not respond to a request for comment.According to CNN, Warner Bros. told Ms. Melas that it could not corroborate her account because, other than the comment caught on camera, it could not find Warner employees who had witnessed the other inappropriate remarks she said Mr. Freeman had made. Warner Bros. declined to comment on Thursday.Another journalist, Tyra Martin, an entertainment producer at Chicago\u2019s WGN-TV who interviewed Mr. Freeman many times over a decade, told CNN that he would often comment on her dress, but that she was \u201cin on the joke.\u201d There was, however, one incident that she felt crossed the line.\u201cWhen I stood up, I pulled my skirt part of my dress down, and he did say, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t pull it down now,\u2019\u201d Ms. Martin told CNN.It is unclear what the accusations will mean for his future film work.Mr. Freeman has two other movies in advanced stages of production, \u201cAngel Has Fallen\u201d and \u201cThe Poison Rose.\u201d Both are independently financed and do not yet appear to have full distribution plans.

Film tends to float on the top layers of the ocean, Ms. Wang said, where it is particularly dangerous to aquatic life.Ms. Wang, a University of Pennsylvania graduate who hails from Canada, has been noodling on the problem of plastic waste since she was a teenager. In high school, she and her co-founder, Jeanny Yao, visited a waste-transfer station in Vancouver, British Columbia, and were shocked at the amount of plastic they saw.Now, using a novel reaction system that employs a liquid chemical catalyst, BioCellection turns unrecyclable, contaminated film waste into chemicals that can be used by consumers and industry. The process is \u201cvery safe,\u201d Ms. Wang said.\u201cIt\u2019s about a practical method that will actually solve the problem,\u201d she said.Michael Riedijk, an investor in BioCellection and an adviser to the company, said in an email that Ms. Wang had \u201cgreat vision\u201d and was a strong promoter and negotiator, essential skills when running a start-up. He said he backed the company because \u201cthe technology they developed is unique.\u201dLater this year, BioCellection will start a pilot program in the San Francisco Bay Area to build its first commercial machine, which can process five metric tons of waste a day. The company is also starting to market its first consumer product: a biodegradable cleaner for electronic screens. And, Ms. Wang said, it is in talks with an electronics company to use its chemicals to make charger cables.Co-founder and chief executive of Fig LoansMr. Zhou, 29, said he wanted to give consumers with marred credit a chance to prove they are better than their credit score \u2014 in part because he was given a chance to excel. He attended Phillips Academy, a prestigious school in Andover, Mass., on a \u201cnear full\u201d scholarship. \u201cThe school took a chance on me,\u201d he said, \u201c and gave an ordinary kid the opportunity of a lifetime.\u201dMr. Zhou and his co-founder, John Li, met when they were graduate business students at the Wharton School and decided that consumer-friendly small loans were a promising market.Fig\u2019s target customers have checking accounts and earn $30,000 to $90,000 a year, but may have made a mistake that excluded them from the financial mainstream. Even though their finances may have stabilized, their history haunts them. Customers can apply online for a loan from Fig, which makes lending decisions based on bank statements, taking into account expenses like rent, utilities and spending, Mr. Zhou said.Loans are $300 to $500 and, depending on the state, are repaid in four or six equal monthly installments \u2014 unlike payday loans, which typically must be repaid in two weeks, often setting up borrowers for failure. Fig\u2019s interest rates sound high \u2014 annual percentage rates are as much as 190 percent and vary by state \u2014 yet are far lower than typical rates for payday loans, Mr. Zhou said. Repayment information is sent to credit bureaus, so borrowers can rebuild their credit.Fig, which is based in Texas, tries to provide a bridge for these consumers, so they can qualify for traditional loans.

In New York City, Ms. Steyn said, a parking space for a sport-utility vehicle can cost $1,000 a month. Car ownership is declining in such cities, she said: \u201cSo what happens next?\u201dG.M.\u2019s answer is Maven, available in 17 cities in the United States and Canada, including New York, Detroit, Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles. It made its debut in Toronto this year. Maven\u2019s 137,000 members can use an app to access a G.M. vehicle on demand by the hour to run errands, or longer for business trips or personal vacations.Many urban consumers, Ms. Steyn said \u2014 particularly young ones \u2014 prefer access to transportation on demand, rather than car ownership. G.M.\u2019s average driver is older than 49. With Maven, Ms. Steyn aims to build a service company within G.M. and attract younger customers.Maven also offers weekly car rentals to workers in the gig economy, who can use the vehicles to transport passengers for ride-hailing companies, or to deliver food and packages.\u201cI\u2019m a passionate advocate for changes in the business model that consumers are demanding,\u201d Ms. Steyn said. Co-founder and chief executive of Peek.comDuring a trip to Turkey, Ruzwana Bashir realized she wanted a better travel app.While visiting Istanbul, Ms. Bashir, 34, a travel enthusiast who has visited dozens of countries, spent the better part of 20 hours trying to book excursions and contacting tour operators. \u201cIt was a very frustrating experience,\u201d she said.\u201cExperiences make you happier than buying products,\u201d Ms. Bashir said. People enjoy the anticipation as well as the activity itself, she said, and then they have shared memories.Ms. Bashir, who is British and attended Oxford, worked in finance at Goldman Sachs and Blackstone, where she learned about the hotel industry and other travel-related businesses. After graduating from Harvard Business School, she decided that she really wanted to be an entrepreneur.She and her co-founder, Oskar Bruening, bonded after discovering that they had both gone horseback riding in Mongolia.Peek was started in 2012, and has since raised $20 million in venture funding.Booking air travel and hotels online is now fairly straightforward, Ms. Bashir said. But arranging activities once travelers arrive at their destination remains a challenge. Travelers often don\u2019t want to book far in advance, to allow for flexibility for weather or personal preference. But if they wait until they arrive, they may end up spending excessive time researching and calling to schedule outings.With the app, Ms. Bashir said, travelers can get ideas by viewing pictures, then book basic activities like walking tours and museum visits as well as more exotic activities, such as a hot-air balloon ride, sky diving or touring monasteries in Greece.Founder and managing director of Illumen CapitalWith Illumen, Mr. Dodson aims to invest in private equity and venture funds, with a caveat: Managers must agree to undergo training to reduce implicit bias that may be creating blind spots in their choices of employees to promote and companies in which to invest. Illumen focuses on so-called impact investors: Those who aim not only to make a return on their money, but also to spur social or environmental changes.Implicit bias refers to assumptions and stereotypes that may unconsciously affect decision-making. In the financial context, Mr. Dodson said, unexamined attitudes may, for example, cause fund managers to pass uppromising investment opportunities if a company is headed by a woman or a person of color.\u201cUnless you\u2019ve thought about reducing bias,\u201d Mr. Dodson said, \u201cyou may be leaving money on the table.\u201dMr. Dodson, 39, has spent the past seven years as a consultant to the board of the Calvert Funds, a $12 billion pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing. Mr. Dodson, who grew up in Washington, D.C., said working to broaden financial opportunities had been the focus of his career. Illumen\u2019s approach is to use research-based interventions developed in partnership with Stanford University, Mr. Dodson\u2019s business-school alma mater, to help investors avoid race and gender bias. Illumen expects fund managers to commit to three years of training and analysis, he said. \u201cHe knows this is a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business.Illumen also has a nonprofit partner that offers \u201cimpact experiences,\u201d in which investors and fund managers spend time in communities to better understand the context in which their investments are made.People love lists.We want to check out the best places to travel, catch up with the best inventions of the last 100 years, be in the know about the best-dressed people, the best books, the best schools. And on and on.Of course, there is a risk to listmaking. Maybe your choices won\u2019t hold up over the years. Maybe the best book of decades ago seems not so great today.With the listmaking fervor and its risks in mind, we searched for people who would fit our criteria for visionaries. They had to be people who are forward-looking, working on exciting projects, helping others or taking a new direction. We wanted diversity in gender, race and ethnic background.We assigned writers who are knowledgeable about the subjects we deemed most important. And we limited the list to 30.Narrowing down the numbers was a huge challenge. And that\u2019s a good problem to have.

{"Headline": "Michael Cohen\u2019s Business Partner Agrees to Cooperate as Part of Plea Deal", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA significant business partner of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, has agreed to cooperate with the government as a potential witness, a development that could be used as leverage to pressure Mr. Cohen to work with the special counsel examining Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.The broadened scope of Mr. Freidman\u2019s cooperation may prove worrisome not only to Mr. Cohen, who is the target of a continuing federal investigation, but also Mr. Trump.Mr. Freidman has been Mr. Cohen\u2019s partner in the taxi business for years, managing cabs for him even after New York City regulators barred Mr. Freidman last year from continuing to manage medallions.Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Ryan, declined to comment on Tuesday.President Trump\u2019s lawyers sought to distance their client from the case.\u201cHe\u2019s just not involved in the taxis,\u201d said one of his lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York. \u201cHe has as much involvement in it as I do.\u201dInstead, he appeared in court in Albany on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to a single count of evading only $50,000 worth of taxes; he will avoid jail time and receive five years of probation if he fulfills the terms of his agreement, the judge, Patrick Lynch of Albany County court, said during the roughly 20-minute proceeding.Later Tuesday, Mr. Freidman texted a New York Times reporter about the article that had been published about his guilty plea, calling it \u201cshameful\u201d and comparing it to a tabloid story. \u201cMichael is dear dear personal friend and a passive client! That\u2019s it!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am humbled and shamed!\u201d he said, adding that the guilty plea represented \u201cme taking responsibility for my actions.\u201d\u201cI had been an officer of the court in excess of 20 years and now I am a felon!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI hate that I have been grouped in this runaway train that I am not a part of!\u201dBut asked if he was cooperating with the authorities, Mr. Freidman would not respond.After Mr. Freidman\u2019s guilty plea, his lawyer, Patrick J. Egan of Fox Rothschild, declined to comment. But earlier this year he said his client \u201cconsiders Michael a very good friend and a great client.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Freidman\u2019s agreement to cooperate in his tax fraud case in Albany could have larger implications. Mr. Cohen is facing an investigation by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, which is examining his business practices. Anything that bolsters that inquiry could increase pressure on Mr. Cohen to cooperate with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who is investigating the 2016 election that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.Last month, federal agents carried out search warrants at Mr. Cohen\u2019s home, his office and a hotel room where he was staying. The search sought a wide range of materials, including documents related to his business associates and accountants, as well as a $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford, the adult film actress known as Stormy Daniels, who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen and an earlier partner in the taxi business managed a company that operated 260 yellow cabs in the early 2000s, a massive fleet that brought in millions of dollars in annual revenue \u2014 much of it in cash. Today, he still owns 32 taxi medallions in New York and 22 in Chicago, a portfolio estimated to be worth at least $10 million.While Mr. Cohen performed a relatively small amount of actual legal work for Mr. Trump, he carried out a wide range of tasks during his decade at the Trump Organization.He scouted real estate deals for Mr. Trump from Fresno, Calif., to the Republic of Georgia, served as the chief operating officer of a failed mixed martial arts venture, started a website to drum up interest in a 2012 presidential run that never materialized and was a point man in responding to allegations of impropriety at Trump University. That wide range of work could make Mr. Cohen a valuable witness for federal investigators.Even before Mr. Cohen went to work for Mr. Trump in 2007, he began to step back from direct management of the taxi cab business, eventually turning to Mr. Freidman to run his cabs.The charges against Mr. Freidman stem from accusations that he pocketed a 50-cent surcharge, known as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority tax, which is used to pay for mass transit improvements. When he was charged last year, Nonie Manion, then the acting commissioner of the state Department of Taxation and Finance, said \u201cthis indictment exposes a blatant scheme to shortchange the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the transportation infrastructure relied on by millions of New Yorkers.\u201dMr. Freidman would also be required to pay $1 million in restitution to the state attorney general\u2019s office.\u201cToday, the \u2018Taxi King\u2019 admitted that he built his empire by stealing from New Yorkers,\u201d said Barbara Underwood, the state attorney general. \u201cFreidman pocketed money that should have provided much-needed investment in our transit system \u2014 and he\u2019ll now have to pay back every cent. Our office will continue to hold accountable those who cheat the system.\u201dDuring the court hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Freidman, dressed in a neat gray jacket and black pants accented with zippers, spoke softly and haltingly. His jury trial had been scheduled for June 18.Toward the end of the hearing, Judge Lynch asked Mr. Freidman if he \u201cunderstood the nature of the benefit\u201d his attorneys had accomplished on his behalf.Mr. Freidman said he had \u201cspent long hours\u201d speaking with his lawyers, adding, \u201cI\u2019m extremely satisfied with the services that have been provided to me.\u201dMaggie Haberman, Brian M.

{"Headline": "The Bumbling Corruption of Rodrigo Duterte", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Syjuco writes frequently about the Duterte administration.Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Among Filipinos working in the Middle East, the talk inevitably turns to home. In encounters in hallways, on buses, while getting a haircut, we chat about our shared experiences as expats with deep connections to our home.Millions of Filipinos across the region are respected for their professionalism and high-quality work, while in the Philippines opportunities are scarce and wages low. Yet systemic corruption and patronage politics in our resource-rich country provide well for our rulers and those who support them.Indeed, Philippine democracy \u2014 with its reign of celebrity, dynasties and nepotism \u2014 is the opposite of a meritocracy. Incompetence is forgiven in those who show fidelity to the rulers, while fame and its pursuit are spun as competence, which has always served the powerful well. Despite President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s electoral promises, little has changed where it matters most: our political culture.One recent blunder here in the Middle East sums up well the transactional relationship between Filipino politicians and those who work for them.Some 260,000 Filipinos were left in Kuwait without representation from their country. The seriousness of this cannot be overstated, given the urgent problem of migrant worker abuse in the Middle East.Despite the government\u2019s showboating, none of the Filipino officials involved has been held responsible.One was Mocha Uson, a blogger who parlayed her fame as a sexy dancer into a position overseeing the president\u2019s social media. She was in Kuwait during the operation and publicized it to her sizable online following, posting the video that eventually outraged the Kuwaiti government.Such transactional relationships are par for the course in our ossified political culture, where accountability is usually selective and always part of a strategy.Despite praise from Mr. Duterte\u2019s supporters for his sacking of dozens of public officials \u2014 for violations including incompetence, corruption and drug-smuggling \u2014 only two of those fired have been formally charged with crimes. And that the president fires his allies by no means negates the fact that, in most cases, it was he who hired them.In fact, several have been reappointed to other, often higher, positions, despite Mr. Duterte\u2019s vow to never tolerate even a \u201cwhiff\u201d of corruption. Among those was the customs chief, who was tied to the smuggling of more than a ton of crystal meth in an operation that allegedly involved the president\u2019s son and son-in-law.Reward is the flip side of accountability. Many of Mr. Duterte\u2019s political appointees are supporters who appear to have received payment for deeds laid at the president\u2019s feet.By empowering surrogates, Mr. Duterte empowers himself, using the increasingly complicit institutions of democracy, giving his authoritarian aspirations a veneer of legitimacy.His allies already control Congress, with a supermajority handed to him after his presidential win when representatives switched sides en masse to join his party. And elections for thousands of local positions across the country last week had been postponed for nearly two years while the administration sought room to maneuver, alleging the need to purge candidates they claimed were financed by drugs.But to the mercenary it hardly matters. Public-relations efforts from his deputies lead to notoriety, to political positions, to a lifetime of comfort and control as long as one\u2019s patrons are ensconced in office.What, then, can we citizens do?Unless we resist such efforts by standing firm in demanding accountability from all our public servants, we\u2019ll continue to be ruled by those who trade service for servility and dangle rights in exchange for obeisance.The president, for all his posturing as a man of humble beginnings, and his promises of change, is a governor\u2019s son and the patriarch of a dynasty that retains power through favors and administers justice arbitrarily. Mr. Duterte may sometimes seem atypical among Filipino rulers, but in this respect, he is typical.No wonder so many Filipinos continue to seek abroad lives with security and agency.The other day, here in Abu Dhabi, the Filipino man cutting my hair told me about the politics in his hometown. Everyone knows the politicians are corrupt, he explained, but it\u2019s excused because at least they provide for the community.\u201cThey always come to our fiestas,\u201d he said, with a shrug. \u201cAnd they give us money so that we can have them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The End of the World Will Start Here in Manbij\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarAbout six miles north of the Syrian city Manbij is a town near the Turkish border called Dadat, which has been ruled by multiple occupiers since 2012. Atop one hill, the armed fighters of the predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., crouch within bunkers and behind earthen walls. Through binoculars they stare at their enemies: the Turkish Army and Turkish-backed Syrian militias, who have built their own bases and bunkers about a mile away.Often American special-operations soldiers visit the Kurds for updates and a cup of tea. The Americans live among them near the front line and work with the S.D.F. to keep the Islamic State from returning. During a recent trip to the area in late March, an S.D.F. commander named Shiar drove us in his pickup truck a short distance from the front line to a small house clearly marked by an American flag flying from the roof. Armored vehicles were parked outside.\u201cYou see, this is their base,\u201d Shiar said. \u201cWe wanted to give the house for free to the Americans. But the Americans insisted they pay rent for it.\u201dOn the porch, American soldiers carrying lumber appeared to be fortifying their position. They declined to comment.Northern Syria has been troubled by violence for more than seven years. Armed groups have risen and fallen, the Syrian military has contracted and expanded and regional players with a stake \u2014 Turkey, Iran, Russia and the United States, along with multiple Persian Gulf countries \u2014 have all supported their favored causes or combatants or inserted their own fighters into the conflict. The result has been a confounding array of forces on the ground, including traditional allies now on opposing sides, or aligned in one locale and opposed in another.Although Syria officially is still a unified country, in reality it has been divided into three sectors by the outside countries intervening on the ground: Russia (in the west, north and center), Turkey (in the northwest) and America (in the north and east).Much of the conflict in Syria arises in locations where two or more of these sectors border one another. This is why Manbij and the surrounding area is such a hot spot. Located on the western edge of the American sector, this city of 300,000 also borders the Turkish and Russian sectors. \u201cI have fought ISIS, Turkey, and now I am in Manbij, where all sides meet,\u201d Shiar said, \u201cIt is just a little city. Who would have thought that a place like this would attract so much international attention?\u201d In the town Arima, just west of the city, the S.D.F., Americans, Turks, rebels, Syrian Army, Russians and Iranians are squeezed into one square kilometer. For the time being, this area is off limits to journalists.\u201cAs schoolkids we were little rascals,\u201d said Ali, a Kurdish fighter whom we met in Ainissa, just east of Manbij. \u201cOur teacher would often yell at us and say, \u2018If you kids continue being such troublemakers, the end of the world will start here in Manbij.\u2019 If I now look at the situation Manbij is in, I often think back on my teacher\u2019s words.\u201dOfficially the Americans and the Turks are NATO allies, but not in Dadat, where the mortars in the garden of the American compound were pointed in the direction of Turkey\u2019s army.This front is not active; the forces rarely exchange fire. But the American soldiers work with Kurdish forces who have squared off elsewhere in Syria against not only a NATO ally but also Syrian rebels who were for years armed and financed by the United States. Those rebels are now working with Turkey.The situation inside the city, and for civilians, is equally complex. Since the start of the conflict, Manbij\u2019s residents have been ruled at one time or another by almost all sides. Syrian government forces were here until mid-2012, when rebels of the Free Syrian Army replaced them, until early 2014. ISIS then took over and ruled until mid-2016, when the S.D.F. took back the city.A majority of Manbij\u2019s inhabitants are Syrian Arabs. Being occupied by the Kurdish-led S.D.F. does not sit well with many of them. The S.D.F. is secular, left-leaning and vocal about women\u2019s rights. Its ranks include female fighters who don\u2019t wear veils and shake hands with men. Some of these women command male troops. The Arab population of Manbij is deeply conservative. Most women who leave the house do so with covered faces. Some Arab residents in Manbij would prefer the city to be taken over by the Turkish Army and Syrian rebels allied with them. Others see risks in allying with Turkey, and say they want the Syrian government to retake Manbij.\u201cIf Turkey replaces the Kurds, there is no way of knowing if they ever will leave again,\u201d said one resident, who asked not to be named. \u201cSo it is better to get Assad back. Assad is an Arab. Kurds and Turks aren\u2019t.\u201dOn March 29, two coalition soldiers were killed in Manbij and five more were wounded when unknown assailants attacked a vehicle near the Sufi graveyard. Although ISIS did not claim the attack, it is generally believed that ISIS or other extremist elements carried it out. The uncertainties about the attack fit a pattern. Few people know whom to trust, and no one knows what to expect. Few civilians in Manbij are willing to speak on the record.\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d said a shop owner who runs a small business near one of the main streets. \u201cIf we say we like the Kurds, the Turks will be angry. If we say we like the Turks, the Kurds and the Syrians are angry. The only thing we can say is this: We hope for three things \u2014 stability, stability and stability.\u201dIn Manbij, the S.D.F. can\u2019t afford to close an eye for a minute because of the constant fear of a sudden, devastating Turkish strike. To the Kurdish commander Muhammad Abu Adel, head of the Manbij Military Council, that fear is rooted not only in the death and destruction such an invasion would sow but also in the uncertainty about whether American backing for his Kurdish forces will end.Adel said he had received assurances that American troops will stay. Standing near his headquarters in the outskirts of Manbij, he scrolled through his smartphone and found WhatsApp messages he had recently received from commanders of an American unit in the city. \u201cListen,\u201d he said.In one message, an interpreter working with the Pentagon\u2019s forces relayed an American officer\u2019s assurances: \u201cThe captain passes his regards to you and says we are supporting you,\u201d he said, in Arabic.Another WhatsApp message also expressed American support for the Kurdish fighters, at least for now. \u201cAre there any injuries on the front lines?\u201d the voice asked. \u201cMake sure everybody is safe.\u201dIn another message, the American captain asked through the translator: \u201cAre your cars still O.K.? You need any spare parts for the cars? Just to let you know, we were on a patrol. We just returned to base.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let the news disturb you,\u201d he added, referring to reports at the time that American forces may withdraw. \u201cIt\u2019s all rumors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Happiest Guy in the World", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-DocsAt any given moment across a beach in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., cruise ships speckle the horizon, their gargantuan bodies reduced to dots in the distance. I grew up near this beach, and most of the people I knew growing up had been on cruises. They would go away for a week or a weekend, drawn by the promise of escape, and return to land with bad sunburns, stories of small adventures and a few extra pounds. For these people, cruising was an occasional vacation. For Mario Salcedo, the subject of this Op-Doc, it\u2019s his everyday life.I first learned about Mario through my grandparents, both of whom are avid cruisers. As several of their senior friends began to spend more time on cruises than on land, my grandparents became aware of an elite cabal of sorts within the cruising subculture: passengers scattered across different cruise lines who choose to live at sea permanently. One such passenger was Mario Salcedo, or \u201cSuper Mario\u201d as the crew of the Enchantment of the Seas affectionately calls him. For the past two decades, Mario has been a full-time resident on Royal Caribbean Cruises, accumulating over 7,300 nights at sea.For nearly two decades, Mario had been living out of his suitcase, traveling extensively for his corporate job as the director of international finance at a multinational corporation. He spent more time in and out of hotel rooms scattered across Latin America than he did at his home in Miami. After working nonstop for nearly 21 years, Mario \u2014 burned out \u2014 decided it was time to pursue a lifelong goal: to travel around the world, without leaving home. In 1997, he quit his job, packed an even bigger suitcase and quietly disappeared from the lives of his friends and family to pursue a new life on the open water.This past August, a film crew of me and four others joined Mario for five days on the Enchantment of the Seas. As we soon discovered, Mario lives a far different life from the one portrayed by both himself \u2014 as an unofficial public ambassador for Royal Caribbean \u2014 and the press.The Mario we followed was not living the fantastical dream life of a \u201ccruising king,\u201d as I\u2019d seen him described. The Mario we found lives a life full of paradoxes: while he proclaims his independence from others, he surrounds himself with throngs of anonymous tourists, shaking hands and selling his lifestyle. I was determined to crack through what I perceived to be a facade. But as I floated dreamily across a sea of professional smiles with Mario, I realized that his facade had taken on a reality of its own, that his ongoing voyages to nowhere \u2014 and everywhere \u2014 provided an overwhelming sense of freedom perhaps not found on land. It is in that freedom that Mario has finally found his home.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s get to it.Instagram is threatening to block me and many others in Europe out of its app if I don\u2019t acknowledge new privacy settings. I had a similar dance with Facebook and Twitter recently. The notices are a result of a European data-privacy law called the General Data Protection Regulation, known as G.D.P.R., going into effect on May 25.The disclosures will provide an inside look at the dossiers companies compile about us. Privacy groups, seeing an opportunity, are planning to submit data requests on people\u2019s behalf and file class-action-style complaints when they spot wrongdoing.As we\u2019ve seen with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, shame can be a more efficient method for changing a company\u2019s behavior than any legal proceeding.A long-running sore spot in the European tech scene is the region\u2019s lack of large, globally-influential technology companies to match the likes of Alphabet, Uber, Alibaba or Tencent.People disagree on whether this is a good use of taxpayer money, but to keep up with the United States and China, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, many European policymakers don\u2019t think they have a choice.Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm that has been embroiled in a data-harvesting scandal, said on Wednesday that it would cease operations and file for bankruptcy.Cambridge Analytica said it was being punished for common practices in the online advertising industry. It\u2019s a deflection, sure, but also not entirely wrong.Facebook said it began an investigation to find other groups that used data-harvesting tactics similar to those employed by Cambridge Analytica. If Mark Zuckerberg wants to make good on his pledge to be more open and transparent, he\u2019ll make the findings public, even if it\u2019s not flattering for Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Giuliani Said About Cohen\u2019s Payment to Stormy Daniels", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRudolph W. Giuliani said on Wednesday that President Trump reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for a payment that Mr. Cohen has said he made to Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress widely known by her stage name, Stormy Daniels. The payment of $130,000 was to keep her from speaking publicly before the 2016 election about an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.Mr. Giuliani, a member of the president\u2019s legal team, made the statement during an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News.Below is a transcript of the exchange._________SEAN HANNITY: My question is, are you concerned within the process of this, we did discover that a foreign national, Christopher Steele, was paid through Fusion GPS, used Russian sources that not only weren\u2019t verified, but were debunked \u2014 are you concerned that was paid for, to manipulate the American people in the lead-up to an election?RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI: Isn\u2019t that closer to the mandate than Michael Cohen?HANNITY: Why isn\u2019t that happening? Where\u2019s Mueller on that, sir?GIULIANI: Having something to do with paying some Stormy Daniels woman $130,000? Which, I mean, is going to turn out to be perfectly legal. That money was not campaign money. Sorry, I\u2019m giving you a fact now that you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not campaign money. No campaign finance violation.HANNITY: They funneled it through a law firm.GIULIANI: They funneled through a law firm, and the president repaid it.HANNITY: Oh. I didn\u2019t know that. He did.GIULIANI: Yep.HANNITY: There\u2019s no campaign finance law.GIULIANI: Zero. Just like every \u2014 Sean, Sean \u2014HANNITY: So this decision was made by \u2014GIULIANI: Everybody was nervous about this from the very beginning. I wasn\u2019t. I knew how much money Donald Trump put into that campaign, and I said, \u201c$130,000? He could do a couple of checks for $130,000.\u201dWhen I heard of Cohen\u2019s retainer for $130,000, he was doing no work for the president. I said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s how he\u2019s repaying it, with a little profit and a little margin for paying taxes for Michael.HANNITY: But you know the president didn\u2019t know about this?GIULIANI: Ah, he didn\u2019t know about the specifics of it, as far as I know. But he did know about the general arrangement, that Michael would take care of things like this. Like, I take care of this with my clients. I don\u2019t burden them with every single thing that comes along. These are busy people._________HANNITY: As we continue with President Trump\u2019s attorney, former New York City mayor, Rudy Giuliani, I want to clarify something. Because I was asking you about Perkins Coie and you said that the money was not campaign money \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m giving you a fact now that you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not campaign money, no campaign violation.\u201d And I said, \u201cBecause they funneled through a law firm.\u201dI think we were talking about two different things there. I want to make sure.GIULIANI: I was talking about the $130,000 payment \u2014HANNITY: Right.GIULIANI: The settlement payment, which is a very regular thing for lawyers to do. The question there was, the only possible violation there would be: Was it a campaign finance violation? Which usually results in a fine, by the way, not this big stormtroopers coming in and breaking down his apartment and breaking down his office.That was money that was paid by his lawyer, the way I would do, out of his law firm funds or whatever funds \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 and the president reimbursed that over the period of several months.HANNITY: He had said, I distinctly remember, that he did it on his own \u2014GIULIANI: He did?HANNITY: Without asking \u2014GIULIANI: I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t investigated that. No reason to dispute that, no reason to dispute that recollection. I like Michael a lot, you like Michael a lot \u2014HANNITY: I\u2019ve known him a long time.GIULIANI: I feel very bad he\u2019s been victimized like this. The president feels even worse. The fact is, just trust me, they\u2019re going to come up with no violations there. Payments are perfectly legal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giuliani\u2019s Bark May Come Back to Bite Trump", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rudolph W. Giuliani may be ill suited to be President Trump\u2019s legal frontman for all of the reasons that the bombastic former mayor appealed to Mr. Trump in the first place.Mr. Giuliani is loose-lipped, intemperate, confrontational and supremely confident that he knows better than anyone else. Like Mr. Trump himself, the man once known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d for overseeing New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has always faced down his critics with relish.And yet, suddenly on Wednesday night, Mr. Giuliani seemed reduced to America\u2019s grouchy dinner guest. He found himself undermining his new client \u2014 the president of the United States \u2014 and the very law enforcement officials he once oversaw as United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.[Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.]\u201cI want to clarify something,\u201d Mr. Hannity said, offering a do-over to Mr. Giuliani, an unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate and longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s. Instead of taking a mulligan, Mr. Giuliani repeated the assertion.Lawyers from inside and outside the White House are confronting the Mueller inquiry, while others are focused on payments made to silence a pornographic film actress who said she had sex with Mr. Trump.As his host tried to throw him several lifelines, Mr. Giuliani dug in, insisting that Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, had tried to keep Ms. Clifford from going public with the alleged affair before the 2016 election.He also called agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who raided Mr. Cohen\u2019s office \u201cstorm troopers,\u201d a reference to Nazis that offended others in the law enforcement community who once held Mr. Giuliani in largely high regard.(In 2000, Mr. Giuliani refused to apologize for using the same term to describe federal agents who seized Elian Gonzalez, a Cuban boy at the center of an immigration battle in Florida. \u201cI\u2019m not going to back down from it,\u201d he said at the time.)Mr. Giuliani\u2019s appearances infuriated others in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit, who had been kept in the dark about his plans. At the White House, many of the president\u2019s associates were particularly angry over an odd swipe that Mr. Giuliani took at Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser.\u201cJared is a fine man, you know that,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said, before adding, \u201cMen are disposable.\u201dWhat he meant by disposable is unclear, but Mr. Kushner\u2019s friends in the West Wing were equally puzzled by Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments about Ivanka Trump, Mr. Kushner\u2019s wife. Mr. Giuliani called her \u201ca fine woman\u201d and predicted that \u201cthe whole country\u201d would turn on Robert S. Mueller III, the special prosecutor in the Russia investigation, if Mr. Mueller went after Ms. Trump.\u201cA fine woman like Ivanka?\u201d he said. \u201cCome on.\u201dA veteran of the no-holds-barred world of New York tabloids that Mr. Trump inhabited for decades, Mr. Giuliani was an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 a potential entree back into the limelight of national politics after his failed 2008 bid for the White House.During Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, he was a forceful critic of Hillary Clinton, a longtime political rival and Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2016 presidential race, and indulged in some non-truth telling that was as puzzling as it was brazen.For example, he suggested that Hillary Clinton had not visited ground zero in the immediate period after the 9/11 attacks, even when reporters covered their joint trips there and ample photographic evidence to the contrary instantly emerged.Mr. Giuliani also said during the campaign that the F.B.I. gave him the inside track into investigations into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails. His private security consulting firm often attracted scrutiny and dinged his chances at joining the Trump administration.Those aspirations never materialized. Mr. Giuliani was passed over for both jobs \u2014 not once, but twice for each position.Still, Mr. Giuliani has never wavered in his support for his fellow New Yorker. And when Mr. Trump was seeking a new lawyer \u2014 a high-wattage TV combatant who would not wilt under the pressures of the news media or legal adversaries \u2014 Mr. Giuliani seemed a natural pick.From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress.But Mr. Giuliani is not used to having his words carefully managed. His comments on Fox News on Wednesday set off a frenzy on Twitter. Almost instantly, people were reposting video of Mr. Trump on Air Force One last month saying he knew nothing about the payments.Asked about his remarks after finishing the interview, Mr. Giuliani said that what might have seemed to some \u2014 including, perhaps, Mr. Hannity \u2014 like a slip of the tongue, was actually a planned disclosure.\u201cThat removes the campaign finance violation, and we have all the documentary proof for it,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said, explaining that the president was aware of what Mr. Giuliani intended to say on the program. He insisted he had spoken with Mr. Trump before and after the interview on Fox News. Mr. Giuliani also dismissed the social media furor.But late Wednesday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group, said Mr. Giuliani\u2019s remarks bolstered its lawsuit accusing the president and his campaign of breaking the law by failing to disclose a contribution to his campaign.\u201cGiuliani seemingly thought he was doing President Trump a favor \u2014 but instead made Trump\u2019s legal problems much, much worse,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, the group\u2019s vice president for policy and litigation.Whether or not that proves true, Mr. Giuliani is likely to have an opinion about it. And a combative one, at that.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

The island is now left with 18 diplomatic allies \u2014 many of them poor nations in Central America and the Pacific, like Belize and Nauru; only one is in Africa, the tiny kingdom of Swaziland.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said a document establishing diplomatic ties was signed on Saturday in Beijing between Wang Yi, the state councilor and foreign minister, and Burkina Faso\u2019s foreign minister, Alpha Barry.On Thursday, in a statement about the decision to break with Taiwan, Mr. Barry made no direct mention of China, saying only, \u201cThe evolution of the world and the socio-economic challenges of our country and region push us to reconsider our position.\u201dBeijing claims Taiwan as its own territory under its \u201cOne China\u201d principle, and has long refused to have diplomatic relations with any country that officially recognizes Taiwan. It has been ratcheting up pressure since President Tsai Ing-wen, whose party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan, took office two years ago.On Friday, Ms. Tsai said on Twitter that \u201cChina\u2019s growing pressure will only strengthen other countries\u2019 support for us.\u201d She added, \u201cWe will never back down.\u201dTaiwan\u2019s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said he had offered his resignation to the president, saying that Taiwan cannot compete with China\u2019s financial resources.\u201cI, along with our country\u2019s people, feel sad, angry and regretful,\u201d he said. \u201cChina grabbing our allies and giving us pressure in the diplomatic space will not shrink the distance across the strait and will not let cross-strait relations walk on a peaceful, friendly path.\u201dIt was unclear if Ms. Tsai had accepted his resignation.The Finance Ministry said, however, that it would end its aid programs in Burkina Faso and that Taiwan would close its embassy there.China is Africa\u2019s largest trade partner, with huge investments in mining, construction and banking, though it had been less active to date in Burkina Faso. It is set to host a summit meeting of African leaders in September in Beijing, where it will most likely offer new pledges of aid and preferential loans.The Vatican could be next, analysts say, as the Holy See and China edge closer to an accord on the appointment of bishops there.Some countries have switched back and forth between Beijing and Taipei several times. This is the second time Burkina Faso has cut ties with Taiwan. It previously did so in 1973, before resuming relations in 1994.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s \u201cAGM,\u201d an abbreviation of \u201cAnnual General Meeting,\u201d preferred by the finance crowd. And there\u2019s Mr. Buffett\u2019s personal favorite: \u201cWoodstock for capitalists.\u201dBut the most revealing name is the shortest one: the meeting. Just as some New Yorkers refer to the Big Apple as \u201cthe city,\u201d as if there were only one, scores of attendees consider this shareholders meeting to be in a class of its own.In part, that\u2019s because the atmosphere feels closer to a carnival than a buttoned-up investors\u2019 conference. There are tables of merchandise and costumed mascots, Ping-Pong matches and a movie reel of celebrity-filled skits and spoofs. There is an unofficial circuit of V.I.P. parties and piggyback events. At the center of it all is Mr. Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s chief executive, one of the world\u2019s most successful investors and the weekend\u2019s enthusiastic master of ceremonies.For Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Initialized Capital and a former executive chairman of Reddit, the fun began long before he touched down in Nebraska. \u201cThere\u2019s such a range of people, even just from the plane out of Newark to here,\u201d he said. Pointing to his business partner, Garry Tan, he added, \u201cThis guy talked to, uh, well, I don\u2019t want to name drop.\u201d As if on cue, the investor Li Lu walked up to shake Mr. Ohanian\u2019s hand; inches away, John Collison, the chief executive of Stripe, typed away on his laptop. For Mr. Tan, the big names mattered less than the Midwestern sensibilities: \u201cThere is a piece of this that really resonates with us, around being plain-spoken and investing in what you understand,\u201d he said. Revelers line up overnight to get in \u2014 or, in capitalist fashion, hire other people to stand in line for them. This year, many people expressed gratitude for the gentle breezes and sunshine, a welcome reprieve from the torrential rainstorms of past years. A handful of revelers were dressed up in bow ties and silver-glitter heels. Others climbed up poles to snap photos of the crowd.By 7 a.m., attendees were streaming into the arena. Many purchased fluffy pretzels and pink beverages adorned with umbrellas from the concessions stands and settled in to be entertained. A parody of Jay-Z and Alicia Keys\u2019s \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d blasted over the loudspeaker, but the lyrics were changed to: \u201cIn Berkshire, financial strength is where dreams are made of, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do.\u201d Then the \u201cmovie\u201d started rolling.As in previous years, Berkshire Hathaway had created a video reel of skits with celebrities, who ostensibly agree to participate for free. This year Katy Perry was one of about half a dozen big names on the screen, joking about the Left Shark debacle at the Super Bowl in 2015 and comparing the uncoordinated backup dancer to the Oracle of Omaha himself. The right shark, she said, was the one who showed up on time to rehearsal and got none of the credit \u2014 and that was Mr. Buffett\u2019s vice chairman Charlie Munger. The crowd applauded loudly.After the Berkshire Hathaway board was announced and earnings were delivered, the most beloved portion of the show began: Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger held a question-and-answer session, taking on topics like global politics and cryptocurrencies. Mr. Buffett dispensed wise advice and spoke with occasional self-effacing charm. Mr. Munger delivered deadpan one-liners that drew raucous laughs, including his comparison of virtual currencies to \u201cturds.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in business, this is the bucket-list event,\u201d said James Weber, the chief executive of Brooks Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s just priceless.\u201d For hard chargers in the financial industry, who are often laser-focused on performance, it\u2019s a reminder that business can be fun. \u201cEvery year that I come personally, I walk away energized,\u201d said Mr. Calkins of Benjamin Moore, who said he has attended the meeting 17 times. Even after the main event was over, there was still plenty of weekend left to enjoy. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t coming here because they\u2019re investing money,\u201d said Conner Van Fossen, an Air Force member who attended the event with his father, Jim Van Fossen, for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s about the spectacle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some of the crowd peered into arriving vehicles, but there was no indication that Mr. Najib and his wife were there.Also on Saturday, the daughter of the imprisoned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said that she expected him to be released on Tuesday.Mr. Anwar is a former deputy prime minister who was removed from office after falling out with Mr. Mahathir in 1998, and was then sentenced to prison for corruption and sodomy. He is now serving a five-year sentence on a second sodomy conviction. The cases against him have been called politically motivated.At a separate news conference on Saturday afternoon, Mr. Najib announced that he was resigning as president of the United Malays National Organization, the party that had governed the country since independence from Britain in 1957. He also said he was stepping down as chairman of Barisan Nasional, which had been the governing coalition until this past week\u2019s election.Mr. Mahathir, who previously served as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, said that any wrongdoing connected with 1MDB would be investigated.\u201cThere is sufficient evidence that an investigation into certain things that have been done by the former prime minister has to be done, and if necessary the rule of law will apply,\u201d he said.Mr. Mahathir added that the investigation would also look at whether officials had failed to fully pursue allegations in the 1MDB case. The government has to place \u201ccertain restrictions\u201d on \u201cpeople who may be involved in wrongdoing or making wrong decisions,\u201d he said.He added that the attorney general, Mohamed Apandi Ali, had been removed from office. \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t have an attorney general,\u201d he said.Mr. Mahathir also named a so-called council of elders that included the tycoon Robert Kuok to advise the new government.Mr. Lim was asked by a Chinese journalist how he felt about being the first ethnic Chinese to hold his position in 44 years.\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself as a Chinese,\u201d he responded. \u201cI am a Malaysian.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of Malaysia\u2019s new prime minister.

The other is a financial powerhouse with few offerings for everyday consumers.Now they\u2019re trying to join forces.Apple and Goldman Sachs have been working for months on a new credit card product that would bear the Apple Pay brand, according to two people familiar with the companies\u2019 talks. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were continuing.The product would be Goldman\u2019s first credit card offering and could help the bank\u2019s effort to expand its consumer products. For Apple, the deal could help it extend its Apple Pay brand, the technology giant\u2019s digital payment service.The two companies have been talking for months and haven\u2019t settled on all the details, said one of the people.Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. Christine Monaghan, an Apple spokeswoman, also declined to comment.The new card would fit into the suite of consumer products that Goldman recently began offering, like a savings account and an array of personal loans through its consumer banking service, Marcus. Goldman hopes to use those new products to reduce its reliance on trading revenue in the years to come.The card could help Goldman insert itself into the lives of iPhone users, who represent a far broader swath of consumers than the company now serves, and eventually open them up to the other services the bank has to offer.\u201cThis seems to make sense,\u201d said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, \u201cIt\u2019s just one piece of a much bigger puzzle that is forming that is Goldman Sachs\u2019s consumer finance business.\u201dPart of Goldman\u2019s recent consumer buildup has focused on credit cards. In December, the bank hired a team from a credit card start-up called Final. In April it bought a mobile app, Clarity Money, that helps users search for the best credit card deals. It has been downloaded a million times.Apple already has one branded credit card, offered by Barclays. That card allows users to earn points they can use for Apple gift cards or for financing the purchase of new Apple products.Apple executives have said they aim for Apple Pay to eventually replace cash and plastic as the primary way to pay. But Apple\u2019s payment service has a long way to go. One of the people familiar with the discussions between Apple and Goldman said that taking Apple Pay into the physical world would help expand its reach. With an Apple Pay credit card, loyal iPhone users could use Apple Pay even in places that don\u2019t yet accept digital payments, the person said.\u201cIt\u2019s such a competitive credit card marketplace right now, especially for higher end folks,\u201d said Matt Schulz, a CreditCards.com analyst. \u201cThe Apple Barclays card isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s going to turn that person\u2019s head, in terms of making them want to get a card. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what these two brands can do to create something that might make more of a splash.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Legal Issues Raised by the Stormy Daniels Payment, Explained", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The disclosure by Rudolph W. Giuliani that President Trump repaid his longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for the $130,000 hush-money payment made to a pornographic actress shortly before the 2016 election has put new scrutiny on the legal issues raised by the unusual transaction.Mr. Trump has never reported this expenditure, loan or repayment \u2014 either in campaign filings with the Federal Election Commission or on his financial disclosure form with the government ethics office. But it remains murky what exactly Mr. Trump knew, and when he learned it.A threshold question is whether the payment to the actress, Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, was intended to influence the election by suppressing a claim that could hurt Mr. Trump\u2019s chances. If so, the transaction was most likely covered by federal campaign finance laws.Those laws barred candidates\u2019 supporters from making donations \u2014 including in-kind donations \u2014 worth more than $2,700 to presidential campaigns during the 2016 general election. And while those laws allow candidates to spend an unlimited amount of their own money to help their campaigns, they require the candidates to disclose such self-funding, both as donations to their campaigns and as expenditures. But if the motive for the payment was unrelated to the election, then it was not covered by those laws.Recent history suggests that it can be tricky to prove that the motive behind such a payment was political rather than personal. In 2012, the Justice Department prosecuted John Edwards, the former Democratic senator from North Carolina, over payments from wealthy donors that were used to hide his pregnant mistress while he ran for president. Mr. Edwards\u2019s lawyers argued that he was instead trying to hide the affair from his wife.In an interview on Thursday on the Fox News program \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Mr. Giuliani insisted that the payment was not a campaign contribution. He said Mr. Cohen was trying to help Mr. Trump\u2019s family \u201cto save their marriage \u2014 not their marriage so much as their reputation.\u201d But then, muddying that message, Mr. Giuliani said, \u201cImagine if that came out on Oct. 15, 2016, in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton.\u201d Separately, in an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that \u201cit could overlap as a campaign problem,\u201d but reiterated that Mr. Trump was not thinking of the payment as a campaign expense.It could work in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor that he and his lawyers had a long history of using legal avenues to try to fight off damaging claims. That history could form the basis of an argument that Mr. Cohen\u2019s payment to Ms. Clifford \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s reimbursement of it \u2014 would have happened whether or not he was running for president.From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress.\u201cIf this was a first-time candidate without a public reputation, then it would be harder to argue that it wasn\u2019t an expenditure to influence an election,\u201d said Charles Spies, a Republican election lawyer who worked in support of one of Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, in the 2016 Republican primary. \u201cBut Donald Trump has a long record of aggressively defending his reputation from attacks.\u201dIn an interview with The Times, Mr. Giuliani was vague about key questions concerning what Mr. Trump knew and when he knew it, saying that Mr. Trump \u201cdid know that there was a form of reimbursements\u201d to Mr. Cohen over the course of 2017, but maintaining that the president did not know what it was for specifically. Mr. Giuliani also said that some executives at the Trump Organization \u201cknew about the fact that Cohen believes money was owed to him \u2014 I don\u2019t know when that came up.\u201dWhen campaign finance violations are punished, they typically result in fines by the Federal Election Commission that are pegged to the size of the unlawful contribution or expenditure. The Justice Department can also prosecute willful violations of election laws, or willful false statements on the federal personal financial disclosure forms, which are felonies and can result in up to five years in prison.There is little chance that the department would file charges against Mr. Trump, regardless of what the evidence shows, because its Office of Legal Counsel has opined that the Constitution makes sitting presidents immune from prosecution.But Mr. Cohen, after the raid last month, is under intense legal pressure.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It is oriented around a central courtyard and garden, in traditional Spanish style.The double-height front doors are 300 years old and made of chestnut with large forged-iron nails. Throughout the house are period materials from Spain, Morocco and France installed during the renovation, including plaster cornices and floors of handmade terra-cotta tile. All of the main rooms have period fireplaces with wood-burning stoves, and all of the furniture is included in the asking price.On the ground floor, there is a large drawing room, a dining room and an English country-style kitchen with a vintage Aga stove and two antique chandeliers. There are also five bedrooms, each with an en-suite bathroom and a private terrace, as well as a Moroccan-style indoor pool with red plaster walls, antique tiles and Moroccan lamps.At the rear of the house are terraced gardens and an outdoor pool. The rest of the grounds are covered by trees that produce manzanilla olives, famed for their sweetness. They are harvested in November and December, Mr. Day said, and sold to a local cooperative.The property also includes a single-car garage and a storeroom in the courtyard.Several small villages with restaurants and markets are a 10- to 15-minute drive from the house, Mr. Day said. Seville, the capital of Andalusia and a popular tourist destination near the southern coast of Spain, is about a 30-minute drive. Known for its Moorish castle, old cathedral and other historic sites, it is also the location of the nearest international airport.MARKET OVERVIEWMajor cities like Madrid and Barcelona began recovering first, said Alexander Vaughan, a founder of the Lucas Fox real estate agency in Barcelona. And \u201cnow the second- and third-tier cities are starting to pick up,\u201d he said.An improving economy and increased demand from international buyers are driving sales, agents said, noting that banks have also loosened mortgage restrictions, making it easier for buyers to finance a purchase.\u201cThe financial system is granting mortgages easier than during the crisis, but not as carelessly as it did previously,\u201d said Constanza Maya, the head of expansion and support for the real estate agency Engel & V\u00f6lkers Spain.But there has been little new construction in recent years, which has pushed up home prices in prime locations, said Ignacio Guzm\u00e1n, the director of the commercial division at Kristina Szekely Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, in Andalusia. \u201cFor a year and a half now, demand has exceeded supply,\u201d Mr. Guzm\u00e1n said.While sales in some parts of Spain remain depressed, said Mark Stucklin, who runs Spanish Property Insight, a website that tracks the housing market, \u201cgenerally speaking, demand and prices are rising in regional capitals and tourist destinations like Seville.\u201dSeville\u2019s historic district and architecture play a role in that, giving the area a unique \u201creal estate heritage,\u201d Mr. Guzm\u00e1n said, adding that traditional Andalusian homes are \u201cvery attractive for both local and foreign buyers.\u201dBut in Seville and the surrounding area, where demand has also been increasing steadily, \u201chousing stock is incredibly limited,\u201d said Karina Karlsen, an agent with Fine & Country, the company listing this property.Interest in property there, she noted, is driven by the low crime levels, the availability of land for horses and by \u201chobby farmers\u201d interested in income from crops. This home, she said, could also be converted into a small hotel, another option popular with today\u2019s buyers.WHO BUYS IN SEVILLEWhile most international buyers are looking for a second home or a place to retire, agents said, others are looking for homes to buy as an investment and for rental income.But the Seville area tends to be more of a \u201clocal\u201d market, said Ms. Maya of Engel & V\u00f6lkers Spain, attracting buyers from elsewhere in the country, particularly Madrid, who \u201cdecide to buy when the economy is going well and when buying in the capital is no longer possible for their budgets.\u201dBUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreigners buying property in Spain, although nonresidents must first obtain a tax identification number. There is also a Golden Visa program that provides residency status to noncitizens who invest at least 500,000 euros (or about $588,000) in a property.But foreign buyers would be advised to hire a lawyer to guide them through the process, as \u201cthe Spanish housing market lacks transparency,\u201d Mr. Stucklin said.Also, he said, \u201cforeigners looking to buy need to do much more research to get an idea of pricing and what sells and what doesn\u2019t before they jump in.\u201dA lawyer can research the title and ensure that there are no liens on the property, said Mr. Vaughan, of the Lucas Fox agency. That is especially important in rural areas, he added, where the specifics of deeds and boundary lines are \u201cnot always that clear.\u201dBuyers are generally required to provide a 10 percent deposit when a contract is signed. Mortgages are available to foreign buyers, but rates can be much higher than in other countries and usually cover only 50 to 70 percent of the sale price.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESSpanish; euro (1 euro = $1.18)TAXES AND FEESBuyers can expect to pay 12 to 15 percent of the purchase price in taxes and fees, including a 10 percent transfer tax and notary fees, agents said.The lawyer\u2019s fee is typically about 1 percent of the sale price.

{"Headline": "The Eviction Machine Churning Through New York City", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "Housing court, a system created to protect tenants, has become a powerful tool for landlords.Articles in this series examine New York's broken system for protecting tenants and affordable apartments.When Neri Carranza went to see the apartment on West 109th Street in Manhattan, she folded money into the pocket of her blue jacket, just in case she liked the place. This would be the first apartment she had ever looked at, the first time she could make a home of her own, paid for with the earnings from her first job, at a glass factory. And the apartment was exactly as her friend from church had described it: small but comfortable.So on a freezing Sunday in 1956, Ms. Carranza, then 32, with a crown of black hair and a fierce desire for independence, moved into the narrow two-bedroom apartment. She made it her own, cleaning and decorating every Sunday, planting yellow roses and hot-pink geraniums in window boxes, painting the walls white when they needed a new coat. As landlords came and went, Ms. Carranza stayed, becoming a fixture in the largely Latino neighborhood.Articles in this series examine New York's broken system for protecting tenants and affordable apartments.\u201cI had everything I ever wanted,\u201d Ms. Carranza said.But one day in 2010, when she was 87, Ms. Carranza learned that her new landlord wanted to evict her for what seemed like the most nonsensical reason: She supposedly didn\u2019t live in her own beloved home.She was hardly the only tenant facing eviction by the owners, the Orbach Group, a New Jersey-based company that had recently paid about $76 million for her building and 21 others nearby, a Monopoly move that effectively snapped up most of the residential real estate along a block of West 109th Street. Orbach had filed eviction suits in housing court against scores of her neighbors in rent-regulated apartments.What happened to Ms. Carranza and the others shows how New York City\u2019s housing court system, created in part to shelter tenants from dangerous conditions, has instead become a tool for landlords to push them out and wrest a most precious civic commodity \u2014 affordable housing \u2014 out of regulation and into the free market.New York\u2019s housing system can be complicated to navigate. Here\u2019s a quick primer on what your rights are and how to exercise them.New York\u2019s housing system can be complicated to navigate. Here\u2019s a quick primer on what your rights are and how to exercise them.Rent-regulated apartments, often the only homes in New York that people of modest means can afford, are vanishing as gentrification surges inexorably through the city\u2019s neighborhoods. Mayor Bill de Blasio, now in his second term, has staked much of his legacy on alleviating this crisis of disappearing affordable housing and rising homelessness.It\u2019s not just that the city\u2019s booming population and economy have spawned a wildly lucrative free market. The entire structure of tenant protections \u2014 while probably still the nation\u2019s strongest, at least on paper \u2014 has been steadily eroded by landlord-friendly laws adopted in Albany and haphazard regulation.Landlords, especially the corporate owners who control an increasing share of the market, follow a standard playbook to push tenants out. That is often the first step toward raising the rent enough \u2014 beyond $2,733.75 a month, under current rules \u2014 to break the shackles of regulation. Owners may offer tenants buyouts to leave. They may harass them with poor services and constant construction. And, sometimes on the flimsiest of evidence, they may sue them in housing court.It is impossible to say how many evictions are unjust. Many people sued for eviction do owe some back rent, and some tenants certainly abuse the court system, remaining in their apartments for months without paying. For small landlords, such tenants can mean fiscal ruin.But an investigation by The New York Times illustrates how the Orbach Group and other mega-landlords exploit a broken and overburdened system. In one of the busiest courts in the nation, errors often go uncaught and dubious allegations go unquestioned. Lawsuits are easy to file but onerous to fight. Landlords have lawyers. Tenants usually don\u2019t, despite a new law that aims to provide free counsel to low-income New Yorkers.Landlords rely on what amounts to an eviction machine. A cadre of lawyers handles tens of thousands of cases a year, making money off volume and sometimes manipulating gaps in enforcement to bring questionable cases. Punishable conduct is rarely punished.Process servers, required to notify tenants that they are being sued, sometimes violate the law. Among tenants whom servers had supposedly talked to in person, The Times found several who were abroad at the time. One had been dead for years.Judges sometimes unwittingly ordered the eviction of tenants who had no idea they had been sued.\u201cWhen they sent the marshal, they never gave us no notice,\u201d said Zanden Alzanden, a Yemeni immigrant who was evicted from his home in the historic Dunbar Apartments in Harlem when he was in the hospital in January 2017. \u201cNothing on door, ever. Only that day, the marshal coming in, my son and an old guy sitting in there: \u2018Boom boom, get the hell out of here.\u2019\u201dTo see what happens when vulnerable New Yorkers are cast into this eviction bureaucracy, The Times analyzed a database of more than a million housing court cases filed between 2011 and mid-2016. The Times also interviewed hundreds of tenants, lawyers and tenant organizers and examined in detail more than a thousand housing court cases from the past decade. It looked especially closely at two places: the Orbach buildings on 109th Street and the Dunbar Apartments two miles uptown.What emerged were often-overlapping modes of harassment: by landlords\u2019 fraudulent or exaggerated claims, by disrepair and by overall court dysfunction.About 232,000 cases were filed last year against tenants, roughly one for every 10 city rentals. Most tenants were accused of owing back rent. But in many cases, tenants were sued for rent they did not owe. Sometimes they had paid, only to have landlords claim that the checks mistakenly remained uncashed or had been lost in the mail; sometimes they were sued for money owed by a government program. Sometimes, tenants withheld rent only because much-needed repairs had never been done.New York Times reporters would like to hear from people across the country about their experiences in housing court. We may contact you to hear more about your story.Required fields are marked with an asterisk.First and last preferred, please.Street address, city and state (or borough), please.Thank you for your submission.In recent years, landlords have also increasingly turned to a different kind of eviction suit, like the one against Ms. Carranza. Known as holdovers, these cases involve purported lease violations. Often the violations are minuscule. Sometimes they are simply fabricated. Even as the overall number of eviction lawsuits has fallen over the last decade, the proportion of holdovers has grown, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens, epicenters of gentrification. A decade ago in Queens, about one in six lawsuits was a holdover. Last year, roughly one in four was.The dislocations from housing court can echo for years. Although evictions are relatively rare \u2014 there were about 21,100 last year \u2014 many tenants, tired of battling, decide to leave on their own. Some end up doubled up with relatives or in homeless shelters. At the Dunbar, more than a quarter of the tenants sued since 2013 have left.Fallou Diop, whose family lived a few doors down from Ms. Carranza on 109th Street, was sued twice by Orbach: in 2009 for falling behind on his $1,144-a-month rent, and in 2011 for allegedly subletting rooms in his apartment. He paid his back rent. The \u201csubletters\u201d were relatives who had lived with him for 19 years. But about two years after winning the second case, Mr. Diop agreed to leave.\u201cI was sick of fighting with them and sick of the harassment,\u201d said Mr. Diop, a retired baker who said he took a $50,000 buyout, a seeming fortune at the time. He then rented an apartment in the Bronx for $2,700 a month.The deal did not work out so well for Mr. Diop. The buyout money ran out. At 65, he sleeps on his ex-girlfriend\u2019s couch.With a monthly rent of about $300, Ms. Carranza\u2019s apartment was a prime target.In July 2010, the Orbach Group filed its holdover suit against Ms. Carranza, charging that she was illegally using her apartment as a storage unit while living with a nearby friend. Court documents called the apartment \u201cinaccessible and uninhabitable,\u201d packed with newspapers and trash.Photos taken five months earlier by Ms. Carranza\u2019s niece showed her sitting in the apartment, watching TV. It was crowded with furniture but well kept, with no newspapers, no trash.But mold covered the walls. Light fixtures and kitchen cabinets had rusted out. Parts of the floor had come up. The kitchen ceiling sagged.Housing court was not supposed to be used this way, as a cudgel against tenants in decrepit housing. The system was created in 1973 with a very different mission: to foster the repair and preservation of New York\u2019s aging housing stock. It also aimed to provide a single forum for landlord-tenant disputes, which had overwhelmed civil courts.The court soon crashed headlong into a business opportunity.After years of suburban flight, urban malaise and fiscal crisis, New York in the early 1990s was a city on the rebound. Neighborhoods previously considered off-limits to the upwardly mobile began to gentrify.At the same time, state lawmakers gutted protections for tenants in rent-regulated apartments. Large companies scooped up buildings, trying to flip affordable apartments into luxury rentals or convert them to co-ops or condominiums.Around the same time, Pinnacle advertised its 22 buildings on 109th Street. It wanted a single buyer.The Orbach Group was a relatively new player in New York. Meyer Orbach, who grew up in his family\u2019s real estate business, had formed the company about six years earlier, focusing on commercial and high-end residential properties. But as the 2008 financial crisis hit, the Orbach Group entered the regulated game, buying 13 buildings on West 49th Street. In May 2009, Orbach bought Pinnacle\u2019s buildings on West 109th.Orbach also adopted Pinnacle\u2019s business model. Between 2008 and 2010, it sued 182 tenants, targeting roughly one in three apartments, court records show. Orbach also relied heavily on holdover lawsuits. One in three Orbach eviction cases was a holdover, compared with one in 10 citywide.Holdover lawsuits have a distinct advantage for aggressive landlords: They can be filed with little proof, yet they can require tenants to go to court repeatedly and turn over years of personal information.\u201cThey are fishing expeditions,\u201d said Michael Grinthal, a supervising lawyer with the Community Development Project at the Urban Justice Center.Bringing a holdover case requires so little evidence, Mr. Grinthal said, that one Brooklyn landlord filed 23 identical lawsuits, accusing tenants of \u201csmoking and/or drinking and/or gambling and/or loitering.\u201d Shaken, some tenants moved, Mr. Grinthal said.In response to questions about its use of housing court, an Orbach spokeswoman, Sandra Kittel, said the company was \u201cdeeply committed to affordable housing\u201d and had kept thousands of apartments affordable.To prove that Ms. Carranza was living with a friend, Harry Tawil, the manager of most Orbach buildings in New York, said \u201ca database search\u201d revealed that she had not used her address to apply for credit in almost five years. He also swore that \u201cNeri Carranza admits that she does not reside in the subject premises.\u201dMs. Carranza and her friend said this was not true.Lawyers for Orbach asked Ms. Carranza for documents stretching back almost five years, including hospital bills, bank statements, electric bills, W-2 and 1099 forms, and tax returns. Also any wills and codicils, passport, driver\u2019s license, social security card and birth certificate.Ms. Carranza, who speaks only Spanish, considered every court document, written in English and slipped under her door, an insult. She was lucky enough to get a lawyer working pro bono, and ultimately she won. But the case stretched for more than three years. In the meantime, repairs were ordered but not done. Punitive damages were sought but not awarded. Still, the papers kept arriving. Ms. Carranza kept going to court.\u201cWhen I\u2019d see those papers on the floor, I would say to myself, \u2018Those sons of their mothers!\u2019\u201d said Ms. Carranza, who holds a black belt in karate and prefers Lanc\u00f4me perfume to all others. \u201cI would shake from the anger,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was an injustice.\u201dThe Dunbar Apartments began as one of America\u2019s grandest experiments in housing reform. Built by John D. Rockefeller Jr. in the 1920s and named for the black poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, the complex was the nation\u2019s first large housing cooperative for African-Americans.Eventually, though, the co-ops became rentals, and the Dunbar slid through a series of owners and stages of disrepair. The current landlord is a limited liability company formed by a Brooklyn company, E&M Associates, which bought the complex in 2013 after a foreclosure on Pinnacle\u2019s mortgage. And with Harlem a real estate hot zone, E&M has worked to remake the Dunbar, pushing out longtime tenants, remodeling vacant apartments and charging far higher rents.The churn and renovation have left the Dunbar in turmoil, divided between old tenants and new, and sometimes between black and white. To some longtime residents, the fresh paint and gleaming appliances installed next door signify that the landlord is letting their own homes decay to drive them out.\u201cI\u2019m gonna put it to you straight: They want the black folks to move out,\u201d said Lynette Williams, 80, who has lived in the Dunbar for 21 years. \u201cBecause the white people can come in and pay more.\u201dThrough a web of limited liability companies, E&M has an ownership interest in at least 90 New York buildings with regulated apartments, property records show. Until recently, a section of its website aimed at investors boasted that E&M approached every property \u201cfrom an investor\u2019s point of view, seeking to understand the underlying intrinsic value of the property, as well as the steps that must be taken to unlock that value.\u201d A link to the section for residents was broken.(After The Times reached out to the company, it took down its website. In response to questions, E&M also said it had \u201chad no involvement with Dunbar Apartments\u201d since mid-2017, although property records show no sale. The company did not respond to requests for an explanation.)Housing court has helped E&M unlock value. In less than five years of ownership, records show, the landlord has sued at least 250 rent-regulated tenants \u2014 almost half the Dunbar \u2014 some multiple times. There have been more than 500 lawsuits in all.Housing court records show only six successful evictions. But 15 more tenants may have been evicted: Records show that eviction warrants were issued, and those people are no longer in their apartments. Eleven other tenants agreed to leave to settle their cases.But that tells only part of the story: Dozens of others left after being sued. Many said they were tired of going to housing court to fight over repairs. All told, 67 of the tenants who were sued \u2014 more than one in four \u2014 are no longer living in the Dunbar.Most Dunbar cases examined by The Times were brought over back rent, as are most eviction suits citywide. And many tenants did owe money.But roughly a third of the cases either were discontinued because the rent had been paid or were simply dropped, indicating that the case had been filed by mistake, or that the tenant had paid after being sued or had simply moved. That raises questions about whether such suits are aimed at harassing tenants.In another third of cases, tenants admitted that they had stopped paying rent but also said their apartments needed repairs. By law, tenants may withhold rent to secure repairs.Several tenants said the only way to get problems fixed was to stop paying rent, be sued and then tell a judge.\u201cWhen they took me to court I was frustrated and upset, so I was withholding my money,\u201d said Katrina Stanley, 51, who lives in the apartment her great-grandmother moved into in the 1920s. \u201cThey sent an unlicensed person to fix my ceiling. And just as quick as he fixed it, the ceiling fell again.\u201dMany tenants complained of leaks. One apartment needed so much work, it failed an inspection for federal rent subsidies. One woman was awarded a major rent reduction after complaining of mold, cockroaches and the improper disposal of a corpse in a nearby apartment.Idrissa Sidibe, 54, a truck driver, moved into the Dunbar in 2001. Over the years, he said, he complained repeatedly about a loose hot-water tap in his bathtub.Last July, the Dunbar sued Mr. Sidibe for almost $2,600 in back rent, which Mr. Sidibe disputed. Three days before the first court hearing, Mr. Sidibe tried to add hot water to a lukewarm bath when the running water blasted scalding hot. Shocked by the pain, Mr. Sidibe struggled out of the tub, then collapsed onto the floor.His closest friend found him and called an ambulance. Photographs showed layers of skin peeling off his right foot and burns on his legs. Mr. Sidibe required skin grafts and spent more than seven weeks at Harlem Hospital Center. While he was there, his kidneys nearly failed \u2014 and the judge approved his eviction.\u201cI was in the hospital thinking, \u2018How am I going to get out of here and make a payment?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Sidibe, who staved off eviction and sued the landlord for his injuries. That case is pending.In response to questions, E&M said through its lawyers that because of neglect by previous owners, the Dunbar required vast work to meet the company\u2019s safety, cleanliness and security standards. The lawyers said they could not comment on individual cases but questioned whether tenants had actually left over the lack of repairs or fatigue at going to housing court.\u201cWe believe it reasonable to assume they left without paying rent that was owed and/or to avoid eviction,\u201d wrote Renee Digrugilliers, a lawyer with the firm Horing Welikson & Rosen.Ms. Digrugilliers said many tenants filed \u201cbogus repair claims\u201d and often made it difficult to do repairs by refusing to allow workers into their apartments. The owner, she said, sued only tenants who did not pay rent or otherwise broke the rules.Even when cases are quickly abandoned \u2014 as in a fifth of eviction suits citywide \u2014 there can be significant repercussions.Laurie Weisman says she was not behind in her rent when she was sued by the Dunbar in March 2017. So she was shocked when a reporter informed her of the lawsuit. (Ms. Digrugilliers said her firm had been given ledgers showing Ms. Weisman behind in rent.)\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re throwing a spitball and seeing if it sticks,\u201d Ms. Weisman said.\u201cI feel cornered,\u201d Ms. Weisman said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here, but I can\u2019t leave.\u201dOn April 11, 2017, the law firm Green & Cohen sued three rent-regulated tenants in a building on West 111th Street.One case was filed and dropped. The tenants in another hired a lawyer, who got Green & Cohen to agree that the lawsuit had been filed in error.In the third case, the tenant, Carolyn Opalisky, a retired jazz club owner, didn\u2019t hire a lawyer. She signed an agreement known as a stipulation, affirming that she owed about $1,325. The next day, Green & Cohen filed eviction papers, though her first payment wasn\u2019t due for more than a month.\u201cI did comply!!\u201d Ms. Opalisky wrote in a court response. \u201cSo why eviction???\u201dThe judge sided with Ms. Opalisky.Because few lawyers are ever sanctioned, the system creates an incentive to file as many cases as possible, regardless of merit.Volume is central to the business model of many law firms that represent landlords in New York. One firm, Gutman, Mintz, Baker & Sonnenfeldt, brought almost 110,000 eviction cases over five years, more than 10 percent of all cases for privately owned buildings.Some firms, The Times found, repeatedly sued tenants even after being told that they owed no rent. Sometimes rent ledgers were wrong. Sometimes lawyers sued for money owed by government programs, usually not allowed.Firms often file cookie-cutter suits, filling in rent numbers and landlord names on documents that otherwise remain the same, without verifying landlords\u2019 information. The filings echo abuses committed during the foreclosure crisis, when banks churned through hundreds of documents without reviewing them for accuracy.Most tenants do not have lawyers, even as big landlords keep lawyers on retainer. At the Dunbar, tenants had lawyers in fewer than 10 percent of the cases reviewed by The Times. Landlord lawyers go from courtroom to courtroom, pulling tenants into hallways to agree to stipulations before they ever see a judge. Tenants who do not speak English face particular problems: In Queens, more than 160 languages are spoken, but the court has staff interpreters for just three, the commission reported. Some tenants said they felt pressured to agree to deals they did not understand.\u201cThey go in there with their fancy lawyers, and don\u2019t let tenants speak,\u201d said Pandora Holt, who has lived at the Dunbar for 22 years and has been sued four times by E&M.Judges are hard-pressed to tell if certain landlords are filing inordinate numbers of eviction suits. Housing cases, unlike those brought in other courts, are not available digitally, and often lawsuits identify only the limited liability company listed as landlord, not the underlying owner. Judges can\u2019t even get a full picture of what is happening in one building. On Feb. 5, Horing, Welikson & Rosen sued 38 tenants at the Dunbar. Those cases \u2014 among 60 suits that a single lawyer filed that day against tenants in 18 buildings \u2014 were parceled out to at least six judges.Green & Cohen is considerably smaller than other firms but has represented large landlords like E&M and Orbach. (Orbach appears to have recently stopped using the firm.)An analysis of hundreds of Green & Cohen\u2019s cases revealed sloppy paperwork in many. The firm sued tenants for money due from government agencies, misstated rents and misspelled names. It submitted erroneous rent ledgers and documents that belonged in different cases.In 2015, a federal class-action lawsuit against Green & Cohen said that the firm had seemingly used \u201cthe same template for all the hundreds of cases that they filed against tenants within the State of New York within the past year,\u201d and that it had determined that meaningfully reviewing cases before filing was \u201cnot as lucrative as the filing of pleadings and motions\u201d without review. The case was confidentially settled.Even lawyers who engage in misconduct are unlikely to face penalties. Between 2011 and 2016, landlords or their lawyers were sanctioned or cited for contempt in housing court fewer than 50 times. The court doesn\u2019t even track lawyers or landlords who get in trouble.Housing court judges rarely impose sanctions unless lawyers request them. But more than two dozen tenant lawyers said they feared seeking sanctions.In October 2016, for instance, Orbach sued Margarita Galvez, saying she owed more than $12,000 on her Upper West Side apartment. Green & Cohen pursued that lawsuit even though Ms. Galvez\u2019s lawyer, Rachel Hannaford, insisted that the rent had been paid. The rent ledger itself showed a $138.50 credit.Ms. Hannaford asked for sanctions, but only against Orbach. \u201cI knew that my little lawsuit wasn\u2019t going to get Green & Cohen sanctioned, and didn\u2019t think it was worth the risk and the harm to future clients,\u201d she said.Ultimately, as part of a stipulation, she dropped that request. Ms. Galvez had not wanted to drag out the case.Ms. Carranza also ran afoul of Green & Cohen. In July 2014, almost a year after the last court date in her first case, Orbach sued her again, saying she owed about $5,500, more than half her annual income.\u201cThe neighbors would tell me, \u2018The landlord is saying you owe a lot of money,\u2019\u201d Ms. Carranza recalled. \u201cCan you imagine? I was so embarrassed.\u201dIt took her lawyers almost seven months to prove that whatever rent was missing was owed by a city program.Wesley Moise is a process server, charged with notifying tenants that they face possible eviction. Judging from entries in court records, he also appears to have acquired some of the salient skills of a mountain goat.On March 24, 2017, Mr. Moise reported, he delivered notices to six Dunbar tenants in 12 minutes.The Dunbar has 44 stairwells and 536 apartments. Each stairwell has its own front door. There are no elevators.Yet Mr. Moise claimed that, in those 12 minutes, he raced from the third floor of one stairwell to the fourth floor of another stairwell, to the sixth floor of a third stairwell, to the third floor of a fourth stairwell, to the third floor of a fifth stairwell and finally back to the fifth floor of the fourth stairwell. Each time, he needed to ring a doorbell and be let inside the building.\u201cI know this building,\u201d said Julio Almonte, who lives in the fourth apartment Mr. Moise claimed to have visited that morning. \u201cEven if I wanted to, there\u2019s no way I could go to six different apartments in 12 minutes.\u201d Mr. Moise, he insisted, did not show up at his door.A process server\u2019s job may sound mundane, but it is crucial: A tenant who does not appear in court can end up evicted after a default judgment. \u201cYou have to get notice and be able to defend yourself,\u201d explained housing court\u2019s supervising judge, Jean T. Schneider.The Times examined hundreds of cases involving an agency that contracts with Mr. Moise, Howard Belfer Inc., which is routinely hired by law firms representing Orbach and E&M. A range of problems emerged: improbable routes, hard-to-recreate travel times, signatures by one notary public on top of another\u2019s typed name, and in-person encounters that tenants say never happened.In an eviction case, a landlord must try to notify a tenant in person on two separate occasions, with two separate documents. Each time, a process server should knock and wait several minutes, returning another day if no one answers, according to case law. If there is still no response, the server must leave a notice on or under the door.There is one further opportunity to alert a tenant in person. The landlord is supposed to verify that the tenant is not in the military or dependent on a service member, a federal requirement protecting military families from eviction.But the courts depend on process servers and those who file nonmilitary affidavits to do what they say. Servers must keep GPS tracking data, which is notoriously fuzzy, and log books, but audits are rare.About 33,000 tenants last year faced judgments for failing to appear in court. It\u2019s not clear how often bad service leads to such default judgments. But tenants who first learn about a case from subsequent eviction notices look like scofflaws in court.Mr. Alzanden, the Dunbar tenant evicted while hospitalized, had to pay more than $4,200 to recover his apartment \u2014 for rent he said he didn\u2019t owe, as well as marshal and legal fees and storage of his belongings. \u201cWe had no choice,\u201d he said.A judge can order a hearing when service is disputed; about 800 are held every year. Service agencies are supposed to report them to the city\u2019s Department of Consumer Affairs. Not all comply.Most violations result in modest fines and consent orders. Instead of revoking licenses, the city usually opts to deny license renewals.Others have kept their licenses despite numerous violations. In August 2016, Nationwide Court Services, based on Long Island, settled 287 violations.In 2012, his agency\u2019s license was suspended for a month. In 2013 Mr. Belfer paid a $60,000 fine and agreed to monitor servers.Yet his servers continued to have problems. Camera footage showed that one Belfer contractor, Dwayne Thomas, had not appeared when he claimed to have served a legal notice in May 2015, a federal lawsuit says. In 2016, the city denied a license renewal to another server, Hakeem Jamal, in part because he claimed to have served a woman at Vincent Yeats\u2019s apartment in the Dunbar one minute before serving someone 17 miles away in Queens.\u201cIt was total malarkey,\u201d said Mr. Yeats, who lived alone and found out about the case days before a possible eviction. \u201cI had such hassle from them, I just gave up and moved.\u201dMr. Jamal, who also worked for Nationwide, said it had fabricated the service in Queens. Nationwide disputed that, saying it had been \u201cduped by an unscrupulous server.\u201dMr. Thomas and Mr. Moise did not respond to requests for comment.Ms. Digrugilliers, the lawyer for E&M, said Mr. Belfer\u2019s company was one of several used by her firm. She said the firm was not aware of any fine against Mr. Belfer\u2019s company, and disputed tenants\u2019 claims of being improperly served.Last fall, The Times requested public records on Mr. Belfer\u2019s company from the Department of Consumer Affairs. In late February, after months of extensions to gather documents, the agency denied much of the request, citing an investigation into Mr. Belfer.At the Dunbar, Mr. Belfer handled many of the nonmilitary affidavits himself. He reported speaking with 15 tenants in 2016 and 2017, one twice.But all 15 tenants told The Times they had never met Mr. Belfer. Two were out of the country when he said he visited them. Five had moved out.Mr. Belfer also claimed to have spoken to another tenant, Edward Robinson, on Dec. 5, 2015. Mr. Robinson had died \u2014 22 years earlier.There was significant fallout: Since 2015, six tenants whom Mr. Belfer claimed to have spoken to were locked out. Three had to pay legal and marshal fees to recover their apartments.When a reporter visited his Long Island office, Mr. Belfer said he did not want to discuss his business. But when asked about nonmilitary affidavits at the Dunbar, he responded: \u201cThese people do not pay their rent. They will say anything to anybody.\u201dThe Orbach Group\u2019s buildings on 109th Street illustrate how a landlord can alter a neighborhood. Once an apartment empties out, workers chop it into smaller rooms and install new fixtures, all catering to students at nearby Columbia University.College students don\u2019t complain much, don\u2019t know much about rent regulation and don\u2019t stay long. Every new tenant means an opportunity for a higher regulated rent, until the apartment hits the free market.The plan is working. In 2009, when Orbach arrived on 109th Street, 285 of the 381 apartments were rent-stabilized, the most common kind of regulation, tax bills show. But by 2016, the most recent data available, only 121 were.Percentage of rent-stablilized unitsin each Orbach-owned building:0%255075100NOT OWNED BY THE ORBACH GOUP20092016BROADWAYBROADWAYWEST 109TH ST.WEST 109TH ST.AMSTERDAM  AVE.AMSTERDAM  AVE.WEST 109TH ST.WEST 109TH ST.COLUMBUS  AVE.COLUMBUS  AVE.Percentage ofrent-stabilized units in eachOrbach-owned building:Not owned bythe Orbach Group0%2550751002009AMSTERDAM  AVE.COLUMBUS  AVE.BROADWAYWEST 109TH ST.WEST 109TH ST.2016AMSTERDAM  AVE.COLUMBUS  AVE.BROADWAYWEST 109TH ST.WEST 109TH ST.By The New York Times | Source: New York City Department of FinanceIn November 2014, at age 91, Ms. Carranza was living on about $830 a month in what her lawyers described as \u201chorrendous conditions.\u201d She had been through 19 court dates.That month, a judge ordered Orbach to fix the apartment. Because the work would be so extensive, Ms. Carranza\u2019s belongings were moved into storage. She went to stay with her niece, Melinda Torres in Carlisle, Pa. The family regularly visited the empty apartment to check on repairs. Nothing much was done.By June 2015, the apartment had no running water and was infested with roaches. Ms. Carranza sued the Orbach subsidiary that owned her building in housing court to force repairs. Separately, she sued the Orbach subsidiary; Mr. Tawil, the building manager; and Green & Cohen in federal court for violating the law prohibiting unfair or abusive debt-collection practices.But by spring 2016, tired and worn down, her apartment still in disrepair, Ms. Carranza decided to settle, for about $100,000.Ms. Kittel of the Orbach Group said Ms. Carranza had consistently demanded a six-figure payment to relinquish her apartment, despite the fact that she was living in Pennsylvania. \u201cWe believe that Ms. Carranza truly demonstrates how broken the system is,\u201d she said.Ms. Carranza now lives with the Torreses, near cornfields, barns and woods. There is no church with services in Spanish. No grocery catering to Latinos. No old friends to visit. There are not even any sidewalks.She spends her days inside, mostly alone. She cooks for herself on a hot plate, fried chicken legs and potatoes.\u201cI lost everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel so bitter inside, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201dEvery month or so, her relatives drive her back to New York, back to her neighborhood. It is always bittersweet. A yoga studio has replaced her karate school. Where a 99-cent store once stood, Orbach has set up a real estate office: \u201cCoSo,\u201d a sign announces in big blue letters.Last fall, Ms. Carranza returned to close her bank account. She stood in front of her building, surrounded by friends, telling them that there were no Latinos in all of Pennsylvania.\u201cThere\u2019s no one to talk to,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can talk to the trees.\u201dHer name was still on the buzzer at 247 West 109th Street. After a tenant invited her inside, Ms. Carranza ran her hand along the hallway as she walked, pointing out her apartment \u2014 No. 2 \u2014 and her mailbox.After years of failed requests for the most basic repairs, her apartment had been completely remodeled \u2014 illegally, as no building permit was ever filed, buildings department records show. Two Columbia students paid about $3,500 a month to live there.Ms. Carranza walked through the home she could no longer recognize, running her hand along the new kitchen counter, touching the new sink, remembering where she used to keep her French dining set, where she used to sleep. A stairway had been added, leading to new basement rooms. She gave one tenant a sideways glance.\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll leave?\u201d Ms. Carranza asked her niece. She paused, thinking. \u201cWhat if they\u2019d give me my apartment back?\u201dShe would sit on the stoop again, and she would invite people over for dinner again, and she would fry chicken again. What happiness she would have, she said, if only she again had her home.Isvett Verde, Sean Piccoli, John Krauss and Paul Moon contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "After Arkady Babchenko\u2019s \u2018Murder,\u2019 a Twist Was Revealed. By Him.", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The assassination bore all the hallmarks of yet another contract killing carried out in the murky shadows of the conflict pitting Russia against Ukraine.A photo of the victim, a dissident Russian journalist, showed him lying face down Tuesday in a vermilion pool of his own blood. He was found by his wife, and died on the way to a hospital from multiple gunshot wounds to the back, said the police in Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s capital.Then on Wednesday, the journalist, Arkady Babchenko, to all appearances very much alive, walked into a news conference that Ukrainian security officials had called to discuss his \u201cmurder.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, I would like to apologize that all of you had to live through this, because I know the horrible feeling when you have to bury your colleagues,\u201d Mr. Babchenko told stunned reporters after the gasps died down. \u201cSeparately, I want to apologize to my wife for all the hell she had to go through.\u201dThe staged death, said Vasily S. Gritsak, the head of the Ukraine Security Service, was a sting operation aimed at stopping a real assassination plot against Mr. Babchenko. It was the latest twist \u2014 if an especially bizarre one \u2014 in the tortured relations between Ukraine and Russia, which annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and is fueling a separatist war in eastern Ukraine.\u201cMatters of life and death in Ukraine, as well as trust of the international community to its policy, are nothing more than a bargaining chip used to fuel the anti-Russian hysteria of the Kiev regime,\u201d the Russian statement said.Both the story of Mr. Babchenko\u2019s death and that of his resurrection garnered enormous attention around the world.Various voices, especially from the world of journalism, called the ploy a bad idea in an era when battling fake news has become a daily problem \u2014 and when real news is dismissed as fake news whenever politicians from Washington to the Kremlin find it in their interest to do so.Critics said Ukraine\u2019s actions would only help the Kremlin raise doubts now when it is accused of wrongdoing, as in the shooting down of a civilian airliner over Ukraine in 2014 that killed nearly 300 people, and the poisoning of a retired Russian spy and his daughter in Britain in March.Ukrainian officials defended their actions, saying the ruse had been necessary to try to stop Russian-financed attacks against targets in Ukraine. Mr. Gritsak said there was no doubt that \u201cthe assassination of the Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko was ordered by Russian intelligence.\u201dMr. Babchenko, 41, a former war correspondent, fled Russia last year after his criticism of the Kremlin for the wars in Ukraine and Syria prompted a nationalist campaign of intimidation against him. He roused particular fury with a Facebook post saying he \u201cdidn\u2019t give a damn\u201d about the deaths of 92 people, most of them Russian singers, dancers and musicians, who died in a plane crash en route to Syria to perform.Ukrainian security officials did not fully explain how their ruse was supposed to work. One man, a Ukrainian, is already in custody, they said.They said it began after they got wind of a $40,000 contract to assassinate Mr. Babchenko, which they said had been paid for by the Russian security services.The authorities identified the supposed organizer as Mr. G., a Ukrainian citizen, and showed tape of security agents arresting a portly man in a white shirt on a city street.Mr. G., they said, had hired a veteran of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine to carry out the killing. But the hit man secretly agreed to cooperate with the security services, the officials said, pretending to carry out the killing and collecting a $30,000 fee. (Mr. G. kept $10,000 for himself, they said.)It was not entirely clear from their description, but it seemed that the payment was somehow contingent on producing a picture of the corpse. The police also released a sketch of the supposed killer.Security officials thanked Mr. Babchenko and his family for participating in the operation, without specifying which family members knew about it. Mr. Babchenko later avoided a question about what his wife had known. She was the one who summoned the ambulance, saying she had found him lying on the floor bleeding.Just before his putative assassination, Mr. Babchenko posted a comment on his Facebook page about how he escaped death four years ago when a general barred him from an overloaded helicopter that ended up crashing, killing all 14 people on board.The post prompted an outpouring of comments that this time, he had not been so lucky.Iuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine, and Ivan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Faces Regulatory Fight on Its Home Turf", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The staging ground for one of the biggest regulatory fights facing the technology industry is far removed from Washington or Brussels, tucked into an alley next to a wine and cheese shop about 30 miles from Silicon Valley.A barely furnished real estate office in an upscale Oakland neighborhood is the headquarters for backers of a proposed California ballot measure that would provide consumers with increased privacy rights, including the ability to demand that companies do not sell their personal data.The proposed ballot measure is the passion project of an unlikely trio: a real estate developer, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst and a financial industry executive. They say they have no political aspirations. They\u2019re not techies and they aren\u2019t your run-of-the-mill privacy zealots. Instead, they say they are like many internet consumers \u2014 a little freaked out about tech firms gobbling up people\u2019s personal data.\u201cPeople want some basic rights,\u201d said Alastair Mactaggart, the 51-year-old real estate developer who has put more than $2 million of his own money to get the measure off the ground. \u201cPeople are resentful but accepting because there isn\u2019t any sense of control about their data.\u201dThe California measure has three major components: It gives consumers the right to ask companies to disclose what data they have collected on them; the right to demand that they not sell the data or share with third parties for business purposes; and the right to sue or fine companies that violate the law.Google, Facebook, major telecommunications companies and California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce have already come out against the initiative, saying it is flawed and a threat to the economic model supporting the internet. They\u2019ve created an organization to fight the measure with a decidedly populist name, \u201cThe Committee to Protect California Jobs.\u201dPolitical consultants have told the initiative\u2019s backers that they should prepare for the opposition campaign to spend $100 million. Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the opposition, declined to put a number on the campaign spending, but acknowledged that there is a lot at stake. \u201cIt\u2019s California,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s privacy initiative hasn\u2019t been certified yet by state officials for the November election, but it is expected to appear on the ballot. The measure\u2019s backers said they have submitted over 600,000 signatures, far eclipsing the 366,000 minimum requirement.Mr. Mactaggart said he first became concerned about data privacy when he asked a Google engineer at a cocktail party if he should be worried about all the information companies were collecting about users. The engineer\u2019s response surprised him: Mr. Mactaggart was right to be worried.Mr. Mactaggart said he then reached out to Rick Arney, a finance industry executive who had worked in the California State Senate as a legislative analyst 20 years ago. Their children go to the same school, and Mr. Mactaggart knew that Mr. Arney was a supporter of ballot measures as a way for ordinary citizens to get something done outside of the political system.\u201cOne of the reasons why it\u2019s brought as a ballot initiative is that there is consensus that Silicon Valley owns Sacramento,\u201d said Chris Hoofnagle, an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and an adviser for the initiative. \u201cThere\u2019s no prospect of any consequential consumer privacy legislation.\u201dBut there was a small problem: neither Mr. Mactaggart nor Mr. Arney was a privacy expert or policy wonk. So they hired Mary Stone Ross, another neighborhood friend, who worked at the Central Intelligence Agency and had been legal counsel for the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, to oversee the effort.They spent months talking to technologists, academics and lawyers. They conducted polls and focus groups to understand what people wanted.After considering various options, they decided against taking a hard-line approach. Companies can still use personal data for their own purposes to sell advertising or improve products. They would be restricted, however, from selling or disclosing that data to someone else for \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d upon a consumer\u2019s request.Mr. Hoofnagle said, however, that the measure\u2019s financial punishments for violators give the law teeth that previous attempts at privacy regulation lacked. It also takes a broader view of what constitutes personal information beyond real names and Social Security numbers \u2014 including biometric data and numbers that identify the devices people use.Opponents of the measure say that those broad definitions of personal data are excessive and that companies can adopt their own privacy rules faster and more effectively.\u201cSomething that takes such a sledgehammer approach to regulating data is extraordinarily concerning,\u201d said Robert Callahan, a vice president of state government affairs at the Internet Association, an industry trade group. \u201cWe think the initiative is filled with flaws and it will have really dangerous consequences for the California economy.\u201dThe initiative\u2019s backers said they were raising money for their campaign using a crowdfunding approach. But to get their message out and raise awareness of the measure, they are advertising on \u2014 where else? \u2014 Facebook.Reflecting on his transformation from wealthy real estate developer to privacy activist, Mr. Mactaggart said that after devoting two years and millions of dollars, he\u2019s more certain than ever that this initiative is important and necessary \u2014 a point brought home during a focus group session that took place in Sunnyvale, a city in the heart of Silicon Valley, with a room full of engineers.\u201cOf all the focus groups we did around the state, that was the one most vehement about the need for this,\u201d Mr. Mactaggart said. \u201cThat was really one of the catalyzing moments for me when I was like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re onto something here.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying for House Gains, Democrats Bless Moderates and Annoy Liberals", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCONWAY, Ark. \u2014 To many Democratic leaders, the path to power in Washington looks like Clarke Tucker.He supports the Affordable Care Act, but not a single-payer system. He signals misgivings about Nancy Pelosi as the next House speaker. And even when addressing an audience of Democratic Party regulars, he does not attack President Trump by name.In short, he comes across as a moderate \u2014 and exactly the kind of candidate who leading Democrats believe the party should field in Republican-leaning districts to bolster the majority they hope to win in the House in November.But that strategy frustrates the party\u2019s liberal supporters, who feel the wind at the Democrats\u2019 back and worry about using it to crowd their House caucus with members who may feel inclined to buck the party leadership and stray from its policy agenda.Though much of the Democratic energy nationally is coming from the party\u2019s left, Mr. Tucker appears to be running well ahead of a clutch of more liberal rivals in the May 22 primary for a seat in Central Arkansas.His broad, incremental approach can feel unsatisfying to more confrontational Democrats. Even more aggravating for them is the support Mr. Tucker has received from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington, which anointed him as its preferred candidate to challenge the district\u2019s Republican incumbent, French Hill.\u201cIs it really worth the win to keep pushing back against the people you\u2019re supposed to be serving?\u201d said Paul Spencer, one of Mr. Tucker\u2019s primary opponents. \u201cThe party used to stand for something. At some point, you\u2019ve got to stand up, and you\u2019ve got to move the party in the right direction.\u201dIn a string of important races across the country, national Democrats have been embracing recruits near the political center, hoping they will give the party the chance to compete in states like Utah and Kansas where a liberal Democrat might stand little chance of winning. About a dozen crucial House races this fall are likely to feature Democratic nominees who are positioned markedly closer to the middle than the national party\u2019s activist base \u2014 more than enough to determine control of the House.The party scored an early upset with just such a candidate, Conor Lamb, in a Pennsylvania special election in March. Mr. Lamb, a veteran, opposed Ms. Pelosi, single-payer health care and most new gun regulations, but with a populist economic message captured a district Mr. Trump carried easily in 2016.Democratic voters have largely been going along in the primaries held so far in these districts, which are often in rural areas. In Illinois the voters chose Brendan Kelly, a prosecutor with a mend-it, don\u2019t-end-it message on the Affordable Care Act, to take on a conservative Republican in a rural district. And on Tuesday, Democrats in several states that President Trump carried in 2016 selected ideological mavericks to carry their banner in difficult House races.One was in Indiana, where Mel Hall, a businessman and former minister who has made political donations to Republicans, dispatched rivals on the left who called him an unreliable Democrat.Another was in West Virginia, where Richard Ojeda, a fiery populist running for an open seat in the southern part of the state, has boasted of having voted for Mr. Trump in 2016.Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, a first-term Democrat who wrested his closely divided district from a hard-line Republican in 2016, said his party should strongly back moderate candidates who have the potential to compete in areas that often prove politically grim for Democrats. Mr. Gottheimer, who is backed by the conservative-leaning U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged liberal Democrats to accept some ideological dissension in the party\u2019s ranks in order to achieve a congressional majority.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to win some of the places we can win, in redder parts of the country, it\u2019s with people who may not be aligned on certain issues with some other Democrats,\u201d Mr. Gottheimer said.Lawmakers and advocacy groups on the left object that recruiting a generation of less-than-liberal Democrats might cripple the party\u2019s ability to enact sweeping policy changes in Washington. If Democrats capture the House in November by only a narrow margin \u2014 perhaps half a dozen seats or fewer \u2014 a small cluster of stubborn centrists could wield enormous influence.Liberal resistance to that scenario may become a more serious obstacle for moderate Democrats later in primary season, when bluer-tinged states select candidates. For example, in California, which votes next month, Democrats are waging fierce left-versus-center primary fights in many of the 14 Republican-held districts. And in many contested suburban districts, Democrats appear likely to nominate candidates well to the left of center.Mr. Gottheimer acknowledged \u201ctension within the ranks in the party\u201d over whom to back in high-profile House races. He said he had spoken personally with centrist candidates in his own state and in Minnesota, California and elsewhere to urge them on. He paraphrased his message: \u201cYou can win, and you\u2019ll be welcome in the caucus and in the party.\u201dThe House Democrats\u2019 campaign committee has not hesitated to back relatively moderate candidates, even in less red areas, when the group concludes that a less strident nominee would give the party its best chance of winning. The committee has backed centrist state legislators for Congress in upstate New York and southern New Jersey, and anointed Gil Cisneros, a former Republican and military veteran, in Orange County, Calif.In Central Arkansas, its seal of approval went to Mr. Tucker.His district, the Second, stretching from the small towns of Saline County through Little Rock and toward the strawberry stands around Bald Knob, has tilted toward Republicans in recent years, but it is not inherently safe territory: A Democrat held the seat as recently as 2010, and Mr. Trump won only a bare majority there in 2016.The incumbent, Mr. Hill, whose campaign did not respond to a request for comment, is increasingly seen as vulnerable, particularly against Mr. Tucker, whose personal struggle with cancer has come to define his campaign. Even so, Arkansas Republicans say they have confidence in Mr. Hill\u2019s well-financed campaign.\u201cAny time you have Democrats almost singularly focused on that race, then that is naturally going to generate a more competitive race,\u201d Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican seeking re-election, said over breakfast at the State Capitol. \u201cIt\u2019s something to watch, but I do believe the potential for an upset is overblown.\u201dPoll results suggest that Mr. Tucker, 37, may advance to the general election without a runoff. The Democratic maneuvers in the race reflect a sometimes-grudging consensus among many donors and strategists that a more liberal candidate would falter in Arkansas.Mr. Tucker said he wanted \u201cto appeal to different kinds of people,\u201d from his party\u2019s most progressive voices to disgruntled Republicans, and he defended his record in the state legislature, which he portrayed as both proudly Democratic and bipartisan.\u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that when you say, \u2018Oh, here\u2019s a candidate who could win,\u2019 it\u2019s not about being moderate enough to attract moderates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about being visionary and innovative and passionate enough to excite people, to get them out and vote as well.\u201dHis rival Mr. Spencer, a high school teacher, chafed at the national party\u2019s intervention in the primary: \u201cI\u2019ve taught the Constitution for 20 years. I never saw any place in that document that said I had to ask permission of the party elite if I could run for public office.\u201dMr. Spencer, whose campaign office in North Little Rock is filled with young workers and a decidedly grass-roots, upstart sensibility, insisted that a liberal platform would fare well among Arkansans if given the chance.For plenty of Democrats, though, that seems too big a gamble. They say that in a place like Arkansas, their party must play a long game, and not expect voters to swing all the way from Republicanism to a Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren-style liberal platform in a single election.\u201cMaybe we can get to that later, but you don\u2019t build Rome in a day,\u201d said Marion Baker, a 93-year-old stalwart of Democratic politics in Arkansas. \u201cWhen you do a little thing, and it works, and people see that you do what you say you\u2019ll do, then they\u2019ll go along.\u201dAlan Blinder reported from Conway, Ark., and Alexander Burns from New York.Advertisement"}

But the Treasury Department said it would give businesses and individuals time  \u2013 either 90 days or 180 days  \u2013  for an  \u201corderly wind down of activities.\u201dOn Nov. 4, sanctions enforcement would begin on industries that include shipping, oil, petrochemicals, insurance, energy and specialized banking and financial services.The sanctions\u2019 effects will depend partly on how non-American businesses and foreign governments respond, and whether they decide to  risk U.S. penalties.The most vulnerable Iranian industry  may be oil, said Farhad Alavi, managing partner of Akrivis Law Group, a Washington law firm that specializes in international trade. The old U.S. sanctions, he said, \u201ccaused a severe drop in Iran oil exports  \u2013 it was selling oil under the table at a discount.\u201dMaking good on a campaign promise to exit the nuclear agreement, Mr. Trump described it as so weak and lopsided in Iran\u2019s favor that it was \u201ca great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the United States.\u201dHe faulted it for allowing Iran to eventually resume enrichment of nuclear fuel and for what he described as its failure to limit Iran\u2019s missile development and \u201cother malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen and other places all around the world.\u201dBut the American withdrawal does not necessarily mean the Iran agreement collapses \u2014 at least not immediately.  Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia are still parties to the agreement. If they all agree to maintain it, the effect of restored American sanctions may be softened.Mr. Trump also held out the possibility of negotiating a new agreement with Iran, though its leaders have said that won\u2019t happen.If the deal collapses, Iran will presumably be free to restart thousands of centrifuges mothballed under the agreement. That would let it increase its uranium fuel supply  \u2013 without the close monitoring of the International Atomic Energy Agency.Iran has said it could restore its uranium-enriching capability quickly, which could put it  closer to a weapons path. But that might put Iran at risk of economic isolation, at least by the European countries that agreed to the accord.Iran had the technical capability to become a nuclear-weapons state, experts say.According to U.S. intelligence agency assessments, the Iranians once operated a covert nuclear weapons development program that they discontinued in 2003.While Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear activities are for peaceful use only, it had amassed a stockpile of uranium that  further refining could have turned into fuel for nuclear bombs.By some reckonings, Iran needed only a few months to make the required bomb fuel. It would have needed considerably more time to make a reliable warhead for a missile to deliver such a weapon.UPuUraniumPlutoniumCentrifuges\u2018Breakout\u2019 timeAbout 8,000 kilogramsProduction capableMore than 19,000Three months or lessThe heavy-water nuclear reactor under construction at Arak was meant to generate electricity, but its spent fuel could have also been mined for plutonium, a potent bomb fuel.Amount of time it would have taken Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a single nuclear weapon.If the 3.5 percent (low-enriched) uranium had been further enriched to weapons-grade (90 percent or more), the stockpile would have been sufficient to fuel more than seven nuclear warheads.The rapidly spinning machines were enriching uranium at two main facilities, Fordow and Natanz.UraniumUAbout 8,000 kilogramsIf the 3.5 percent (low-enriched) uranium had been further enriched to weapons-grade (90 percent or more), the stockpile would have been sufficient to fuel more than seven nuclear warheads.PlutoniumPuProduction capableThe heavy-water nuclear reactor under construction at Arak was meant to generate electricity, but its spent fuel could have also been mined for plutonium, a potent bomb fuel.CentrifugesMore than 19,000The rapidly spinning machines were enriching uranium at two main facilities, Fordow and Natanz.\u2018Breakout\u2019 timeThree months or lessAmount of time it would have taken Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a single nuclear weapon.UPuUraniumPlutoniumCentrifuges\u2018Breakout\u2019 timeAbout 8,000 kilogramsProduction capableMore than 19,000Three months or lessThe heavy-water nuclear reactor under construction at Arak was meant to generate electricity, but its spent fuel could have also been mined for plutonium, a potent bomb fuel.Amount of time it would have taken Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a single nuclear weapon.If the 3.5 percent (low-enriched) uranium had been further enriched to weapons-grade (90 percent or more), the stockpile would have been sufficient to fuel more than seven nuclear warheads.The rapidly spinning machines were enriching uranium at two main facilities, Fordow and Natanz.Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities at the time the agreement was reached reflected a longstanding effort by the country to harness nuclear power. It began well before the revolution that overthrew the American-backed shah in 1979.Despite Iran\u2019s repeated denials, questions began to intensify more than 15 years ago about whether it had worked clandestinely to develop nuclear weapon capabilities.Led by the United States, Western powers sought to pressure Iran with economic sanctions to curb its  steadily increasing capacity to enrich uranium and produce plutonium, the fuels of atomic weapons.After years of off-again-on-again negotiations, an agreement was reached in 2015 between Iran and the major world powers \u2013 Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.\u201cThe West as we once knew it no longer exists,\u201d Der Spiegel\u2019s editors wrote. \u201cOur relationship to the United States cannot currently be called a friendship and can hardly be referred to as a partnership. President Trump has adopted a tone that ignores 70 years of trust.\u201dThen there are the hard facts. Europe\u2019s trade with the United States is incomparably larger than its trade with Iran, and even if Britain, France and Germany \u2014 co-signers of the Iran accord, along with China, the European Union, Russia and the United States \u2014 try to maintain the Iran deal and support their companies against so-called secondary sanctions by Washington, many European banks and industries would be wary of defying America\u2019s enormous economic clout, and especially the reach of its banking system.The anger in Europe, however, is not so much about the cost of renewed sanctions as about the total, humiliating disdain for the Europeans\u2019 arguments, and, by extension, for the trans-Atlantic alliance and all it has stood for since World War II. If Europeans allowed other powers, including allies, to make security decisions for them, \u201cthen we are no more sovereign and we cannot be more credible to public opinion,\u201d Mr. Macron said in a statement that echoed the sentiments of many of his European neighbors.There have been bitter differences before, notably over the war in Iraq, but to Europeans, Mr. Trump\u2019s contempt is of a higher order, an arrogant mind-set that even on matters of paramount global importance, America will do what it wants without giving a damn for the interests of its closest allies.Roiled by its own internal crises and divisions, Europe lacks the big stick that would compel Mr. Trump to listen to reason. The sweet talk attempted by Mr. Macron has proved equally futile. But that does not excuse Europe, and especially Germany, Britain and France, from standing firm against Washington\u2019s bullying and making every effort to keep the Iran deal \u2014 and all the other aspects of the international order Mr. Trump has tried to destroy \u2014 from collapse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump to Drop Call for Medicare to Negotiate Lower Drug Prices", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump will lay out on Friday a broad strategy to reduce prescription drug prices, but in a break from one of his most popular campaign promises, he will not call for Medicare to negotiate lower prices with drug manufacturers, senior administration officials said.The White House will issue a blueprint that represents \u201cthe most comprehensive plan to tackle prescription drug affordability of any president,\u201d a senior official told journalists on Thursday night.Asked if the plan would include direct negotiations by Medicare, the official said, \u201cNo, we are talking about something different.\u201d\u201cWe are not calling for Medicare negotiation in the way that Democrats have called for,\u201d the official said later. \u201cWe clearly want to make important changes that will dramatically improve the way negotiation takes place inside the Medicare program.\u201dAs he campaigned for the presidency, Mr. Trump boldly broke with his party and embraced a longstanding Democratic proposal when he called for the federal government to use its buying power to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare recipients. The proposal was popular with voters but not with other Republican politicians, who had been battling it for years.Under Part D of Medicare, millions of older Americans receive insurance coverage for prescription drugs. The benefit is delivered entirely by private entities under contract with Medicare. These private entities \u2014 insurance companies and the middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers \u2014 negotiate prices with drugmakers. But under a 2003 law, the federal government \u201cmay not interfere\u201d in those negotiations.The president\u2019s plan will make it easier for private plans to negotiate \u201cbetter deals for our seniors, especially for high-cost medications,\u201d said the senior administration official, who spoke on the condition that he would not be named. The official refused to provide details, which he said would be disclosed on Friday.Congressional Democrats said they would like to work with Mr. Trump on plans to rein in drug costs, but they predicted that his proposals would be inadequate.\u201cOn the campaign trail, he spoke like a populist,\u201d the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said on Thursday. \u201cHe talked the talk, but he has failed \u2014 at least so far \u2014 to walk the walk.\u201dMr. Trump plans to speak in the Rose Garden of the White House to an audience that includes members of Congress and patients who have suffered because of high drug costs.\u201cOther countries use socialized health care to command unfairly low prices from U.S. drugmakers,\u201d said a summary provided by the White House on Thursday. \u201cThis places the burden of financing drug development largely on American patients and taxpayers, subsidizes foreign consumers, and reduces innovation and the development of new treatments.\u201dThe United States spends well over $300 billion a year on prescription drugs sold at pharmacies and other retail outlets, and Medicare and Medicaid account for nearly 40 percent of that spending, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.Mr. Trump plans to criticize brand-name drug manufacturers for setting high list prices and for trying to stifle competition by delaying the marketing of lower-cost generic drugs. He is also expected to criticize pharmacy benefit managers, saying they profit from rebates paid by drug companies but do not pass on much of the savings to patients.Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that drug companies are \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201dIn his State of the Union address in January, he said that \u201cfixing the injustice of high drug prices\u201d was one of his top priorities for 2018. \u201cAnd prices will come down substantially,\u201d he said. \u201cWatch.\u201dAs a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump supported two ideas that are anathema to the pharmaceutical industry: allowing Medicare officials to negotiate prices and allowing consumers to import prescription drugs from Canada and certain other countries where brand-name drug prices are generally lower than in the United States.But top administration officials, like Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, strenuously oppose those ideas. Republicans argue that the federal government has such overwhelming power as a buyer that it could basically set a price that manufacturers would have to comply with.And since taking office, Mr. Trump has not endorsed such proposals.Many ideas in the president\u2019s \u201cblueprint to lower drug prices\u201d can be carried out unilaterally by the secretary of health and human services. But the blueprint also includes several legislative proposals from the president\u2019s 2019 budget request.One legislative proposal would allow low-income people on Medicare to obtain free generic drugs, without co-payments. Another would, for the first time, establish an overall limit on Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. Mr. Trump also wants to lower costs for consumers at the pharmacy counter by requiring Medicare drug plans to pass on at least one-third of the rebates they receive from drug manufacturers.Mr. Azar, testifying on Capitol Hill on Thursday, described the problem this way: \u201cPrescription drug costs in our country are too high. List prices are too high. Seniors and government programs are overpaying due to lack of negotiating tools. Out-of-pocket costs are too high. And foreign governments are freeloading off of our investments in innovation.\u201dDemocrats are driving for a more aggressive approach. Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, said: \u201cWe acknowledge that drug companies make life-extending and pain-relieving drugs, and that\u2019s a good thing. But the price gouging is killing patients.\u201d Consumers, he said, are being \u201cheld hostage to the pricing power of Big Pharma.\u201dThe Food and Drug Administration approved 1,027 generic drugs last year, a record, and nearly 90 percent of prescriptions are filled with generic medicines, for which consumers often pay less than $25.But increasing numbers of costly new brand-name drugs are also entering the market. Some provide highly effective treatments for some forms of cancer and other diseases. But the prices sometimes exceed $100,000 a year, and even patients with health insurance may be responsible for tens of thousands of dollars in co-payments.Advertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-05-12", "News": "The nation\u2019s housing policy for the poor can feel like a giant lottery. Sometimes it actually is a lottery. Supported byAdrian Caratowsa had a studio he\u2019d remade as his own, repainting the walls and wallpapering over the kitchen cabinets. But every day for five years, he walked out into a neighborhood he found depressing.With affordable housing scarce and likely to grow more so, San Francisco planned to draw winners for Natalie Gubb Commons at random. Lotteries that allocate scarce resources are not set up to distinguish the neediest from the merely needy. Rather, they reward random chance, which is a distinctly different notion of what\u2019s \u201cfair.\u201dMs. Calderon and her husband had been looking for a home for two years, since the last landlord learned of the third child on the way and told them they had to go. They could afford a studio, a one-bedroom maybe, but no one Ms. Calderon called would rent such a small space to a family of five. So they slept in their car, with a newborn, for months. They entered one homeless shelter, then another.Mr. Caratowsa walked by Natalie Gubb Commons a week before the lottery, as he had several times before. Scaffolding still obscured two sides of the development. The west-facing facade had come into view, eight stories of industrial-chic gray.\u201cTo walk downtown, seeing people in suits, going to work, they have their coffee in their hand \u2014 to me it\u2019s like when a little girl wants to be a princess and she wears her mom\u2019s high heels,\u201d Mr. Caratowsa said. \u201cThat\u2019s me being in the Financial District. It\u2019s just a place where I feel like I have hope.\u201dAffordable-housing projects were already becoming harder to execute as federal support dwindled and construction costs rose. Then, after Donald J. Trump was elected president, the value of Low-Income Housing Tax Credits began to fall. Changes to the tax code suddenly looked likely, and a lower corporate tax rate would mean companies would have less reason to put equity into affordable housing in exchange for credits to offset their tax liability. What investors were willing to pay for the credits plummeted by February 2017, once the likelihood of a tax overhaul had set in. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, that fall in prices has translated to about $45,000 less per housing unit in San Francisco from investors in the common 4 percent tax credits, according to Novogradac & Company, an accounting firm that tracks the affordable housing market. And because tax-credit investors aren\u2019t providing that equity, the city must fill gaps in projects with other public dollars.Put together, these programs amount to only a partial housing policy. \u201cThis country does have a national housing policy,\u201d said Kate Hartley, director of the San Francisco Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development. \u201cAnd that is that we provide our greatest subsidies to relatively affluent, housed people.\u201dBut the tax bill\u2019s implications for poor renters will be more profound. The odds are likely to grow worse than these: Last year, 53 households applied per each new affordable unit at The Meridian in Los Angeles; 84 for every home at Parcel 25 in Boston; 391 for each unit at Stargell Commons in Alameda, Calif.; 979 for every home at Our Lady of Lourdes Apartments in New York.The lotteries that follow, said Kirk McClure, a professor of urban planning at the University of Kansas, \u201care a simple manifestation \u2014 and apparently an unavoidable one \u2014 of the fact that we have never in America made affordable housing a right.\u201d   For years, San Francisco conducted public lotteries in a bingo drum. But the raffle tickets were always getting stuck in the drum\u2019s crevices. The city also tried a big box. People couldn\u2019t see what was happening inside, however, and tickets got stuck under the lid.This exercise \u2014 rolling the drum, shaking the box, inspecting for trapped tickets and repeating \u2014 lasted hours on a building the size of Natalie Gubb Commons. Ms. Torres would bus around town, picking up applications, dropping off applications. Lines would wrap around some developers\u2019 offices on deadline day. \u201cPlease don\u2019t give up, please keep trying, and please know that sometimes people have to apply several times before they get offered a unit,\u201d Maria Benjamin, who runs several of the city\u2019s affordable housing programs and the lotteries, announced before the Natalie Gubb Commons lottery on a Tuesday morning in November. About 50 people, a tiny share of the total applicants, turned up in the basement auditorium of San Francisco\u2019s central library. On a 95-unit building, Ms. Benjamin told them, any number in the top 200 had a chance, as many applicants fail to qualify.At the front of the auditorium, a laptop sat in place of the bingo drum. Kenneth Biby, the property manager at Natalie Gubb Commons, clicked a button, sending the lottery numbers to a randomizing website. Ten minutes later, city staff printed results for each person who\u2019d signed in at the door. The staff called them by first name, their results kept private. Of everyone present, there were two decent draws: 19 and 150. After more than two years of searching, she was growing tired. In December, another couple moved into her apartment. There were now seven people in a four-bedroom with one bath. Ms. Torres and her husband and 7-year-old daughter shared one room. They had to dash for the shower when the others were cooking.They did not understand why a family like theirs couldn\u2019t find a home of its own. Ms. Torres, 43, worked part time as a school monitor and a teacher\u2019s aide. Her husband worked two jobs, as a security guard and a building concierge. But the overcrowded driveways on their block hinted at many households like theirs, all living in too few apartments.\u201cWhat am I waiting for?\u201d Ms. Torres said. \u201cHow can I keep waiting? Why? So that it will get more and more expensive, and possibly I still won\u2019t find anything?\u201dMs. Calderon avoided the shelter as much as she could. She spent afternoons in the park with her children, returning to the building only at night. Ms. Torres studied for child development classes she was taking at a cafe that felt more comfortable than her own apartment. They had to find privacy in public spaces, a sense of home separate from where they slept.Mr. Caratowsa kept returning downtown, envisioning himself amid the skyscrapers. He drew the best number: 71. He was elated, but cautious. Of Natalie Gubb\u2019s 95 apartments, 46 were one-bedrooms. He needed people ahead of him to request larger units, or bow out. An empty building like Natalie Gubb Commons is a math problem. Some units were designated for tenants below 40 percent of the median income, others below 50 percent. Each household must also earn at least twice the monthly rent, meaning that many who are poor enough to qualify for the building are too poor to cover the rent. Mr. Caratowsa waited six weeks for his interview, and another month to learn his application had been approved. Then things happened too quickly. In March, Mercy was ready for him to sign a lease and move in. He had to give notice in the Tenderloin, and couldn\u2019t afford April rent in two places in addition to a deposit. Anxious, he put in his 30 days\u2019 notice and asked Mercy for an installment plan to cover the April rent. He waited.Ms. Calderon\u2019s family left the homeless shelter in January and moved in with a co-worker of her husband\u2019s, another home with too many families. Then in March she heard of a building where no one would mind the size of their family. An available $1,200 studio had a modern kitchen where she could cook for her children, and a patio where they could roller skate. On his inspection, the day he received his keys, Mr. Caratowsa walked up to the living room window. He could see into the offices across the street. A highway off-ramp spilled traffic onto the street below, and another high-rise was under construction. But his apartment was surprisingly quiet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Teacher Walkout Movement Won\u2019t Reach Every State", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 The nationwide teacher protest movement spread to a sixth state on Wednesday as thousands in North Carolina rallied at the Capitol for higher pay and more money for schools. It was the first mass walkout for teachers in the state.In the months since the movement began, teachers have walked out in deep-red states and purple states; in states with booming economies and ones that are struggling; in states where school funding scrapes the bottom, and others where the numbers are closer to the national average.Despite the diversity and seemingly endless energy, the movement has limits. Most states have schools that are funded more or less equally from state and local coffers, with voters making many financial decisions close to home. But North Carolina shares something with other walkout states: Its state government plays an unusually strong role in funding education and setting its priorities, often superseding the influence of school districts.This strong-state model can include a larger-than-typical role for state governments in funding schools, a state-mandated salary schedule for teachers or efforts to equalize funding between poor and rich school districts.Because of such policies, the states are, in a way, ripe for large-scale labor actions, despite having weak public sector unions. Unlike some Northeast states where teachers in one town can earn $20,000 more than those in a nearby city, low-income and middle-class districts in the states that have had walkouts have similar teacher salary and school funding challenges, building solidarity \u2014 and political leverage \u2014 across hundreds of miles.Teacher salaries across the United States have failed to keep pace with inflation since 2009, falling by an average of 4 percent, according to data from the National Education Association, the national teachers\u2019 union. The drop is steeper in the six walkout states \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia.After Republicans took control of state government in 2013, North Carolina ended the estate tax and lowered corporate taxes as well as some personal income taxes.The actions, plus the recession, meant schools took a hit. Since 2009, the budgets for supplies, textbooks and school technology have been slashed by about half, according to the Public School Forum of North Carolina, a nonpartisan research group. And a greater share of teacher compensation has been dedicated toward pensions and health care costs.Symone Kiddoo, 27, is a school social worker in Durham. On Tuesday, she packed and distributed hundreds of donated meals to students at Southwest Elementary School and Forest View Elementary School. Ms. Kiddoo is the sole social worker for both schools, where over half of the 1,400 students come from low-income families. The food was for students to eat when school was closed for the walkout.Ms. Kiddoo spends her days responding to behavioral incidents, like a student overturning a table, and counseling children through crises, like the death of a parent. She makes sure students who can\u2019t see the chalkboard get glasses, and she maintains a food pantry and a clothing closet for children in need.She earns about $42,000 a year and works a second job as a pool attendant at the Y.M.C.A. She said she was participating in the walkout not primarily because of low pay, but for more mental health funding to hire social workers, school psychologists and counselors.\u201cWe are scrappers,\u201d she said, able to get a lot done with few resources. Still, she said it would be easier if social workers were assigned to one school at a time.As in Arizona, the last state to mount a widespread walkout, traditional public schools here have been challenged by the expansion of charter schools and private school vouchers.When students leave a traditional public school, they take their per-pupil funding with them. While the traditional school no longer has to provide them with instruction, other costs remain, like the repair of a roof or a heating system.\u201cIt\u2019s my biggest concern, that we\u2019ve become more segregated,\u201d said Mark Jewell, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union.Rhonda Dillingham, executive director of the North Carolina Association for Public Charter Schools, said she agreed that teachers should be paid more but would not be participating in the protest because of the negative rhetoric about school choice.\u201cI can\u2019t get behind the rally,\u201d Ms. Dillingham said. \u201cAs far as segregation, charter schools are open to all North Carolina students. I can\u2019t think of anything more segregating than a child\u2019s ZIP code and what a parent is able to pay for a house.\u201dConservatives see the walkout movement as partisan, with Democratic Party-aligned groups trying to fire up their base ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections. They acknowledge that teacher salaries could be higher and that more money is needed for items like textbooks, but point to the difficulty of balancing state budgets that must also pay for Medicaid and pension systems.\u201cThe only discernible crisis for the organizers of the event is that Republicans still control the General Assembly,\u201d said Terry Stoops, director of education studies at the John Locke Foundation, a conservative research group in Raleigh.Mr. Jewell, the union president, has been candid about wanting to change the makeup of the legislature. The walkout, which he calls a \u201cday of advocacy,\u201d is \u201cjust the beginning of a long stretch that we\u2019re calling the six-month haul\u201d toward the ballot box.The Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, has proposed an average pay raise for teachers of 8 percent and wants to halt planned tax cuts for businesses and high-earners in order to dedicate more money to schools.Republicans, who hold a veto-proof majority, say they can offer a 6 percent raise and smaller class sizes while maintaining tax cuts, and say additional raises should be tied to performance. Over the last several years, they phased out a program that paid teachers more for earning a master\u2019s degree and did away with most tenure protections.In North Carolina, as in the other five walkout states, union membership is optional for teachers.Mr. Jewell came to North Carolina from West Virginia, where he participated in a 1990 statewide walkout. This winter, when he saw rank-and-file teachers in his home state organizing on Facebook, he said he knew he wanted his own association to lead the way toward a mass labor action. \u201cYou have to get in front of the movement,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carolina Panthers Will Be Sold for $2.2 Billion to David Tepper", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJerry Richardson, the founding owner of the Carolina Panthers, has agreed to sell the team to David A. Tepper, a billionaire hedge fund owner, for a record-setting amount of at least $2.2 billion.The sale price was confirmed by two people with knowledge of the deal.The owners could vote on Tepper\u2019s application as early as next week, when they meet in Atlanta.Advised by Steve Greenberg of Allen & Co., Richardson initially sought at least $3 billion for his team, but trimmed his expectations when no potential buyers emerged at that price. At least one potential buyer, Michael Rubin, the founder of the online sports merchandise retailer Fanatics, dropped out of the process when he was told he would have to pay substantially more than $2.5 billion for the team, according to two people with knowledge of the process.Another bidder, Ben Navarro, who owns a financial investment group, was unable to raise the estimated $2.6 billion he was said to have offered. Questions were also being raised about his holdings in companies that offer credit cards to low-income consumers.Tepper offered several hundred million dollars less than Navarro, but was favored by more owners because of his substantial wealth, estimated at $11 billion, and because he was vetted when he became a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Tepper will have to sell his stake in the Steelers as part of his deal to purchase the Panthers.\u201cIf he\u2019s good enough for Art Rooney, he\u2019s good enough for me,\u201d one owner said, referring to the owner of the Steelers.Tepper, who has already submitted much of the required paperwork to the league, is unlikely to face much opposition when the N.F.L. owners on the finance committee review his application before sending it to the full ownership to vote on.The sale of the Panthers is being widely watched in the league because the final price will become a benchmark for other team sales. Sports bankers said the Denver Broncos, the New Orleans Saints and the Tennessee Titans could change hands in the next few years. The patriarch of each of those teams has died in recent years or is in failing health. Rubin could re-emerge as a bidder for one of those teams.In the near term, the team will stay in Charlotte, N.C., a fast-growing city and a healthy market for the N.F.L. But there are likely to be few restrictions to prevent a buyer from moving the team. The team owns the stadium, and the city has spent tens of millions of dollars on renovations. The team must play there through June 2019, or pay a penalty to break the agreement.Advertisement"}

Her downfall came at the same crossroads.On Wednesday, Ms. Hasibuan, who debuted at New York Fashion Week in 2016 with models wearing head scarfs, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for defrauding tens of thousands of Indonesian pilgrims hoping to travel to Mecca. She was also convicted of money laundering.With her husband, Andika Surachman, Ms. Hasibuan, 31, owned a travel agency dedicated to religious package tourism. Prosecutors said the agency, First Travel, swindled roughly $65 million from more than 63,000 people by promising to send them on holy tours to Saudi Arabia after each paid a cut-rate $1,000 fee up front. The trips never happened.Mr. Surachman was sentenced to 20 years in prison at the same Depok District Court in West Java where Ms. Hasibuan was sentenced. She appeared in court in an austere black head scarf and baggy white blouse, a contrast from the opulent styles she designed. Her younger sister, Siti Nuraida Hasibuan, who served as the finance director of First Travel, was given a 15-year sentence this month.Also known as modest fashion, Islamic fashion tends to rely on rich fabrics and fine detailing like sequins or beading. Hijabs, or Islamic head scarves, are matched with flowing gowns.\u201cHer designs were edgy and luxurious,\u201d said Teti Nurhayati, the chief executive of Indonesia Fashion Gallery, the multibrand store in New York that helped to organize Ms. Hasibuan\u2019s shows. \u201cShe had the creativity, the capacity, as well as the production capability to go global.\u201dAfter her first boutique opened in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, in 2015, Ms. Hasibuan quickly expanded internationally, with shops in Abu Dhabi and Istanbul.On social media, where she had hundreds of thousands of followers, Ms. Hasibuan flaunted her extravagant lifestyle, as if to say that being a conservative Muslim woman did not preclude luxury. Her social media accounts have been taken offline.A generation ago, many women in Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation, did not wear the veil or the loose robes popular in the Middle East. In both Indonesia and neighboring Malaysia, tightfitting chemises and sleek sarongs were considered the national dress for women.But as Muslim women worldwide have embraced more conservative clothing, Indonesians have hewed to the trend. In a sign of the times, top singers of dangdut \u2014 a raunchy musical form complemented by gyrating dance moves \u2014 have famously given up their miniskirts for the hijab, or jilbab as it is known locally.Indonesia sends the largest number of travelers on the hajj, or pilgrimage, to Mecca each year. First Travel, Ms. Hasibuan\u2019s company, was offering cheap umrah tours, which are lesser pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia outside the designated hajj period.\u201cHer failure was caused by her other business, not from the fashion world,\u201d Ms. Nurhayati said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this verdict will have any impact on modest fashion in general.\u201dMuktita Suhartono contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs to Open a Bitcoin Trading Operation", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Most big banks have tried to stay far away from the scandal-tainted virtual currency Bitcoin.But Goldman Sachs, perhaps the most storied name in finance, is bucking the risks and moving ahead with plans to set up what appears to be the first Bitcoin trading operation at a Wall Street bank.In a step that is likely to lend legitimacy to virtual currencies \u2014 and create new concerns for Goldman \u2014 the bank is about to begin using its own money to trade with clients in a variety of contracts linked to the price of Bitcoin.Rana Yared, one of the Goldman executives overseeing the creation of the trading operation, said the bank was cleareyed about what it was getting itself into.\u201cI would not describe myself as a true believer who wakes up thinking Bitcoin will take over the world,\u201d Ms. Yared said. \u201cFor almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table.\u201dStill, the suggestion that Goldman Sachs, among the most vaunted banks on Wall Street and a frequent target for criticism, would even consider trading Bitcoin would have been viewed as preposterous a few years ago, when Bitcoin was primarily known as a way to buy drugs online.Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous figure going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, who talked about replacing Wall Street banks \u2014 not giving them a new revenue line.Over the last two years, however, a growing number of hedge funds and other large investors around the world have expressed an interest in virtual currencies. Tech companies like Square have begun offering Bitcoin services to their customers, and the commodity exchanges in Chicago started allowing customers to trade Bitcoin futures contracts in December.But until now, regulated financial institutions have steered clear of Bitcoin, with some going so far as to shut down the accounts of customers who traded Bitcoin. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, famously called it a fraud, and many other bank chief executives have said Bitcoin is nothing more than a speculative bubble.Ms. Yared said Goldman had concluded that Bitcoin is not a fraud and does not have the characteristics of a currency. But a number of clients wanted to hold it as a valuable commodity, similar to gold, given the limited quantity of Bitcoin that can ever be \u201cmined\u201d in a complex, virtual system.\u201cIt resonates with us when a client says, \u2018I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Yared said the bank had received inquiries from hedge funds, as well as endowments and foundations that received virtual currency donations from newly minted Bitcoin millionaires and didn\u2019t know how to handle them. The ultimate decision to begin trading Bitcoin contracts went through Goldman\u2019s board of directors.The step comes with plenty of uncertainties. Bitcoin prices are primarily set on unregulated exchanges in other countries where there are few measures in place to prevent market manipulation.Since the beginning of the year, the price of Bitcoin has plunged \u2014 and recovered significantly \u2014 as traders have faced uncertainty about how regulators will deal with virtual currencies.\u201cIt is not a new risk that we don\u2019t understand,\u201d Ms. Yared said. \u201cIt is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.\u201dGoldman has already been doing more than most banks in the area, clearing trades for customers who want to buy and sell Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange.In the next few weeks \u2014 the exact start date has not been set \u2014 Goldman will begin using its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts on behalf of clients. It will also create its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients.He will initially be placed on Goldman\u2019s foreign currency desk because Bitcoin trading has the most similarity to movements in emerging market currencies, Ms. Yared said.Mr. Schmidt is looking at trading actual Bitcoin \u2014 or physical Bitcoin, as it is somewhat ironically called \u2014 if the bank can secure regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve and New York authorities.The firm also has to find a way to confidently hold Bitcoin for customers without its being stolen by hackers, as has happened to many Bitcoin exchanges. Mr. Schmidt and Ms. Yared said the current options for holding Bitcoin for clients did not yet meet Wall Street standards.Goldman is known for pushing the envelope in the trading of complicated products. The firm faced significant criticism after the financial crisis for its profitable trading of so-called synthetic derivatives tied to the subprime mortgage markets.Mr. Schmidt said Goldman\u2019s sophistication was a big part of the reason he was open to the job, despite many other opportunities in the virtual currency world.\u201cIn terms of having a trusted institutional player, it has been something I have been looking for in my own crypto trading \u2014 but it didn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

In the late 1930s theft was almost entirely associated with the poor. As he saw it, his fellow sociologists had come to the conclusion that crime was a result of \u201cfeeblemindedness, psychopathic deviations, slum neighborhoods and \u2018deteriorated\u2019 families\u201d; it was believed that less than 2 percent of crime came from members of the upper echelons of society. But Sutherland believed this outlook was not only biased, but blinkered, failing to take into account theft that was taking place in plain sight. \u201cThe \u2018robber barons\u2019 of the last half of the 19th century were white-collar criminals,\u201d he told the crowd of the American Sociological Society in 1939, recounting the time Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt more or less confessed that his family wealth was ill gotten, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose you can run a railroad in accordance with the statutes, do you?\u201dAccording to people on both sides of the law, today, thanks to the internet and tax havens, it is even easier for white-collar crime to slip under the radar: Cash is stashed in untouchable island accounts; corporate checks can be forged and deposited; money laundering takes the form of a prepaid debit card; insider trading is just a conversation over cocktails. You\u2019ll be shocked to learn just how simple it is to rob and steal while maintaining a veneer of respectability.Checks can be useful tools when it comes to engaging in both corporate theft and what are called account takeovers. Each requires a basic understanding of forgery. To steal from a business, says Frank Abagnale, whose criminal exploits inspired the movie \u201cCatch Me if You Can,\u201d the best forgers \u201ccapture a corporate logo and maybe the front of the building \u2014 layer it in the background, and you can make a check 10 times better looking than the actual check.\u201d Then they call the company and ask to speak to someone in accounts receivable. After they explain that they want to pay an invoice by wiring money to the institution, they are told where it does its banking and are given its routing and account numbers. They add that information to the fake check.Next they find someone in corporate communications to give them a press statement, which will include the signature of the C.E.O. or C.F.O. They scan the document and print the signature onto the check. It is not likely be scrutinized unless the amount is more than $2,000. \u201cNo human being sees the check \u2014 it goes through a high-speed processor,\u201d Abagnale says. For the last 40 years, he has been a consultant to financial institutions and government agencies, telling them how to combat forgery. Around 17 billion checks, with a value of roughly $27 trillion, were written in 2015, according to the Federal Reserve.Another, more common way to use checks fraudulently is to take over an individual\u2019s account. \u201cLet\u2019s say you gave me a check for $9,\u201d Abagnale says. \u201cAll I would do is go to checksinthemail.com \u2014 they have every style of check you can imagine.\u201d It\u2019s possible for fraudsters to match the style of check they\u2019ve been given \u2014 to duplicate the trees in the background, say \u2014 and then to order with a different name on the check along with the bank account information of the unsuspecting person. When the other person\u2019s bank receives those checks, it will debit that account. The swindler can pay rent and credit-card bills or visit a local check-cashing operation and walk away with thousands of dollars. \u201cIt\u2019s months later that anyone would discover it,\u201d Abagnale says. \u201cAnd the bank is responsible for paying both parties even if the business files a complaint within 30 days.\u201dScammers have long mounted schemes to pressure gullible customers to buy assets, especially penny stocks, with promises of hot tips and inside information. But today, the pump-and-dump playbook is being applied to the new frontier of cryptocurrency. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re seeing in the virtual-currency space is an application of these old schemes to new conduct,\u201d says James McDonald, the director of enforcement for the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. What pump-and-dump schemes need is a thinly traded market where a price swing is easy to manipulate and disproportionately large compared with how little the asset costs. \u201cIf I buy a hundred shares of Apple, that\u2019s not going to move the price,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cBut if there\u2019s a new currency, if I buy a hundred tokens or shares, that could be 50 percent of the trading for that day. If it was trading at 10 cents, that could triple the price or more.\u201dThe scammers begin by investing a large sum in a currency that is relatively unknown. Then they spread misinformation on social media, claiming, say, that a famous investor like Warren Buffett is investing in the currency. They might post false news articles that say it has been granted a line of credit by bank or a company like Mastercard, and then circulate links to the fake news on social media \u2014 spreading the news on Twitter accounts known to promote stocks, for example. It\u2019s a risk if the stories are too appealing. An article claiming that the Fed chairman is endorsing an unknown currency for the Reserve or that the United States is going to use a specific coin will not be believed.Scammers often cultivate an online identity on Twitter or Facebook that becomes known for specializing in recommending currencies or stock picks \u2014 then recommend the one they want to pump up and wait for followers to buy it. \u201cThen you have trading that corroborates the misinformation,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cYou get the false reports, the currency spikes and then it looks believable.\u201d Monitoring the enthusiasm for the currency, they sell when it seems to be at a peak. Because they hold the majority of the currency, its price will plummet once they dump the holdings. \u201cThis can happen in a matter of minutes,\u201d he says.People who want to keep their money away from the tax collector will move it to a foreign country. Those who are rich enough will hardly even have to seek out such a tax haven \u2014 the opportunities will come to them. \u201cWhen you have more than $20 million, then you\u2019re going to start being targeted by these financial institutions \u2014 you will be invited to sporting events like golf or galas,\u201d says Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of \u201cThe Hidden Wealth of Nations.\u201d \u201cThey won\u2019t sell in an aggressive way, but they will talk about legal tax immunization and strategies.\u201dUntil the financial crash in 2008, according to Zucman\u2019s research, Switzerland controlled approximately 50 percent of the \u201coffshore\u201d accounts used by the world\u2019s wealthiest; today that figure is roughly 25 percent. More wealth is now stored in Asia: Singapore and Hong Kong are home to 30 percent of offshore accounts in use, while the rest are in the Caribbean, Panama and Europe.A lawyer or financial adviser can set up a shell corporation. \u201cThere are intermediaries \u2014 law firms that can connect people to banks, and they supply these anonymous shell companies,\u201d Zucman says. Once the shell company is established, it will send an invoice for phony services like investment advice. Payment for these services then goes to the offshore bank account attached to the shell company. The resulting paper trail looks legitimate.Zucman estimates that an amount equivalent to 8 percent of the world\u2019s household financial wealth is held, untaxed, in offshore accounts \u2014 around $8.6 trillion in 2016. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of opacity,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see all this wealth that belongs on paper, and authorities don\u2019t have a good way to pierce this veil of secrecy. They rely on the good will of bankers, which is not sufficient.\u201dAccessing money in an offshore account is as easy as using a debit card from the offshore bank or taking out a loan in the United States against the assets held abroad. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to show up,\u201d Zucman says. \u201cIt can all be done remotely.\u201dEmployees at publicly held companies often possess something quite valuable to outside investors: knowledge about their employers\u2019 prospects beyond what has been issued in news releases. Those who would share \u2014 and perhaps illegally profit from \u2014 this intelligence in order to play the stock market know to circulate among their company\u2019s various departments, says Roomy Khan, a former analyst at Intel who went to prison for passing nonpublic information to Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire founder and former chief of the Galleon Group hedge fund and others.\u201cI was always trying to make connections in the company\u2019s finance department and the marketing chain,\u201d Khan says. \u201cIn sales they know what the bookings are; in marketing they know what people are looking for.\u201d Because Intel controlled nearly 90 percent of the PC market for microchips when she was there, the intelligence gathering she did for Rajaratnam gave him the ability to predict the fortunes of Intel and the entire PC market.When it comes to buying or selling stocks based on those predictions, insider traders must avoid being consistently accurate. Too many on-the-spot and out-of-the-ordinary trades that are correct can raise flags. \u201cThe government spots insider traders,\u201d says Khan, who now gives speeches to companies about the dangers of insider trading. The feds aren\u2019t the only ones monitoring unusual trades. Companies can get in trouble if they have too many leaks, and so can investment funds if they act on them, so both types of businesses are looking out for suspicious activity.Social and professional circles can be used to draw out information from anyone willing to share secret details of products or strategies. \u201cLet\u2019s say Samsung was having battery issues, and if my friend said something about the issues, I would start probing him. I know what the market is looking for,\u201d Khan says. \u201cI would ask more and more detailed questions.\u201d Manipulation is the key to gaining confidential information, but insider traders try to be casual and friendly; people are more easily persuaded to share if they are made to feel powerful, wanted and included in the upper echelons of financial society. Khan says: \u201cI used my lifestyle, my success, the trappings of success.\u201dIllegal enterprises seek every possible way to get their cash back into circulation. To launder this dirty money in the United States requires them to \u201cstructure\u201d their deposits of ill-gotten cash. Banks are required to report transactions involving $10,000 or more in cash, so their deposits need to be much smaller than that. \u201cCriminals understand that U.S. banking laws have become a lot stricter in the last several years,\u201d says Adam Braverman, United States attorney for the Southern District of California. \u201cThey used to deposit $9,999 in 10 or 20 different banks. Now we look for those suspicious activities.\u201d Would-be launderers try to avoid triggering the software banks use to maintain anti-money-laundering controls by varying their deposits by amount, location \u2014 both geographically and institutionally \u2014 and even timing.Prepaid debit cards like Green Dot offer more anonymous (and less labor-intensive) means of working dirty money into the system. \u201cA new way organizations launder money is by purchasing gift cards or debit cards that they can resell and transfer money easily,\u201d Braverman says. Because anyone can buy such cards at a drugstore, for example, they\u2019re harder to trace than bank deposits, which require accounts. Purchasers still need to limit how much they put on debit cards to less than $10,000.If launderers want to do things the old-fashioned way, they can smuggle cash across a border. It\u2019s best to vacuum-seal it or pack it with plastic wrap to reduce the bulk \u2014 a million dollars can take up a lot of space \u2014 and hire a courier to transport it in duffel bags to a country with lax banking laws. Once the money is in, say, a South American location where that\u2019s the case, dollars can be exchanged for the local currency at a casa de cambio.The United Nations estimates that up to $1.6 trillion is laundered annually worldwide. Pop culture would have us believe that cash-driven businesses like strip clubs, car washes and casinos are the best places to clean up money.

McAdam of Verizon, according to people familiar with the discussions but not authorized to speak publicly.The lawsuit was pre-emptive, given that Ms. Redstone has considered replacing CBS\u2019s board if it continued to resist a merger with Viacom. CBS has wanted Les Moonves to become the combined company\u2019s C.E.O. and his C.O.O., Joe Ianniello, to take the No. 2 position. Viacom has pressed for its C.E.O., Bob Bakish, to hold that spot, and Ms. Redstone had largely sided with Viacom.CBS added that its board believes it is acting out of a fiduciary duty to all of its shareholders, and not just Ms. Redstone.\u2014 Michael de la MercedAfter CBS essentially declared war against its controlling shareholder and her desire to combine the company with Viacom, Ms. Redstone dropped a bombshell of her own.From a statement by National Amusements, the vehicle through which the Redstones control CBS and Viacom:NAI believes CBS\u2019s action today was precipitated following NAI raising specific concerns about incidents of bullying and intimidation in relation to one CBS director, dating back to 2016. NAI has made every effort to deal with this matter privately and confidentially. Unfortunately, CBS\u2019s action today continues to enable and empower such conduct.In meetings and informal discussions during the week of May 7, 2018 and continuing over the weekend of May 11\u201313, 2018, the CBS Special Committee finally determined that a CBS/Viacom merger is not in the best interests of CBS stockholders (other than NAI).CBS asserted that it filed suit because it was worried about Ms. Redstone blocking a meeting of the special committee taking place on Thursday. At the meeting, the committee is set to consider issuing a special dividend to all shareholders that could effectively neuter Ms. Redstone\u2019s 79 percent voting stake in the media company.National Amusement also said that CBS and Viacom had even reached a provisional agreement on valuation. Viacom\u2019s investors would receive 0.6135 CBS shares for each Viacom share they own, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations. The valuation marked a compromise for both sides and is a sign that CBS had previously supported exploring a merger of the two companies.Symantec, a cybersecurity software company, on Monday released details about an internal investigation that arose from concerns of a former employee.Symantec announced the investigation late on Thursday but provided scant details. On Monday, the company said the employee had drawn attention to certain financial measures and the company\u2019s public disclosures, including commentary on its historical financial results. The measures included those that might affect executive compensation, the company said in a statement released after the close of regular trading on Monday. Retaliation was another issue the former employee raised, the statement said, without going into detail.Symantec said it \u201cdid not anticipate a material adverse impact on its historical financial statements.\u201dShares of Symantec lost a third of their value in Friday but recovered somewhat on Monday. The stock finished up nearly 10 percent and added another 2.6 percent after the close.Symantec executives on Thursday did not hold a question and answer session with analysts to discuss the quarterly results it put out that day.

{"Headline": "Why Italy\u2019s Political Turmoil Is Causing Financial Angst Elsewhere", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s political convulsions have raised new fears about the future of the euro, the single currency of the European Union that was introduced 16 years ago.The possibility, however remote, that a populist Italian government would renounce the euro and revive the lira currency has unnerved many bankers and investors. Stocks tumbled on Tuesday on the fears, and the euro fell against the dollar to its weakest level in six months.Here is a look at why the fears could escalate into a major crisis, and what it could mean for Italy, the euro, Europe and the world.Italians have actually been talking about the euro since they began using it in 2002. For years, they have complained that their spending power has diminished under the euro. But the populists who did well in the election also say euro membership has subverted Italy\u2019s sovereignty \u2014 an increasingly resonant theme in the country.Before Italy adopted the euro, it had the power to raise or lower interest rates to affect the value of its currency \u2014 and Italy\u2019s economic competitiveness. A cheaper lira made Italian exports more affordable in other countries, strengthening the economy at home. But under the euro system, Italy \u2014 like all members of the eurozone \u2014 has no control over interest rates, which are set by the European Central Bank.The two parties that won the March 4 elections, the Five Star Movement and the League, have expressed hostility toward rules that govern the 28-nation European Union and the 19 members that have adopted the euro.Italy was one of the euro\u2019s founding members, and its economy is one of the largest in Europe, dwarfing that of Greece. An Italian exit could cause severe economic disruptions internationally and subvert investor confidence far beyond Italy and Europe. Interest rates could spike all over the world, reflecting a rising atmosphere of risk.The euro, on the other hand, has fared better in Italian public opinion, partly because of the financial convenience it has created. \u201cThe euro is a tight fit. Italians aren\u2019t happy, but that doesn\u2019t mean they want to go,\u201d said Maurizio Pessato, president of the polling firm SWG.The country\u2019s Democratic Party, the biggest loser in the last elections, has never questioned belonging to the eurozone.Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister and center-right politician who still wields major political influence, has delivered a mixed message.But his off-again-on-again partner in the center-right bloc, Matteo Salvini, has campaigned for years against a single currency and is known to wear shirts printed with \u201cBasta Euro\u201d \u2014 \u201cEnough with the Euro.\u201d His party, the League, has called for a vast overhaul of the treaties that regulate eurozone membership.For years, the Five Star Movement promulgated euro-skepticism, and initially promised a nonbinding referendum on the euro. That stance softened when it became clear that many investors feared a euro exit. On Monday, the party\u2019s leader, Luigi Di Maio, said his party had never supported leaving the euro. Still, the party wants Italy to have more sovereignty in economic choices.Experts are debating how that would be possible. Italy would have to change some articles of its Constitution, which is deeply intertwined with European principles, and draft a constitutional law. A referendum could be called.Even if Italians voted to exit the euro, the procedure could be lengthy and messy. Experts say that Italy would need to stop economic and banking activities for months to avoid speculation. Financial analysts say it is probable that many investors would avoid Italy.Just the possibility of an Italian government skeptical of the euro has created financial market volatility that could indirectly lead to problems in Italy, one of Europe\u2019s most indebted countries. If volatility continues, Italy may have difficulty selling government bonds that are used to pay its debts and finance salaries and pensions. The only solution would be a rescue from European Union financial authorities, with the acceptance of the same kind of austerity requirements imposed on Greece.Many experts agree that Italy would be poorer, with uncertain economic prospects for years. Italy would likely default on its debts, and its replacement currency would be greatly devalued. A default could lead to retaliation from other countries, asset freezes abroad and economic isolation. Italy sells more than half its goods within the European Union.Financial markets and speculators might see the euro as an untrustworthy currency, throwing into doubt the premise of stability and strength its founders envisioned. The effects could corrode confidence in the European Union itself.\u201cThe contagion would be enormous,\u201d said Massimo Bordignon, professor of economics at Milan\u2019s Catholic University. \u201cAnd the cost for Italy and for the other European countries would also be enormous.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

They\u2019re not going to throw it out.\u201dWine was offered, and so was cheese, and soon enough participants had bonded with one another. Each had a watercolor kit, a plastic plate for mixing and a paper towel for blotting. Dogs seemed somehow to purposely pose on the floor or sit in their owners\u2019 laps and watch as they became colorized. Some pet owners went bold, opting for bright, heavy strokes; others chose faint pastels.Maggie Finales, 49, a graphic designer, finished first.\u201cMy dog Luli passed away 10 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a tribute to her.\u201d Ms. Finales chose to paint her Yorkie from a photo taken in Puerto Rico. \u201cIt was the \u201990s. She was very happy lying in the sun. I\u2019ve had a portrait of her done before, but I\u2019ve never drawn her. She was with me for 17\u00bd years. This is a way of remembering her.\u201dFor Ms. Metalios, a dog groomer, the evening was an opportunity to tap into a different creative side, while spending quality time with Bolt.\u201cI love being in a place where I can bring him, and I like to paint,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have multiple paintings of my dog.\u201d Her first portrait of Bolt was placed prominently in her wall unit. \u201cI might replace that one with this one,\u201d she said. \u201cMy first was amateur. Now I\u2019m like a pro.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "College May Not Be Worth It Anymore", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Ruppel Shell writes about science, social justice and the economy.Recent decades have brought agreement that higher education is, if not a cure, then at least a protection against underemployment and the inequality it engenders. In 2012, President Barack Obama called a college degree an \u201ceconomic imperative that every family in America has to be able to afford.\u201dYoung people and their families go into debt because they believe that college will help them in the job market. And on average it does. But this raises a question: Does higher education itself offer that benefit, or are the people who earn bachelor\u2019s degrees already positioned to get higher-paying jobs?If future income was determined mainly by how much education people received, then you would assume that some higher education would be better than none. But this is often not the case.People who have dropped out of college \u2014 about 40 percent of all who attend \u2014 earn only a bit more than do people with only a high school education: $38,376 a year versus $35,256. For many, that advantage is barely enough to cover their student loan debt.And not all have even that advantage: African-American college dropouts on average earn less than do white Americans with only a high school degree. Meanwhile, low-income students of all races are far more likely to drop out of college than are wealthier students. Even with scholarships or free tuition, these students struggle with hefty fees and living costs, and they pay the opportunity cost of taking courses rather than getting a job.The value of a college degree also varies depending on the institution bestowing it. The tiny minority of students who attend elite colleges do far better on average than those who attend nonselective ones. Disturbingly, black and Hispanic students are significantly less likely than are white and Asian students to attend elite colleges, even when family income is controlled for. That is, students from wealthy black and Hispanic families have a lower chance of attending an elite college than do students from middle-class white families.It\u2019s a cruel irony that a college degree is worth less to people who most need a boost: those born poor. This revelation was made by the economists Tim Bartik and Brad Hershbein. Using a body of data, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which includes 50 years of interviews with 18,000 Americans, they were able to follow the lives of children born into poor, middle-class and wealthy families.But for those born into poverty, the results were far less impressive. College graduates born poor earned on average only slightly more than did high school graduates born middle class. And over time, even this small \u201cdegree bonus\u201d ebbed away, at least for men: By middle age, male college graduates raised in poverty were earning less than nondegree holders born into the middle class. The scholars conclude, \u201cIndividuals from poorer backgrounds may be encountering a glass ceiling that even a bachelor\u2019s degree does not break.\u201dThe authors don\u2019t speculate as to why this is the case, but it seems that students from poor backgrounds have less access to very high-income jobs in technology, finance and other fields. Class and race surely play a role.Part of the reason is oversupply. Technology increased the demand for educated workers, but that demand has been consistently outpaced by the number of people \u2014 urged on by everyone from teachers to presidents \u2014 prepared to meet it.No other nation punishes the \u201cuneducated\u201d as harshly as the United States. Nearly 30 percent of Americans without a high school diploma live in poverty, compared to 5 percent with a college degree, and we infer that this comes from a lack of education. But in 28 other wealthy developed countries, a lack of a high school diploma increases the probability of poverty by less than 5 percent. In these nations, a dearth of education does not predestine citizens for poverty.It shouldn\u2019t here, either: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer than 20 percent of American jobs actually require a bachelor\u2019s degree. By 2026, the bureau estimates that this proportion will rise, but only to 25 percent.Why do employers demand a degree for jobs that don\u2019t require them? Because they can.What all this suggests is that the college-degree premium may really be a no-college-degree penalty. It\u2019s not necessarily college that gives people the leverage to build a better working life, it\u2019s that not having a degree decreases whatever leverage they might otherwise have.This distinction is more than semantic. It is key to understanding the growing chasm between educational attainment and life prospects. For most of us, it\u2019s not our education that determines our employment trajectory but rather where that education positions us in relation to others.None of this is to suggest that higher education is not desirable: I\u2019ve encouraged my own children to take that path. But while we celebrate the most recent crop of college graduates, we should also acknowledge the many more Americans who will never don a cap and gown. They, too, deserve the chance to prove themselves worthy of good work, and a good life.Advertisement"}

In the final days, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is paying many employees for full-time work, but not requiring them to come into the office if they aren\u2019t needed.\u201cThis aggravates me so much,\u201d said Tracy Forbes, a manager at a Babies \u201cR\u201d Us store in Phoenix. \u201cThese people are getting rich, and we are getting nothing after keeping this company going for 60 years.\u201dFor creditors, it is all about the pecking order.Vendors are fighting to get paid for their toys and landlords are scrambling to find new tenants for the hulking stores that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is leaving behind. Bankruptcy professionals typically sit near the top and are largely assured of getting paid.The high cost of bankruptcy has been an issue for years. The fees in the Lehman Brothers case topped $1 billion two years after the investment bank filed the largest corporate bankruptcy case in history and help set off the global financial crisis in 2008.\u201cThe fees have been increasing, and there is no effective means to control them,\u201d said Lynn LoPucki, a bankruptcy professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.Companies can choose where they want to file for bankruptcy. And Mr. LoPucki said bankruptcy judges were reluctant to push back on fees, fearing lawyers would choose to file big cases elsewhere.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, based in Wayne, N.J., filed its Chapter 11 case in federal court in Richmond, Va., which has a reputation for approving large professional fees.Bankruptcy professionals say that working to reorganize or liquidate a company is time-consuming, complicated and intense. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is made up of multiple corporate entities \u2014 in the United States and internationally \u2014 that have hired lawyers and advisers.All of that has added up to a big bill. So far, the company said, it has shelled out $108 million on professional fees. It expects to spend as much as $348 million as a result of the bankruptcy, according to the company documents.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us collapsed quickly, going from a potential turnaround play to a costly liquidation.With cash tight, the company wanted last spring to take some of the pressure off by refinancing about $200 million of its total $5 billion in debt. But when word got out that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had hired restructuring advisers, the company\u2019s vendors were spooked heading into the crucial Christmas season.By September, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said it had no choice but to file for bankruptcy.The company had originally hoped to shed some of its debt and keep operating. But after dismal holiday sales, the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us lenders began to question whether the company had a future and threatened to pull back on financing.In March, the company said it would close hundreds of United States stores and lay off all its workers.Saddled with huge debt, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had a difficult time competing with Walmart and Amazon. Loan payments were sapping cash that it could have spent on updating its cavernous stores and building out its website.Ms. Forbes\u2019s last day at the Phoenix store is on June 30. The company, she says, will stop contributing to her 401(k) account next week. Ms. Forbes says she is also owed six weeks of vacation, but will not be paid for it.This week, she traveled to Washington D.C. with the labor advocacy group OUR to lobby members of Congress on the need to protect severance in bankruptcy cases. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get severance from Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, we have to stop it from happening to someone else,\u201d Ms. Forbes said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mulvaney Downgrades Student Loan Unit in Consumer Bureau Reshuffle", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe change, outlined in an email sent to the bureau\u2019s staff Wednesday morning, is part of an effort by Mr. Mulvaney to refocus the agency away from its consumer finance enforcement and rule-writing mission and more toward providing consumers with information about their legal rights.It follows a similar move Mr. Mulvaney made in February, when he folded the bureau\u2019s fair lending division into the consumer unit, telling staff it would \u201ccontinue to focus on advocacy, coordination and education.\u201dAmong the bureau\u2019s career staff, the shift was regarded as a new attack on one of the bureau\u2019s core statutory functions, and another attempt by Mr. Mulvaney and his team to dismantle a consumer watchdog reviled by President Trump.One person at the bureau familiar with the student loan office\u2019s work said it clearly was being targeted. Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s reorganization left untouched several other groups with similarly specific focuses, including offices that concentrate on protecting service members and older Americans.John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the agency, called the move a \u201cvery modest organizational chart change.\u201d\u201cThe work of the office continues, personnel are all on the job and working on the same material as they were before,\u201d Mr. Czwartacki said. \u201cThe bottom line is there is no functional or even practical change.\u201dBut the bureau distanced itself further from any interest in an overhaul of student loan collection by removing the issue from its long-term regulatory agenda on Wednesday.The agenda, a formal statement of the bureau\u2019s rule-making interests, is published twice a year a year by the White House Office of Management and Budget, which Mr. Mulvaney also leads.The memo also outlined several other moves, including delegating Brian Johnson \u2014 a former top aide to Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who is a staunch opponent of the bureau \u2014 to be Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s \u201cfinal stop\u201d on all policy matters.\u201cAt a time where Americans are saddled with $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, the last thing we should do is tear away critical support,\u201d Attorney General Xavier Becerra of California, whose office is cracking down on lenders, said in a tweet after word of the reorganization leaked.Navient has denied wrongdoing and deployed a team of Washington-based lobbyists to fight what they believe is an unfair investigation. The company spent $4 million last quarter on legal costs, \u201cvirtually all of which\u201d related to the bureau\u2019s case, Navient\u2019s chief financial officer said on its earnings conference call last month.Last year a federal judge rejected Navient\u2019s request to dismiss the agency\u2019s lawsuit. The company argued in court that the promises it made on its website and elsewhere to help students navigate their loan repayment options were strictly marketing hype.\u201cThese are general marketing statements,\u201d Matthew T. Martens, Navient\u2019s lawyer, told Judge Robert D. Mariani in the Federal District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt\u2019s friendly talk, it\u2019s puffery, but it is not the stuff of a legal obligation to now become your financial counselor.\u201dJudge Mariani disagreed. Navient\u2019s conduct \u201ccreated a duty to act in accordance with their own statements,\u201d he wrote in a ruling that allowed the case to proceed.\u201cThe size of the student loan portfolio is massive, and it\u2019s growing \u2014 second only to home mortgages \u2014 and now we are gutting oversight,\u201d said Chris Peterson, a University of Utah law professor who was a top staff member at the bureau.\u201cIt\u2019s appalling,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying to take the teeth out of enforcement, and it\u2019s going to have a big impact on the most vulnerable student borrowers, who are being misled and bankrupted.\u201dMr. Mulvaney\u2019s political appointees at the bureau have been discussing how to proceed on student loan enforcement, including the Navient case, with political appointees working for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, according to two administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Career investigators who have worked on the Navient case have largely been kept out of the loop, they said.Mr. Mulvaney, responding to reports that he was considering a settlement favorable to the lender, told a Senate committee last month that the bureau was \u201creviewing all of the bureau\u2019s enforcement matters to ensure that the ongoing work adheres to the proper interpretation of federal consumer financial law.\u201dSoon after, a group of Democratic senators released a statement calling that response \u201cevasive\u201d and demanding that the interim director not let Navient \u201coff lightly.\u201dThe announcement of the student loan enforcement change was buried at the bottom of a bullet-pointed memo sent by Mr. Mulvaney \u2014 who refers to himself as \u201cMick M\u201d in bureau correspondence \u2014 to his staff.\u201cThe office of \u2018Students and Young Consumers,\u2019\u201d he wrote, \u201cwill be folded into the office of \u2018Financial Education.\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to Navient.

{"Headline": "House Votes to Dismantle Bias Rule in Auto Lending", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican regulatory rollback took a step forward on Tuesday as the House voted to scrap an Obama-era rule intended to prevent discrimination by auto lenders and as lawmakers inched closer to a bipartisan agreement to alter portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.Both the Senate and House voided the consumer rule using the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law that gives Congress the power to expunge rules that were created by government agencies.The auto-lending guidance has divided lawmakers along party lines, with Democrats arguing that the policy protected consumers from unfair discrimination and Republicans making the case that it was an example of overreach by the consumer bureau that was squeezing the lending industry. Eleven House Democrats supported the measure on Tuesday.Consumer advocates warned that doing away with antidiscrimination protections would drive up fees for those seeking auto loans and said that other consumer protections could soon be targeted.\u201cCompanies will put millions of people into more expensive car loans simply because of the color of their skin,\u201d said Rion Dennis, an advocate of financial overhaul at Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cBy using the Congressional Review Act to wipe out straightforward regulatory guidance, the congressional majority has also opened the door to challenging longstanding efforts to protect workers, consumers, civil rights, the environment and the economy.\u201dOn Tuesday, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said that the consumer bureau used faulty methodology when producing an analysis to justify its auto-lending rule.\u201cThey claimed that somehow there was unconscious discrimination,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said. \u201cThey made it up. They had no data.\u201dLast year, the Government Accountability Office determined that the bureau\u2019s guidance was technically a rule, a decision that gave Congress authority to use the Congressional Review Act to kill it. While several rules developed toward the end of the Obama administration have been nullified by this Congress, rescinding the auto financing rule was considered unusual since it is an older provision that has been in place for years.Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, warned on Tuesday that Republicans were opening a Pandora\u2019s box that could herald the repeal of rules that have been in place for years, potentially harming consumers in a variety of ways. She pushed back against the suggestion that the consumer bureau rule relied upon bad data and said killing it would hurt minorities.\u201cThis is about discrimination,\u201d Ms. Waters said.Republicans and Democrats have long been at odds over the mandate of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Republicans have long derided the agency for overstepping its bounds and last year, Mr. Trump installed Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, to run the bureau on an interim basis. Since then, Mr. Mulvaney has worked hard to scale back its ambitions and freeze much of its enforcement activities.While lawmakers continue to disagree over portions of the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory agenda, Republicans and Democrats are nearing agreement on the first significant bipartisan bill to alter the Dodd-Frank Act.House Republicans, who had been pushing for a more expansive financial overhaul bill that would eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and make other sweeping changes, appear ready to accept the more limited Senate bill that passed this year. That bill would largely ease regulations that largely apply to community banks.Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the House speaker, said on Tuesday that he had reached an agreement with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to move forward with a vote on the Dodd-Frank bill in the House. He said that the House would also send to the Senate a package of other pieces of financial overhaul legislation that the House has been working on that they believe would add to that bill.Additional pieces of legislation that stray too far from what the Senate passed on a bipartisan basis are unlikely to pass in the Senate, where Republicans have a very slim majority.Mr. Ryan did not indicate when he planned to hold a vote, but lawmakers and administration officials have signaled that it could be in the coming weeks.Thomas Kaplan contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Giuliani Says Trump Repaid Cohen for Stormy Daniels Hush Money", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat statement, which Mr. Giuliani made Wednesday night on Fox News, contradicted the president, who has said he had no knowledge about any payment to the actress, Stephanie Clifford, to keep quiet before the election.[Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.]\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Trump responded. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dIn an interview with The New York Times shortly after his Fox News appearance, Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and longtime Trump confidant who recently joined the president\u2019s legal team, said that he had documentation showing that Mr. Trump had personally made the payment. Mr. Giuliani indicated that the goal was to conclusively demonstrate that there was no campaign finance violation involved.\u201cThat removes the campaign finance violation, and we have all the documentary proof for it,\u201d he said. Mr. Giuliani added that when the initial payment was made, Mr. Cohen did it \u201con his own authority.\u201d\u201cSome time after the campaign is over, they set up a reimbursement, $35,000 a month, out of his personal family account,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. He added that over all, Mr. Cohen was paid $460,000 or $470,000 from Mr. Trump through those payments, which also included money for \u201cincidental expenses\u201d that he had incurred on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf.The president has repeatedly denied that he had an affair with Ms. Clifford, who has described having intimate contact with Mr. Trump before he became president.\u201cThey funneled through a law firm, and the president repaid it,\u201d Mr. Giuliani told Sean Hannity, the Fox News host. After Mr. Hannity asked for clarification, Mr. Giuliani insisted: \u201cThat was money that was paid by his lawyer. The president reimbursed that over the period of several months.\u201dThe source of the $130,000 payment is at the center of several legal disputes involving Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford. That includes whether the payment to Ms. Clifford was in effect a contribution to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign aimed at preventing a negative article from surfacing just before Election Day.Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Cohen had \u201csettled several problems for\u201d Mr. Trump, and that the payment related to them. Another person familiar with the payment confirmed that that was the mechanism used to repay Mr. Cohen.Mr. Giuliani said that he was \u201cnot clear that\u201d Mr. Trump was aware of the payment to Ms. Clifford at the time it was made, and he said that his understanding was that the president did not learn about the payment to her until recently.\u201cI don\u2019t think he did\u201d know \u201cuntil now,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.The comments on Fox sent a jolt through Washington and New York, including the legal teams working on behalf of the president, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford, who has sued Mr. Cohen in an attempt to be released from the nondisclosure agreement that accompanied the $130,000 payment in October 2016.Michael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, said Wednesday night on Twitter that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments amounted to an admission that the president had lied to the American people about whether he was aware of the hush payment.From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress.In an interview, Mr. Avenatti said a key issue going forward would be how Mr. Trump accounted for any such payment and whether it was hidden in a way that could violate anti-money laundering statutes.Mr. Giuliani\u2019s statement to Mr. Hannity was the latest of several contradictory narratives from Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives about the deal to pay Ms. Clifford for her silence during the campaign, each of which have had potential implications for violating campaign finance disclosure laws.Mr. Cohen had previously provided a detailed account of how he had paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 out of his own pocket, drawing down on a home loan to do so. That opened Mr. Cohen and the Trump campaign to charges that he violated the law by exceeding the amount that an individual can donate to a presidential campaign.If Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment, that could help Mr. Cohen and the campaign avoid prosecution for violating campaign contribution limits because a candidate is allowed to contribute an unlimited amount to his own campaign.According to a person close to the president, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment, a determination made in recent weeks by the president\u2019s lawyers after examining banking records. The lawyers determined that campaign funds had not been used for the payment, the person said.The lawyers also concluded that the funds did not come from a third party or the Trump Organization, the person said. While the disclosure may be embarrassing for the president, his lawyers believe the payment did not violate campaign finance laws, the person said.Another person familiar with the payment to Mr. Cohen from Mr. Trump said the money was reimbursed in a series of payments, not in a lump sum.But such a payment from the candidate \u2014 even if it was made through a lawyer \u2014 would have to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission as an in-kind contribution to the campaign and as an expenditure by the campaign, if it was for the purpose of influencing the election.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign did not disclose the reimbursement to Mr. Cohen on its commission reports.The crucial question in determining whether the reimbursement to Mr. Cohen violated campaign finance laws might be whether the payment was specifically intended to help Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.Paul S. Ryan, an official at the government watchdog group Common Cause, argued that \u201call the facts indicate that the payment was to influence the election.\u201dMr. Ryan asserted that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s admission could allow prosecutors to make the case that Mr. Trump \u201cknowingly caused his campaign committee to file an incomplete disclosure report with the F.E.C.\u201d\u201cUntil tonight, it would have been tough to prove that because Donald Trump had denied knowing about the payment,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cBut his reimbursement amounts to knowledge.\u201dWhile most violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act\u2019s disclosure provisions are misdemeanors, a knowing and willful violation could be a felony.But Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments could cloud Mr. Avenatti\u2019s legal argument that his client should be formally released from the hush agreement she signed. When the president told reporters he knew nothing about the deal, he helped Ms. Clifford\u2019s case that the hush agreement was not binding if Mr. Trump did not know about it and did not sign it.Though far from bringing clarity to the question, Mr. Giuliani obscured it further \u2014 now two lawyers for the president are providing two very different versions of events.Kenneth P. Vogel, Michael S. Schmidt and Matt Apuzzo contributed reporting from Washington, and Jim Rutenberg from New York.Advertisement"}

He drinks rainwater caught from the sky and eats avocados from trees in his backyard. Mainlanders express envy when they hear how he bought nearly 100 acres of Hawaii\u2019s Big Island for just over $100,000.But there\u2019s a catch to this off-grid paradise: Mr. Dreaming lives a short stroll from a lava-spewing rift of Kilauea, one of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes.\u201cWe have a reputation for being something of a pirate\u2019s lair,\u201d said Mr. Dreaming, 64, a musician and contractor who was raised in New Jersey with the name John Fattorosi. \u201cBut we really just want to live freely in a place of stunning beauty without anyone telling us what to do.\u201dFor many of those who continued to buy homes, the lure continued to be cheap housing in a tropical wonderland.Hawaii has what may be the highest statewide home prices in the United States, with the median home value in the state at about $605,000, according to the housing website Zillow. And while the unemployment rate is low at around 2 percent, that figure obscures other problems. Hawaii had the highest cost of living of any state in 2017, according to the Center for Regional Economic Competitiveness, driven largely by housing prices. Zoning restrictions in parts of the archipelago and the use of private residences as vacation rentals constrict available affordable housing even further.The result: Even though Hawaii\u2019s economy seems to be strong, wage increases have trailed the climb in home prices, fueling an exodus of people from the state. For some who don\u2019t want to leave, or for mainlanders seeking to move to Hawaii, the far-flung areas of the Big Island hold allure.\u201cWe\u2019re 40,000 housing units from anywhere near adequate to easing the need for places for people to live in Hawaii,\u201d said Carl Bonham, an economist at the University of Hawaii. \u201cThat\u2019s why Puna is an option no matter its remoteness or risks.\u201dMany homes in Puna are not built to code, or are built in zones where lava flows have already wiped out previous developments, which some residents attribute to the frontier mind-set here. Others, however, contend that public officials have not enforced existing regulations as strictly as they could have.Many of the subdivisions in Puna were created in the 1960s before the first lava hazard maps, drawn in the mid-1970s, said Daryn Arai, deputy planning director for the County of Hawaii.\u201cIf we knew back then what we know now, things would probably be different,\u201d Mr. Arai said. But he added that the county currently has no regulations that apply directly to lava flow hazard zones, aside from building codes that establish wind and seismic safety standards. Those generally apply, however, to how a house is constructed, not where it is built.Meanwhile, many homeowners are scrambling as the lava flows advance.Now, Ms. Sengir said, she is desperately trying to save some possessions in case the lava flows overrun her home, which is uninsured for such an event. Still, Ms. Sengir took a more conventional route to living in Leilani than some of her neighbors.Howie \u201cSunray\u201d Rosin, a Brooklyn-born plumber, moved to the Big Island in 1997, but only recently was able to afford to move to Leilani when the owner of a home nearing foreclosure allowed him to live on the property in exchange for paying property taxes of about $2,000 a year.\u201cI got incredibly lucky,\u201d said Mr. Rosin, 48, while guiding visitors around the dilapidated villa where he now lives. \u201cThis place is wilder than you can imagine,\u201d Mr. Rosin, also a musician and Navy veteran, added. \u201cMany people are willing to risk living next to a volcano because the living is cheap.\u201dAt the time, basic infrastructure \u2014 things like paved roads, sewage systems, running water and electricity \u2014 was lacking. Subdivisions such as Leilani now have some of those services, but many residents still rely on rain catchment tanks for water. Just a few miles away, many homeowners live entirely off the grid, on even cheaper land parcels.In some parts of Puna, newcomers are building nearly directly on fields of hardened lava from eruptions that destroyed other communities. For instance, an eruption of Kilauea in 1990 destroyed about 100 homes in the community of Kalapana. Less than 30 years later, dozens of homes now stand atop the flow field that swallowed Kalapana. The homes, some built without heed to code, lack ties to the electricity grid and sewage systems. Residents collect water in catchment tanks.Often, banks won\u2019t issue a traditional mortgage on such properties, but those determined to come here have found other ways to finance their ventures.\u201cOn some days we can hear the roaring of the eruptions in Puna, like a jet engine taking off,\u201d said Rainbow Foster, 33, who bought a home and a patch of land on the lava field with her husband three years ago for $55,000 in an owner-financed deal.\u201cOur credit rating wasn\u2019t good and we had very little money,\u201d said Ms. Foster, who is self-employed, as is her husband, Tony, 44. They get by doing odd jobs and selling tie-dyed T-shirts, but cherish the sense of freedom they have in Puna to raise their two children. Some of their neighbors have evacuated, but Ms. Foster said that isn\u2019t an option for their family.\u201cThis is the life we chose,\u201d said Ms. Foster, who grew up in Puna. \u201cWe\u2019re hanging tight.\u201dTamir Kalifa contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Companies Rushed to Invest in Iran. What Now?", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 European companies moved quickly to invest in Iran after it agreed in 2015 to mothball its nuclear weapons program in return for an end to economic sanctions.Officials in Europe want to protect its companies by finding ways to shield them from American sanctions while they continue doing business in Iran.The United States, however, has not struck an optimistic tone. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has already said licenses that allow Boeing and Airbus, the American and European aircraft giants, to sell to Iran \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d\u201cThe objective is to put and maintain maximum sanctions on Iran,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.With a population of about 82 million and substantial oil reserves, Iran represented a largely untouched market with the potential for fast growth, a rare opportunity for Western companies with global ambitions.While players like General Electric and Boeing lined up orders, many American companies, including oil giants like Chevron and Exxon Mobil, had to watch from a distance; even with the deal in place, they were still effectively blocked by sanctions imposed by the United States from working in Iran. European businesses did not have the same restrictions.For Europe, Iran was a particularly promising example of the kind of fast-growing emerging country that helped lift the region out of a severe debt crisis in recent years. German companies, for instance, have thrived by selling factory machinery, power grid infrastructure and construction equipment that growing nations need to build modern economies.Despite its potential, however, Iran has largely been a disappointment for European investors. In a dysfunctional economy, many failed to gain traction in a huge bureaucracy rife with political power struggles.Companies have also been stifled by a reluctance of foreign banks to provide financing, and fears \u2014 fully justified, as it turned out \u2014 that the nuclear d\u00e9tente would not last.Although exports from the European Union to Iran increased by about one-third last year to 10.8 billion euros, or about $12.8 billion, the country still ranked only 33rd among the bloc\u2019s trading partners, behind the likes of Kazakhstan and Serbia.\u201cGerman-Iranian economic relations are lagging their potential,\u201d Volker Treier, head of the exports department at the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said in an email.After Mr. Trump\u2019s decision not to extend a moratorium on sanctions, Mr. Treier said, \u201cthe moderately positive development in business with Iran comes with a big question mark.\u201dIn the end, expectations may simply have been too high.So far, Airbus has delivered just three jets, none of them super jumbos, a company spokesman said on Tuesday. Two of the three have been leased.In 2016, Daimler signed an agreement with Iran Khodro, a vehicle maker based in Tehran, to distribute Fuso brand trucks. Demand has been limited, however, because of Iran\u2019s weak economy, Daimler spokesman Florian Martens said Tuesday.Whether Total can stay in the deal is open to question. Although Europe may yet carve out protections for companies from the region, the company fears the imposition of so-called secondary sanctions by the United States against non-American businesses and individuals as part of the decision to pull out of the nuclear accord.Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Total\u2019s chief executive, recently said that the company would argue that because it had signed its Iran deal before Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, Total should benefit from a \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d and would ask for a waiver from the United States to continue. Total also might turn its share over to its minority partner CNPC, a Chinese state-owned oil company.European Union officials said on Tuesday that they were making plans to blunt the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal \u2014 presumably helping insulate companies like Total.\u201cWe are working on plans to protect the interests of European companies,\u201d Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, told reporters on Tuesday.It was unclear, however, what those measures might be.France, for example, hopes to engage in more detailed dialogue with the Trump administration to press for waivers for its companies. But it was too soon to say whether Mr. Trump would be swayed, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. It was also not immediately clear whether Mr. Trump would recognize the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d arguments favored by Total, the people said.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the deal with Iran may not automatically prompt governments to choke off trade.Having ripped up an international deal, the president may have trouble recruiting allies and cutting off exports of Iranian oil, the country\u2019s most valuable product.Iran\u2019s crude exports have risen to about 2.4 million barrels a day in recent months, after being around 1 million barrels a day in the months before sanctions were lifted.\u201cIt is going to be hard to get people on board,\u201d said Richard Nephew, a former State Department official who was the lead sanctions expert in the Iran negotiations under President Barack Obama and who successfully persuaded other customers of Iran to stop buying its oil in the years leading up to the eventual nuclear deal.Mr. Nephew, now a senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, forecast that of Iran\u2019s major customers, Japan and South Korea would most likely cooperate on sanctions because they are worried about Washington\u2019s negotiations with North Korea.He said European customers, however, would probably be slower to come around. And China and India, which in some months have been buying more than 1 million barrels a day from Iran, may continue to buy Iranian crude in the same quantities.All told, the impact of renewed sanctions would be an estimated loss of 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian exports, Mr. Nephew said. That would be a significant amount, but much less than the 1.4 million barrels a day or so that Mr. Obama\u2019s sanctions achieved.In the meantime, Iran is running its oil industry at full tilt, analysts say. \u201cIt is obvious that they are anticipating potential new sanctions and running full speed before it happens,\u201d said Antoine Rostand, president of Kayrros, a Paris-based market research firm.But the sanctions would nonetheless create major complications. Iran has quickly pumped up oil production in existing fields, but these will eventually become tapped out. It won\u2019t be able to bring new fields online without partners and capital.Still, giant oil corporations have not given up on Iran.\u201cWe continue to be interested in exploring the role Shell can play in developing Iran\u2019s energy potential within the boundaries of applicable laws,\u201d Royal Dutch Shell said in an email on Tuesday.The same principle applies to other investors, provided they are big enough \u2014 and wealthy enough \u2014 to handle the risk, said Andreas Schweitzer, managing director of Arjan Capital, a firm in London that advises companies on investing in Iran.\u201cThose who want this 80-million-person market and have a long-term strategy,\u201d he said, \u201cwill go there with or without Mr. Trump.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the chief executive of Total. He is Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, not Pouyann\u00e9e.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Stanley Reed from London.

{"Headline": "After Years of Trying, Virginia Finally Will Expand Medicaid", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublican lawmakers in the state had blocked Medicaid expansion for four straight years, but a number of them dropped their opposition after their party almost lost the House of Delegates in elections last fall and voters named health care as a top issue.The vote, on a budget bill that included the Medicaid expansion, came almost three months after the House approved a similar plan. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat also elected last fall, has been a vocal proponent of the expansion and can now claim a victory that his predecessor, Terry McAuliffe, desperately wanted but never got.The House passed the Senate bill within hours; it will now go to Mr. Northam\u2019s desk. The measure includes a requirement that many adult recipients who don\u2019t have a disability either work or volunteer as a condition of receiving Medicaid \u2014 a provision that was crucial to getting enough Republicans on board.\u201cThis budget is the culmination of five years of effort to bring our taxpayer dollars home from Washington and expand Medicaid,\u201d Mr. Northam, a pediatrician, said in a statement. \u201cAs a doctor, I\u2019m so proud of the significant step we\u2019ve taken together to help Virginians get quality, affordable health care.\u201dThe Affordable Care Act gave states the option to expand Medicaid starting in 2014, and required the federal government to pay no less than 90 percent of the cost. Opponents said that even 10 percent was unaffordable for most states, and that the federal government might renege on paying its share, especially if the health law were repealed.On a day when Virginia neared becoming one of the biggest states, by population, to expand the program to date \u2014 an important step forward for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 President Trump boasted inaccurately at a bill signing that \u201cfor the most part we will have gotten rid of a majority of Obamacare.\u201dThe federal government shares the overall cost of Medicaid with the states; the program covers about 75 million Americans, or 1 in 5. About 11 million of them were able to enroll as a result of states\u2019 decisions to expand the program under the Affordable Care Act. Republican attempts to repeal the health law last year would have largely undone the Medicaid expansion and caused most of the new recipients to lose their coverage.Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates voted to approve Medicaid expansion during the regular 60-day legislative session that ended in March. But the Senate, whose members were not up for re-election last fall, remained opposed. Lawmakers failed to pass a state budget then because of the issue.\u201cThat is debt, and I have four kids who are going to be having to pay for that for the rest of their lives,\u201d Senator Amanda Chase, a Republican from Chesterfield, said of the federal funds spent on Medicaid expansion, explaining her vote against it on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a fiscal burden, but it\u2019s not the best solution for people who want real, quality health care.\u201dTwo other Republican state senators, Ben Chafin and Jill Holtzman Vogel, also voted for Medicaid expansion on Wednesday.\u201cI came to the conclusion, for me and my district, that no just wasn\u2019t the answer any longer,\u201d Mr. Chafin. who represents an economically struggling district in southwestern Virginia, said on the Senate floor. \u201cDoing nothing about the medical conditions, the state of health care in my district, just wasn\u2019t the answer any longer.\u201dThe approval did not come without last-minute drama: Thomas Norment, the Senate majority leader and steadfast opponent of Medicaid expansion, tried unsuccessfully to block it in the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, and again on the Senate floor on Wednesday, when he pushed to pass a version of the budget that did not include it. Instead, a substitute budget including amendments that allowed for Medicaid expansion, offered by Senator Hanger, was approved.The state currently has one of the most restrictive Medicaid programs in the country, covering mostly children and disabled adults. Childless adults are not eligible, and working parents cannot earn more than 30 percent of the federal poverty level, or $5,727 a year.The Affordable Care Act allows states to expand Medicaid to adults earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level, which comes out to $16,643 for an individual.Most of the remaining states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid are in the South and Midwest, and are led by Republicans. Along with 32 states, the District of Columbia has expanded the program already.Advertisement"}

The coalition\u2019s agenda, moreover, does not call for pulling out of the European Union or giving up the euro.Yet the new Italian government cannot be dismissed as just another in Italy\u2019s long history of political crises. The shift of a core member of the European Union, one whose allegiance to the \u201cEuropean project\u201d had not been in doubt, toward the new Central European members hostile to Brussels is a serious blow to the deeper European integration championed by President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Imposing stern rules on Greece, and scolding Poland and Hungary for their illiberal policies, were actions taken by established Western nations secure in their roles in Europe. But if Italy, the fourth-largest economy in the European Union, starts defying union rules and demanding a renegotiation of the terms of its membership, it will be far more difficult to hold other members in check.Still, it is too early for Mr. Bannon and his allies to celebrate, or for the champions of the union to panic. The allure of populists can fade rapidly if they fail to come up with concrete solutions to the resentments that brought them to power. The task for Mr. Macron and Ms. Merkel and their allies is to stay the course on the bloc\u2019s values, coherence and rules, but also to recognize and address the anger that has fed the rebellion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ireland\u2019s Abortion Referendum Becomes a Test for Facebook and Google", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "Major tech companies took steps to prevent foreign meddling online before voters in Ireland cast ballots on Friday. Here\u2019s how those efforts are working out.Supported byMr. Dwyer, who co-founded an election transparency group, pulled up one anti-abortion YouTube video that had only a few views when it was posted last year. After the video was republished as a referendum campaign ad on Facebook by a group from an unknown location, it attracted more than 1.2 million views, he said. He also showed an anti-abortion ad on Facebook that purported to be from an unbiased organization, but was also purchased by a buyer who couldn\u2019t be traced.\u201cWith social media in this campaign, our democracy is up for sale to the highest bidder and we\u2019re blindfolded at the auction,\u201d said Mr. Dwyer, 28, who runs the Transparent Referendum Initiative, which is pushing for new campaign disclosure laws for digital advertising.Critics warn that if Facebook and Google cannot minimize their negative influence in a country the size of Ireland, which has a population of 4.8 million, far bigger challenges will loom with the midterm elections in the United States this November.Even so, the effectiveness of the companies\u2019 actions in Ireland has not been clear cut \u2014 and it may take months, if not years, to know whether any disinformation campaigns broke through their efforts. That\u2019s especially so since ads are only one part of a larger misinformation problem that also includes organic posts.Mr. Dwyer said Facebook\u2019s ban of abortion ads financed by foreign groups had reduced such ads on the social network. Yet abortion ads from international groups continued to make their way online through other digital platforms, and campaign materials were still being posted and shared on Facebook by users, he said.\u201cThe broader question is what information is flowing through the system and how much of that information is pollution and what is not,\u201d said Gavin Sheridan, a co-founder of the online news outlet Storyful, who tracked foreign ad spending for the Irish vote. \u201cWe can\u2019t really know.\u201dNiamh Sweeney, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy for Ireland, said the company blocked foreign political ads on May 8 after finding some worrisome activity. In one instance, she said, the company found a foreign group paying to increase the visibility of Facebook posts created by Irish campaigners. That violated the spirit of Irish law that bans international campaign contributions. Facebook declined to identify the groups involved.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a small thing to do, but we felt it was the right move to make,\u201d Ms. Sweeney said, adding that Facebook\u2019s team in Ireland recommended the action to the company\u2019s Silicon Valley leadership.Google, which banned all referendum-related ads in Ireland on May 9, declined to comment. The company said in a statement this month that it had stopped running the ads to protect the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the vote.The Irish government committed in January to holding a referendum on whether to repeal a 35-year-old constitutional ban \u2014 known as the Eighth Amendment \u2014 on abortion. If a majority of voters approve the repeal, the amendment would be replaced with a new clause stating the Irish Parliament has the power to make laws regulating abortion.Since then, the issue has been hotly debated, with campaign placards taking over downtown Dublin and the referendum dominating conversation. The vote\u2019s outcome appears too close to call.Mr. Dwyer said he began noticing the flood of online abortion ads almost immediately after starting the Transparent Referendum Initiative in February. The ads came from groups with names like Women Betrayed by Abortion, Chicago for Repeal and Eighth Debate.In one ad that Mr. Dwyer traced as coming from a British religious organization, the message read: \u201cDon\u2019t allow more children to be lost to legalized abortion.\u201d Another Facebook ad, posted by a group from an untraceable location, showed the image of a fetus in a toilet.The pileup of such ads helped lead to Facebook\u2019s blockage of political advertising from groups based outside Ireland. In addition, the company introduced a transparency tool so people can see all the ads an organization is airing across the site.Facebook also deployed an artificial intelligence system developed after the 2016 United States presidential campaign to spot foreign ads. The system flags ads that are suspected of coming from outside Ireland by analyzing billing information, where a website originated, what kind of ad-targeting specifications are used, and if the ad host is using a virtual private network to hide where it is based.The system will play a critical role in the company\u2019s future election efforts. Ms. Sweeney said it was still improving and occasionally produced false positives and other inaccuracies.While many Irish are split on the abortion vote, they have been united in their criticism of Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s roles in the referendum.\u201cFacebook and Google are deciding what to do with our referendum,\u201d said Mr. Sheridan, the chief executive of Vizlegal, a maker of legal software, who supports lifting the abortion ban.Mr. Sheridan is part of a volunteer army that uncovered suspicious ads coming from groups outside Ireland. \u201cWe didn\u2019t elect Mark Zuckerberg to make decisions about how our referendum should be run,\u201d he said, referring to Facebook\u2019s chief executive.Others involved in the campaign said they were upset at the internet companies\u2019 ban of political ads because it deprived them of an avenue of influence. John McGuirk, a spokesman for the Save the 8th campaign, which favors retaining the abortion ban, said the group was preparing to spend 40,000 euros on YouTube ads, or the equivalent of about $47,000. But since Google had stopped taking referendum-related spots, they were no longer able to do that.\u201cIt\u2019s frightening the extent to which they can make a decision on the basis of something and be answerable to nobody,\u201d Mr. McGuirk said.\u201cWe need to know who is running the ads and who\u2019s paying for the ads,\u201d said James Lawless, the legislator who sponsored the bill.Facebook said it supported the Irish bill. Google declined to comment.Mr. Dwyer said governments globally must set stricter rules around disclosures of online campaign ads so voters knew who was paying for the material showing up in their Facebook feeds, in their Google search results and on YouTube.\u201cIreland is definitely not unique,\u201d he said. \u201cNo country has cracked this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Spain, Mariano Rajoy\u2019s Government Veers Toward Collapse", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe choice for Mr. Rajoy was increasingly stark: jump first and resign his post, or wait to be pushed out on Friday when the Parliament was scheduled for a vote he seemed nearly certain to lose. Either outcome would mean a change of leadership for Spain and would send the country sooner or later to new elections.But unlike Italy, where the country\u2019s economic stagnation under the euro has become a central issue, the issue in Spain is Mr. Rajoy himself and a long-building corruption scandal that has tainted his conservative Popular Party.Afterward, Spain\u2019s main opposition Socialist Party put forward a motion asking lawmakers to vote Mr. Rajoy from office and install a Socialist administration, ahead of another national election.If that measure succeeds Friday, it would complete a remarkable comeback for the Socialist leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and make him Spain\u2019s new prime minister. If Mr. Rajoy resigns, it would allow his deputy prime minister to take over on an interim basis.By midafternoon, the Basque nationalist party said that its lawmakers would support Mr. S\u00e1nchez, ensuring that a vote of no-confidence would be approved by a slim majority of the 350 lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament. The two main Catalan separatist parties were also set to vote against Mr. Rajoy.At the start of debate on Thursday, Mr. S\u00e1nchez urged Mr. Rajoy to resign rather than getting voted out of office.\u201cWhat more needs to happen for you to understand that remaining is damaging and a burden not only for the country but also for your own party?\u201d Mr. S\u00e1nchez said in Parliament, addressing Mr. Rajoy.Mr. S\u00e1nchez also confirmed that a Socialist administration would maintain the budgetary plan recently approved by Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, which includes a generous financing deal for the Basque region, and promised to open a dialogue and \u201crebuild the broken bridges\u201d with the Catalan separatist politicians with whom Mr. Rajoy has been at loggerheads for years.Mr. Rajoy insisted Thursday morning that he had no intention of allowing Mr. S\u00e1nchez to run Spain.\u201cHow do you plan to govern?\u201d Mr. Rajoy asked Mr. S\u00e1nchez. \u201cThere\u2019s no point coming here to say only that Rajoy is the biggest of all evils.\u201dBut as it became clearer that Mr. S\u00e1nchez could sway lawmakers from smaller parties, Mr. Rajoy did not attend the afternoon session of Parliament.Two years ago, Spain spent 10 months in political limbo after two inconclusive elections, a period that ended with Mr. Rajoy at the helm of a vulnerable minority government.New elections could mean a replay and extend the uncertainty that has destabilized markets and the politics of southern Europe, starting with Italy.What the two countries share are political systems that have been badly fractured by the emergence of upstart parties, by the lingering effects of the financial crisis and by waning faith in the traditional parties that have dominated politics for decades.The only bright spot for Europe, analysts say, is that none of the main parties in Spain are challenging the European single currency, as is happening in Italy.\u201cUnlike the situation in Italy, the crisis of the Rajoy government and the vote of no confidence are not about the European Union or the euro,\u201d said Bonnie N. Field, a professor of global studies at Bentley University in Massachusetts. \u201cIn this way, Spain is less of a threat to the European project than Italy.\u201dThe reason for that has everything to do with the divergent paths the two countries took to try to get out of the euro and debt crisis from which much of Europe is only now emerging.Italy blinked again and again at painful economic and political reforms, and its economy remains a laggard, saddled with high public debt and low growth. Mr. Rajoy on the other hand pushed through contentious austerity measures that have widened income inequality and made jobs more precarious, but have restored economic growth.Spaniards surpassed Italians as a richer people in term of gross domestic product per capita this year for the first time in the countries\u2019 shared history in the European Union.Until Thursday, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s main survival hope came from the divisions among opposition parties. His current government depends on support from a smaller, pro-business party, Ciudadanos, which was founded in Catalonia and has seen its stock rise for its strong opposition to the region\u2019s independence drive.Ciudadanos wanted to force Mr. Rajoy to either call a snap election or get Parliament to approve an interim administration of technocrats \u2014 rather than a Socialist government \u2014 before an election later this year.As it became clear that the Socialists could circumvent Ciudadanos and rely instead on the support of Catalan and Basque nationalist politicians, Albert Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, warned that the Socialists could allow separatists to destroy Spain\u2019s unity.\u201cToday is a terrible day for Spain,\u201d Mr. Rivera said.A no-confidence vote needs approval not only by an absolute majority of lawmakers, but also agreement on a substitute prime minister.No party has anything close to a parliamentary majority, and recent polls suggest only that Ciudadanos has an incentive to hold an election now.A snap election would come at a fragile time for the two left-wing parties of Spain, the Socialists and Podemos, which failed to form an alternative coalition government to replace Mr. Rajoy in 2016 and then suffered from internal feuding.Last week\u2019s verdicts in the corruption case made Mr. Rajoy\u2019s party the first Spanish political force to be convicted of operating a slush fund and ordered to pay a fine, 245,000 euros, or about $285,000.The party\u2019s former treasurer, Luis B\u00e1rcenas, was sentenced to 33 years in prison and fined \u20ac44 million, alongside 28 other businessmen and politicians who received over 300 years in combined prison sentences for benefiting from a kickbacks-for-contracts scheme.Mr. Rajoy and others from his party have acknowledged the damage since then, but they have also insisted that it did not imply that fraud was committed by Spain\u2019s current administration or the party as a whole.But Aitor Esteban, a Basque nationalist lawmaker, insisted on Thursday that the court ruling marked a \u201cbefore and after\u201d for Mr. Rajoy and his party.He said that his own party was \u201cnot looking to destabilize Spain\u201d but wanted to put an end to \u201cmonths of political tsunamis,\u201d caused by repeated corruption scandals and the \u201cincapacity to reach agreements\u201d of the bigger national parties, led by Mr. Rajoy\u2019s conservatives.Mr. Esteban congratulated Mr. S\u00e1nchez on making \u201ca good move,\u201d but also warned him to stay true to his pledge to resolve the crisis in Catalonia.\u201cI trust that the dialogue that you have promised will be real,\u201d Mr. Esteban told Mr. S\u00e1nchez.\u201cYou will face hostilities from day one,\u201d Mr. Esteban added. \u201cYour government will be very complicated, weak and difficult.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan Seeks Its Economic Mojo in the Stuff That Makes the Stuff", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 There is absolutely nothing sexy about bellows. But they just might be the future of Japan.\u201cThe technology used in making these products is very difficult,\u201d said Norihiro Irie, Irie Koken\u2019s president. \u201cNot many companies are able to do it.\u201dJapan is moving toward \u201can entirely different strategy, where other countries cannot compete,\u201d said Ryoji Musha, president of the economic analysis outfit Musha Research in Tokyo. \u201cGoing forward, Japan will show a remarkable emergence as one of the locomotives of the global economy.\u201dMany of Japan\u2019s biggest players have to look beyond the country\u2019s borders in their quest for growth. The declining population helped drive Takeda Pharmaceutical\u2019s deal on Tuesday for Shire \u2014 the largest overseas acquisition ever by a Japanese company.\u201cThe undertow pulling at the dynamics of growth is the main limit to what Japan can do on a sustained basis,\u201d said Kenneth Courtis, chairman of the finance firm Starfort Investment Holdings. Though Japan has some competitive companies that will continue to excel, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that changes the overall equation.\u201dJapan also had several false starts over the past quarter-century, only to stumble back into the doldrums. If this time is different, one big reason will be companies like Irie Koken.Mr. Irie said business had not been this good since he took over as the company\u2019s president 19 years ago. Sales more than doubled in its last fiscal year.\u201cWe can\u2019t catch up with all our orders,\u201d Mr. Irie said.With I.T. becoming more critical to just about every sector and factories looking to improve efficiency, greater demand is expected for robots, chips and other high-tech products \u2014 and the made-in-Japan parts and machines needed to manufacture them.\u201cEven if there is a recession, I don\u2019t see it changing speed right now,\u201d said Rosen Diankov, chief technology officer at the robotics company Mujin Inc.Mr. Diankov, an American robotics specialist, founded Mujin in 2011 with Issei Takino of Japan, a former cutting-tool sales manager, to produce devices that control industrial robots. Its headquarters in a refurbished warehouse in east Tokyo have the hipster vibe of a garage start-up, with offices and workshops cluttered with equipment.Such entrepreneurial companies are all too rare in Japan, where venture capital and risk-taking are scarce compared with the United States or China. But Mujin\u2019s founders believe that Japan is leading the way in automation, and they wanted to be part of the action.\u201cWe could have opened our company in Silicon Valley,\u201d said Mr. Takino, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOne of the good things about being in Japan is that it is very easy to find a customer.\u201dMujin\u2019s technology can appear retro at first glance. One hand-held remote looks as if it belongs with a 1990s video game console. But Mujin says its advanced components make robots more efficient and easier to use, and are hard for competitors to recreate.The sheer complexity of these Japanese specialties may help the economy maintain a competitive edge. Unlike the TVs, CD players and other consumer electronics that drove Japan\u2019s past boom, Mujin\u2019s controllers and Irie Koken\u2019s bellows are much harder for manufacturers in China and elsewhere to replicate. When the Beijing-based online retailer JD.com wanted to automate an unmanned warehouse in China, it turned to Mujin.Some of Japan\u2019s big corporations are heading in the same direction. The electronics giant Panasonic was once synonymous with televisions and videorecorders. But over the past six years, it has drastically downsized its consumer businesses \u2014 it no longer sells televisions in the United States \u2014 and shifted into industrial electronics, including the batteries for Tesla roadsters and sensors and cameras for automobiles.\u201cIt is very important to position ourselves wisely,\u201d said Yasuyuki Higuchi, chief executive of Panasonic\u2019s connected solutions unit. \u201cOtherwise, we cannot be competitive.\u201dHowever, even the most competitive sectors aren\u2019t immune from Japan\u2019s problems. Severe labor shortages are already plaguing businesses, said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at the research firm Capital Economics, who added that the country was not welcoming nearly enough foreigners to offset the impact.\u201cThe demographic headwinds will continue to resist,\u201d said Mr. Thieliant, who estimates that Japan\u2019s current spate of growth has already ended. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get more immigrants in, you eventually hit a wall.\u201dMr. Irie has struggled to find the workers he needs to fill the deluge of new orders. His customers now have to wait twice as long as usual for their bellows \u2014 up to five months. \u201cThe economy is very good, so good workers are being taken by other companies,\u201d he complained.The shortage has prodded management to invent new ways to attract talent. Mujin employs a chef to cook lunch for the staff every day. Mr. Irie in recent years has taken all of his employees on a Hawaii vacation and renovated the company\u2019s offices.\u201cThe older employees asked, \u2018Why do you have to spend money to make things stylish?\u2019\u201d Mr. Irie said. \u201cThe image of manufacturing may not be very nice. We want to change it.\u201dHe remains optimistic, too. He plans to expand the capacity of his factory in Japan over the next few years, possibly making the company\u2019s largest investment ever.\u201cWe are riding a wave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can be on this wave because we have something special.\u201dChie Kobayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banks Adopt Military-Style Tactics to Fight Cybercrime", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byO\u2019FALLON, Mo. \u2014 In a windowless bunker here, a wall of monitors tracked incoming attacks \u2014 267,322 in the last 24 hours, according to one hovering dial, or about three every second \u2014 as a dozen analysts stared at screens filled with snippets of computer code.Pacing around, overseeing the stream of warnings, was a former Delta Force soldier who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan before shifting to a new enemy: cyberthieves.\u201cThis is not that different from terrorists and drug cartels,\u201d Matt Nyman, the command center\u2019s creator, said as he surveyed his squadron of Mastercard employees. \u201cFundamentally, threat networks operate in similar ways.\u201dThen banks grabbed the playbook. At least a dozen of them, from giants like Citigroup and Wells Fargo to regional players such as Bank of the West, have opened fusion centers in recent years, and more are in the works. Fifth Third Bank is building one in its Cincinnati headquarters, and Visa, which created its first two years ago in Virginia, is developing two more, in Britain and Singapore. Having their own intelligence hives, the banks hope, will help them better detect patterns in all the data they amass.The centers also have a symbolic purpose. Having a literal war room reinforces the new reality. Fending off thieves has always been a priority \u2014 it\u2019s why banks build vaults \u2014 but the arms race has escalated rapidly.Cybersecurity has, for many financial company chiefs, become their biggest fear, eclipsing issues like regulation and the economy.Alfred F. Kelly Jr., Visa\u2019s chief executive, is \u201ccompletely paranoid\u201d about the subject, he told investors at a conference in March. Bank of America\u2019s Brian T. Moynihan said his cybersecurity team is \u201cthe only place in the company that doesn\u2019t have a budget constraint.\u201d (The bank\u2019s chief operations and technology officer said it is spending about $600 million this year.)In the latest exercise last November, 900 participants from 50 banks, regulators and law enforcement agencies role-played their response to an industrywide infestation of malicious malware that first corrupted, and then entirely blocked, all outgoing payments from the banks. Throughout the two-day test, the organizers lobbed in new threats every few hours, like denial-of-service attacks that knocked the banks\u2019 websites offline.The first Quantum Dawn, back in 2011, was a lower-key gathering. Participants huddled in a conference room to talk through a mock attack that shut down stock trading. Now, it\u2019s a live-fire drill. Each bank spends months in advance re-creating its internal technology on an isolated test network, a so-called cyber range, so that its employees can fight with their actual tools and software. The company that runs their virtual battlefield, SimSpace, is a Defense Department contractor.Sometimes, the tests expose important gaps.If something similar happened at a bank, especially a smaller one, regulators asked, would it be able to recover? Those in the room for the drill came away uneasy.\u201cThere was a recognition that we needed to add an additional layer of resilience,\u201d said John Carlson, the chief of staff for the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the industry\u2019s main cybersecurity coordination group.The largest banks run dozens of their own, internal attack simulations each year, to smoke out their vulnerabilities and keep their first responders sharp.\u201cIt\u2019s the idea of muscle memory,\u201d said Thomas J. Harrington, Citigroup\u2019s chief information security officer, who spent 28 years with the F.B.I.Growing interest among its corporate customers in cybersecurity war games inspired IBM to build a digital range in Cambridge, Mass., where it stages data breaches for customers and prospects to practice on.One recent morning, a fictional bank called Bane & Ox was under attack on IBM\u2019s range, and two dozen real-life executives from a variety of financial companies gathered to defend it. In the training scenario, an unidentified attacker had dumped six million customer records on Pastebin, a site often used by hackers to publish stolen data caches.As the hours ticked by, the assault grew worse. The lost data included financial records and personally identifying details. One of the customers was Colin Powell, the former secretary of state. Phones in the room kept ringing with calls from reporters, irate executives and, eventually, regulators, wanting details about what had occurred.When the group figured out what computer system had been used in the leak, a heated argument broke out: Should they cut off its network access immediately? Or set up surveillance and monitor any further transmissions?At the urging of a Navy veteran who runs the cyberattack response group at a large New York bank, the group left the system connected.\u201cThose are the decisions you don\u2019t want to be making for the first time during a real attack,\u201d said Bob Stasio, IBM\u2019s cyber range operations manager and a former operations chief for the National Security Agency\u2019s cyber center. One financial company\u2019s executive team did such a poor job of talking to its technical team during a past IBM training drill, Mr. Stasio said, that he went home and canceled his credit card with them.Like many cybersecurity bunkers, IBM\u2019s foxhole has deliberately theatrical touches. Whiteboards and giant monitors fill nearly every wall, with graphics that can be manipulated by touch.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a fusion center unless you have really cool TVs,\u201d quipped Lawrence Zelvin, a former Homeland Security official who is now Citigroup\u2019s global cybersecurity head, at a recent cybercrime conference. \u201cIt\u2019s even better if they do something when you touch them. It doesn\u2019t matter what they do. Just something.\u201dJason Witty, the chief information security officer at U.S. Bank, admits that the blinking map he breaks out for customer briefings is mostly for show. But it serves a serious purpose, he said: making the command center\u2019s high-stakes work more tangible.\u201cIf you show customers the scripts you\u2019re actually running, it\u2019s just digits on a screen,\u201d Mr. Witty said. A big, colorful map is easier to grasp.Hackers stole personal information, including Social Security numbers, of more than 146 million people. The attack cost the company\u2019s chief executive and four other top managers their jobs. Who stole the data, and what they did with it, is still not publicly known. The credit bureau has spent $243 million so far cleaning up the mess.It is Mr. Nyman\u2019s job to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen at Mastercard. Walking around the company\u2019s fusion center, he describes the team\u2019s work using military slang. Its focus is \u201cleft of boom,\u201d he said \u2014 referring to the moments before a bomb explodes. By detecting vulnerabilities and attempted hacks, the analysts aim to head off an Equifax-like explosion.But the attacks keep coming. As he spoke, the dial displayed over his shoulder registered another few assaults on Mastercard\u2019s systems. The total so far this year exceeds 20 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Jail Sentences and Corporate Flameouts, China Is Tackling Its Debt", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFaced with the looming consequences of a decade-long borrowing binge, the Chinese government is intensifying its efforts stamp out risky lending and speculative froth from the world\u2019s second-largest economy. To do it, Beijing is putting the brakes on shadowy forms of underground lending and making public spectacles of the worst offenders, even as it takes steps to ensure that small investors and the broader economy are not shaken.But other signs are emerging, including loan defaults from a growing number of companies and rising interest rates for many borrowers.\u201cLike any deleveraging campaign, it is not painless,\u201d said Christopher Lee, a China credit specialist at S&P Global, said. \u201cThere will be losers.\u201d\u201cThe message there is: You guys need to clean up your own mess and sell whatever you can to fix it,\u201d Mr. Lee said.China has also clamped down on its unruly shadow banking sector, a murky area where non-bank lenders connect borrowers with those willing to lend in exchange for big returns \u2014 in many cases, small investors are unaware of potential risks. As a result of new government rules, that money is either drying up or also getting more expensive. For example, the cost of raising money through trust loans \u2014 a popular form of shadow banking in China \u2014 has risen sharply, from 7 percent to as much as 10 percent over the last 12 months, according to Mr. Lee.The impact is beginning to show.Over the last four days alone, three private Chinese companies have defaulted on debt, telling their bondholders that they cannot make repayments, according to data compiled by S&P Global. So far this year, 13 companies have defaulted on bonds, with the pace quickening in recent weeks. Defaults were rare or nonexistent in earlier years, in part because local authorities pressured lenders to forgive or extend missed payment dates to preserve jobs and keep the economy stable.\u201cThe intensified regulatory control on shadow banking activities have largely shut down this alternative financing channel,\u201d said Ivan Chung, associate managing director of Greater China credit research at the ratings agency Moody\u2019s. \u201cWeak issuers are more vulnerable to default pressure,\u201d he added.Bankruptcies have shot up, too, with new cases growing by more than half in 2017 compared with the previous year, according to a study by Orient Capital Research. In its report, the research firm said it expected to see a significant increase in defaults by Chinese companies again this year.Overall borrowing has become more expensive for many companies. Bond rates are rising, too, making it more costly for companies to tap that source of money.The Chinese government is playing a careful game. Even as it allows more defaults, last month it poured more money into the financial system to contain the potential damage.It is also sparing larger companies like Anbang. With about 35 million policyholders, Anbang could shake China\u2019s financial system if it collapsed.\u201cWith smaller companies, they are not necessarily going to step in,\u201d said Fraser Howie, a former banker in Asia and a co-writer of three books on the Chinese financial system. He added, \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is that the government is allowing some of them to fail. There are lots of private companies that are defaulting on a daily basis.\u201dAnbang said on Thursday that it had sufficient cash to meet its commitments to customers. Mr. Wu, it reiterated, is no longer its chairman. Mr. Wu\u2019s lawyer, Zhai Jian, declined to comment.The court found that Mr. Wu had illegally sold insurance products to bolster the company\u2019s financial situation. According to the prosecutors, Mr. Wu instructed employees to falsify financial statements and marketing information in an attempt to skirt regulations and raise money from the public.The sentence was a strong one given the charges, said Yan Yiming, a criminal lawyer in Shanghai. The court on Thursday also said that it had seized Mr. Wu\u2019s bank accounts, real estate and equity.Mr. Wu had initially struck a defiant tone, contesting the charges in March during his only appearance in the court. But facing a potential life sentence, Mr. Wu had pleaded guilty to the charges and asked the court to consider a lighter sentence.\u201cI repent deeply,\u201d Mr. Wu said in March in a televised statement from the court. \u201cI know and regret my crimes.\u201dCao Li contributed to reporting from Hong KongAdvertisement"}

Monique Heart, her dress held up by packing tape, again blamed her failure to deliver a challenge-winning look on her lack of funds. This does cast sunshine on an important deliberation in the drag world \u2014 with new money pouring in to select drag super PACs, should there be reform? Mon\u00e9t X Change raised the point that she, too, is not wealthy, yet she manages to turn out a look. But, does she? She was almost eliminated twice, owing to her \u201ccheap-looking\u201d pieces. The case remains open, but it is rather clear that when it comes to the depth of their pockets, these citizens are not united.The next issue was education. Fortunately, despite our nation\u2019s proposed budget slashes, the library remains open, and the annual Reading Is Fundamental mini-challenge went on. The dark horse candidate Kameron Michaels continued her campaign of surprise with delightful reads of Eureka and Mon\u00e9t. (I would say \u201cdon\u2019t sleep on Kameron,\u201d but that is all anyone with a pulse wants to do.) Several queens ribbed The Vixen, and she reacted about as good-naturedly as a similarly humorless woman reacted to similarly humorous reads at a televised dinner held within the last seven days.Mon\u00e9t packed it up with a prime Amazon joke at Asia O\u2019Hara\u2019s expense. Her delivery is always guaranteed to be direct and lightning-quick. Keep tracking her. (Can you tell that I am shipping her hard? O.K., O.K., I\u2019ll stop.)Eureka order-fired a joke about The Vixen\u2019s kitchen (the heat of which the latter visibly could not take), and defunded the library, winning a gift certificate to L.A. Eyeworks. (Perhaps she will regift it to The Vixen, whose constant eye-rolling has surely caused vision loss.)The caucus chairman Ru then announced that \u201cChristmas for drag queens,\u201d the also-annual Snatch Game challenge, had finally come with a bound. The Mary gentlemen excitedly jingled their bells, and hung their stockings without Blair.Today, Satan, the first lady of literacy and Snatch Game legend Bianca del Rio arrived in a Holly Goheavily look, and escorted the queens toward serving bawdry, hep burns. She wisely advised Eureka against portraying Divine, steering her instead toward playing the poster child for our nation\u2019s education and food-desert crises, Honey Boo Boo.Kameron announced with her singular quiet confidence that she would play the late, great wrestler Chyna, and, in what would appear to be a body-slam, Monique was encouraged to take on Congress-Auntie Maxine Waters.Aquaria announced that she would embrace her sentence-hobbling \u201cflaws\u201d and use them to her advantage by playing the first lady Melania Trump. Against advisement, Asia and The Vixen chose to impersonate the publicly closed-mouthed moving images Beyonc\u00e9 and Blue Ivy Carter, respectively. Asia called out to the noted student of the \u201cNo, bye!\u201d school of improv The Vixen: \u201cIf I\u2019m stuck, I know there\u2019s someone on the panel that I can have banter with \u2026 I\u2019ll wait to play off of you until you like, really establish your character.\u201d Every atom of oxygen left the room, and every other queen quietly, knowingly secured their masks.There was a war on this drag queen Christmas, and it was a blood bath. Eureka absolutely murdered as Honey Boo Boo, expertly heightening with a bump-set-spike of doodled answers and idiotic childlike glee. Mon\u00e9t, clad in a five-dollar Fulton Street Mall caftan and two-dollar Party City wig, proved that you don\u2019t have to spend money to make Mon\u00e9t, and we\u2019ll never forget how her Maya Angelou made us feel. Kameron and Cracker, as ever, made solid showings, and Aquaria, in an upset, held a Tiffany box and nailed Melania Trump.Back in the workroom, the conversation turned, as it does in these times, to politics. Mon\u00e9t said, \u201cI think it\u2019s important to do political numbers \u2014 as drag queens I feel like that\u2019s our call to duty.\u201d Monique confessed that while she has considered doing more political work, \u201cI live in a former slave state \u2026 Tensions were really high in Kansas City, and I didn\u2019t want to get shot.\u201dThe Mermaid Fantasy runway challenge, a homage to the Divine Miss M, showed us how well these men have been taught to fish. Aquaria served a Rex Tillerson fantasy as an oil-spilled, tattered-tailed mermaid. Mon\u00e9t\u2019s \u201cwarrior mermaid\u201d look earned the quip \u201cTuna Turner\u201d from Ru, and I cannot write anything funnier than that, and therefore will not try.Asia\u2019s grotesque lionfish mask earned an \u201cick\u201d from all of the judges save Kate Upton, who \u201ckind of loved it.\u201d (Kate, if you want to really love a twisted-faced fish, call me. I\u2019m single.) And The Vixen\u2019s unturned tuna had rather wide-set cans, prompting Kate to noodle, \u201cno one wants the breasts in the armpit.\u201d (Sigh, don\u2019t call me, Kate. We\u2019ll never work.)The candidates were then asked that most unanswerable debate question \u2014 \u201cWho deserves to go home tonight, and why?\u201d Every queen on the stage elected to send The Vixen home, with the exception of her arch-nemesis Eureka. She named Asia, who she believes is her fiercest competition, which I do not also believe. The Vixen, naturally, voted Eureka off the island, citing her \u201cunprofessionalism,\u201d her habit of claiming to be attacked and her \u201cThis is who I am. Deal with it\u201d attitude. (And we all thought irony died on 9/11.)In an attempt to Define The Relationship, Eureka countered that she has reached out to Vixen many times with love, and has been rebuffed at every turn. This provoked a torrent of defense, and even more eye rolls. I do hope Ru keeps a medic on hand.Facts are facts: There simply is no excuse, financial or otherwise, for a drag queen to not know the words to a lip sync. Sadly, neither her glitter nor her Jesus saved her, and Monique was buried at sea.Unfathomably, one of the funniest queens to ever appear on the show did not survive the Snatch Game, and the unfunniest queen to ever appear on the show did. Against all predictions, an unbridled rage-channel who can\u2019t take a joke continues to advance. Will knowing the right words be enough to stop her? Will those words be \u201cMiss Vanjie\u201d?See you next week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Pullout From Iran Nuclear Deal May Unsettle Oil Markets", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal has so far had no more than a muted effect on oil and gasoline prices. But that could easily change.The full impact on global oil markets may not be seen for weeks or months. It will depend on how tightly the administration enforces new sanctions on Iran, and whether the entire deal collapses or can somehow be salvaged. That may well depend on the responses of a diverse cast of geopolitical actors from Moscow to Beijing to New Delhi since the United States imports no oil directly from Iran.A cascade of unpredictable events may follow the administration\u2019s action, one that could ultimately lead to compromise. If not, there could be even greater instability across the Middle East and possibly an oil-price spike.The biggest wild card is how Iran will respond.For additional leverage, Iran could unleash allied militias based in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen against Israel and Saudi Arabia. A blockade or mining of the Strait of Hormuz, a choke point for global oil trade on the Persian Gulf, would be the ultimate retaliation that could send global oil prices soaring if tensions in the region rise.\u201cOil could go up $10 a barrel, but it\u2019s all unpredictable,\u201d said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, a Houston-based oil service company that operates in Egypt and Iraq. \u201cThe Iranians could do anything and go berserk, or they could have cool heads and work with the Europeans and the Russians.\u201dOil prices rose more than 3 percent on Wednesday, pushing West Texas intermediate crude, the United States benchmark, above $71 a barrel. They had already risen by more than 14 percent since the beginning of the year, in part because traders anticipated the Trump administration would withdraw from the deal.What happens in Iran, a leading producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is critical to global energy markets.Iran currently contributes roughly 3.8 million of the 98 million barrels of oil produced daily worldwide. Most energy experts say that a revival of American sanctions on banks and other companies that do business with Iran could reduce Iranian production and exports by at least 10 to 15 percent, and that drop could take six months or more to be felt.The restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program under the deal could survive.That would be far less than the decline engineered by multinational sanctions from 2012 to 2015, and less than the decline in Venezuelan production in recent years.Roughly 40 percent of Iranian oil exports go to China and India, two countries thirsty for more energy that are unlikely to follow Mr. Trump\u2019s lead on this issue. The two countries could even increase their imports, absorbing as much as 150,000 more barrels a day, according to a recent report by Barclays.Europe is another major importer of Iranian oil, and France, Germany and Britain strongly urged Mr. Trump to reconsider his decision.Some European refiners might slash their Iranian imports, especially those with large interests in the United States. European banks might refuse to finance trade with Iran, which could also reduce oil exports.After the nuclear deal was signed in 2015, the United States waived a law that imposed sanctions on foreign banks of countries that do not reduce Iranian oil imports. That waiver will expire on Saturday, although how far Washington will push to enforce the sanctions remains to be seen.European governments are not expected to reimpose some of their strongest sanctions, like barring insurance on Iranian oil shipments, which essentially blacklisted the transportation of Iranian oil.Those sanctions were some of the most effective in reducing Iranian oil exports from 2.5 million barrels a day in 2011 to one million barrels a day in January 2013. Iranian exports have now recovered to 2011 levels.\u201cCompliance with unilateral U.S. sanctions would be much more difficult to enforce than the multilateral measures implemented in 2012,\u201d said Paul Sheldon, an S&P Platts Global Analytics associate director.Iran had hoped that the nuclear deal would increase foreign investment, especially in its aging oil fields, but the impact has been limited so far. European oil executives say American withdrawal from the deal will slow investment further. That in turn will limit global supplies.\u201cThere are enormous resources in Iran,\u201d said Eldar Saetre, chief executive of Statoil, the Norwegian oil giant. \u201cThe global oil and gas demand is growing every year and that demand has to be supplied from somewhere.\u2019\u2019Results of the administration\u2019s move are hard to predict, and some may hurt American interests. Higher oil prices could help Iran compensate for its loss of export volumes. If European imports of Iranian oil drop, that could help Russia earn more cash from exports.Higher energy prices could hurt summer drivers and depress American tourism or even slow the global economy.The administration seems sanguine about the outlook. \u201cWe\u2019ve had various conversations with various parties about different parties that would be willing to increase oil supply to offset this,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters on Tuesday in Washington. \u201cMy expectation is not that oil prices go higher, to a certain extent some of this was already in the market on oil prices.\u201dSaudi Arabia has spare production capacity and may well want to take markets away from Iran, especially in Asia. But the country has worked hard to limit supplies to drive prices up, in part to make the proposed initial public offering of Saudi Aramco more attractive.Predicting where oil prices may go is often likened to a fool\u2019s game.In a note published on Tuesday, Steve Wood, Moody\u2019s managing director for oil and gas, even predicted that oil prices would eventually decline from current levels.\u201cNotwithstanding heightened geopolitical risks,\u201d Mr. Wood said, \u201cwe expect oil prices will likely stay in the $45-to-$65 per barrel range over the medium term as non-OPEC production grows.\u201dGoldman Sachs recently estimated that a six-month loss of 250,000 Iranian barrels a day could raise oil prices by $3.50 a barrel over its summer forecast of $82.50 for Brent crude, the international benchmark. (Its price on Wednesday was slightly above $77.)That is a relatively small increase, but Iran is only one of several flash points where political tensions may reduce crude supplies.Oil production is collapsing in Venezuela, battles between warlords puts output at risk in Libya, while disruptions during elections in Nigeria later this year could interrupt petroleum flows. Altogether, a major disruption and spike in prices is possible even if American shale drillers push up their production and Western countries release significant amounts of oil from their strategic reserves.A rising oil price naturally follows rising tensions in the region.\u201cIf Iran threatens to resume nuclear testing and the U.S. is concerned,\u201d said Gerald Bailey, president of Petroteq Energy, a Canadian company, with long experience in the Middle East oil patch, \u201cany type of confrontation will drive the prices up, even more especially if words or confrontation turn to action.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eric Schneiderman\u2019s Legacy in Financial Cases May Survive His Downfall", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe job of New York attorney general over the past two decades has proved to be a launching pad for aspiring politicians who used their legal authority to go after Wall Street hucksters, corrupt politicians and real estate scofflaws.It was a strategy laid out by former Gov. Eliot Spitzer and by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who had both held the role. And Eric T. Schneiderman showed no reservation in following a similar playbook when he went after the big banks for mortgage abuses and the ride-hailing company Uber for its use of customer data.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s confrontations with President Trump, mainly through a series of lawsuits to counter the administration\u2019s attempts to roll back environmental and financial regulation, bolstered his national profile and played especially well in progressive political circles.Before his sudden downfall, there was no denying that Mr. Schneiderman, 63, had a knack for getting results and getting attention during his more than seven years as attorney general. A former state senator, he brought a politician\u2019s approach to the job, announcing investigations both large and small and issuing news releases galore.The eclectic nature of Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s cases is indicative of the broad mandate of the New York attorney general. But critics say it also suggests a scattershot approach that tried to do too much and spread him thin.Consider the 2013 case against a group of payday lenders, firms that make high-interest small-dollar loans. In announcing the lawsuit, Mr. Schneiderman said the firms had charged interest rates as high as 355 percent to thousands of state residents, and he vowed to \u201cstop companies that seek to prey upon consumers.\u201d He noted the finance charges on loans to nearly 18,000 New Yorkers had exceeded more than $185 million.\u201cThe office issued news releases relating to investigations at a dizzying rate, with less emphasis on follow-through or actual results,\u201d said Caroline Polisi, a white-collar defense lawyer who has appeared as a legal commentator on cable news shows. But Ms. Polisi added that there had been considerable substance to a number of Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s investigations as well as some major successes.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s big accomplishment in going after Wall Street were the billions of dollars in penalties that he helped secure from big banks that had sold flawed mortgage-backed bonds during the run-up to the financial crisis. He ensured that some of that money went to help communities across the state that were overrun by abandoned houses and foreclosures \u2014 often referred to as \u201czombie homes.\u201dHis legal team was one of the first in the nation to target banks for sponsoring nontransparent trading platforms called \u201cdark pools,\u201d which allowed high-speed trading firms to take advantage of investors. In 2016, Mr. Schneiderman and the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a $154 million settlement with Barclays and Credit Suisse to resolve allegations that the banks had permitted traders to misuse their dark pool platforms.Three years ago, he opened an investigation with the Massachusetts attorney general into whether Exxon Mobil deliberately misled the public and investors about the impact of climate change.In 2015, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office opened an investigation into the mortgage practices of Caliber Home Loans, a fast-growing lender, but has said nothing about the inquiry since then.A spokeswoman said that the office generally avoided providing details about the number of open investigations. But Barbara Underwood, who was named New York\u2019s acting attorney general on Tuesday, said in a statement that the office\u2019s \u201cwork continues without interruption.\u201dMr. Schneiderman, over the past year, has positioned himself at the vanguard of legal challenges by state attorneys general to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to roll back regulation \u2014 especially environmental rules. Last month, he and more than a dozen states sued the E.P.A. for failing to properly control methane pollution, a greenhouse gas.He became an early thorn in the side of Mr. Trump by filing a lawsuit against Trump University in 2013, accusing the school of taking advantage of thousands of customers and running a \u201cbait and switch\u201d educational program. But some critics said the $25 million settlement that Mr. Schneiderman secured in 2016 was too low.Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense lawyer in New York, said Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s \u201cdark-side demons shouldn\u2019t obliterate his many admirable positions and accomplishments.\u201dThere was a time when the position of New York attorney general was a rather sleepy one and did not garner the kind of national media attention it now often does.For decades, the office was best known for bringing consumer protection cases and had remarkable little turnover. Louis J. Lefkowitz, a Republican, held the post for 22 years, through 1978. His successor, Robert Abrams, a Democrat, was attorney general for 15 years.Mr. Spitzer used the post to launch his successful campaign for governor, an office he was forced to quit over the fallout from a federal investigation into secretive payments he allegedly made to several prostitutes.Mr. Cuomo also used the attorney general\u2019s office to catapult him into the governor\u2019s mansion. Like Mr. Schneiderman, he drew criticism from some quarters for over-publicizing his office\u2019s actions to get attention.But with Mr. Schneiderman now out of the picture, the job\u2019s high profile is expected to entice a wide array of state politicians to seek to replace him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Metaphors, Memes, Games and Themes: Using Times Visual Resources to Support Student Book Clubs and Independent Reading", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiteracy SkillsThese teaching strategies provide students with more choices in book genres and titles than have traditionally been offered in English class and, of course, promote a love of reading.But, as with any differentiated-instruction technique, these models do not come without their challenges. Teachers must find ways to provide just the right amount of structure to make sure that students meet the objectives of the course curriculum while also giving them the time and space they need to read with greater stamina and explore the social aspects of reading.One way I\u2019ve learned to support independent reading and book clubs in my classroom is by using visual resources from The New York Times and The Learning Network. From matching games to making memes, these resources provide the structure needed to propel students to new understandings while respecting their independence as readers.Are there Times pictures, articles or other methods that you especially like to use with independent or book club reading in your classroom? Please share your ideas in the comments._________You can use images to create engaging multiple-choice questions that promote deep thinking and prompt discussion and writing. Create your own matching game by writing questions and choosing, as answers, several images that can work for any book your students are reading. Then, invite students to select the image that best represents their book club or independent reading book.At times, you may even be able to write a prompt using a single image. For instance, with this image you could ask: Which one of these figures best represents the protagonist in your book and why?You might find that these image-driven prompts can spark discussions between book groups, as well \u2014 helping students find threads that connect their book choices to the choices of others, and providing them with plenty of ideas to add to their \u201cRead Next\u201d lists._________Books frequently explore issues, conflicts, life lessons and relationships, and The Times is chock-full of images that do the same thing.You might have your students alter images from The Times to turn them into memes, inspirational posters and comics that relate to their books. This allows students to apply their learning and tap into their creativity without consuming too much time.Here are few activities they might try:_________Your students might use these images to analyze their texts before speaking at a book club meeting or journaling about an independent reading book. You might even challenge them to create their own sketches, maps, graphs and charts of key moments to help them visualize what\u2019s happening in their novels.For example, students can evaluate a character\u2019s decisions using this simple organizer:Make a prediction by mapping past events:Show a character\u2019s development:Or, illustrate an internal conflict:_________One of the challenges of integrating more choice into the classroom is figuring out how to provide whole-class instruction in foundational reading skills while allowing students the space and time they need to explore their own texts.Practicing \u201creading\u201d pictures can act as a shortcut to teaching and helping students apply strategies necessary for the close readings of texts \u2014 like noticing details, finding evidence, discovering patterns and making meaning from those patterns.Let your students study the image and ask them:To take it a step further, you might next share the image split into quadrants and assign students a specific quadrant to examine.Ask them:Then, invite students to ask themselves these same questions about a particular scene or chapter in their book. What patterns emerge? What conclusions can they draw about a character, plot point or conflict? Students might discuss the meaning in those patterns in a book club meeting._________Metaphorical thinking can be a powerful tool to interpret a text through a new lens, and The Times provides a plethora of images that \u2014 without captions included \u2014 invite divergent thinking as students interpret and apply them to their reading.Here are a few possible prompts that can help students think through relationships and comparisons in their books:For example, Julianna, a ninth-grade student who was reading \u201cOne of Us Is Lying\u201d by Karen M. McManus, interpreted this image this way:A girl who is really smart is in a relationship with a boy who is a drug dealer and makes bad choices in general. He perceives himself as far lower than she is and this picture shows their dynamic in the book, like a physical representation of how they relate to each other.When looking at this image, Harrison, a ninth grader, observed that in Jeff Zentner\u2019s \u201cThe Serpent King,\u201d Dill feels \u201ctrapped in being forced to follow his upbringing, to be a godly person, when he really feels abandoned by God.\u201dYou might ask your students how these images relate to the characters in their books. Who is marginalized? Which characters are extroverted or introverted, and how does this affect their decisions? What challenges do they face in their life among peers?_________Times articles and multimedia resources offer a great jumping off point for students to explore familiar literary themes and even conduct further research into how they manifest in the real world.For example, many books have something to say about humans\u2019 response to fear.Students could journal about a character or idea from their book that is represented by the picture below:Another way students can explore themes in their books is by doing what Times illustrators and digital artists do every day for articles across the site \u2014 render artistic representations of the essential ideas of a text._________Students might use these pictures to begin their own stories inspired by the genre, plot or conflict in the novel they are reading \u2014 or they could use them to explore a character in the book they are reading by imagining him or her in a new scenario.For example, they might write a short story about what the characters in their book would do if they found themselves in this situation:Or, they might write a story in which the protagonist uses one of these items to deal with a conflict:Or, they might write their own story that mirrors the plot or conflict of the book they are reading but is set, instead, in a mysterious world like this one:_________You might share this tweet from The Learning Network editor, Katherine Schulten:Ask students to consider: What do you notice in this image? What details best reflect your experience with the book you read? Which best symbolize how this book has contributed to your love of reading?This could be an informal journal entry or an exit slip.

{"Headline": "What Comes Next for Italy?", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Severgini is a contributing opinion writer.The League (formerly Northern League), a far-right party, and the Five Star Movement had picked an unknown legal scholar, Giuseppe Conte, as their prime minister and a euroskeptic economist, Paolo Savona, as finance minister. That was too much for Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, who rejected the proposed government on Sunday. The choice of Mr. Savona, he said, posed a risk \u201cfor Italian families and their savings.\u201dEven without Mr. Savona\u2019s anti-European Union stance, the government was built on unrealistic promises. The 58-page \u201ccontract\u201d that the Five Star Movement and the League had signed, after weeks of bickering, was crammed with programs worth over 100 billion euros \u2014 including an unlikely 20 percent flat tax and a guaranteed income for every citizen \u2014 that worried foreign investors. (Interestingly, the contract did not call for any sort of clash with Brussels; Mr. Savona might want to leave the euro, but the parties called for no such thing.)In other words, the proposed government was unlikely to succeed, but it probably wouldn\u2019t have been a disaster for the European Union, either.The coalition\u2019s leaders are now calling Mr. Mattarella\u2019s decision the end of democracy in Italy, though doing so was firmly within his constitutional powers. They have threatened to impeach him, but they\u2019ll never gather the majority of Parliament or the support of the public necessary to do so.[Receive arguments and opinions on the pressing social issues and hidden stories around the World Cup right in your inbox. Sign up for Offsides.]Mr. Cottarelli\u2019s task won\u2019t be easy. The League and the Five Star Movement jointly hold a majority in both houses of Parliament. But will they stay together? Probably not. Minutes after their tentative government sank, they were at each other\u2019s throat \u2014 where they have been for years, with gusto.Is Italian democracy about to collapse, then? Of course not. Right or wrong, the financial markets and the rest of Europe were convinced that the proposed government was a fundamental threat; now that it has been sidetracked, they will do what they can to prevent its return.But even left to their own devices, Italians are not going to rise up. We saw what happened in Catalonia, after the Spanish government blocked Catalan efforts at independence: violent clashes in the streets and a true constitutional crisis. Matteo Salvini, the League\u2019s rowdy leader, on Sunday night threatened to rally his voters and march toward Rome, evoking the Marcia su Roma, fascism\u2019s founding moment in 1922. But Italians \u2014 including League voters \u2014 are wiser than that, and we have rarely taken our discontent to the streets. And Mr. Salvini is no Benito Mussolini.Whenever the next elections are held, they will be under a new electoral law, a huge improvement over the current bizarre, ineffective mix of proportional and first-past-the-post representation. Combine that with voter moodiness, and the results, regardless of where the League and the Five Star Movement stand today, are anyone\u2019s guess.For sure, the summer is going to be hot, even by Italian climatic and political standards. The Five Star Movement \u2014 the winner on March 4, with 33 percent of the vote \u2014 feels betrayed by the League, which refused to replace Mr. Savona with one of its own, Giancarlo Giorgetti, a solution President Mattarella would have accepted.Their agendas are also quite different. The League is firmly on the right and is strong in the wealthy northern half of the country, where people fret about taxation and immigration. The Five Star Movement appeals more to the left, and it got most of its votes in the poorer Italian south, where voters are worried about unemployment and sloppy local government. The two parties are unlikely to stand together at the next election.It remains to be seen whether Silvio Berlusconi, the aging, weakened but unshakable leader of the center-right Forza Italia party, will hold his nose and seek a coalition with the League. They teamed up in the last election, where the parties won 14 percent and 17 percent, respectively, only to have Mr. Salvini drop Mr. Berlusconi to try to form a government with Five Star. Mr. Salvini could woo him back, though, with a renewed promise to give Forza Italia control of the telecommunications and justice agencies, which Mr. Berlusconi deems crucial for his business and personal interests.What about the Democratic Party, which was in power from 2013 to 2018 but was the big loser on March 4, when it polled only 19 percent? Much of its success will depend on its leader, Matteo Renzi, at 43 years old already a spent force in Italian politics. He has promised to resign to make room for the departing prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni; if he does, the party stands a chance of a comeback.It sounds na\u00efve to say it, but the real winners here are Italy\u2019s voters. Thanks to their coolheaded president, they have a chance to rethink their answers to a very important question. By voting for the League and Five Star, they set Italy on a collision course with the European Union. British voters made a similarly emotional decision to leave the union, and they don\u2019t get a second chance. Italy should consider itself lucky: A solid Constitution is better than a rushed referendum.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Italy\u2019s president in two references.

{"Headline": "To Lower Drug Costs at Home, Trump Wants Higher Prices Abroad", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, poised on Friday to unveil his strategy to lower prescription drug prices, has an idea that may not be so popular abroad: Bring down costs at home by forcing higher prices in foreign countries that use their national health systems to make drugs more affordable.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump rebuffed his European allies by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. Threatened tariffs on steel and aluminum have strained relations with other developed nations. And now the administration is suggesting policies that could hit the pocketbooks of some of America\u2019s strongest allies.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be ending global freeloading,\u201d Mr. Trump declared at a meeting with drug company executives in his first month in office. Foreign price controls, he said, reduce the resources that American drug companies have to finance research and develop new cures.The council said that profit margins on brand-name drugs in the United States were four times as high as those in the more regulated markets of major European countries and Japan. The United States, it said, needs to \u201caddress the root of the problem: foreign, developed nations, that can afford to pay for novel drugs, free-ride by setting drug prices at unfairly low levels, leaving American patients to pay for the innovation that foreign patients enjoy.\u201dMr. Trump plans to lay out his ideas on Friday. Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said in a speech on Wednesday that the administration would attack several problems, including high list prices set by drug manufacturers; rising out-of-pocket costs for consumers; and \u201cforeign governments free-riding off of American investment in innovation.\u201dAdministration officials have raised expectations that the president\u2019s proposals will have a far-reaching impact. \u201cBold action is on the way,\u201d Mr. Azar said last week.So is resistance.\u201cCanadian drug prices are among the highest in the world,\u201d said Tammy Jarbeau, a spokeswoman for Health Canada, the national health department. \u201cOur plan is to bring down prices so they compare more favorably with those of other countries of comparable size and economic development.\u201dAnd Democrats called it na\u00efve to think that American drug companies would lower prices in the United States if they could increase drug prices abroad.\u201cThere is absolutely no reason to believe that trade policies designed to raise prescription drug prices overseas will result in equivalent or any decreases in prices in the United States,\u201d six House Democrats, led by Representatives Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, said in a recent letter to Mr. Trump.People who work in the industry said it was unlikely that consumers would go to the pharmacy counter and see a meaningful reduction in drug prices before the end of the year.Mr. Trump is expected to criticize brand-name drug manufacturers for high list prices and maneuvers that delay the marketing of lower-cost generic drugs. He is also expected to go after middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, saying they profit from rebates paid by drug companies but do not share much of the savings with patients.Dr. Peter B. Bach of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, an expert on drug prices, said: \u201cAdministration officials are talking about defects in the market that make some drugs unaffordable. The real question is whether the president will take on new brand-name drugs that have no competitors and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\u201dThe United States can pressure foreign nations through diplomacy and trade negotiations. In its annual report card on the protection of intellectual property rights around the world, the United States trade representative last month criticized the drug pricing and reimbursement policies of Canada, South Korea, Japan, India, Turkey, New Zealand and a number of European Union countries, saying they did not adequately recognize the value of innovative medicines.America\u2019s trading partners must \u201ccontribute their fair share to the research and development of new cures and therapies,\u201d the report said, echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that foreign price controls were \u201cvery unfair to this country.\u201dThe report said the Trump administration had recently secured a commitment from South Korea to revise its drug pricing policy to provide higher payments for certain innovative American-made drugs. But the administration said it was concerned about the way Canada sets price ceilings for many prescription drugs. An independent quasi-judicial body reviews drug prices in Canada to make sure they are not excessive.Canadian officials say they have no interest in raising prices to allay the concerns of Trump administration officials or American drug companies.But the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the main lobby for drugmakers, welcomed the new emphasis by the Trump administration.\u201cIn many countries, governments are the principal purchaser of medicines and effectively dictate prices,\u201d the group told the administration. Government price controls in Canada, Japan, Korea and other markets \u201csubstantially eliminate incentives to invest in the development of new medicines,\u201d the drug lobby said.Mr. Azar said the administration would also tackle another problem: \u201cgovernment programs overpaying for drugs.\u201dSeema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Medicare and Medicaid, which cover more than 100 million people, account for nearly 40 percent of all drug spending in the United States.\u201cBeing the largest payer of health care services,\u201d she said, \u201cwe will use our considerable influence\u201d to move the market toward lower drug prices.In advance of the speech by the president, administration officials have been targeting the role of pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate with drugmakers to obtain price concessions in the form of rebates. The rebates are typically calculated as a percentage of a drug\u2019s list price, set by the manufacturer.\u201cAll of the incentives are lined up for manufacturers to set higher and higher prices,\u201d Ms. Verma said. \u201cWhen prices go up, patient cost-sharing also goes up.\u201dThe administration wants benefit managers and insurers to pass on more of the savings to consumers.Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, sent a chill through financial markets last week when he asked what would happen if the federal government re-examined the \u201csafe harbor\u201d that provides legal protection for drug rebate payments.\u201cSuch a step could help restore some semblance of reality to the relationship between list and negotiated prices, and thereby boost affordability and competition,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said.Administration officials say they know that drug companies have discovered cures for diseases that once killed millions. But, Ms. Verma said, \u201clifesaving treatments do not mean anything if patients cannot afford them.\u201d\u201cWhile it is wonderful news that there are hundreds of gene therapies in development,\u201d Ms. Verma said, two cancer therapies that have reached the market \u2014 Yescarta and Kymriah \u2014 \u201chave been priced at $373,000 and $475,000, and a new gene therapy for certain forms of blindness\u201d \u2014 Luxturna \u2014 \u201chas been priced at an astonishing $850,000.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On U.S.-North Korea Talks, China May Hold the Cards", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDANDONG, China \u2014 Along the Chinese border with North Korea, the evidence of Beijing\u2019s leverage in the coming talks between President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is everywhere.Footage of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, hosting Mr. Kim this week plays in a loop on a big outdoor screen here in the city of Dandong, and residents are eager for cross-border trade to resume as sanctions on North Korea are eased. Traders say they are putting in advance orders for coal from North Korean suppliers. Some exporters are already smuggling goods across the border.\u201cIf you bribe the customs officials twice as much as before,\u201d said one businessman who sells machinery for mining, \u201csome of the smaller equipment goes through.\u201dAt a new apartment complex where four 15-story towers are going up, sales have taken off and prices have doubled as buyers \u2014 including North Koreans carrying stacks of Chinese currency \u2014 snap up studios overlooking the Yalu River, a saleswoman said.The Trump administration insists it will maintain its campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on the North until Mr. Kim has shown \u201csubstantial dismantlement\u201d of his nuclear arsenal. But the buoyant mood in Dandong is a reminder that China, as North Korea\u2019s main trade partner, can decide how strictly to enforce the international sanctions against it.Beijing has already positioned itself as a critical player that can shape the outcome of the talks, which Mr. Trump said will take place June 12 in Singapore. The reclusive Mr. Kim has traveled twice in the past two months to China to consult with Mr. Xi, notably in each case just before hosting a visit by Mike Pompeo, the new American secretary of state.The message both times was clear: Mr. Kim wants China\u2019s support for his approach to nuclear disarmament \u2014 a gradual, action-for-action process in which the North is rewarded for each move it takes toward denuclearization.Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team has urged a faster approach, with a timetable as quick as six months to a year, and economic benefits coming only at the end. In his meeting with Mr. Kim this week, though, Mr. Xi endorsed \u201cphased and synchronous measures\u201d that would \u201ceventually achieve denuclearization and lasting peace on the peninsula.\u201dEven as Mr. Trump is celebrating North Korea\u2019s release of three American prisoners, China has many reasons to believe it will come out ahead in the coming talks.For one thing, its leverage over sanctions enforcement means its view on the main issues \u2014 the method and pace of denuclearization \u2014 will carry weight with both North Korea and the United States. Beyond that, it sees the prospect of progress toward a longstanding security goal: the withdrawal of United States troops from the Korean Peninsula.While he has emphasized the importance of moving quickly, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has also endorsed an \u201caction for action\u201d approach to denuclearization, putting his position closer to that of China and North Korea than of the United States. The joint declaration issued after his summit meeting with Mr. Kim last month set no deadline for denuclearization, suggesting the diplomatic momentum is already shifting toward a phased approach.This could make it easier for the North to reject demands to discard its weapons quickly, forcing Mr. Trump to choose between accepting a more gradual process or going home empty-handed despite the expectations he has built ahead of the meeting.\u201cThe obvious risk that America faces in the summit is that Trump makes a big concession to Kim, without getting anything close to full denuclearization in return,\u201d said Hugh White, a professor of international strategic studies at the Australian National University.If Mr. Trump cannot get the big breakthrough he wants in denuclearization, he may try instead to negotiate a treaty to establish diplomatic relations with the North and formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted by an armistice.Mr. Trump has shown great enthusiasm for signing an official peace treaty with North Korea, a gesture that he has said would be good for everyone.However, such an outcome might also play into China\u2019s hands by calling into question the need for the nearly 30,000 American troops now stationed in South Korea, and the annual joint military exercises that involve even more American forces, which are intended to serve as a deterrent against the heavily armed North.\u201cAn agreement with North Korea which reduced tension, while clearly welcome in itself, could well mark the beginning of the end for America\u2019s longstanding preponderance in Asia,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cAnd that would be a big win for China.\u201dAlready China, which has long propped up the North Korean economy, has shown interest in reviving trading ties with the North.Chinese experts said Beijing did not plan to flout the sanctions openly at this point. However, China only reluctantly signed onto the sanctions last year, and largely at the behest of Mr. Trump, who frequently praised it for punishing the North.Under the sanctions, China has cut exports to the North of refined energy products and stopped importing seafood, coal and also North Korean laborers, all important sources of foreign exchange for the Kim regime.Now that North Korea is in play in a larger strategic contest of wills between Beijing and Washington, China is no longer so interested in squeezing the North.\u201cChina has no incentive to punish North Korea anymore,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cIts relations with South Korea have soured. A few months ago, China had a good relationship with President Trump, but now there is a trade war with the United States.\u201dFor its part, South Korea is also keen to prevent the North from slipping too far under Chinese control, even while its current support of a gradualist approach to denuclearization is in line with China\u2019s view. In the joint communiqu\u00e9 released after Mr. Kim\u2019s meeting with Mr. Moon last month, the South pledged to help the North modernize its railroads and highways.The recent diplomatic developments have given both China and South Korea \u201cevery reason to oppose and disregard new sanctions if the U.S. tries to impose them,\u201d said Bilahari Kausikan, the former head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Singapore.Mr. Cheng, the professor, said that once sanctions were eased, China could even help rebuild North Korea\u2019s roads and ports as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing\u2019s signature effort to extend its influence by helping other countries finance large-scale infrastructure projects.During the Dalian meeting this week between Mr. Xi and Mr. Kim, the Chinese heaped praise on Mr. Kim for declaring that North Korea would now concentrate on developing its economy, where an income of $200 a month is considered upper middle class, and a Japanese bicycle is regarded as a luxury item.Increasing numbers of North Korean businessmen have begun returning to Dandong in the last few weeks, since Mr. Kim\u2019s first visit to China at the end of March.A saleswoman for CNC, a Chinese real estate developer, said that North Koreans were lifting the local property market. She said desirable studios with a view of the Yalu River, fitted with imported kitchen equipment, were selling for about $100,000, twice what they fetched when they went on the market two weeks ago.Iris Zhao contributed reporting from Dandong and Beijing.Advertisement"}

In some cases, Russia has timed diffusions for the precise moment when a target enters a certain country.Mr. Browder reflected in a 2016 interview that the Russian authorities were undeterred by failure. \u201cThe Russians try stuff a hundred times, and sometimes it works,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can fail 99 times, but the 100th time it could work. For them, that makes it all worthwhile.\u201dMr. Browder turned the lawyer\u2019s death into an international cause and succeeded in persuading Congress to pass a 2012 law, the Magnitsky Act, that barred Russian officials linked with his death from entering the United States or using its banking system. The European Parliament later passed its own version of the act, in a hearing that ended with a standing ovation for Mr. Browder.Mr. Browder was born in the United States but later renounced his American citizenship and became a citizen of Britain. His grandfather Earl Browder was the head of the American Communist Party.

{"Headline": "New Revelations Suggest a President Losing Control of His Narrative", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe shifting statements also illustrated starkly why some of the president\u2019s lawyers have urged him not to submit to an interview by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating whether Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign cooperated with Russia during the 2016 presidential election and whether the president obstructed justice to thwart that investigation. Those lawyers have said Mr. Mueller is setting a perjury trap for Mr. Trump. What they do not say publicly is that they worry the president would be unable to avoid contradicting himself.Under the unforgiving glare of federal prosecutors, however, misrepresentations carry far greater jeopardy. In nearly a year on the case, Mr. Mueller has shown that he is more than willing to charge associates of Mr. Trump with lying to investigators; independent lawyers have said it would be reckless for the president\u2019s lawyers to allow him to be interviewed. Even supporters who maintain that Mr. Trump is essentially a truth teller acknowledge that he can be loose with details.For Mr. Trump, it is about creating a narrative that suits his desired image, and dictating the terms of his own life \u2014 in media coverage, in his business, in politics, even in his medical care. But he now risks losing his grip on the story line he has long sought to control, in part because of his own treatment of associates like his doctor and the lawyer who paid the porn star.This week\u2019s revelation about the true origin of the doctor\u2019s statement may not have surprised many. When Dr. Harold N. Bornstein released a letter in December 2015 saying that Mr. Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,\u201d few believed it was authentic. It contained the exact language about \u201cstrength and stamina\u201d that the candidate often used to describe himself.From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress.But in an interview on Fox News on Wednesday night, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor now serving as a lawyer for the president, said Mr. Trump had reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the money.In a follow-up interview on Thursday morning, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump did not actually learn the specifics until recently. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know the details of this until we knew the details of this, which was a couple weeks ago,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cMaybe not even a couple \u2014 maybe 10 days ago.\u201dMr. Giuliani seemed less concerned with explaining Mr. Trump\u2019s previous denial than with emphasizing that it was the candidate\u2019s personal money and therefore could not be a violation of campaign finance law. He said the payment to Ms. Clifford as part of a nondisclosure agreement was made in October 2016 only to protect Mr. Trump\u2019s family from a false allegation, not to influence the election less than two weeks later.While others might think paying $130,000 to someone who was making a false allegation was hard to fathom, for a wealthy man like Mr. Trump it was not quite \u201cpocket change, but it\u2019s pretty close to it,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.\u201cWhen Cohen heard $130,000, he said: \u2018My God, this is cheap \u2014 they come cheap. Let me get the thing signed up and signed off,\u2019\u201d Mr. Giuliani added.On Fox News, Mr. Giuliani attributed the decision to Mr. Comey\u2019s refusal to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump in the Russia investigation. \u201cHe fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn\u2019t a target of the investigation,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. Since then, Mr. Mueller\u2019s office has told the White House that Mr. Trump is a subject, though not a target, of the investigation.But some still wondered whether it was an unscripted comment, especially given that it came up almost casually at the end of a long interview with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump have a long and deep relationship. The former mayor has the president\u2019s ear \u2014 and understands how to communicate with him \u2014 in a way that few others do.Still, Mr. Giuliani is a former big city mayor accustomed to being an executive, and his ability to simply carry out orders without adding his own flair has always been in question.Either way, the last few days have shown that Mr. Trump\u2019s narrative is now at least in part in the hands of others \u2014 his lawyers, his friends, his doctor, his accuser\u2019s lawyer, even his investigators. And for a man who prefers to craft his own story line, that is not a comfortable situation.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Jersey City, It\u2019s Kushner vs. Kushner in a Race to Develop", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERSEY CITY \u2014 The decade-long blood feud between the Kushner brothers, Charles and Murray, has already put one brother in jail.Now, the men, who haven\u2019t spoken in 15 years, are rivals in the development of Journal Square in Jersey City, the site of one failed project after another for the past three decades.Their ability to get along \u2014 or not \u2014 could affect this important corner of a rapidly changing city of 264,000 people.Journal Square is less a neighborhood than a maze of streets occupied by a bus depot and a PATH station, dowdy retail, a community college, low-income housing and a restored landmark theater converted into a Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Assembly Hall.The Kushner brothers have both placed bets that they can lure young people fleeing high-priced Manhattan and Brooklyn to the area. They are each building three luxury towers with a total of 3,977 apartments on 388 floors in the six buildings.Murray Kushner completed his first tower, a 53-story, dark-glass and white-paneled building and he has started work on the second, a 71-story behemoth.But Charles\u2019s site, arguably the better parcel on the south side of the entrance to the transit center, sits empty and forlorn. Over the last year, he has jettisoned a partner and anchor tenant, feuded with the mayor and lost a generous helping of state and city tax breaks, as well as a source of financing.While Murray Kushner may not otherwise care about his brother\u2019s woes, in a twist of fate, the two may very well need each other to succeed.\u201cYou need condos, rentals, restaurants, nice stores and whatnot,\u201d said Arnold Bettinger, a member of the city\u2019s planning board whose family owned Bettinger\u2019s on the Square, a liquor store in Journal Square for 55 years before it closed in 1987. \u201cIt\u2019s been empty a long time.\u201dNo matter what they think of one another, said one person who knows both brothers and requested anonymity so as not to be drawn into the feud, \u201cIn this case, they\u2019re oddly aligned. They need each other to make their projects work over time.\u201dPartisan politics also complicates matters.Charles Kushner is feuding with Mayor Steven Fulop, who once welcomed him and his son Jared to Journal Square and favored tax breaks and subsides for their $900 million project. Last month, Mayor Fulop\u2019s administration rejected giving the developer a tax break, notifying Mr. Kushner that his project was in default.\u201cThey\u2019re punishing us because Jared works in the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Kushner said in an interview.Mr. Fulop said in a statement that after six years of negotiations and delays, \u201cthere was little evidence that the project was moving forward in earnest. Due to these failures to meet certain conditions of the redevelopment agreement, the city had no choice but to file the notice of default.\u201dCharles Kushner insisted that he is \u201cshovel ready\u201d to break ground in the fall. Despite Mayor Fulop\u2019s turnabout, he said his project deserves a tax break to get the complex off the ground, for the good of the city and Journal Square. Mr. Kushner said he is unwilling to proceed without a subsidy or incentive from the city.It remains to be seen whether Mr. Fulop will relent, or whether Mr. Kushner will sue the city and wait out the mayor as, he said, his land grows more valuable. Mr. Kushner\u2019s April application to the city for a 30-year tax break and $8.9 million in city-issued bonds may ultimately make its way to the City Council, where Mr. Fulop appears to hold sway.Charles and Murray Kushner were once close. They raised their families in Livingston, N.J., a well-heeled suburb with a large number of Orthodox Jews. Their homes were about as close as the two development sites in Journal Square.Those who know them say there was always a certain amount of rugged competition between the brothers. Each had his own real estate company, but they also invested together.Charles Kushner, however, was also a powerhouse in the Democratic Party and a major contributor to party causes.In the early 2000s, the brothers squabbled in court over the amount of money that Charles poured into political campaigns and charities. The United States attorney in New Jersey, Chris Christie, took notice, opening an investigation into whether political contributions and other expenses were wrongly listed as business expenses on tax returns.Charles Kushner assumed his brother and a sister were assisting the investigation. Incensed, he retaliated in a way that made even some of his friends gasp. He ordered the videotaping of his sister\u2019s husband engaging in sex with a prostitute he had hired, then had the video sent to his sister.Would the brothers ever reconcile? \u201cPerhaps, if Charlie hadn\u2019t gone to prison,\u201d said Alan R. Hammer, who has known Charles Kushner for 35 years. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bad television movie.\u201dMurray and his son Jonathan, who runs KRE Group, or Kushner Real Estate Group, got to Journal Square first.In 2013, the city granted their complex, called Journal Squared, a 35-year tax break and provided $10 million in bonds for public improvements, while the state granted up to $33 million in tax credits over 10 years. The first tower in the project, with 538 units, opened last year and was fully leased by the end of 2017.Murray and Jonathan, who declined to comment for this story, broke ground last year on the second tower, although work appears to be moving slowly.\u201cEvery building that goes up there will contribute to the success of the Journal Square renaissance,\u201d said Charles Kushner of their projects. Mr. Kushner typically does not discuss his brother.Late in 2014, Charles and Jared, in partnership with the KABR Group, bought the 2-acre site for what is now called 1 Journal Square, two towers sitting above a 10-story base, near the entrance to the PATH station.They already owned a parcel across the street, where they planned a third tower, that includes the former home of The Jersey Journal.The competition between projects is fierce in a city where there are 6,000 apartments under construction and 22,000 units in the pipeline.Jared Kushner brought in a new partner and tenant, WeWork, for the two-towered complex, which was to include co-working space, a business incubator and dormlike living called WeLive.But by 2017, Jared had left the company for the White House. Charles said he decided to cut his ties to WeWork and build more conventional, market-rate apartments. As a result, the state reduced the total tax credits for the project to $33 million from $93 million.Mayor Fulop, who was running for re-election in heavily Democratic Jersey City, went public immediately with his opposition to hefty tax breaks for 1 Journal Square. The innovative aspects of the project were lost with the departure of WeWork, the city contends.Since then, the Kushners have said that they will no longer use the federal program popular among developers that trades a path to citizenship to foreigners who invest $500,000 in American projects.Last September, however, the planning board approved Charles Kushner\u2019s revised plan for the project. In April, his company filed a new application for tax breaks and bonds from the city. But Mr. Fulop has remained publicly opposed to providing the Kushner project with any tax breaks, contrary to the mayor\u2019s position on other projects, including Murray Kushner\u2019s Journal Squared.That left Mr. Kushner furious. He said that Mr. Fulop acknowledged last fall in a telephone conversation that Mr. Kushner was being discriminated against for his ties to the White House.Asked about Mr. Kushner\u2019s account of the phone call, the mayor\u2019s office did not specifically address the matter. The mayor did point out that 1 Journal Square failed to start construction by Jan. 1, as required by the development agreement, and questioned whether Mr. Kushner has the financing to proceed.\u201cThe Kushner project in Journal Square is in default for a number of project-related issues,\u201d Mayor Fulop said in a statement, \u201cnot the family\u2019s connection to the White House.\u201dMr. Kushner acknowledged that Murray\u2019s project, as the first big complex in Journal Square, deserved its generous tax breaks. But that doesn\u2019t mean that he should get nothing, he said.\u201cWe are front and center in Journal Square,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. \u201cWe are certainly entitled to some sort of tax abatement for enhancing the area.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brooklyn Safety Patrol Leader Is Charged in Sex Abuse of Teen", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wednesday, sex crimes investigators for the New York Police Department received a troubling report: The influential leader of a Brooklyn safety patrol known as the shomrim had been sexually abusing a teenage girl, the police were told.A day later, detectives arrested the man, Jacob Daskal, a leader of one faction of what has been, since the 1970s, a sort of auxiliary police force for the ultra-Orthodox Jews of Brooklyn\u2019s Borough Park, Crown Heights, Flatbush and Williamsburg neighborhoods.Mr. Daskal, 59, was charged with statutory rape, sexual abuse and other crimes. The authorities believe the abuse took place at Mr. Daskal\u2019s home between August and November of last year, when the girl, who is now 16, was a year younger. But the inquiry is continuing, to determine if the alleged abuse occurred over a longer period of time or if there were additional victims.In May 2016, two men linked to the shomrim of Williamsburg admitted to taking part in the assault of a black man in their neighborhood. A month earlier, Alex Lichtenstein, a former member of Mr. Daskal\u2019s Brooklyn South Safety Patrol, which covers Borough Park, was arrested on federal charges of trying to secure handgun permits by offering the police thousands of dollars in cash bribes.In the case of Mr. Daskal, 59, he was arrested at 12:30 p.m. on Thursday, within the 77th police precinct, the police said. He was then taken to the Brooklyn Special Victims squad, they said.On Friday, the police said that Mr. Daskal had been charged with third-degree rape; third-degree criminal sex act; forcible touching; acting in a manner injurious to a child less than 17; and third-degree sexual abuse. He shuffled, handcuffed, into court for arraignment and pleaded not guilty before Judge Deborah Dowling, who issued an order of protection on behalf of his accuser.Evan Lipton, a lawyer for Mr. Daskal, said his client was prepared to surrender his passport. Afterward, as Mr. Daskal was released on bail, some supporters surrounded him in a hallway as Mr. Lipton told him, \u201cYour phones have been seized.\u201dIt was not immediately clear what triggered Wednesday\u2019s report to the police.Around Borough Park, people seemed dazed by the news of the arrest.\u201cThis is the last thing anybody would believe,\u201d said one man, a neighbor, who stood outside Mr. Daskal\u2019s house about noon, watching as a van from the Crime Scene Unit pulled to the curb. Throughout the morning, investigators, some wearing latex gloves, converged on the brick duplex set back from 46th Street as onlookers, including several children, gathered outside.On those same streets, the shomrim are seen as quick-acting stand-ins for police officers. With their two-way radios and social media links, they have won praise for keeping a watchful eye on the community, chasing down burglars, controlling crowds and locating the missing.Residents, many of whom are Yiddish-speaking and cling to a culture rooted in preindustrial Europe, trust the shomrim as liaisons to secular authorities, who can negotiate language barriers and complex social mores.Police officials, too, have embraced the shomrim. It is commonplace for shomrim leaders to attend promotion ceremonies at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan.On Friday, as investigators streamed in and out of Mr. Daskal\u2019s house, signs of their connections were evident. Parked in the street, near Mr. Daskal\u2019s driveway, were a pair of shomrim vehicles outfitted like police patrol cars: emergency lights; a shield logo; the words \u201cCourtesy Professionalism Respect\u201d written on the side.Alan Feuer, Sean Piccoli and Kerry Wills contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Over all, the peso is down nearly 19 percent since the start of the year.Mr. Macri, president since December 2015, portrayed the request as the product of changing international conditions and the legacy of high government spending.\u201cThe problem we have is that we are among the countries in the world that most depend on external financing, the product of the huge public spending that we inherited,\u201d he said in a recorded video message.Treasury Minister Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne emphasized that the financing the country could obtain through the I.M.F. would be cheaper than what was available in the markets. Yet he also gave a thinly veiled nod to the widespread skepticism \u2014 if not outright anger \u2014 that many in Argentina have toward the I.M.F.\u201cWhat we do have to keep in mind is that we are talking about an International Monetary Fund that is very different from what we knew 20 years ago,\u201d Mr. Dujovne said. \u201cThe fund has learned its lessons from the past, just like we all did.\u201d\u201cThe I.M.F. is a bad word in Argentina because of the memories it brings to mind of economic programs that almost never turned out well,\u201d said Matias Carugati, chief economist at Management & Fit, a consultancy.When President N\u00e9stor Kirchner paid off an I.M.F. debt of almost $10 billion in 2006, he celebrated it as a way for the country to regain its sovereignty.Mr. Macri took office with an ambitious plan to end a decade of isolation from the international markets by issuing billions in debt. Now, the decision to turn to the I.M.F. could erode Argentines\u2019 confidence in him, said Luis Tonelli, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Buenos Aires.Merely seeking the help of the I.M.F. could lead the public to feel that \u201cthe government is weak and has to call the bad guy in the movie,\u201d Mr. Tonelli said.Members of the political opposition were quick to criticize Mr. Macri.Front for Victory, the largest opposition bloc in the lower house of the National Congress of Argentina, called the decision \u201ca severe step backward.\u201d\u201cAgreements with the I.M.F. have always been prejudicial to our people,\u201d the group said. \u201cThey have meant cuts in salaries, pensions, privatizations and firings in the public sector and increases in poverty.\u201dEconomists cautioned that more information was needed in order to properly analyze the type of credit the government could obtain from the I.M.F. and the conditions that would be imposed as a result.\u201cIt is news that should bring a bit of relief to the market,\u201d said Luis Secco, the director of Perspectivas Econ\u00f3micas, a consultancy. \u201cBut it\u2019s undeniable that the words \u2018agreement with the fund\u2019 will also cause a lot of political problems for the government.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Banks to Get a Break From Limits on Risky Trading", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig banks are getting a big reprieve from a postcrisis rule aimed at curbing risky behavior on Wall Street.Federal bank regulators on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping proposal to soften the Volcker Rule, a cornerstone of the 2010 law that was enacted after the financial crisis to rein in risky trading. The change would give Wall Street banks more freedom to make their own complex bets \u2014 activities that can be highly profitable but also leave them more vulnerable to losses.The rule, part of the broader Dodd-Frank law, was put in place to prevent banks from making unsafe bets with depositors\u2019 money. It took five agencies three years to write it and has been criticized by Wall Street as too onerous and harmful to the proper functioning of financial markets. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve proposed easing several parts of the rule, and four other regulators are expected to soon follow suit, kicking off a public comment period that is expected to last 60 days.The loosening of the Volcker Rule is part of a coordinated effort underway in Washington to relax rules put into place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Big banks, emboldened by President Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda and a more favorable political climate in Washington, have begun pressing for changes to several postcrisis rules, including the Volcker Rule.Last week, Mr. Trump signed into law a bipartisan bill that will free thousands of small and medium-size banks from the Dodd-Frank law, and on May 21, he signed a law rescinding a consumer rule aimed at preventing discrimination by auto lenders. The Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently proposed easing limits on how much the largest banks can borrow and the Fed also proposed changes to the stress tests that banks must undergo each year to determine whether they can withstand an economic downturn.Mr. Trump\u2019s acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mick Mulvaney, has also engaged in a rapid series of regulatory changes since November, including halting new investigations, freezing new hires and preventing the agency from collecting certain data from banks.Regulators said on Wednesday that the primary intent of the Volcker Rule would remain intact and that banks would not be allowed to return to the wild days of proprietary trading, when traders made big bets with the bank\u2019s money and sometimes lost huge sums. But they said the rule needed to be simplified so that banks could more easily comply with it and Washington could adequately enforce it.\u201cThe proposal will address some of the uncertainty and complexity that now make it difficult for firms to know how best to comply, and for supervisors to know that they are in compliance,\u201d the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said at a board of governors meeting. \u201cOur goal is to replace overly complex and inefficient requirements with a more streamlined set of requirements.\u201dThe Volcker Rule, while not the most significant postcrisis regulation, is arguably the most recognizable. It was included at the behest of Paul Volcker, a former Fed chairman who warned that Wall Street was recklessly gambling with house money. On Wednesday, Mr. Volcker, now the chairman of a nonpartisan think tank called the Volcker Alliance, welcomed efforts to simplify compliance with the rule but said in a statement, \u201cWhat is critical is that simplification not undermine the core principle at stake \u2014 that taxpayer-supported banking groups, of any size, not participate in proprietary trading at odds with the basic public and customers\u2019 interests.\u201dHe added: \u201cI trust the final rule will strongly maintain that position by, as intended, facilitating its practical application.\u201dAll three sitting Fed governors voted to release the proposal, which will be open to public comment and could change before being finalized. At a brief Fed meeting to discuss the rule, officials stressed that the changes were merely refinements that stemmed from their experience overseeing the process of putting the rule into place, including what did and did not work.Bank lawyers said the Fed was clearly trying to insulate itself from criticism that it was giving banks too much leeway by declaring that the changes were based on experience overseeing the rule.\u201cFor people who are saying \u2018you\u2019re going too easy on the banks,\u2019 their rejoinder is \u2018we have data saying that\u2019s not true,\u2019\u201d said Douglas Landy, a partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy who helps some of the largest banks comply with the Volcker Rule. \u201cIt\u2019s the type of language you might not see in a Fed report before the financial crisis or Dodd Frank when they weren\u2019t as aware of the political implications.\u201dThe six largest United States banks have all lobbied either directly or through trade groups for changes to the rule. Representatives for JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo declined to comment on the proposal while representatives of Bank of America and Citigroup had no immediate comment.But the changes would alter how much time the banks have to spend proving they are following the Volcker Rule and give them more leeway to determine which types of trades comply. It would also shift the burden of proof for determining whether a trade qualifies under Volcker away from the bank to the regulators.Now, banks must prove that each trade serves a clear purpose that goes beyond a speculative bet by showing regulators specifically how each trade either meets customer demands or acts as a hedge against specific risks. That had curtailed trading in a variety of assets like derivatives, corporate bonds and other complex products.Under the changes outlined Wednesday, banks will no longer have to offer proof for each specific trade and would instead have to enact strict internal controls and compliance programs to ensure they are meeting the requirements of the Volcker Rule. The change would allow banks to more freely engage in hedging, in which they execute trades in an effort to counteract risk in other parts of their businesses.Regulators would also give banks more leeway to determine what levels of trading activity are appropriate for meeting customer demands on each of their trading desks. That would be a shift from the current rule, which sets rigid standards that do not differentiate between trading desks that serve different assets, like corporate bonds and derivatives.In a briefing for journalists on Wednesday, an agency official said letting banks set their own risk and activity limits would help reduce the difficulties big banks face in trying to prove that their various market activities, which can differ greatly from one another, conform to a set of rigid standards.Regulators will also continue to collect trading information from the largest banks, which are subject to strict oversight and monitoring as part of the enhanced supervisory process put into place after the crisis.Lael Brainard, a Fed governor appointed by President Barack Obama, said on Wednesday that she supported the proposal, as long as the chief executives of banks were willing to personally attest to future claims that their institutions were adhering to the restriction on speculative betting.\u201cThe requirement of C.E.O. attestation is critical for this to work, in my view,\u201d Ms. Brainard said in prepared remarks.Other changes would group banks into categories according to how much Wall Street trading they do. Banks engaging in the least amount of trading would have the easiest set of requirements to fulfill under the rule, a change that dovetails with Congress\u2019s recent move to exempt the smallest banks from having to comply with the Volcker Rule at all.The changes are already prompting outrage among consumer advocates and other financial watchdogs, who warn it will allow a return to the Wild West days on Wall Street.\u201cThis proposal is no minor set of technical tweaks to the Volcker Rule, but an attempt to unravel fundamental elements of the response to the 2008 financial crisis, when banks financed their gambling with taxpayer-insured deposits,\u201d Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, said in a statement.Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has been among the most vocal critics of changes to Dodd-Frank, called the proposal the latest example of corruption in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington.\u201cEven as banks make record profits, their former banker buddies turned regulators are doing them favors by rolling back a rule that protects taxpayers from another bailout,\u201d Ms. Warren said.But business groups applauded watering down of the Volcker Rule on Wednesday as a step in the right direction \u2014 one that would allow banks to operate more efficiently.The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said that the Fed vote showed that regulators were finally recognizing the \u201cunintended negative impact\u201d of the complex rules governing the financial system. And the American Bankers Association praised policymakers for \u201ctaking sensible steps to better tailor regulations consistent with risk.\u201dDavid Hirschmann, president of the United States Chamber\u2019s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, said that it was time for a more efficient Volcker Rule.\u201cWe are pleased that regulators understand that the Volcker Rule is currently impeding important financing for American businesses,\u201d Mr. Hirschmann said.Advertisement"}

But it could have an outsize impact on the presidency: The payment has helped spur a lawsuit by Ms. Clifford against Mr. Trump and a federal investigation into Mr. Cohen. Campaign finance watchdogs assert the transaction was the result of a secret, and illegal, effort to subvert election spending laws on behalf of the president. The story behind the payment to Ms. Clifford \u2014 when Mr. Cohen paid it, how he paid it, whether he was paid back and by whom \u2014 will be critical to both the lawsuit and investigation, not to mention others that may come. Below is what we know about what happened, how the explanations have evolved and why it all matters.Oct. 17, 2016Mr. Cohen sets up a new company in Delaware, Essential Consultants L.L.C., from which he will later pay Ms. Clifford. Delaware has minimal disclosure requirements for people who create companies there, making it hard to know their identities. Many companies incorporate in Delaware. The location of Essential Consultants could become legally significant if investigators establish that Mr. Cohen used Essential Consultants to evade campaign finance laws requiring full disclosure of campaign donations and disbursements. Mr. Cohen and lawyers for Mr. Trump have denied wrongdoing.Oct. 26, 2016 Oct. 27, 2016 Oct. 28, 2016Mr. Trump\u2019s name does not technically appear on the document. According to a draft amendment to the original contract, which was shared with The New York Times, Ms. Clifford was referred to as \u201cPeggy Peterson.\u201d Mr. Trump was named as \u201cDavid Dennison\u201d in the document.Nov. 4, 2016 The election is held four days later. The story about Ms. Clifford\u2019s payment does not get any real attention for another 14 months.Jan. 12, 2018Mr. Cohen responds in a statement, \u201cThese rumors have circulated time and again since 2011. President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels,\u201d and forwards a denial from Ms. Clifford. A White House official says, \u201cThese are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied before the election.\u201d Feb. 13, 2018March 6, 2018Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, says, \u201cThere was no knowledge of any payments from the president,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with the president about this.\u201d She says, \u201cHe has denied all these allegations.\u201dMarch 9, 2018Mr. Cohen repeats his statement that he was not reimbursed by either the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign. April 5, 2018April 26, 2018May 2, 2018 Mr. Trump\u2019s new lawyer, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, tells Sean Hannity of Fox News that the \u201cthe president repaid it,\u201d referring to the payment Mr. Cohen made to Ms. Clifford. In fact, he says, \u201cthey set up a reimbursement, $35,000 a month.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Stopgap Government in Italy", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Technically, President Mattarella blocked only the appointment of Paolo Savona, an 82-year-old economist tapped to be finance minister, on the ground that his covert plans to exit the euro posed a risk \u201cfor Italian families and their savings.\u201d But the impasse over Mr. Savona prompted the coalition\u2019s lowest-common-denominator choice for prime minister, an obscure law professor named Giuseppe Conte, to bow out, leading the president to ask Carlo Cottarelli, a solidly pro-Europe and pro-austerity economist and former official of the International Monetary Fund, to form a nonelected government. Mr. Cottarelli said new elections would be held in early 2019, though they could be held as early as September if he fails to survive a confidence vote.Opponents of the coalition cheered Mr. Mattarella\u2019s action as a courageous blow against the dangerous rise of populism and irresponsible programs that would have vastly increased public spending in a country already saddled with a 2.3-trillion-euro ($2.7 trillion) debt. The spurned parties, which had struggled since national elections on March 4 to overcome profound differences and form their coalition, complained of unwarranted presidential interference in a legitimate political choice. The leader of the Five Star Movement, Luigi Di Maio, called for the president to be impeached, while the League\u2019s leader, Matteo Salvini, threatened to organize a march on Rome.However spooked the markets were, they had been equally wary of the coalition and its grandiose spending plans, and given the mutual hostility of the coalition partners, their government might not have survived for long. Mr. Mattarella\u2019s stand, at least, gives Italian voters a second chance to weigh their options after glimpsing what their earlier choices might mean. That\u2019s something some Brexit voters in Britain, or Trump voters in the United States, might have welcomed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron Vowed to Make France a \u2018Start-Up Nation.\u2019 Is It Getting There?", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet a year after Mr. Macron unveiled an aggressive agenda to turn France into \u201ca start-up nation,\u201d it is unclear if reality has kept pace with his rhetoric. While the country has quickly become one of the most talked-about destinations in Europe for tech companies and start-ups, France still faces an uphill path in its bid to usurp London as the region\u2019s technology leader.The French president has carefully cultivated a tech-savvy image, promoted a steady drumbeat of high-profile events, and even pushed through a raft of economic and labor reforms to make his country more appealing to investors. But France continues to lag Britain in tech-related investments and in the business of artificial intelligence. Start-ups still face challenges in scaling up. And a lot of seed funding comes from the French government itself.Companies have been pledging to do more in France. In January, for example, the chief executives of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies announced 3.5 billion euros, or $4.1 billion, in new investments and the creation of at least 2,200 jobs in the next five years.Those figures are minuscule compared with investment in Silicon Valley, and even London. Mr. Macron nevertheless sought to build on France\u2019s momentum on Wednesday, when he convened 60 tech chief executives for meetings in Paris. The French president met individually with the Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and with the leaders of IBM, Microsoft and Uber later Wednesday at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.Facebook has faced a barrage of public criticism over its handling of user data and vast powers, points Mr. Macron intends to press further on Wednesday. The president\u2019s office also said that Mr. Macron would have frank discussions with the various chief executives over the taxation of tech companies and fighting the proliferation of rumors and misinformation spreading online. The meetings come as French lawmakers are expected to debate additional transparency measures for social media companies like Facebook.But Mr. Macron president is also expected to seize the moment to announce more tech-related investments in France.\u201cClearly there has been a Macron effect,\u201d said Franck Sebag, a Paris-based partner at the professional services firm Ernst & Young, who has studied France\u2019s digital trajectory.\u201cFew people were even talking about France as a tech country a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Sebag said. \u201cHe\u2019s ignited a willingness to invest.\u201dAs President Trump pursues an increasingly protectionist agenda for the United States, and Britain veers away from the European Union, Mr. Macron has promoted a policy of open borders and being business-friendly in a country that has long had a reputation for being anything but. Multinationals are venturing to create more jobs in France as Mr. Macron overhauls French labor laws, despite protests by French workers.\u201cThe U.K. is no longer the undisputed capital of European venture capital,\u201d Dealroom said in a recent report. \u201cContinental Europe is catching up, while France is almost on par already.\u201dFor all the hype, France must confront a number of longstanding hurdles.The trend here is shifting, though.Big businesses are increasingly tallying the advantages, especially since Mr. Macron convened 140 chief executives of global companies at an ornate gathering at the Palace of Versailles in January. He told them that he was pursuing a strategy to make France more productive and competitive, and announced more than \u20ac3.5 billion in foreign investments, including a large chunk for tech.Fujitsu of Japan is one of several Asia-based companies that plan to invest in expanded artificial intelligence research here. After the gathering in Versailles, the Fujitsu president, Tatsuya Tanaka, was named a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur by the French government, one of France\u2019s highest honors.\u201cThe new image of France,\u201d the company said in a statement, \u201cis attracting foreign investors again.\u201dElian Peltier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Plan for Safe Injection Sites Faces Many Hurdles", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe greatest threat to the plan may come from federal law enforcement authorities, who could determine that the sites violate the nation\u2019s drug laws.\u201cIt is a crime, not only to use illicit narcotics, but to manage and maintain sites on which such drugs are used and distributed,\u201d the Vermont federal prosecutor\u2019s office wrote in the statement last December. It said that \u201cexposure to criminal charges would arise\u201d for drug users, as well as workers in the injection sites, and that properties where the centers are \u201cwould also be subject to federal forfeiture.\u201dMr. de Blasio on Friday acknowledged the obstacles during his weekly radio appearance on WNYC.\u201cThere are very substantial law enforcement and legal issues, quality-of-life issues, there\u2019s all sorts of concerns,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cBut in the final analysis, what\u2019s clear to me is this will save lives. We will see a number of people who would otherwise have died of an overdose be in a setting where they can be saved.\u201dA report produced in coordination with the city\u2019s health department estimated that the four injection centers might prevent up to 130 overdose deaths a year. Last year, New York City had 1,441 overdose deaths, a record number.The centers would have personnel trained to administer medication that can reverse an overdose. There would also be places where drug users could get access to social services and programs to help them deal with their addiction.Mr. de Blasio said the centers, which the city calls overdose prevention centers, would be in facilities where private social service providers currently operate needle exchange programs for drug users. There would be one in the Bronx, two in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn.But the possibility that federal authorities might seek to seize buildings where the sites operate could scare off landlords \u2014 creating a concern for the nonprofit groups that are expected to be involved in the project.\u201cIt would be very damaging if anything was publicly disclosed about these sites at the present moment for the simple reason that the sites have not approached the owners of these properties for approval,\u201d said Charles King, the president of Housing Works. Mr. King is also chairman of a group created to run the injection sites, called Research for a Safer New York.Officials have identified four needle exchange programs that are expected to host the injection sites: a Housing Works site on West 37th Street in Midtown, a location in Washington Heights, one in the Longwood section of the Bronx and one near Barclays Center in Brooklyn.Mr. King and executives of some of the other groups involved allowed that the injection sites may yet be placed in different nearby locations.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan would proceed only if it receives authorization from the State Health Department. The city is asking state health officials to designate the program as a research project, which would be licensed to operate with narcotics during a one-year pilot program.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo noted on Friday that his father, Mario M. Cuomo, had taken a similar step as governor in the early 1990s when he first allowed needle exchange programs to operate in the state. The needle exchanges began at that time to combat the spread of infectious diseases, including AIDS, among drug users.\u201cThe goal is a laudable goal,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, referring to the objective of averting overdose deaths. \u201cHow you get there is obviously the question. There are legal questions that are involved, there are community questions, law enforcement questions.\u201dHe said that the health department would review the mayor\u2019s plan, but he added, \u201cIt violates the federal law, which is something you have to deal with.\u201dMr. de Blasio has proposed no injection centers for Queens or Staten Island. James Oddo, the Staten Island borough president, and Michael E. McMahon, the Richmond County district attorney, both said on Friday that they opposed locating a center in the borough, although it has one of the highest rates of overdose deaths in the city.\u201cWhile thinking outside the box is necessary to finding solutions for the heroin and opioid epidemic, I believe creating supervised injection sites undermines prevention and treatment efforts, and only serves to normalize the use of these deadly drugs,\u201d Mr. McMahon said in a statement.Liz Evans, the executive director of the Washington Heights Corner Project, which operates a needle exchange on West 181st Street, said that many aspects of the plan remained unclear, including where the money would come from to finance the new centers.As she answered the telephone on Friday afternoon, Ms. Evans had just come from helping to administer the anti-overdose drug naloxone to a man who was found collapsed in the neighborhood. She said the man, who had appeared on the verge of death, was recovering.\u201cI think there is a sense of urgency around dealing with this issue, and whatever it takes to get there sooner is something we should be looking at, rather than later,\u201d Ms. Evans said, pointing out that safe injection centers have been operated for years in Canada and Europe. \u201cWhile we\u2019re talking, people are still overdosing and dying.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Markets Are Worrying Investors, Again", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdd a familiar item to the list of worries for investors: turmoil in the emerging markets.Turkey\u2019s central bank lifted interest rates sharply Wednesday, an emergency measure aimed at stopping the riptide of capital pouring out of the country in recent days.The central bank announced that it would raise a key borrowing rate by 3 percentage points, to 16.5 percent, after Turkey\u2019s lira dropped by as much as 5 percent during the day. In currency markets, moves of even 1 percent are viewed as exceptionally large.Argentina made a similar move this month after investors abruptly lost faith in the government\u2019s reform efforts. The Argentine peso plunged more than 20 percent, before the central bank lifted interest rates to 40 percent. The government is now negotiating a bailout package with the International Monetary Fund.The question on the minds of investors: Is this the start of a bust that could shake the world economy, similar to those that battered Russia, South Korea, Mexico and most of Southeast Asia in recent decades?Or is this merely a market hiccup, akin to the temporary setback that hit emerging markets in 2013?A checkered history of booms and busts hasn\u2019t stopped investors from pouring trillions of dollars into emerging markets in recent years, lured by the promise of higher rates of return than safer bets in the United States, Europe and Japan.Central banks in those large, developed economies had pushed interest rates sharply lower after the 2008 financial crisis, making the higher yields in riskier countries all the more attractive.Last year, investors pumped $1.2 trillion into fast-growing developing economies, especially those that were perceived as having responsible budget and central bank policies. That amount exceeded the totals in 2015 and 2016 combined.Many of those bets have paid off handsomely. Investors earned more than 9 percent on emerging-market bonds last year, much better than the roughly 3.5 percent they could have earned investing in the American bond markets. Emerging-market stocks did even better, rising more than 30 percent in 2017, compared with a 19 percent increases in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.But now money is flowing the other way. Some $8 billion has fled bond and equity markets in developing countries over the past month and a half, according to the Institute of International Finance, a banking industry trade group. And the sharp drops in Argentine and Turkish markets suggest that trickle is turning into a gusher.Many emerging-market enthusiasts say the recent anxiety simply reflects that investors are locking in gains and temporarily taking their money home.\u201cWhat is driving this is a massive bout of profit-taking \u2014 it\u2019s the first pullback in the past 10 quarters,\u201d said Jan Dehn, an emerging-market bond specialist at Ashmore Investment Management in London. \u201cTurkey and Argentina are weak spots \u2014 but they are just two countries out of 80. Over all, the fundamentals are incredibly strong.\u201dOthers think that Turkey and Argentina, while more fragile than their peers, may merely be the first dominoes to fall as the decade-long environment of low interest rates comes to an end.With the American economy strong, the Federal Reserve is gradually lifting short-term interest rates. Those act as a magnet for money from around the world, pushing the value of the dollar higher. All currencies are relative, so a stronger dollar translates into a decline in the value of other currencies. That trade-off is especially pronounced in emerging markets, whose economies rely on money from foreign investors.This can fuel a vicious cycle in which a strong dollar weakens emerging-market currencies, prompting investors to pull even more money out of those economies. That, in turn, further weakens their currencies.The concern is that the pattern could spread.\u201cIt is not just Argentina and Turkey,\u201d said James Donald, the head of emerging markets at Lazard Asset Management in New York. \u201cThere are some sizable countries suffering from current account deficits.\u201dA country runs a current account deficit if it takes in more money \u2014 in investments and trade \u2014 from foreigners than it sends to other countries. That leaves the country at the mercy of international investors to keep it afloat financially.So far, the rise in the United States dollar hasn\u2019t been especially sharp, especially compared with its rise in 2013, when the Fed first said it would start tapering off the support that the central bank had provided since the financial crisis. That ignited a phenomenon that market players labeled the \u201ctaper tantrum,\u201d and it caused a sharp drop in emerging markets such as South Africa, India and Turkey.The fact that the slight rise in the dollar is already putting emerging markets under pressure is a red flag to some experts, because it suggests the situation could get much more severe if the dollar keeps climbing.\u201cIf we\u2019re getting these kinds of moves for a shock that\u2019s really quite a bit smaller than the \u2018taper tantrum,\u2019 it makes me quite worried,\u201d said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.Advertisement"}

In the book, Seierstad portrays the inner workings of an Afghan family with whom she lived for several months: the patriarch\u2019s acquisition of a second wife, the perils of flirting in a conservative society, the tyrannical behavior of men and the suffering of women. The patriarch \u2014 the bookseller of the title \u2014 claimed that Seierstad misrepresented him as a brute, violated the sanctity of his household and jeopardized his family\u2019s lives. \u201cSurely it is the Afghan culture that puts these young women at risk,\u201d Seierstad said at the time. One of the bookseller\u2019s wives sued Seierstad for invasion of privacy, though she was eventually cleared of the charges. These were the days after Sept. 11, during the American invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. The Islamic world was suddenly something that needed to be penetrated and understood. Two civilizations had clashed, and everyone was confused. But for a long time, only one bore the burden of having to explain itself, and of watching itself be explained.Fifteen years later, the wars begun after 9/11 continue in spectacular and gruesome new forms. The books about them have also changed, at least a little. In her new book, \u201cTwo Sisters: A Father, His Daughters, and Their Journey Into the Syrian Jihad,\u201d Seierstad, the author of several other works, including \u201cOne of Us,\u201d about the 2011 massacre of dozens of Norwegians by a far-right terrorist, again takes on conservative Islamic culture, war zones and fathers. But this time the mystery she\u2019s exploring is the appeal for Muslims of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Seierstad wants to know: Why did thousands of Europeans leave their homes in the West to join ISIS in Syria?As in \u201cBookseller,\u201d the main character in \u201cTwo Sisters\u201d is the patriarch of a large family: Sadiq Juma, who moved his wife and children (eventually he had five) to Norway from Hargeisa, Somaliland, after fighting in the Somali civil war. In Norway he found work in a Coca-Cola warehouse, but when the book opens he is injured and on sick leave, and the family is being supported by NAV, the Norwegian welfare authority. Sadiq has embraced his Norwegian life, whereas his wife, Sara, didn\u2019t want to learn the language. She speaks Somali with her children, and as the years pass she has fretted about them becoming \u201ctoo Norwegian,\u201d particularly their son Ismael. He was more rebellious than her daughters, Ayan and Leila, who \u201casked for permission for everything.\u201dThen, in October 2013, the two girls disappear. A farewell email arrives from an unknown location in Sweden: \u201cMuslims are under attack from all quarters, and we need to do something,\u201d the sisters write. They apologize for hurting their parents but promise to make it up to them in the afterlife. Hours later, another email follows, this time from Adana, Turkey, where the girls are having their last meal in Europe, waiting for someone to bring them to the war zone: They suggest that their family read \u201cDefense of Muslim Lands: The First Obligation After Iman,\u201d by Dr. Abdullah Azzam, who inspired Osama bin Laden to finance the mujahedeen in Afghanistan and is known as the \u201cfather of modern jihadism.\u201dSadiq immediately flies to Turkey to intercept his daughters. He\u2019s too late. At the Syrian border, parents from Kuwait, Qatar and Britain have come looking: \u201cHunched figures. Desperation in their eyes.\u201d A Turkish taxi driver connects Sadiq to a Syrian smuggler, who arranges his trip across the border to the town of Atmeh. Sadiq\u2019s travails in Syria \u2014 including 12 days in a bloody, excrement-filled ISIS prison \u2014 are among the most well-executed scenes in the book. \u201cWhat sort of hell is this?\u201d a Syrian cellmate asks before he is beheaded. Meanwhile, Sadiq\u2019s daughters, who have been taken in by ISIS in a nearby town, send messages to Ismael back in Norway complaining about their father\u2019s pestering of ISIS leaders to release them and bragging about \u201cnot having to lift a finger\u201d for \u201ca house, water, electricity, the lot!!!\u201dAyan and Leila did not respond to Seierstad\u2019s requests to speak to her for this book. As a substitute for firsthand interviews, she quotes the girls\u2019 surreal internet chat-speak. \u201cSo we\u2019re probably never going to see each other again?\u201d Ismael says, deploying a crying emoji. \u201cDon\u2019t ever think that, we always have Skype, haha,\u201d Leila replies. Ismael descends into depression, and the girls become meaner. \u201cSad to see my sisters offering their bodies to retards fighting to get killed, otherwise it\u2019s all good,\u201d Ismael writes. \u201cHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA better to die than to live life like a loser,\u201d Ayan writes back. The sisters figure in the family\u2019s life as disembodied aggro-texters. They speak in the language of the Facebook update, and unsurprisingly it makes everyone else feel awful. \u201cThey had chosen a life without him,\u201d Sadiq thinks. \u201cThey were making pancakes in Raqqa.\u201d Without Ayan and Leila\u2019s testimony, \u201cTwo Sisters\u201d is less a portrait of why two European women joined ISIS than one of those they left behind.Even without the sisters\u2019 voices, the passages in which Seierstad attempts to piece together how the girls were radicalized are absorbing. As the oldest and her father\u2019s favorite, Ayan dominates the account. When she was 13, she and her friends wore Kiss T-shirts and skinny jeans. Her favorite author was Knut Hamsun. Ayan is herself a good writer, with an impressive imagination; in a short story she wrote for school, she conjures the interior life of an American soldier in Vietnam: \u201cWe are on night patrol doing a recon. Those sly gooks could be hiding just about anywhere.\u201d The soldier recalls taking part in massacres in which women and children were coated with oil and set on fire. \u201cHow can the sky be so beautiful when the world is so sickening?\u201d Ayan writes. From an early age, she was a feminist, \u201ctough and self-confident,\u201d and \u201cindignant at the oppression of women, the focus on body image.\u201d She thought Islam sometimes oppressed women, too.Then came three crucial developments: Ayan\u2019s mother hired a Quran teacher for her brood, who held radical views; Ayan discovered an organization called Islam Net, which she joined for the religiosity as much as for the cute boys; and she and her friends met a group of charismatic thugs who longed for jihad abroad. Seierstad portrays Islam Net, inspired by Saudi Salafism, as the crucial catalyst for the girls\u2019 initial radicalization; its leaders demand that Ayan devote more time to its activities, prying her from the grasp of her advanced Norwegian high school. The group preaches peace to non-Muslims they hope to convert, but the first Islam Net gathering in Norway is devoted to a discussion of how the American government and the Jews planned the Sept. 11 attacks.Sept. 11, and the subsequent embrace of \u201cus vs. them\u201d rhetoric by the United States, come up often in \u201cTwo Sisters.\u201d Muslims in Norway feel threatened by the anti-Islamic rhetoric of the war on terror, lumped together into one inherently suspect group. Teenagers \u201cstuffed all their setbacks and growing pains in the same bag: It\u2019s because I\u2019m a Muslim,\u201d Seierstad writes. Then came the war in Syria, an opportunity for self-definition: \u201cWhy be a second-class Norwegian when you can be a first-class Muslim?\u201d Muslims, Ayan and Leila agreed, \u201cneeded some form of defense.\u201dSuzy Hansen\u2019s \u201cNotes on a Foreign Country: An American Abroad in a Post-American World\u201d was a finalist for a 2018 Pulitzer Prize.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Is Winning", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistFor those of us who feared disaster from this presidency but saw the first year as a period when Trump was relatively constrained, his \u201cI\u2019m in charge here!\u201d pivot was a worrying phenomenon. But it\u2019s the nature of the Trump era to confound all expectations, so naturally what followed the Cohn-Tillerson-McMaster exits and the tariff announcements and the stock market wobbles was \u2026 the most politically successful six weeks of Trump\u2019s presidency to date.Now \u201csuccessful\u201d is a relative term: Our president is still deeply unpopular, still under investigation and embroiled in scandal, still unable to push a substantial agenda through the Congress, still likely to see his party lose the House of the Representatives in November.This improvement might be surprising if you just follow the drumbeat of scandal coverage in the press, which has arguably only gotten stronger as Trump\u2019s lawyer has fallen under investigation and the Stormy Daniels business has gone from a sideshow to a main attraction.But while the pace of scandalous news hasn\u2019t slackened, the nature of that news has changed: A scandal that began with the promise of republic-shaking revelations about presidential treason is increasingly dominated by sex and lies and possible campaign-finance violations \u2014 in other words, Clinton-in-the-1990s territory, rather than the Manchurian Candidate scenario.Especially since Trump now enjoys an economy whose unemployment rate has fallen to late-1990s territory. In this climate, the president isn\u2019t likely to win a trade war but he can afford to fight a little one, and like Clinton in 1998 he can expect a little more forgiveness from voters for his sleaze.Without handing out the Nobel Peace Prizes ridiculously prematurely (of course the Nobel committee would never do that \u2026), it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s North Korean strategy has not prevented diplomatic efforts from advancing, or put us on some irreversible march to war. This makes northeast Asia the latest theater to defy, for now, the fears of sudden destabilization that drove so much reasonable foreign-policy anxiety about this president.But if the economy and foreign policy have boosted the president\u2019s fortunes, the most important boost may be coming from inside his own party, in the form of the totally nonexistent agenda that congressional Republicans have put forward since the tax bill passed.That nonexistence is, of course, an indictment of the G.O.P., but politically it\u2019s vastly preferable to the deeply unpopular legislation that the Republicans might otherwise be pursuing, if they were to reattempt Obamacare repeal or pursue some other item from the zombie-Reaganite playbook.A core fact of our era is that the national Republican Party is politically effective only as a vehicle for anti-liberalism, a rallying point for all the disparate groups who feel threatened by having our cultural elite in full control of government. Which means the G.O.P. is often more popular the less it attempts to legislate at all.If Trump has consistently missed opportunities to be the post-Reaganite policy maker that his party needs, he is now at least benefiting politically from exactly that inaction. And if Mueller and Kim and the economy cooperate, he could keep winning, within limits, for a while.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Running Uphill: The Challenge of Unseating Dianne Feinstein", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOXNARD, Calif. \u2014 Kevin de Le\u00f3n is one of the most prominent Democratic figures in the nation\u2019s most Democratic state. He has drawn national attention from the Democratic left for a spirited challenge to Senator Dianne Feinstein and for the aggressive legislative challenges to President Trump\u2019s policies advanced by the State Senate under his leadership.But these days, Mr. de Le\u00f3n is struggling for a toehold as he tries to negotiate the fraught and complicated terrain of trying to topple someone widely seen as a California institution. At 84, Ms. Feinstein is a five-term senator who began her political career as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969, when Mr. de Le\u00f3n was just 3 years old.Mr. de Le\u00f3n, 51, represents what many party members see as one of the leading faces of the next generation of California Democratic leadership amid calls for Ms. Feinstein to step aside to make room for the next class of leaders.But Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s struggles suggest that this moment of transition remains a work in progress. He would seem to have the right political makeup to lead the party to its next chapter. He is more liberal than Ms. Feinstein at a time when the left is on the rise. He is Latino in a state where the power of Latino voters continues to grow. And he is coming off almost four years as president of the Senate, giving him a platform to present himself as one of the state\u2019s most aggressive leaders in opposing Mr. Trump.Yet he is running against a powerful remnant of California\u2019s old guard who enjoys strong historical, cultural and sentimental ties to many Democrats who have followed Ms. Feinstein\u2019s career over the decades. Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s run is exposing the challenges for a candidate who at any other time \u2014 or against another opponent \u2014 would seem to be a potentially powerful competitor.Mr. de Le\u00f3n is not, for the most part, facing questions on his record; rather, in the view of many of Ms. Feinstein\u2019s supporters, she is a highly successful senator and foil to Mr. Trump, especially on national security issues, and there is simply no reason for her to go.\u201cI am not delusional,\u201d he said over an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl at a diner in San Diego. \u201cListen, I am not na\u00efve to the fact that people are not shouting my name all over the state of California. What we\u2019ve identified is after 25 years of unchallenged incumbency, people in California want a change. And a new voice representing them. I want to be that voice.\u201dBut, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a tough race.\u201dSo it was that Mr. de Le\u00f3n could be found one recent Saturday driving himself around in his blue Chevy Volt from rally to picnic, singing along to Morrissey on the radio, in a one-car campaign caravan that took him from downtown Los Angeles to Thousand Oaks to Oxnard.Mr. de Le\u00f3n has earned applause from some Democrats for leading the Senate as it challenged Mr. Trump.He has hammered Ms. Feinstein for showing a willingness to work with Mr. Trump and he has taken positions on issues \u2014 military intervention, health care, tax cuts, among them \u2014 that stand in contrast to the more moderate and measured senator.More pointedly, he made a point of contrasting his background with Ms. Feinstein, portraying her as the wealthy doyenne of San Francisco Democratic politics and himself as the working-class son of a San Diego barrio seeking to become this state\u2019s first Latino senator. Mr. de Le\u00f3n recently took a reporter on a tour of Logan Heights, the San Diego neighborhood where he grew up, and lingered at a single-room apartment where he shared a bed with his single mother who worked as a housekeeper. The tour was memorialized by an aide for a Facebook Live feed.\u201cI try to deal with the poverty gap \u2014 to do policies for all of us, rather than only for the wealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cShe votes for two wars without a way to finance the wars, votes for a Republican tax cut that as a billionaire, she benefits greatly from. That is a gross abuse of power.\u201dIt is a measure of Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s standing in the polls \u2014 and the fact that as of now, at least, he is not viewed as a real threat to the senator \u2014 that Ms. Feinstein has while campaigning avoided engaging Mr. de Le\u00f3n.Her campaign manager, Jeff Millman, defended her performance. \u201cRather than responding to political cheap shots, Senator Feinstein is responding to the everyday needs of Californians by opposing Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy, his attempts to repeal Obamacare and his attacks on Dreamers,\u201d he said.There is clearly an audience who share Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s view that it is time for Ms. Feinstein to step aside.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to push someone not to run,\u201d Ryan Skolnick, 25, a speech coach from Simi Valley, told Mr. de Le\u00f3n as he moved through a crowd of supporters at a restaurant in Oxnard.R. L. Miller, the chairwoman of the environmental caucus of the California Democratic Party, nodded vigorously when asked if she thought Ms. Feinstein should retire. \u201cOh my gosh \u2014 where do I start?\u201d she said. \u201cWe can upgrade. She\u2019s reliable. But he has the heart of an activist \u2014 she does not.\u201dGraciela Soliz Ventura, 68, a retired schoolteacher, said that she had long been a \u201cbig supporter\u201d of Ms. Feinstein, but that the senator\u2019s time had passed.\u201cShe\u2019s not listening to California and our values,\u201d she said. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201dStill, Ms. Feinstein is widely respected, if not necessarily revered, which complicates Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s task. In interviews, he repeatedly said he is not suggesting she is too old to return to Washington, but rather that she is ideologically out of step.It is not an easy case to make.\u201cYou are disrupting the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are challenging the establishment authority that has been out of touch with California voters. Times have changed.\u201dMr. de Le\u00f3n suggests that Ms. Feinstein is treated deferentially, by the press and the public, because of her stature. \u201cShe gets passes,\u201d he said. \u201cShe constantly gets passes.\u201dMr. de Le\u00f3n said he decided to challenge Ms. Feinstein after she called for \u201cpatience\u201d with Mr. Trump.\u201cAs Democrats we will never be fooled into believing that if we are patient enough, that Donald Trump could be a good president,\u201d he said to applause from a group of voters ambling under the sun on a patio at a Mexican restaurant in Oxnard. \u201cThis is not a time to be polite or patient.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified R.L. Miller of the environmental caucus of the California Democratic Party. Ms. Miller is a woman, not a man. An earlier version also misstated Kevin de Le\u00f3n\u2019s age at the time Dianne Feinstein was entering politics. He would have been 3, not 4.

{"Headline": "Trump Wields Pardon Pen to Confront Justice System", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For more than a year, President Trump has struggled to control the United States\u2019 law enforcement apparatus, frustrated that it remains at least partly out of his grasp. But he is increasingly turning to a tool that allows him to push back against a justice system he calls unfair.In a burst of action and words, Mr. Trump demonstrated Thursday that, in some instances, he still has the last word. He pardoned Dinesh D\u2019Souza, a conservative commentator convicted of campaign finance violations, and he said he may extend clemency to former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois and Martha Stewart, the lifestyle mogul.The president\u2019s intervention in those cases came as he rails against Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department and the F.B.I. over various investigations into his campaign, his personal lawyer and his own actions that may have been aimed at obstructing the inquiry of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. Last week, he effectively ordered the Justice Department to investigate his investigators and reveal confidential information about the case to Republican allies in Congress.Senator Mark R. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was one of many critics who saw Thursday\u2019s pardon and the dangling of other clemency actions as a strategy to ensure loyalty within the president\u2019s own circle.All three cases have connections, if sometimes distant, to Mr. Trump, either through his political allies or his time in the private sector. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who accompanied Mr. Trump during a trip to Houston and Dallas on Thursday, pushed for the pardon for Mr. D\u2019Souza. Mr. Blagojevich appeared on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s reality show, while Ms. Stewart hosted an \u201cApprentice\u201d spinoff.Advisers and analysts said Mr. Trump seems delighted by his pardon power. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of Trump telegraphing that he\u2019s in control of everything, including D.O.J.,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, a Trump family biographer. \u201cBut there\u2019s something about the almost capricious nature of this list that seems to me to suggest it\u2019s like a little kid\u2019s version of being in charge \u2014 I can do whatever I want and nobody can stop me.\u201dBut such pardons were only some of those issued. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a time when this was the only thing the president was doing, and he was doing these kind of special deals without any evident recognition that there was an actual program of pardoning that was open to ordinary Americans that really need relief,\u201d said Margaret Colgate Love, the Justice Department pardon attorney for Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton.The president said he did not know Mr. D\u2019Souza but called him Wednesday night to tell him he would pardon him. \u201cNobody asked me to do it,\u201d Mr. Trump said.In a statement on Thursday, the former governor\u2019s lawyer, Leonard Goodman, likewise made an argument meant to appeal to Mr. Trump, noting that prosecutors \u201cused a cooperating informant to get a wiretap to record all of his conversations.\u201dDuring his conversation with reporters on Thursday, Mr. Trump mentioned Ms. Stewart, as well, but more in passing. \u201cShe used to be my biggest fan in the world\u201d back \u201cbefore I became a politician,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s O.K., I don\u2019t view it that way.\u201dIn his recent book, \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d Mr. Comey devoted an entire chapter to the case against Ms. Stewart. He wrote that he hesitated to charge her for fear of being attacked for making a \u201cmountain out of a molehill,\u201d but concluded that she had to be prosecuted \u201cto protect the institution of justice, and reinforce a culture of truth-telling.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from Houston, and Eileen Sullivan and Michael D.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Can investors now strike a trade war from their list of worries?\u2022 G.E. announced a big deal for a transportation unit.\u2022 Our take on the new Theranos book.\u2022 Banks are using military tricks to fight cybercrime.The conglomerate has agreed to combine its transportation business to Wabtec in a tax-free transaction, valued at about $11.1 billion.The deal is the first move to shed an entire business since John Flannery became C.E.O. in August, and it likely presages more. Mr. Flannery said last fall that he wanted to sell off $20 billion in assets.Since the end of the financial crisis, G.E. has sold roughly $200 billion of assets. The company has moved to exit its finance arm, sold NBCUniversal and divested its appliance business that most people associated with G.E.Here\u2019s a timeline of some of G.E.\u2019s biggest transactions since the financial crisis.Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund lost when it took on Samsung three years ago. But the activist investor has claimed victory in its latest battle with a South Korean conglomerate, or chaebol.Here\u2019s how the hedge fund prevailed.The contextElliott said that the restructuring plan showed management \u201chas failed to act in the best interest of the companies and their respective shareholders.\u201d It instead proposed turning Hyundai Motor into a holding company that it said was more tax efficient and sustainable.Why Elliott could win this timeIn a presentation earlier this year, the hedge fund noted that Hyundai\u2019s proposed transaction was similar to what Samsung wanted to do in 2015, where the company sold an affiliate to the chaebol\u2019s holding company. There, Samsung was able to rally individual investors, who accounted for nearly a third of its shareholder base, to its cause.By contrast, retail investors comprise some 5 percent of Hyundai\u2019s shareholder base. Big international institutions, which make up the bulk of Hyundai\u2019s investors, are likely to be more immune to the entreaties of companies under attack from an activist if the campaign makes sense financially.\u2014 Michael de la MercedStock markets are up so far this month, suggesting in part that investors were betting that tensions between the United States and its largest trading partners would ease.That seemed to occur this weekend. The United States and China issued a joint statement on trade and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said planned tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods were on hold. China did not seem to commit to much that is concrete to gain a reprieve from the tariffs, a notable achievement for the country\u2019s negotiators.The joint statement said China would significantly increase its imports from the United States, but it did not say how much more it would buy and over what time period. The parts of the statement about investing in each other\u2019s country and protecting intellectual property were even vaguer.President Trump on Monday nevertheless promoted the statement as a win. But influential members of his administration who are still spoiling for a big trade fight will no doubt want to keep up the pressure on China \u2014 and Mr. Trump may at times share their desire in the coming months. Still, the events of recent weeks show that the United States was largely isolated in its trade fights and the Trump administration may have lacked the resolve or unity to keep up its hard-edged approach. The Trump administration can, of course,reintroduce the threat of tariffs if it believes China is failing to make concessions in the proceeding trade talks. But after stepping back this weekend, it will be harder for the Trump administration to make an aggressive stance appear credible.Indeed, the big question hanging over the Trump administration: Why did it withdraw its tariff threat now, before exacting hard, quantifiable concessions from China? One reason may be that the United States needs China\u2019s help in dealing with North Korea ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s summit with Kim Jong Un planned for June. Another reason may be that China was up for a long fight with the United States and signaled so. Whatever the cause, the takeaway for investors is that the Trump administration passed up an opportunity to show China that it meant what it said.Still, investors may not want to relax too much. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity has been rising even as he made combative moves on the trade front that at times roiled the market. In other words, there does not appear to be much political risk domestically, if any, to taking on China, and so Mr. Trump may use belligerent trade talk to stir up his base ahead of the midterm elections in November.But as long as he steps back from taking tough actions, investors will most likely take his rhetoric in stride. That stance has served them well. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is now up from where it was in mid-February when the Trump administration outlined its case for steel and aluminum tariffs.- Peter EavisAnalysts over at Goldman Sachs are out with a report on Monday looking at the holdings of 848 hedge funds with a combined $2.3 trillion in stock market bets.Here are some takeaways:Individual stocks\u2022 Hedge funds added bets on Facebook more than any other stock during the first quarter, followed by Microsoft, Aetna and Monsanto.\u2022 Amazon had the biggest reduction in wagers on it, followed by Apple, McDonald\u2019s and Citigroup.Sectors\u2022Tech remained the biggest holding among hedge funds but their holdings overall decreased during the first quarter.\u2022 Hedge funds boosted their bets on the energy sector.\u2022 They remain the most bullish on shares of consumer discretionary companies.\u2022 The hedge funds cut their exposure to financial stocks.The vote was 5 to 4, with the court\u2019s more conservative justices in the majority. The court\u2019s decision on the matter could affect some 25 million employment contracts.She tweeted:Steven Mnuchin said this weekend, \u201cWe\u2019re putting the trade war on hold.\u201d S.&P. 500 futures were up on the news. But the pressure is on the Trump administration to back up its tough talk on China \u2014 a task that may be more difficult without the leverage of potential tariffs.The fight inside the White House is still real. Free-trade supporters like Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, are still slinging arrows at hard-liners like the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro. (While Mr. Mnuchin said the tariffs were \u201con hold,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said they were still possible.)The two sides have agreed on a \u201cframework\u201d under which China would increase its purchases of American goods, while putting in place \u201cstructural\u201d changes to protect American technology and to make it easier for American companies to compete in China.G.E. was advised by Morgan Stanley and Dyal Company, the boutique investment bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs deal maker Gordon Dyal, as well as the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.

I\u2019m sure there are more improvements you can think of, so send \u2019em in.Have a good weekend.A: Well, first: like silk or pretty much any fabric, not all viscoses are created equal \u2014 which makes sense when you realize the official name for viscose is viscose rayon, and it is one of the oldest man-made fibers, first patented in 1884 by Hilaire de Bernigaut. Just because it is man-made, however, does not mean it is synthetic (though it\u2019s not exactly all-natural either): viscose is made from wood pulp that has been chemically treated. Its name comes from a viscous \u2014 get it? \u2014 solution used during the process. The end product can have, as you point out, the feel of silk, though it can also mimic cotton and velvet. And just because it is man-made also does not mean it equates to cheap \u2014 especially if a designer is involved, when what you are paying for is in part the creativity and brand attached to the garment. So toss that idea in the scrap pile.So there you go. From his email to your closet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medical Mystery: Something Happened to U.S. Health Spending After 1980", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe New Health CareThe spending began soaring beyond that of other advanced nations, but without the same benefits in life expectancy. What happened? Health spending and life expectancy are not necessarily closely related, so it\u2019s helpful to consider them separately. \u201cConfronted with fiscal pressures, as the share of G.D.P. absorbed by health care spending began to get serious, other nations had mechanisms to hold down spending,\u201d said Henry Aaron, a health economist with the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe didn\u2019t.\u201dBut none of this explains the timing of the spending divergence. Why did it start around 1980?Mr. Starr suggests that the high inflation of the late 1970s contributed to growth in health care spending, which other countries had more systems in place to control. Likewise, Mr. Cutler points to related economic events before 1980 as contributing factors. The oil price shocks of the 1970s hurt economic growth, straining countries\u2019 ability to afford health care. \u201cThus, all across the world, one sees constraints on payment, technology, etc., in the 1970s and 1980s,\u201d he said. The United States is not different in kind, only degree; our constraints were weaker. These are all highly valuable, but they came at very high prices. This willingness to pay more has in turn made the United States an attractive market for innovation in health care.Yet being an engine for innovation doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into better outcomes. Almost no matter how it\u2019s measured, longevity in the United States has not kept pace with that of other nations. Again, the inflection point is around 1980. Why?The lack of universal health coverage and less safety net support for low-income populations could have something to do with it, Ms. Glied speculated. \u201cThe most efficient way to improve population health is to focus on those at the bottom,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t do as much for them as other countries.\u201d Slow income growth could also play a role because poorer health is associated with lower incomes. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that, apart from the richest of Americans, income growth stagnated starting in the late 1970s,\u201d Mr. Cutler said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "SoftBank Fund Puts $2.25 Billion in G.M.\u2019s Driverless Unit", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySelf-driving cars have increasingly figured in visions of the automotive future, and a big new investment is the latest signal that such a moment is close at hand.On Thursday, a fund affiliated with SoftBank Group of Japan said it planned to invest $2.25 billion in the driverless-technology division of General Motors to help the automaker ramp up a ride-hailing service in select cities.The deal\u2019s magnitude reflects the growing confidence that commercial use of autonomous cars is in sight \u2014 despite recent setbacks to some other companies, including at least two fatal accidents, that have raised questions about the technology\u2019s safety.\u201cThis is a new source of capital to scale this business,\u201d Dan Ammann, G.M.\u2019s president, said in a conference call. \u201cWe think this fully funds our plan.\u201dAs part of the deal, G.M. said it would put an additional $1.1 billion of its own money into the unit, which is known as G.M. Cruise Holdings and is based in San Francisco. SoftBank\u2019s investment will be made through its Vision Fund, which focuses on the technology sector.Investors offered the move a vote of confidence, sending G.M.\u2019s shares up almost 13 percent on Thursday.In both Detroit and Silicon Valley, as well as overseas, the rush to build a foundation for autonomous-driving technology is gathering momentum. Waymo, the driverless-technology company spun out of Google, said Thursday that it had agreed to purchase as many as 62,000 minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for a ride-hailing service that will start operating commercially in Phoenix by the end of this year.Waymo previously agreed to buy up to 20,000 compact cars from Jaguar Land Rover, starting in 2019, giving it a potential fleet of more than 80,000 driverless vehicles within three or four years.\u201cThe volumes they are committing to is a clear signal these companies think they\u2019ve got it, that their technology is very close to commercial ready,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who tracks autonomous technology.The determination of G.M. and Waymo to offer ride services within months also suggests a conviction that businesses that use driverless cars to ferry ordinary people from place to place will spread rapidly and \u2014 absent the cost of a driver \u2014 yield hefty profits.At the same time, Mr. Ramsey noted, \u201cit\u2019s a completely unproven business model,\u201d with costly technology that is bound to have growing pains. The first vehicles will probably be programmed to be so cautious in traffic that crosstown trips may initially take much longer than people are used to, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t think safety will be the concern for most people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time it takes to get to your destination could be a turnoff, though.\u201dLike G.M., Ford is racing to put self-driving cars into ride and delivery fleets, but it has a longer timeline and is hoping to have its car in production by 2021.G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the SoftBank investment validated the direction that G.M. and its Cruise division were taking. The investment gives SoftBank a 19.6 percent stake in G.M. Cruise and values the unit at more than $11 billion. That\u2019s well above the $1 billion that G.M. paid two years ago to acquire Cruise as a start-up company.\u201cThere\u2019s no other company in the world that has the technology chops and the experience to lead the industry on this front,\u201d said Michael Ronen, managing partner of SoftBank\u2019s investment arm, SoftBank Investment Advisers.The investment highlights the ambition and seemingly bottomless wallet of SoftBank\u2019s founder, Masayoshi Son. It was Mr. Son who came up with the idea of raising nearly $100 billion from investors ranging from Saudi Arabia to Apple for the Vision Fund, which is now one of the world\u2019s biggest and boldest investors in tech companies.In a reflection of Mr. Son\u2019s personality, SoftBank and the Vision Fund have become known for moving quickly to invest in companies with products seen as crucial to the future of technology. They have been willing to pour large sums into early start-ups at enormous valuations, crowding out other potential investors.Ride-hailing has been a major focus for SoftBank, with investments in Uber, Didi Chuxing of China, Ola of India, Grab of Singapore and 99 of Brazil.At the time, the company said its vehicle, the Cruise AV, could be produced on a standard assembly line once approval was granted by the federal government and states where the cars would operate. Likely spots for initial operations are San Francisco and Scottsdale, Ariz., where Cruise is already conducting tests.Waymo, on the other hand, does not intend to make cars but instead will rely on partners to produce vehicles that it will outfit with sensors, radar and other technology.A unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, it has been working on self-driving technology for nearly a decade, and is focusing on four potential lines of business. In addition to the ride service it intends to start, the company expects to put its autonomous-driving technology into trucks and delivery vehicles, and aims to license its technology to automakers like Fiat Chrysler. It sees a potential fourth business line in driverless shuttles that can ferry riders to mass transit systems.The company expects to begin buying Pacifica minivans for its ride service later this year. They will be produced at a Fiat Chrysler plant in Windsor, Ontario, and equipped with self-driving technology at a Waymo technical center in Novi, Mich.Waymo gave no details on how many minivans it expects to buy this year or next, the value of the deal, or the period covered by the purchase agreement.The companies said Thursday that they were in talks about licensing Waymo technology to Fiat Chrysler so the carmaker can at some point sell self-driving vehicles to consumers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rajoy Government in Spain Is Threatened by Verdicts in Corruption Case", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of a corruption scandal five years ago, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain denied his party had operated a slush fund, shortly after his former treasurer was found to have hidden millions in Swiss banks.Now, however, the issue of corruption in Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party has returned with a vengeance to the top of Spain\u2019s political agenda, threatening the survival of his minority conservative government.The judges sentenced 28 other businessmen and politicians, who received more than 300 years in combined prison sentences, and they ordered Mr. Rajoy\u2019s party to pay a fine of \u20ac245,000, making it the first Spanish political force to be convicted of operating a slush fund.A no-confidence vote against the prime minister is not yet a certainty, and will require the backing of other parties. But on Friday, the other parties critical to whether the motion will be scheduled in coming days indicated their support.They included the far-left Podemos party, which leaves Mr. Rajoy\u2019s fate essentially in the hands of the Ciudadanos party, which has supported him since late 2016.On Friday, Ciudadanos told Mr. Rajoy to either call a snap national election or expect Ciudadanos to join the no-confidence motion against him.\u201cFor a decade, the response of the Popular Party to corruption has been denial, overlooking it, trying to cover the scandal \u2014 instead of admitting the deep nature of the problem and starting a renewal of both the names and structures of the party,\u201d said V\u00edctor Lapuente, a Spanish associate professor at the Quality of Government Institute of the University of Gothenburg.In the short term, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s strategy worked, Mr. Lapuente said, but \u201caccumulatively, this rejection of the problem has boosted the chances of its main political competitor, and now, for the first time, hard-core right-leaning voters have an alternative in Ciudadanos.\u201dCiudadanos has been gaining recently in the polls in part because of its hard-line opposition to Catalonia\u2019s independence movement. The conundrum for Ciudadanos is how to balance its commitment to uprooting corruption with its pledge to safeguard Spain\u2019s political stability at a time when the government in Madrid continues to face a secessionist challenge.\u201cThe corruption of the PP has ended and asphyxiated this legislature,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Manuel Villegas, the secretary general of Ciudadanos, told reporters on Friday morning. \u201cMr. Rajoy cannot hide behind inaction and ineffectiveness.\u201dMr. Rajoy admitted that the court ruling and other recent corruption scandals had damaged his party, but not to the point of threatening his government\u2019s survival.\u201cThese are cases dating back many years,\u201d Mr. Rajoy told Cope, a radio station, on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the PP is a lot more than 10 or 15 isolated cases.\u201dThe corruption headache comes days after Mr. Rajoy won some reprieve from Basque nationalist lawmakers, who used their pivotal votes to back his government\u2019s next budget despite an earlier pledge to withhold support until Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government ended the direct rule it imposed on Catalonia after the region tried to secede last year.Mr. Rajoy is not obliged to call another national election until late 2020, after surviving two inconclusive elections to start a second mandate in 2016, with the support of Ciudadanos.Even with Ciudadanos joining the call to remove Mr. Rajoy, a no-confidence vote in Parliament also requires opposition parties to first agree on an alternative government leader, which significantly reduces its chances of success, according to Antonio Barroso, a political analyst at the consulting firm Teneo Intelligence in London.\u201cOpposition parties will likely engage in a blame game regarding the failed motion rather than effectively coordinate to get rid of Rajoy,\u201d Mr. Barroso forecast in a note on Friday.Thursday\u2019s court ruling followed not only the most prominent but also one of the longest corruption investigations in Spain, started in 2009 by the investigative judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n.The inquiry focused on public contracts signed between regional conservative politicians and a group of businessmen led by Francisco Correa during Spain\u2019s construction boom.The investigation was code-named G\u00fcrtel, the German translation of Mr. Correa\u2019s name (which means belt). It eventually snowballed and split into several different cases, including some centered on Mr. Rajoy\u2019s national party and its links to the hidden Swiss money of Mr. B\u00e1rcenas.Mr. Correa received the highest sentence on Thursday: 51 years in prison. Among the other people condemned was Ana Mato, a former health minister in Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government.Ms. Mato was ordered to reimburse 27,800 euros for gifts and family trips paid for by one of the companies at the heart of the kickback scheme, while her former husband and fellow politician, Jes\u00fas Sep\u00falveda, was sentenced to 14 years in prison.In 2013, Mr. Rajoy initially sought to distance his party from the dealings of Mr. B\u00e1rcenas, until a series of embarrassing text messages between the men were leaked to the Spanish news media.\u201cLuis, we are doing what we can,\u201d Mr. Rajoy texted to Mr. B\u00e1rcenas, shortly after the scandal broke. \u201cLuis, be strong.\u201dIn Thursday\u2019s ruling, the court said not only that such a fund existed, but also that Mr. Rajoy\u2019s testimony \u201cshould be questioned.\u201dEven if Mr. Rajoy survives the current no-confidence challenge, Spain\u2019s judiciary is still slowly sifting through several other cases related to his party. This week, Eduardo Zaplana, a former conservative minister, was detained by the police in Valencia, as part of a separate corruption and money-laundering investigation.Mr. Rajoy should brace himself for \u201cmore judicial nightmares for the Popular Party in the next few months,\u201d Mr. Lapuente, the politics professor, said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The $19 Billion Question: Will Cuomo Support the Subway Plan?", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the new leader of the New York City subway presented his ambitious plan to save the system on Wednesday, he was working to win over several audiences: subway riders who are fed up with service; transit agency board members who must approve any proposal; and elected leaders who must pay for it.But most of all, Andy Byford, had to impress Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the man who controls the transit system and will be most responsible for securing money for the multibillion dollar plan.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s response left many wondering: Why did the governor bring on a transit chief to overhaul the subway if he was not going to support his plan meant to do exactly that?\u201cI certainly wasn\u2019t expecting people to just overnight say, \u2018Yeah, we love it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Byford told reporters on Thursday after a speech to promote the plan. \u201cBut the good news is the debate is underway, the plan is being written, it\u2019s out there, so I look forward now to working with anyone \u2014 all stakeholders \u2014 to now get this thing funded.\u201dStill, it is difficult to imagine that Mr. Byford\u2019s proposal would have much of a life without the governor\u2019s buy-in, leaving some transit advocates suggesting that this could become a critical test for the subway chief.\u201cIf Byford put in the work to produce the plan, but the response from the governor is, \u2018I\u2019m going to hang you out to dry, and I\u2019m going to pretend to be fiscally responsible in the face of a high price tag,\u2019 then I think Byford should call his bluff and walk away,\u201d said Benjamin Kabak, a transit advocate who runs a popular website about the subway.Asked whether he might leave the job, Mr. Byford told reporters: \u201cI love this job. And the reason I\u2019ve written this plan is I want to execute this plan. So I\u2019m itching to get on with it.\u201dLater Thursday, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office released a new statement in response to questions about whether the governor supported Mr. Byford and his plan. Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, offered support for Mr. Byford \u2014 and a list of other top executives at the authority. \u201cThe governor looks forward to reviewing the report and supporting the M.T.A.\u2019s new management team in their effort to overhaul and modernize NYC Transit and bring relief to riders,\u201d she said. \u201cAndy Byford, Joe Lhota, Pat Foye, Ronnie Hakim, Phil Eng and Janno Lieber are changing the M.T.A. and that\u2019s why they\u2019re there.\u201dTechnically, Mr. Byford was hired by leaders at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state-controlled agency that oversees the subway. But Mr. Cuomo, who has taken a close role in setting the agency\u2019s priorities, interviewed Mr. Byford in person and essentially signed off on him.In the past, Mr. Cuomo has praised Mr. Byford in public, though Mr. Cuomo has also pressed him to focus on a new signal technology that has not been used on any major transit system. Mr. Byford\u2019s plan relies on a proven technology that has already been thoroughly tested in New York.The authority\u2019s chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, says Mr. Cuomo is simply trying to keep pressure on the agency to become more efficient. Mr. Lhota views his role as helping to protect Mr. Byford from the difficult politics surrounding the agency so that Mr. Byford can focus on running the system.But the plan\u2019s release was quickly overshadowed by political squabbling between Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, and criticism from the actress Cynthia Nixon, who is running for governor in the Democratic primary.On Thursday, Ms. Nixon said Mr. Byford\u2019s plan is exactly what the subway needed. \u201cThe question is, will the governor listen to the study that he himself has ordered?\u201d Ms. Nixon said.A day earlier, Mr. Cuomo had told reporters the plan could not succeed without Mr. de Blasio pitching in some cash. Mr. de Blasio said that fixing the subway was Mr. Cuomo\u2019s problem because he ran it. An M.T.A. spokesman hit back, saying the city owned the subway and the mayor\u2019s unwillingness to help pay for the plan had made it \u201cdead on arrival.\u201dEric Phillips, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, then responded with a searing statement: \u201cNew York City contributes billions of dollars to subways the governor and M.T.A. mismanage. We wish the governor was less obsessed with the mayor bailing him out and more obsessed with doing his job to fix the subways.\u201dOn Thursday, Scott Rechler, chairman of the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group, joked that Mr. Byford was Superman and his kryptonite was politics. \u201cWe need to protect Andy from kryptonite poisoning him,\u201d Mr. Rechler said.Mr. Cuomo is critical to the plan\u2019s fate because most of its financing would likely have to come from Albany, where Mr. Cuomo controls the agenda. Several new funding sources have been discussed, from congestion pricing \u2014 which would toll drivers entering Manhattan \u2014 to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s idea for a tax on millionaires, and either would require the approval of state lawmakers.But there is little doubt that New York City would have to kick in some money as well. The authority\u2019s roughly $800 million short-term rescue plan ended up being split by the state and the city, but only after months of mudslinging between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio.Even if Mr. Cuomo did not give a ringing endorsement for Mr. Byford\u2019s plan, his representatives on the M.T.A. board weighed in after Mr. Byford\u2019s presentation. Mr. Rechler, a real estate executive and major donor to Mr. Cuomo, endorsed the plan.\u201cWe need to find the money to get it done, and we need to provide you with the political cover and the resources to make it a reality,\u201d Mr. Rechler said.\u201cOur focus should not be on money right now,\u201d he said. \u201cOur focus should be on restoring the trust and confidence in the system that people rely on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Awash in Radioactive Waste", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Pearce\u00a0is an environmental reporter and author.On its 60th anniversary, the civilian age of nuclear power in America appears to be almost over. But with the country awash in radioactive waste and plutonium stockpiled for warheads, the task of managing this atomic legacy grows ever more urgent. Opening a long-delayed waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada is imperative.America is still the world\u2019s leading generator of nuclear power. But economics, more even than environmental concerns, is consigning nuclear power in its present form to history\u2019s technological trash can. With well over a third of the country\u2019s power reactors over 40 years old, the questions now are how long the accountants will allow them to keep going and what we will do with these power plants and the radioactive waste they produced.Far away in the nation\u2019s capital, some lawmakers question throwing more billions into the money sink at Hanford. But this outlay will be just the start of what needs to be a national effort to clean up the nation\u2019s power plants that could eventually cost a half-trillion dollars or more.The Maine Yankee plant in Wiscasset, Me., provides an example of how far behind we are. The plant shut in 1996. The residents of Wiscasset were promised the site would soon be cleaned up. But two decades later, 1,400 spent-fuel rods remain, stored in 60 steel canisters that are themselves encased in concrete, as well as 400 tons of casks containing radioactive steel from the reactor.These interim storage sites could be in business for many decades, since no community is eager to provide any of the nation\u2019s nastiest nuclear trash a permanent home.That is certainly true in Nevada. The federal government has long earmarked tunnels it has dug into Yucca Mountain \u2014 deep in a military reserve where the federal government once tested atomic bombs \u2014 for burials of the waste from Hanford and the nation\u2019s commercial reactor fleet. But senators have stonewalled, and in 2009 President Barack Obama canceled the $120 billion project without putting an alternative plan in place. In his 2019 budget request, President Trump asked for money to resume the program. But the Senate turned him down.America cannot put off forever the day when it gets a grip on this lethal legacy. Yucca is as safe as anywhere, and we owe it to future generations to get digging. On the issue of permanent storage, this may be one instance where President Trump\u2019s policy instincts are more farsighted than President Obama\u2019s.The United States\u2019 failure to establish a burial site for its most dangerous and long-lasting nuclear waste could have tragic consequences. \u201cNot in my backyard\u201d means that the waste is left in everyone\u2019s backyard. Unless put out of harm\u2019s way, plutonium is virtually a permanent radioactive threat, and a potential attraction for would-be nuclear terrorists or malevolent governments of the future.The age of generating nuclear power may be drawing to a close. But cleaning up its legacy has barely begun.Fred Pearce is an environmental reporter and author, most recently, of \u201cFallout: Disasters, Lies and the Legacy of the Nuclear Age.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Cash to Fight Income Inequality? California City Is First in U.S. to Try", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "Long plagued by poverty and desperation, Stockton, Calif., is testing universal basic income as a means of improving the lives of its residents.Supported bySTOCKTON, Calif. \u2014 This town in California\u2019s Central Valley has long functioned as a display case for wrenching troubles afflicting American life: The housing bust that turned Stockton into an epicenter of a national foreclosure disaster and plunged the city into bankruptcy. The homeless people clustered in tents along the railroad tracks. Boarded-up storefronts on cracked sidewalks. Gang violence.Now, Stockton hopes to make itself an exhibition ground for elevated fortunes through a simple yet unorthodox experiment. It is readying plans to deliver $500 a month in donated cash to perhaps 100 local families, no strings attached. The trial could start as soon as the fall and continue for about two years.As the first American city to test so-called universal basic income, Stockton will watch what happens next. So will governments and social scientists around the world as they explore how to share the bounty of capitalism more broadly at a time of rising economic inequality.Will single mothers use their cash to pay for child care so they can attend college? Will people confronting choices between buying school supplies or paying their electric bills gain a measure of security? Will families add healthier food to their diets?Basic income is a term that gets thrown around loosely, but the gist is that the government distributes cash universally. As the logic runs, if everyone gets money \u2014 rich and poor, the employed and the jobless \u2014 it removes the stigma of traditional welfare schemes while ensuring sustenance for all.That a city in California has made itself a venue for the idea seems no accident. The state has long tried fresh approaches to governance. Ahead of the state\u2019s political primaries in June, much of the conversation has centered on concerns about economic inequality.In various guises, the idea has captivated activists and intellectuals for centuries. In the 1500s, Thomas More\u2019s novel \u201cUtopia\u201d advanced the suggestion that thieves would be better deterred by public assistance than fear of a death sentence.In more modern times, Milton Friedman, darling of laissez-faire economics, embraced the idea of negative income taxes that put cash in the hands of the poorest people. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. advocated \u201cthe guaranteed income.\u201dDr. King\u2019s legacy has currency in Stockton, which is now led by a history-making mayor, Michael Tubbs. At 27, he is the youngest mayor of a sizable American city, and the first African-American to hold the job here.Mr. Tubbs grew up in South Stockton, where payday lenders and pawn shops exploit the desperation of working poor people. His father was in prison for gang-related crime. His mother worked in medical customer service and struggled to pay bills, relying on welfare and food stamps.His mother kept him inside, his nose in his school books, fearful of the pitfalls beyond the door.He recalls standing at the mailbox tearing open a college acceptance letter while police cars massed down the block, lights flashing, as a neighbor\u2019s son was arrested for dealing drugs.Many of the adults around him were juggling multiple jobs, yet still living under the tyranny of unpaid bills.\u201cPeople were working themselves to death,\u201d Mr. Tubbs said. \u201cNot working to live a good life, but working just to survive.\u201dHe enrolled at Stanford University. In his high school yearbook, friends scribbled congratulations for his having \u201cmade it from here.\u201dHe was an intern in President Barack Obama\u2019s White House. After graduating from college in 2012, he taught ethnic studies, government and society at a charter high school while serving on the Stockton City Council.On the same day that President Trump was elected, voters in this city of 300,000 people put Mr. Tubbs in charge.Forged as a supply hub during the Gold Rush of the 19th century, Stockton evolved into a center for migrant workers who toil in the fruit and vegetable farms of California\u2019s Central Valley.By the new millennium, it had become a bedroom community offering affordable homes for people who worked in unaffordable places like San Francisco and Silicon Valley, as far as two hours away.The crash in housing prices played out savagely here. The local unemployment rate reached 19 percent in early 2011. Stockton descended into bankruptcy.As Mr. Tubbs took office, nearly one in four local residents was officially poor. The median household income was about $46,000 \u2014 roughly one-fourth below the national level. Only 17 percent of adults 25 and older had graduated from college. People were perpetually vulnerable to mundane calamities like auto troubles that kept them from getting to work.\u201cPoverty is the biggest issue,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cEverything we deal with stems from that. There\u2019s so many people working incredibly hard, and if life happens, there\u2019s no bottom.\u201dOnce he took office, his staff recommended basic income as a potential means of attacking poverty, one that was starting to gain traction around the world.In contrast to government programs that stipulate how money must be spent, basic income is supposed to deliver regular payments without restrictions. It amounts to a bet that poor people know the most appropriate use for a dollar better than bureaucrats. Rather than filling out forms and waiting to see case workers, people can devote their effort to looking for work, gaining skills or spending time with their children.Still, as the traditional promise of work breaks down, unconventional ideas are emerging from the political margins to gain a serious airing.At a conference in San Francisco last spring, Mr. Tubbs was introduced to Natalie Foster, a co-founder of the Economic Security Project, an advocacy group formed to advance the concept of universal basic income. The project included Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder.Within the Silicon Valley crowd, basic income had become a fashionable idea for addressing collective angst over the social consequences of technology. The masters of innovation were becoming stupendously rich via creations poised to make working people poor, replacing human labor with robots. Basic income was posited as compensation.The Economic Security Project was keen to demonstrate another aspect of basic income \u2014 its potential to help communities facing problems in the here and now. It was shopping for a city that could serve as staging ground.\u201cIt\u2019s important that people see this as possible,\u201d Ms. Foster said. \u201cCities are laboratories of democracy.\u201dStockton was diverse, with more than 40 percent of its residents Hispanic, some 20 percent Asian, and 14 percent African-American. More than half of the working-age people in surrounding San Joaquin County earned the minimum wage. The city was in the hands of a social media-savvy mayor who could help spread the word.Ms. Foster\u2019s group agreed to deliver $1 million for a new project \u2014 SEED, for Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration.The sum was nowhere near enough to finance universal anything. It would not cover the basics of any critical need.Still, it could produce a glimpse of what a guaranteed cash program might look like.The city commissioned artists to paint murals in the center of town, celebrating basic income as the next phase of the civil rights struggle advanced by Dr. King.As city leaders formulate the details of the project, they are wrestling with a foundational question: Are they running a legitimate social science experiment, or engineering a demonstration of basic income\u2019s virtues?The answer directs how they distribute the cash.If it is primarily a display, then only the most responsible people should be given cash. But if it is about science, the money must be dispensed more randomly, with the likelihood that some people will waste it on drugs.At a meeting at City Hall, the SEED project manager Lori Ospina urged that the program be designed to yield valid scientific data. That involves choosing participants on the basis of narrow demographic criteria \u2014 perhaps their age, their race, their income.But that approach could expose the city to charges that the program is not inclusive enough. \u201cThe trolls I\u2019ve been dealing with on social media and in real life have very racialized views of how this is going to work,\u201d Mr. Tubbs said. \u201cAs the first black mayor of this city, it would be very dangerous if the only people to get this were black.\u201dHe wants to select participants who are most likely to spend their money wisely, generating stories of working poor people lifted by extra cash.People like Shay Holliman.As a child, her mother was incarcerated. She was raised by her grandmother, along with nine other children. They crammed into apartments full of cockroaches, moving from state to state to stay ahead of the bill collectors.She had a baby. She worked at McDonald\u2019s, but she lacked reliable child care, making the job impossible. She could not pay rent on her $600 a month welfare check.One night, she found herself walking the Stockton streets, her infant daughter in a carrier against her chest, pulling two suitcases full of everything she owned.Taking shelter with a sister consumed by drug addiction, she fell into a vortex of violence. She served 11 years in prison for killing a man who she said had attacked her sister.She emerged with a problem that confronts many people in Stockton: She was eager to work, yet she was vulnerable to criminal background checks that deny jobs to convicted felons.She worked inside commercial freezers and as a driver. Recently, she took a job at a nonprofit that helps people released from prison set up lives on the outside.\u201cI\u2019m finally living my dream,\u201d she said.In some quarters, the basic income experiment has provoked talk that free money will prompt people to ditch work.\u201cOh, my,\u201d said Ms. Holliman, who still carries credit card debt of more than $500 and does not earn enough money to regularly buy fresh fruit. \u201cWhen you\u2019re struggling, you\u2019re going to rush and pay your bills.\u201dStockton\u2019s trial is meant to deliver examples of that sentiment, challenging the notion that people needing help have not tried hard enough.\u201cIt\u2019s about changing the narrative around who\u2019s deserving,\u201d the mayor said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Malaysia Opposition, Led by 92-Year-Old, Wins Upset Victory", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 In a historic election upset in a country that has been governed by just one coalition for decades, a Malaysian opposition bloc led by the 92-year-old former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad swept to a majority in national parliamentary elections.Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in government funds, gave an emotional national address on Thursday, saying that he would \u201caccept the verdict of the people.\u201dBut the election\u2019s result has not yet been settled. The country\u2019s king must now rule on who will be the next prime minister, as the loose coalition of opposition parties led by Mr. Mahathir is not officially recognized as a single political entity.In the end, if Prime Minister Najib is ousted, he may become vulnerable to criminal prosecution. And he still faces a United States Justice Department investigation and efforts to recover $1.7 billion in assets said to be acquired with laundered money.In a news conference Thursday, Mr. Mahathir called on the king to swear him in as prime minister by 5 p.m. \u201cThere is an urgency here. We need to form the government now, today,\u201d he said.Bernama, the government news agency, reported that the opposition had won 122 seats in Parliament, 10 more than needed to form a new government.With that apparent victory, Mr. Mahathir, who led the country for 22 years before retiring at 78, would return to power as the world\u2019s oldest elected government leader.It is the first victory by the opposition since Malaysia became independent from Britain in 1957, potentially ending the current governing coalition\u2019s six decades in power. \u201cWe have achieved a very substantial majority,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said earlier Thursday.As prime minister, Mr. Najib used the power of his office to muzzle critics and thwart investigations into the missing money.\u201cWe are not seeking revenge,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said. \u201cWhat we want to do is restore the rule of law.\u201dMr. Mahathir had left Mr. Najib\u2019s party over the financial scandal and joined the opposition to help oust him.The test of the unity of Mr. Mahathir\u2019s coalition may come if it is allowed form a cabinet. The coalition includes opposition leaders he once jailed when he was prime minister.Mr. Najib waged a desperate election-eve attempt to gain support, promising this week that if his own coalition won, he would exempt everyone 26 or younger from paying taxes and declare two public holidays next week, just before the start of the holy month of Ramadan.Mr. Najib\u2019s father and uncle both served as prime minister, and their party, the United Malays National Organization, has always been in charge.In an urgent bid to oust Mr. Najib, the opposition turned to Mr. Mahathir, who served as prime minister for 22 years and is often credited with transforming majority-Muslim Malaysia into a modern country. But Mr. Mahathir also established the system of centralized power that Mr. Najib has enjoyed for years.On the campaign trail, Mr. Mahathir apologized for enabling Mr. Najib to become prime minister in 2009.Mr. Mahathir, who will turn 93 in July, united a fractured opposition and attracted ethnic Malay voters long loyal to the governing party.Mr. Najib, however, had many political advantages, including a strong party organization, greater access to campaign funds and gerrymandered districts that favor his National Front coalition.Malaysia also has weak campaign finance laws that allow for a flood of election spending without identifying the source of donations or disclosing how the money is distributed.Mr. Najib has been embroiled for years in a scandal over billions of dollars that disappeared from a government investment fund that he once headed, 1Malaysia Development Berhad.The United States Justice Department concluded that $3.5 billion from the Malaysian fund was laundered through financial institutions in the United States and spent on items like expensive real estate, jewelry, paintings and the production of movies, including \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201dThe assets include a $27.3 million diamond necklace received by Mr. Najib\u2019s wife, Rosmah Mansor, and a $3.2 million painting by Pablo Picasso that was given to the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.Several other countries also are investigating transactions associated with the missing money.Malaysian officials, however, have said there is no evidence that money from the investment fund was misappropriated.Mr. Najib mentioned the Washington visit in a statement on Monday as he asserted that his government was respected abroad.\u201cThe truth is that Malaysia\u2019s standing in the world is very high,\u201d he said.Many of Mr. Mahathir\u2019s new allies saw aligning with him as the best way to bring back the former opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who narrowly lost to Mr. Najib in 2013 and is scheduled to be released from prison next month after his second conviction on sodomy charges.Both of Mr. Anwar\u2019s convictions \u2014 the first under Mr. Mahathir and the second under Mr. Najib \u2014 were widely seen as politically motivated.In his campaign, Mr. Mahathir, who has long criticized Mr. Najib\u2019s use of government payouts as a political tool, sought to highlight the investment fund scandal.Sharon Tan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Next Privacy Battle in Europe Is Over This New Law", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new European data privacy legislation is so stringent that it could kill off data-driven online services and chill innovations like driverless cars, tech industry groups warn.If the current draft prevails, the law will require Skype, WhatsApp, iMessage, video games with player messaging and other electronic services that allow private interactions to obtain people\u2019s explicit permission before placing tracking codes on users' devices or collecting data about their communications.Industry and consumer advocates are essentially fighting over a contentious issue central to the post-Cambridge Analytica online economy: whether data-driven digital services represent more of a boon to consumers or the kind of surveillance that can threaten democracy.The ePrivacy Regulation will replace and broaden an older European Union directive \u2014 which covered traditional telecommunications like voice calls \u2014 by also covering digital communications like text messaging and video chat apps.The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users\u2019 electronic communications: obtaining consumers\u2019 explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.\u201cDo you really want that app to use your metadata? Do you really want them to read your content on a dating app?\u201d Ms. Sippel asked. \u201cConsumers need to get back control over what is happening with their lives and their data.\u201dBut tech industry groups and their supporters argue that ePrivacy\u2019s consent requirement and other provisions are so onerous that they would hinder innovations like smart cars, which automatically transmit safety information back to the manufacturer. And requiring companies to provide equal communications services to people who opt out of data mining, they say, could cause sites or apps that rely on data-driven advertising to start charging fees or close down.\u201cEvery stakeholder I have talked to from industry, from all sizes from the very biggest to the very smallest businesses, are unanimously opposed to this,\u201d he said.Tech companies and trade groups have waged a furious, multipronged lobbying campaign to shut down, or at least weaken, the legislation.Cisco, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, the American Chamber of Commerce, DigitalEurope and the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe, a digital advertising industry group, have all lobbied officials at the European Commission about ePrivacy, according to a lobbying database created by Transparency International EU, a nonprofit research group in Brussels.How much they are spending on the effort is unclear. While companies and trade groups that lobby European Commission officials must provide financial details on annual lobbying expenditures, they do not have to break out the spending by issue.Industry associations have also lobbied the Council of the European Union, whose leadership rotates every six months. For the ePrivacy law to be enacted, the Council must first come to its own consensus on the bill before negotiating the law\u2019s final language in a three-way discussion with the European Parliament and the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm.Elitsa Zlateva, a spokeswoman for the permanent representation of Bulgaria to the European Union, said her country\u2019s officials were committed to the bill\u2019s progress. She declined to provide names of other trade groups that the country\u2019s representatives had met with on ePrivacy.The \u201cBulgarian presidency acts as an honest broker,\u201d she wrote in an email, and works to balance the interests of European member states, citizens and business.Christian Borggreen, vice president for the computer industry group in Europe, said he hoped that the ePrivacy Regulation would not conflict with the G.D.P.R. and that it would \u201cadd meaningful privacy protection without unduly hurting digital innovation.\u201dMichela Palladino, director of European policy and government relations at the Developers Alliance, said of the ePrivacy bill\u2019s restrictions on handling user content and metadata: \u201cThat is something that is too extreme and will really cut potential business opportunities\u201d for many industries that rely on data.Ms. Sippel said hewing to industry opinions was impeding progress on the ePrivacy effort.\u201cIn my view, we have some weak governments on the Council that are not willing to get into trouble with industry,\u201d she said, emphasizing that she was expressing her opinion and not stating an official parliamentary position. \u201cSo, for the time being, they haven\u2019t found a common position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Settles With Russia\u2019s Gazprom Over Antitrust Charges", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Commission said on Thursday that it had reached a settlement with Gazprom, finally concluding a long-running antitrust investigation into the Russian energy giant\u2019s dominance in regional gas markets.Officials in Brussels said the company had accepted a series of concessions, but unlike with competition inquiries into other companies like Google and Intel, it declined to issue any financial penalties. That provoked criticism in countries like Poland, which say they have been squeezed by the energy company in the past, and fear that the deal between Gazprom and the European Commission does not go far enough to prevent similar behavior in the future.Still, the settlement could mark the end of a long legal tangle between the commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, and the Russian state-controlled company, which is the dominant supplier of natural gas in parts of Europe.\u201cThese obligations will significantly change the way Gazprom operates in central and Eastern Europe, to the benefit of millions of European consumers,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday.Gazprom has accepted measures, the commission said, to assure the free flow of gas among European member states. The aim is to clear away market barriers and contractual terms that analysts say allowed Gazprom to charge higher prices.The company, for instance, is required to remove any restrictions on customers\u2019 reselling gas across borders. It is also required to enable flows of the fuel to countries like the Baltic States, whose gas markets remain isolated from the rest of Europe. Gazprom customers will have a right to demand lower prices if what they are paying diverges from benchmark prices determined by major European trading hubs, like the TTF in the Netherlands.If the company breaks any of the rules, the commission can impose fines up to 10 percent of the company\u2019s world revenue.\u201cGazprom won\u2019t be able to play hardball,\u201d said Jonathan Stern, an analyst in the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, a research institution.That was not enough, however, to placate some Central and Eastern European countries.\u201cWe are disappointed that the yearslong proceedings have ended with no fine for Gazprom, no compensation for affected companies, and with hardly any meaningful concessions on Gazprom\u2019s side,\u201d Poland\u2019s minister for European affairs, Konrad Szymanski, said in a statement.Analysts said Ms. Vestager likely decided that it was preferable to obtain a clear set of concessions from Gazprom now, rather than impose fines that would likely trigger appeals from the company, and further years of legal battles.Still, the deal may yet serve both parties.Gazprom, as a result of the deal on Thursday, will be free to continue to do business with important customers like Germany and Italy. And the settlement will further the commission\u2019s goal of ensuring that energy prices in Europe are determined by market forces, not by big suppliers.\u201cWe believe that today\u2019s decision is the most reasonable outcome,\u201d Alexander Medvedev, Gazprom\u2019s deputy chairman, said in a statement.The agreement on Thursday comes with the gas market in a markedly different position than when the investigation began.The construction of interconnecting pipelines between countries, and the rise of gas trading particularly in Northern and Western Europe, have helped drive prices down. And Gazprom\u2019s market position has been further challenged by the prospect of increased supply from the United States, as well as a greater reliance on renewable energy sources that produce electricity, like wind and solar power.The settlement \u201cis actually recognizing what the status quo would have been in two or three years\u2019 time,\u201d Mr. Stern said.There may be other consequences, though.By accepting this de facto code of conduct, Gazprom may be helping one of its pet causes \u2014 the building of a controversial new pipeline between Russia and northern Germany called Nord Stream 2.The United States and other countries oppose the pipeline, partly on the grounds that it would tighten the company\u2019s hold on the European market. In fact, Poland\u2019s own antimonopoly office has launched proceedings against Gazprom and five European companies for financing the pipeline. The project is favored by Germany, though, on the grounds that it would provide another supply route.The settlement could set \u201cthe ground rules\u201d for getting wider acceptance for Nord Stream 2, according to Trevor Sikorski, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm.\u201cIt makes it more difficult to oppose Nord Stream 2 on the basis of market dominance,\u201d he said.Marc Santora contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Get Help Paying for Your Wedding", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was a time when the parents were fully expected to foot the bill for a wedding. But with costs steadily climbing and many couples waiting longer to marry, this long-held tradition no longer seems to apply.Many parents still pick up the tab, though financial responsibility increasingly is being shared \u2014 among the couples, both sets of families and even friends.You\u2019ll also need to establish a comfortable (and reasonable) budget and savings plan after setting a date, especially if you think you may be responsible for all or most of the bills. \u201cLook for ways to reduce expenses or increase income, like maybe adding freelance work,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neill said.Being flexible (and maybe frugal) can certainly help. There are many ways to save on cost, namely by shopping around or even negotiating with potential wedding vendors. You may also consider booking a venue outside the peak season, which runs from late spring through early fall, or on a day other than a Saturday, when prices are at their highest. Or, even opt for a buffet instead of a sit-down meal. (One of Ms. O\u2019Neill\u2019s favorite money-saving tips: \u201ccardboard tiered cake with a small top-cake layer to cut for photos and a basic sheet cake to serve to guests.\u201d)And don\u2019t be afraid to think outside the box. Instead of a fancy hall or event space, Eric Roberge, 38, and Kali Hawlk, 28, of Boston are having both ceremony and reception this June at a rented waterfront house on Cape Cod, where their families also are staying.Mr. Shagawat offers similar advice to his financial planning clients, and also bluntly suggests: \u201cIf you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have enough money, you can always extend the date.\u201dFor those of you who are unwilling or unable to change the date, or who happen to come up short at the last minute, here are some money-raising options to consider.Most financial advisers see borrowing of any sort as a last resort. But these all-dressed-up personal loans \u2014 unsecured, or without collateral \u2014 can cover all or part of the wedding and honeymoon. One big plus: The lending process is usually pretty quick, with borrowers often receiving funds the same day they apply.Wedding loans come in all shapes and sizes, with fixed and variable interest rates, and with or without origination fees. The rates and terms are largely determined by credit worthiness \u2014 the higher your FICO score, the lower the cost. (A score of 750 to 850 is considered excellent; 700 is good.)\u201cThis is a better value for consumers than putting everything on a credit card,\u201d said Ms. Shuff of Lightstream, which offers personal loans at 5.49 to 14.24 percent; $5,000 to $100,000 can be borrowed for 24 to 84 months. The average loan last year, she said, was $16,630.While personal loans are far better than carrying credit card balances indefinitely, they only work if you can comfortably afford the monthly payments. \u201cThe good thing is you have a fixed time frame to pay it off,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neill said.Financial advisers may especially cringe at the thought of loading up cards with wedding expenses, especially if you\u2019re in the habit of carrying monthly balances. But credit cards can be helpful if used wisely. They offer fraud protection, for one thing, and often provide perks likes bonus points or cash-back rewards.\u201cYou have to be strategic,\u201d said Kristina Whyte, a certified public accountant who is in an M.B.A. program at Yale, \u201cand be willing to do the research and be very careful in terms of budget reassessing.\u201dMs. Whyte, 33, and her husband, Philippe Milord, 39, an associate director for revenue data analytics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, paid for most of their wedding and honeymoon in 2014 with plastic. Each used two cards offering zero percent interest promotions for 15 to 18 months, and increased the credit limits on them so they covered most of the $50,000 total wedding costs.\u201cWe paid them off before they started accumulating interest,\u201d said Ms. Whyte, adding that she and Mr. Milord cut back on daily expenses to make the pre-interest payments.The couple also accumulated bonus points that helped cover a portion of their honeymoon to the Maldives. \u201cWe were all on our own,\u201d Ms. Whyte said. \u201cWe paid for our bridal shower, engagement party, everything.\u201dBut even she cautions against relying too heavily on credit cards. \u201cI would only do this if you\u2019ve been diligent in the past about paying off your balances. I hate paying interest!\u201dMs. O\u2019Neill agreed. \u201cDo not put wedding expenses on a credit card unless you plan to repay the balance quickly and are just charging expenses to earn reward points,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019ll be paying for your wedding for decades.\u201dIf you (or your parents) own a home that has risen in value, you could easily tap into the equity to help pay wedding bills. The main risk: Default on the loan and you could lose your home. And, you\u2019re tying up money that may be better used for longer-term goals, like paying for college or retirement.There are advantages, though, to either a home-equity loan, which provides a fixed amount in a lump sum, or home equity line of credit, a.k.a. Heloc, which gives you access to a revolving credit line.Like personal loans, they have fixed terms. But because the loan is secured, interest rates are generally lower than on personal loans or credit cards. According to Bankrate, they average 5.56 percent for a home-equity loan and 5.90 percent for Heloc. There may be other fees, however, like closing costs or account maintenance. Also, the interest is no longer tax deductible; the new tax law eliminated this longstanding feature.Other potential borrowing sources may be retirement funds, like 401(k)\u2019s. But here again, be cautious: Failure to pay it back in a timely manner could result in penalties and taxes, not to mention reduced retirement income. (Along those same lines, you can also borrow against a whole life insurance policy, though the death benefit is reduced if you don\u2019t repay.)\u201cA wedding is a depreciating asset,\u201d Mr. Shagawat said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a wedding to jeopardize your retirement or long-term success.\u201dSome couples have successfully turned to sites like GoFundMe and Indiegogo to raise money for their weddings.The big question, however, is how do you make requests for cash without sounding, well, tacky? \u201cI\u2019ve seen it done tactfully,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neill said, particularly for couples saving for both a wedding and a home. \u201cI\u2019ve seen invites that say something like, \u2018Our biggest financial goal right now is to save for a house. We encourage you to help us reach our dream.\u2019\u201dCliff Edge, 60, and Les Howell, 58, of Decatur, Ga., weren\u2019t saving up for a new home, but they weren\u2019t looking for any more toasters or silverware, either. They just wanted some help financing their modest wedding reception last year for about 100 guests; Mr. Howell is a semiretired writer and producer, and Mr. Edge works as a high school aide.\u201cWe were pretty strapped for money, and we were determined not to go into debt,\u201d Mr. Edge said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "UEFA\u2019s Investigators Recommend Booting A.C. Milan", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEuropean soccer\u2019s top financial investigators have recommended excluding the storied Italian club A.C. Milan from continental competition for violating rules that limit spending, according to two people involved in the process.A final decision on whether UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe, banishes Milan, a seven-time European champion, from participating in the Europa League is due in early June. But after scrutinizing the club\u2019s finances for several months, UEFA announced last week that the club had failed to convince officials that it is on sound financial footing and referred the case to the adjudicatory chamber of its financial control unit to recommend an appropriate punishment.A ban from continental competition is now likely, according to the two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case is continuing and they were not authorized to speak about it publicly. It would serve as the latest indignity for a club once considered soccer royalty, and another bellwether for a deepening crisis in Italian soccer.Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup in 2018 for the first time since 1958. An emergency president is running the national federation. In early May, Serie A, the country\u2019s top league, was forced to scrap a new $1 billion television contract amid antitrust complaints.Milan\u2019s troubles stem from the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s deal to sell the money-losing team last year to the Chinese businessman Li Yonghong for $860 million. To clinch the deal, Li needed last-minute financing from the American billionaire Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management. Li must repay the high-interest loan in October.Milan loses tens of millions of dollars each season. As a result, the team, which spent $270 million to acquire nearly a dozen new players last summer, has failed to meet UEFA\u2019s so-called financial fair play criteria, which prohibit clubs from spending beyond their means. The rules were designed to reduce a cycle of boom and bust at many top clubs, and to prevent the sport from becoming an arms race among superrich club owners.After a lackluster start, Milan finished sixth last season. That was only good enough to qualify for the second-tier Europa League for a second consecutive season rather than the more prestigious Champions League. The club had banked on reaching the lucrative Champions League, a competition that would have been worth at least $50 million.A spokesman for UEFA said the organization did not provide details on recommendations made to its adjudicatory chamber.For Milan, the focus on finances is humiliating. The team has won 18 domestic championships and was often a favorite in Champions League. Only Real Madrid has lifted the trophy more times. Should Milan be kicked out of the Europa League, the team would be the first from the so-called Big Five leagues of Europe to suffer that fate. The Big Five include the top leagues in England, France, Germany, Spain and Italy.UEFA\u2019s decision to refer Milan to its financial adjudicatory chamber appeared to take the club by surprise. Marco Fassone, the club\u2019s chief executive, said after UEFA announced its decision that he expected the organization and the team to come to a settlement.\u201cThis certainly hurts our image, but we are still hopeful,\u201d he said.UEFA has said the club\u2019s plan to repay Elliott Management remains uncertain. Under the terms of the loan, the hedge fund could take control of the club if Li does not repay on time.UEFA has struggled to stop cash-fueled clubs from streaking away from the rest of the competition. A major test will come when it announces the results of an investigation into Paris St.-Germain, the Qatari-owned champion of France that spent about 400 million euros (about $467.7 million) to buy forwards Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 last season.UEFA had already sanctioned the club previously, levying a fine and limiting the size of its squad in 2014.The P.S.G. and Milan cases have also sharpened the focus on UEFA\u2019s financial control bodies.Split into two chambers, one to investigate and one to adjudicate, they are described as being independent, but UEFA\u2019s governing executive council appoints the members.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawyers for Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels Sling More (Legal) Mud", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne minute before their court-ordered deadline of 5 p.m., Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers filed a scathing motion asking a judge to keep Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, from formally entering the case, saying he was \u201cfanning a media storm\u201d and had been \u201csmearing\u201d Mr. Cohen in recent weeks in a relentless series of TV appearances and social media posts.About two hours later, Mr. Avenatti fired back with his own motion, arguing that many of his adversaries\u2019 assaults on him were \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d \u201cbaseless\u201d and lacking in \u201cadmissible evidence.\u201dThe mutual broadsides were only the latest round of sparring in a battle between the proxies for Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford, who appeared onscreen as Stormy Daniels. That battle has been dragging on for weeks now in almost every conceivable venue: in court filings, at legal hearings, on Twitter and on television news shows.All of this, Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers noted in their memo, was sufficient reason for Judge Kimba M. Wood, who is handling the matter in Federal District Court in Manhattan, to deny Mr. Avenatti\u2019s request for admission to the case. \u201cTo our knowledge, this court has never been presented with clearer evidence of the deliberate creation of a carnival atmosphere and inappropriate conduct while an attorney\u2019s application for admission was pending,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cMoreover, this is an unprecedented attack on an individual who has not been charged with any crime.\u201dChief among those distractions was the report Mr. Avenatti released, claiming that Mr. Cohen\u2019s company, Essential Consultants, had taken questionable payments from several sources, including a firm with links to the Russian oligarch, Viktor Vekselberg. In their memo filed on Friday, Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers said that the report was marred by \u201cinaccurate statements\u201d and that even some of the accurate information it contained came from an unlawful source.\u201cMr. Avenatti appears to be primarily focused on smearing Mr. Cohen publicly,\u201d the lawyers wrote, \u201cin his efforts to further his own interest in garnering as much media attention as possible.\u201dIn a brief interview on Friday night, Mr. Avenatti maintained that he was hardly to blame for the spectacle-like nature of the case.\u201cBecause of the stakes,\u201d he said, \u201cthis would be a circus with us or without us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Allies at Cross-Purposes: Trump Puts Europe Into Damage-Control Mode", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 After a series of decisions by President Trump that have split the trans-Atlantic alliance, European foreign ministers have begun a scramble to contain the fallout to their own interests, global institutions and stability in the Middle East.The Europeans \u2014 as well as the cosignatories Russia and China \u2014 want Iran to continue to abide by the deal, which is considered a signal accomplishment of European diplomacy. It sharply restricts Tehran\u2019s ability to enrich uranium to prevent the development of a nuclear weapon.To preserve the deal, the Europeans are trying to figure out ways to provide some of the economic benefits it promised Iran, which are threatened now with the renewal of tough American sanctions.Their efforts come against the backdrop of Gazans being shot in large numbers in demonstrations tied to Israel\u2019s 70th birthday and Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem \u2014 another move made in the face of European opposition.The Europeans have also emphasized their disagreement over the embassy move.Ms. Mogherini said Europeans would continue \u201cto respect the international consensus on Jerusalem\u201d and not move their embassies until the city\u2019s final status was resolved in a peace treaty.Ian Bond, foreign policy analyst with the Center for European Reform, argued that \u201cEuropeans and Atlanticist Americans must preserve what they can of the trans-Atlantic partnership\u201d while Mr. Trump is in office.\u201cBut he is doing a lot of damage in the meantime \u2014 not just hurting allies, but actively helping potential adversaries,\u201d he said, pointing to the Iran deal pullout, the Jerusalem embassy and unilateral tariffs on steel that harm Europe.Nathalie Tocci, the director of Italy\u2019s Institute of International Affairs and a senior adviser to Ms. Mogherini, said that Europe\u2019s foreign and defense policy \u201chas become more difficult now, not least because of the Trump administration efforts to undercut the E.U.\u201dShe warned that \u201cif Europeans are serious about their strategic autonomy, now is the time to demonstrate it by standing united behind their shared interests.\u201d And she said saving the Iran deal \u201cis the place to start.\u201dMs. Mogherini said that the three European countries that helped negotiate the Iran deal would stay with it as long as Iran did. \u201cWe will save it together,\u201d she said.Mr. Zarif said that the talks had gone well, and that \u201cwe are on the right path to move forward\u201d and had agreed on \u201cthe importance of full implementation of the nuclear deal.\u201d Further talks with the Europeans, he said, will \u201ccontinue in the next two weeks.\u201dOn Tuesday night, after the meeting, Ms. Mogherini said that the foreign ministers had agreed to begin work, to \u201cfind solutions in the next few weeks,\u201d on issues like Iran\u2019s energy sales, banking transactions, export credits and investment, and protections for European companies working in Iran.But preserving or increasing European investment in Iran in the face of the American sanctions is a difficult challenge \u2014 especially since the White House has made clear to Europeans that their companies will not get exemptions from the sanctions, which Washington hopes will pressure Iran into a new set of negotiations.It was an irony that escaped few European officials: They were trying to find ways to ease the economic pressure on Iran and keep it in the nuclear deal, while Washington was trying to increase that pressure for unclear ends.Many Europeans, like Ms. Tocci, believe that the unstated American aim is \u201cregime change\u201d in Iran, something that the British and French foreign ministers, Boris Johnson and Mr. Le Drian, have specifically ruled out as a European goal.These same foreign ministers once spent weeks trying to toughen sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and its support for groups like Hamas and Hezbollah to please Mr. Trump and get him to agree to stay in the nuclear accord. Now they have dropped all such attempts. Instead, they were working to keep Iran in the deal at all and find ways to compensate Tehran for doing so.While Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, has said that the American intention is to force Iran into new, broader negotiations, European officials said they had heard no American strategy for doing that.European diplomats, speaking on background because they did not have authorization to talk otherwise, said on Tuesday that they felt no great urgency, which was just as well, given the difficulty of the task. They had the impression, they said, that Iran wants to remain in the deal so long as the government can show benefits to the population, and of course to avoid a more open confrontation with Washington.The Europeans will try to uphold their side of the bargain, one senior European diplomat said, but it will be very difficult to preserve the economic benefits for Iran.For all the talk about so-called blocking regulations to protect European companies from American sanctions and the possible use of the European Investment Bank to provide euro-based financing for deals with Iran, there was little optimism that these solutions would work very well.Many European companies that have invested in Iran \u2014 or might want to \u2014 also do business in the United States, a much more important market, and are unlikely to want to test the American sanctions.Nor do the Europeans want competition with the United States, which is still Europe\u2019s most important ally and partner, to tip into confrontation, as Ms. Mogherini has said. That is especially important for Britain, which is leaving the European Union and wants Washington\u2019s support.As the Europeans met with Mr. Zarif, elsewhere in Brussels the American chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., was meeting with NATO allies to discuss Afghanistan and European security.While NATO had no role in the Iran deal, the three European nations trying to preserve it are also Washington\u2019s most powerful allies in NATO.But Europeans, in general, feel that the fundamentals of the trans-Atlantic partnership are all under threat from Washington. That can only help countries like Russia and China, which seek to undermine the current world order.She said: \u201cIf we always step away from multilateral agreements as soon as we don\u2019t like something about them, that would be a bad message for the world. We want to strengthen multilateralism.\u201dIt is less clear what she and other Europeans are willing to do about it.Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chance to Spend 99-Plus Years in Venice (in the Afterlife)", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVenice JournalVENICE \u2014 To let: four small lots with a 99-year (renewable) lease, on an exclusive Venetian island. Fixer-uppers. Illustrious neighbors: Igor Stravinsky, Joseph Brodsky, Emilio Vedova. Starting auction price: around $300,000.The cemetery, built after Napoleon\u2019s administration ordered the residents of Venice to bury their dead outside the city center, has for more than 200 years been a final resting place for Venetians, as well as a few chosen foreigners given special dispensation to be buried there.Now, that honor will go to the highest bidders.Last year, Mayor Luigi Brugnaro decided to put up for auction five private chapels built by old Venetian families but abandoned for years. The proceeds will be used to restore older sections of the cemetery that have been worn by exposure to the elements.It may not be a palazzo on the Grand Canal, but it\u2019s a rare chance to spend the hereafter \u2014 or at least 99 years of it, renewable for 50 more \u2014 in an exclusive haunt that is normally open only to Venice residents, relatives of those buried in the cemetery and celebrities with a strong connection to the city.Be forewarned, however: The chapels need considerable work and, like a Venice palazzo, will require eternal care.A chapel here needs \u201cthe same maintenance as a palazzo in the historic center,\u201d Massimiliano De Martin, the municipal councilor responsible for urban planning, said during a stroll through the cemetery grounds.The new owner \u2014 Dominique Vacher, the director general of Laboratoires Genevrier, a pharmaceutical company \u2014 and his wife already owned an apartment in the lagoon city, and decided to extend their stay.Venice is billed \u201cas the city where happiness is eternal,\u201d he said in a statement issued by City Hall.There will be plenty of room: The tomb chamber previously held seven corpses.The cemetery was built during the French occupation of Venice, when it was decreed that burying the dead on the main islands was unsanitary. It was later enlarged.Until 1954, all private tombs in the city, whether below or above ground, were leased for eternity. Since then, the city of Venice has leased tombs for a varying number of years. In some cases, leases can be renewed.Otherwise, graves are exhumed on a schedule posted at the cemetery entrance and on its website. Exhumations take place throughout the year, aside from July and August, when \u201cit\u2019s too hot,\u201d said Maurizio Zaranto, the cemetery\u2019s manager. The remains can be cremated, and the ashes can go into a columbarium niche for 30 years, renewable for 20 more. Or bones can be deposited into the cemetery\u2019s common ossuary.Since 2011, the city has also allowed ashes to be scattered in the lagoon, as long as an official is present and the city\u2019s mortuary police have granted approval. This is true for foreigners\u2019 ashes, too.In the San Michele cemetery, relatives of the deceased typically tend the tombs, and on a recent afternoon Venetians of various ages brought fresh flowers, brushed off tombstones and fought off ravenous mosquitoes.\u201cThere are more dead Venetians than live ones \u2014 it\u2019s a fact,\u201d Mr. De Martin said.As with the Roman Catholic section of the cemetery, the Protestant graves are the responsibility of the families, but many no longer live in Venice. With a smaller population, \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same pressure faced in the Catholic part\u201d to make space for new tombs, said Oddbjorn Sormoen, an art historian and director of the fund-raising foundation.So far, the group has mapped its quadrant to identify the areas most in need of repair and assess ways to redress them.\u201cOur next project is restoring the gateway to the chapel,\u201d said John C. Mowinckel, the foundation\u2019s president. His great-grandfather, Johan Ludwig Mowinckel \u2014 a Norwegian businessman who traded in salted cod, used in the traditional Venetian dish baccal\u00e0 \u2014 is buried at San Michele.\u201cOh, if we could get a dollar from every Protestant in America,\u201d the fund-raiser added wistfully.Restoration efforts on the Catholic side are, for now, financed by money raised by the auctions.The first lot included five chapels, and officials said other chapels had been identified for future bidding. \u201cWe\u2019re promoting the auction throughout the planet, because Venice has always been a city open to the world,\u201d said Mr. De Martin, the city councilor.While far from the maddening crowds that throng the city\u2019s famous St. Mark\u2019s Square, the cemetery has become a tourist magnet, both for those paying homage to the celebrities buried there and for those wanting to savor its peace and solemnity.\u201cYou see, you\u2019re smiling here in the cemetery,\u201d Mr. De Martin said. \u201cYou don\u2019t die here. This is the sense we want to give: that in Venice, no one dies. You live forever, in another way, but you continue to live.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Battle Between Cuomo and Nixon, the Subway Becomes a Central Issue", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a curious position: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo helped hire the new leader of New York City\u2019s subway. But when that leader released a sweeping plan to fix the failing system last week, Mr. Cuomo offered a tepid response, promising simply to review it.Eight days later, on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo embraced the plan and said that he wanted to pay for its steep price by pursuing congestion pricing \u2014 a proposal to toll drivers entering Manhattan.\u201cThat\u2019s the only feasible, realistic answer,\u201d Mr. Cuomo told reporters. \u201cEverything else is just politics.\u201dWhat exactly prompted his latest comments? At least one factor is Cynthia Nixon, the actress who is challenging Mr. Cuomo in the Democratic primary for governor.Mr. Cuomo, however, got out in front of the news by saying he would pay for the subway overhaul plan, which could cost $19 billion just for the first stage, by working to have the State Legislature approve congestion pricing next year.In announcing her plan, Ms. Nixon again attacked Mr. Cuomo for ignoring the plight of subway riders. \u201cThe way he\u2019s handled this issue for his first two terms should completely disqualify him from a third,\u201d her proposal states.The dueling comments on the subway were only the latest example of how the transit system has become a central campaign issue. After Ms. Nixon announced her candidacy in March, Mr. Cuomo held a series of press events to show that he was working to fix the subway.Standing before a mob of television cameras, Mr. Cuomo inspected train parts at an overhaul yard. He ran a magnetic wand along the subway tracks to clear debris. He admired a fiery demonstration of rail-welding technology.Still, on the subway and other issues like public housing and recreational marijuana, Ms. Nixon has proved adept at getting under Mr. Cuomo\u2019s skin.\u201cI think we can pretty much assume that anything the governor does between now and Sept. 13 is in response to Cynthia Nixon,\u201d Christina M. Greer, a political-science professor, said referring to the date of the primary election.The last time Mr. Cuomo is known to have taken the subway was in January 2017 for the first trip on the new Second Avenue line on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. Mr. Cuomo lives in Westchester County and often works in Albany, the governor\u2019s office has said, though he does frequently travel to New York City.\u201cThe governor was born and raised in Queens and grew up taking the train \u2014 but riding the subways doesn\u2019t fix them, and that\u2019s the only thing we\u2019re focused on,\u201d said Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo. She declined to say when Mr. Cuomo last took the subway.Ms. Nixon has made a point of riding the subway, as has Mr. de Blasio, the governor\u2019s frequent adversary. Mr. de Blasio has taken the subway at least 18 times this year, his office said, providing a list of recent trips.\u201cWe made some progress on it,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said of congestion pricing. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it finally passed, but I look forward to that passing next year.\u201dThe governor\u2019s office disputed the notion that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s recent events have been prompted by Ms. Nixon\u2019s candidacy. They argued that he has been a forceful advocate for the subway and that the recent events were organized to highlight the work that can now move forward after Mr. de Blasio finally agreed to finance half the cost of a short-term emergency repair plan.\u201cAfter three months of slamming the M.T.A. in the press, Ms. Nixon released a plan to fix the subways and it was the M.T.A.\u2019s plan,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said in a statement. \u201cThanks.\u201dLast summer, Mr. Cuomo declared that the subway was in a state of emergency and the authority began an emergency plan for immediate repairs. But many riders say that service remains terrible. Only about 65 percent of weekday subway trains are on time \u2014 about the same rate as a year ago, according to the authority\u2019s statistics.Subway riders might not notice significant improvements before Election Day. Ms. Greer, who is a McSilver Institute Fellow at New York University, said that having a well-documented record is one of the risks of running for a third term.\u201cIsn\u2019t this terrible?

{"Headline": "At Trump Tower, Michael Cohen and Oligarch Discussed Russian Relations", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEleven days before the presidential inauguration last year, a billionaire Russian businessman with ties to the Kremlin visited Trump Tower in Manhattan to meet with Donald J. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, according to video footage and another person who attended the meeting.In Mr. Cohen\u2019s office on the 26th floor, he and the oligarch, Viktor Vekselberg, discussed a mutual desire to strengthen Russia\u2019s relations with the United States under President Trump, according to Andrew Intrater, an American businessman who attended the meeting and invests money for Mr. Vekselberg. The men also arranged to see one another during the inauguration festivities, the second of their three meetings, Mr. Intrater said.Days after the inauguration, Mr. Intrater\u2019s private equity firm, Columbus Nova, awarded Mr. Cohen a $1 million consulting contract, a deal that has drawn the attention of federal authorities investigating Mr. Cohen, according to people briefed on the inquiry.Mr. Intrater said in an interview that Mr. Vekselberg, his cousin and biggest client, had no role in Columbus Nova\u2019s decision to hire Mr. Cohen as a consultant. When asked about the meeting at Trump Tower during the presidential transition, Mr. Intrater described it as a brief and impromptu discussion, and said that Mr. Vekselberg had not originally planned to attend.\u201cObviously, if I\u2019d known in January 2017 that I was about to hire this high-profile guy who\u2019d wind up in this big mess, I wouldn\u2019t have introduced him to my biggest client, and wouldn\u2019t have hired him at all,\u201d Mr. Intrater said. He agreed to be interviewed about his dealings with Mr. Cohen, he said, because he had done nothing wrong.The disclosure sheds additional light on the intersection between Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle and Russians with ties to the Kremlin. The meeting came months after Mr. Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., met at Trump Tower during the campaign with a Kremlin-linked lawyer claiming to have damaging information on his opponent, Hillary Clinton, and a former campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, met with Russian intermediaries in Europe. During the campaign, Mr. Cohen himself was pursuing a deal to build a Trump high-rise in Moscow, which did not come to fruition.Mr. Cohen\u2019s meeting with Mr. Vekselberg happened during his final days as a Trump Organization employee, at a time when his position in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit seemed uncertain. Although Mr. Cohen told some associates that he expected a high-level White House job, that role never materialized, and he instead struck out on his own to drum up business from companies that wanted advice and access to the Trump administration, including AT&T and Novartis.Mr. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s lawyer and longtime fixer, met with a Russian oligarch at Trump Tower to discuss Russia and was later paid by a company connected to him.Mr. Cohen\u2019s goal for the meeting \u2014 and whether it may have been related to his consulting business \u2014 remains unclear. His lawyers, and lawyers for Mr. Vekselberg, did not respond to requests for comment when told about video footage from C-Span showing Mr. Vekselberg and Mr. Intrater arriving at Trump Tower on Jan. 9, 2017. Mr. Intrater said the meeting included only a brief discussion about relations between the United States and Russia.The meetings and Columbus Nova\u2019s payments to Mr. Cohen have attracted scrutiny from Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election, as well as federal prosecutors in Manhattan examining Mr. Cohen\u2019s business activities and finances, the people said.The meetings were an opportunity for the three men to discuss shared interests during the presidential transition and early days of the administration, according to interviews and records reviewed by The Times.Mr. Cohen and Mr. Intrater initially met shortly before the 2016 election and discussed ways to invest in the taxi business, which had made the fixer millions of dollars over the years.In the interview, Mr. Intrater described the lead-up to the Trump Tower meeting as a series of coincidences around that potential deal: Mr. Cohen and he intended to meet on the morning of Jan. 9, 2017, to discuss investing in distressed taxi loans. But Mr. Cohen had to reschedule for the afternoon, when Mr. Intrater had planned to meet Mr. Vekselberg, who was visiting New York and then came along to the meeting.\u201cI remember walking in and seeing lots of boxes because Michael was packing up his office and looking forward to hanging out his own shingle,\u201d Mr. Intrater said. \u201cWe were in his office for about 15 minutes. We talked about how much we hoped U.S.-Russian relations would get better through business projects and cultural exchange.\u201dIt is unclear whether anyone else at Mr. Trump\u2019s company or on his transition team was aware of the meeting. Mr. Trump was in the building that day, and his office was just doors down from Mr. Cohen\u2019s, though Mr. Intrater said they did not see the president-elect.The next week, the three men sat together at one of the inaugural dinner events. While there, Mr. Intrater took a photo with Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Mr. Intrater said.Mr. Intrater donated $250,000 to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, which entitled him to the tickets he and Mr. Vekselberg used to attend the event. Days later, Mr. Cohen signed on as a consultant to Columbus Nova, and documents show that in addition to the taxi loans, he pitched the firm on an oil and gas operation in the American Southwest.Mr. Vekselberg, whose conglomerate includes investments in energy, attended a meeting in March last year that Mr. Cohen arranged to discuss the oil and gas deal, Mr. Intrater said. Nothing came of the discussions.In contrast, Mr. Vekselberg\u2019s discussion with Mr. Cohen at Trump Tower about Russian relations partly reflected his role as an informal diplomat of sorts, a billionaire businessman who shuttles between Russia and the United States to promote economic and philanthropic ventures.\u201cHe always has been a key Russian conduit for investing in U.S. political causes, business causes, other things that would allow him to gain entree to the U.S. elite,\u201d said Michael Carpenter, the Russia director at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.As Mr. Vekselberg\u2019s business empire expanded, he picked up various Kremlin projects, including a plan to create a Silicon Valley-style development outside Moscow and the construction of a hotel cluster for the 2014 Winter Olympics. In return, the Kremlin awarded him a medal of honor.He also attended a now-famous December 2015 dinner in Moscow where Mr. Flynn sat at a table with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin.The day before Mr. Trump was sworn in, Mr. Vekselberg expressed doubt on Russian television that the United States would quickly lift its economic sanctions against Russia. It was worse than he feared: Last month, he and Renova were placed on the Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions list.

{"Headline": "In Colorado, a Fracking Boom and a Population Explosion Collide", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWELD COUNTY, Colo. \u2014 A new oil rig will rise behind a middle school in this sprawling county in the coming months, its slender tower bearing an announcement: fracking is back.But this growth is also spurring a return of the turmoil that accompanied the last boom, pitting neighbor against neighbor and communities against companies in a fight over which projects should be allowed to pierce the land.In Weld County \u2014 the center of the state\u2019s oil and gas activity and home to more than 23,000 active wells \u2014 that tension has converged at a school called Bella Romero Academy. Just behind the school, workers are laying the foundation for a 24-well project that will pull oil and gas from the earth as students race across the playground.The project has the support of state regulators and the county commission. But it is opposed by the school board, the superintendent and many parents, some of whom say they support fossil fuel development but are alarmed by such a large operation so close to their school.Well heads will sit 828 feet from the edge of Bella Romero property.\u201cIt\u2019s like they said, \u2018Put it where the Mexicans live, over there it\u2019s O.K.\u2019\u201d said Yveth Haro, 42, whose son Elian, 10, is a student at Bella Romero. \u201cWell I don\u2019t think it\u2019s O.K.\u201dOther sites, he said, \u201cdid not have all those critical characteristics.\u201dWhile oil and gas companies have long operated in Colorado, they flooded the region in the 2000s as increased use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, unlocked possibilities. By 2013, communities along the Front Range were pushing for control of their own backyards, enacting laws that tried to curb fracking near homes and playgrounds.The conflicts come amid a population surge driven in part by outdoors-oriented millennials fleeing high-cost cities, and by industries like aerospace and finance. Much of that growth is in Denver, Boulder and the area to the north that happens to sit above fuel-rich shale.The uptick in production, however, comes at a time of political uncertainty. Gov. John Hickenlooper \u2014 a Democrat thought of as friendly to the industry \u2014 is term-limited this year, and liberal candidates are lining up to replace him. A leading contender is Jared Polis, a congressman well-known for his attempts to rein in drilling.Already, oil and gas representatives are pouring millions into the race to defend a business they calculate contributes $32 billion a year to the state\u2019s economy.Just as important could be an upcoming Colorado Supreme Court ruling in which justices will decide whether state regulators must prioritize public health and the environment when approving permits, rather than balancing those factors with the benefits of production.If the court decides the state must consider health first, said Sharon Jacobs, a law professor at the University of Colorado, it could have sweeping effects, raising the bar for new permits.Or, depending on how regulators interpret the ruling, they could continue issuing permits as usual.It is also increasingly diverse, and school parking lots are jammed with deep-rooted farming families, Mexican immigrants and refugees from places like Burma and Somalia.Bella Romero Academy, with its red-and-yellow brick walls and bilingual signs, teaches several hundred students in grades four to eight. The buffer zone between the school and the incoming oil project is the students\u2019 soccer field and a drainage ditch.The school is surrounded by homes. Longhorn cattle, llamas and goats live at its perimeter.The fight over the project is complicated by the fact that the largely conservative county has benefited enormously from oil and gas, which has flooded the region with money and jobs and is embraced by much of the community.Don Warden, the county\u2019s finance director, called the shale below him \u201cthe gift that keeps on giving.\u201dToday, County Road 49 is so crowded with oil derricks and tanks that some residents call it the Frack Freeway. And while new wells may raise alarm elsewhere, they\u2019ve become the norm in Weld, where fracking operations are tucked into neighborhoods and already border several schools.\u201cYou\u2019re talking to a person who lives within about 200 feet of a drilling operation,\u201d said Barbara Kirkmeyer, a county commissioner. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you shouldn\u2019t move in next to it.\u201dThe project near Bella Romero, however, has exposed fissures, with even a few industry supporters saying that the combination of the operation\u2019s size and proximity to students takes development too far.Among the operation\u2019s fiercest opponents is Patricia Nelson, 28, whose son Diego, 5, will attend Bella Romero when he reaches fourth grade.\u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that they keep it away from the schools, keep it away from the homes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to a point where the industry, I feel, is starting to cause more problems than what they\u2019re worth.\u201dIn response, the company has made \u201cunprecedented accommodations,\u201d said Mr. Cain, and will complete 80 percent of work outside school hours, employ a sound wall and a noise-minimizing drill rig, and pipe out oil and gas, rather than trucking it, reducing traffic and emissions.Mr. Cain called the episode an anomaly at a company with an otherwise admirable reputation for safety.Together, the fires have heightened safety concerns, and activists have staged protests outside the school, sometimes carrying fliers to educate parents, many of whom do not speak English.Environmental groups and the N.A.A.C.P. Colorado State Conference are suing the state over the project, alleging that regulators erred in approving the permit.Still, while some neighbors oppose the project, others do not.\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t bother me a bit,\u201d said Shawn Elliott, 50, who lives next to Bella Romero.Bert West, 81, another resident, agreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful. Everyone is screaming. But it\u2019s jobs, and it\u2019s money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s New Government Will Challenge the E.U. at Its Heart", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 As Italy\u2019s new populist leaders prepare to form a government, European leaders are bracing for potential new confrontations over migration and some of the core principles of the common currency, the euro.\u201cThe new Italian government will give Germany every excuse not to do what Macron would like and it will destabilize the markets,\u201d said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institution. \u201cIt will increase the risk of another eurozone banking crisis, not reduce it.\u201dLast week Italy\u2019s populist parties, the Five Star Movement and the hard-right League, said they would sharply increase spending and repeal reforms of the labor market and the pension system, violating financial limits imposed by Brussels and meant to apply to any country using the euro.The plans would throw an already weak Italian economy into further debt. And the consequences are certain to ripple through the bloc, where leaders worry about another financial crisis just as Greece finally seems to be exiting from its eight-year bailout program.\u201cEven if they have retreated on leaving the euro, what they\u2019re proposing in terms of the social program and minimum guaranteed salary will blow a hole through all the eurozone rules,\u201d said Anthony L. Gardner, the most recent American ambassador to the European Union. \u201cI think investors are underestimating the risk.\u201dThe French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned Italy this week to respect bloc budget rules or put the euro in jeopardy again.\u201cItalians must understand that the future of Italy is in Europe and nowhere else, but there are rules to respect,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said in an interview on Europe 1 radio.\u201cIf the new government takes the risk of not meeting its commitments on the debt, the deficit, but also the cleanup of the banks, it is the entire financial stability of the eurozone which would be threatened,\u201d he said.Mujtaba Rahman, chief European analyst with the Eurasia Group, said that \u201ceven a fairly aggressive fiscal expansion will put Rome on a direct collision course with Brussels,\u201d which had been predicting a more moderate Italian policy.The crunch is likely to come in a new Italian budget next fall, Mr. Rahman said. The proposed expansion of spending is a direct challenge to \u201cthe whole philosophy of economic governance and rules governing the eurozone area,\u201d he said.The cumulative Italian debt is already about 130 percent of gross domestic product, more than twice what the eurozone is supposed to require, and probably too big to bail out if necessary.The uncertainty around the Italian economy will also be a further major blow to the ambitions for eurozone stabilization and reform laid out by Mr. Macron, proposals that have already been sharply watered down by Germany.With a critical European Union summit meeting coming in June, Mr. Rahman said, \u201cthis will be deeply unhelpful to Macron, because the Italians will be the excuse for Germany to do nothing serious on reform.\u201d\u201cThe window for eurozone reform, already narrow, is shrinking fast,\u201d he said.There are worries in security terms, too.France, Britain and Germany, as signatories to the Iran nuclear deal, had been discussing new sanctions against Iran as part of their effort to persuade President Trump to keep to the Iran deal.The economic situation in Italy is hardly good, which was a major contributing factor to the victory of the League and Five Star. Henrik Enderlein, a professor of political economy at Germany\u2019s Hertie School of Governance and now in Florence, put four charts on Twitter showing poor Italian performance compared with the rest of the eurozone, with the comment, \u201cYes, I am worried.\u201dThe charts showed poor economic growth, very high debt, very high levels of nonperforming loans in Italian banks and low popular support for the euro. Italian GDP per capita is lower now in real terms than it was nearly 20 years ago, when Italy joined the euro, noted Matthew Goodwin, a political scientist at the University of Kent.The other factor that helped the new coalition was the strong feeling among Italians that the European Union had let them down over migration; Italy and Greece have now become the primary landing spots for refugees and economic migrants from the Middle East and Africa.Promises made during the campaign to deport up to 500,000 migrants could also bring Italy into sharp conflict with Brussels, Mr. Grant said. \u201cDeportation of that size would be impossible without violating due process,\u201d he said.That could force Brussels to start an Article 7 process against Italy for breaking the fundamental commitments to the rule of law that would be \u201cmore serious\u201d than the process begun against Poland for meddling with the independence of the judiciary.In the end, Mr. Gardner and Mr. Rahman said, Italy is likely to be kept in line more by the financial markets than by Brussels itself. Brussels has been \u201clazy and complacent\u201d in the face of the Italian election challenge, Mr. Rahman said. \u201cBut what will really decide if there is a crisis, are the markets,\u201d he said.And with Mario Draghi, an Italian, soon leaving as head of the European Central Bank, it is not clear that a successor would be as willing to provide a backstop to Italian debt in the way Mr. Draghi promised to do. \u201cDon\u2019t assume the E.C.B. will be the same,\u201d Mr. Rahman said.Mr. Gardner added: \u201cEvery leader has to take account of the bond markets. Even Berlusconi had to.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Putin\u2019s 4th Term, More a Coronation Than an Inauguration", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Vladimir V. Putin took the oath of office on Monday for a fourth term as Russia\u2019s president, in a ceremony staged in a gilded Kremlin hall once used to crown czars and replete with pageantry, highlighting his vast accumulation of authority after nearly two decades in power.Mr. Putin, a former KGB agent, has ruled Russia as prime minister or president for more than 18 years, and in that time has crafted an image as a steely nerved leader and the man best qualified to rebuild his country after the collapse of the Soviet Union.In a theatrical touch, a televised ceremony began on Monday with Mr. Putin sitting at his desk in the Kremlin, suit jacket looped over his chair, as if hard at work until moments before the ceremony. A phone rang, letting him know it was time for his fourth term; he donned his jacket and walked alone through the red-carpeted Kremlin corridors and into a hall packed with about 6,000 invited, cheering guests.In a short speech, Mr. Putin suggested his focus had now turned to domestic matters and improving Russia\u2019s economy for the \u201cwell-being of every family,\u201d though there were no words of reconciliation in the country\u2019s tense relations with the West.\u201cThe country\u2019s security and defense capabilities are reliably ensured,\u201d Mr. Putin told the audience of government ministers, lawmakers, religious leaders and celebrities.\u201cNow we will use all the possibilities we have first of all for the resolution of internal, and most essential, tasks of development,\u201d he said. \u201cA new quality of life, well-being, security and health for the people, that is what is important today.\u201dWhile lower key than Mr. Putin\u2019s inauguration in 2012, the ceremony\u2019s regal themes nevertheless gave it the air of a coronation.The honor guard and flag bearers wore uniforms with tall military caps, of a style dating from Russia\u2019s war with Napoleon in 1812. The ceremony itself unfolded in a Kremlin hall used to crown three czars \u2014 Alexander II, Alexander III and Nicholas II \u2014 as well as previous presidential inaugurations. And later, Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, gave Mr. Putin an 18th century icon while blessing him for his new term.Abroad, Mr. Putin has sought to restore Russia\u2019s sway in world affairs. During his third term as president, he intervened militarily in Ukraine and Syria, putting him at loggerheads with the West. And, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, he directed Russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential election to aid Donald J. Trump.The arrests added images of swinging nightsticks and shoving matches with the police to the inaugural events. The repression, Vedomosti, a business newspaper, wrote, risked \u201cspoiling the upcoming inauguration more even than the protest.\u201dThe violence included a throwback to an earlier era of crowd-control tactics in Russia. Men wearing Cossack uniforms and carrying a type of traditional leather whip known as a nagaika had mingled in the crowd, occasionally lashing out. The Echo of Moscow radio station reported Monday that the Cossack group had won municipal contracts to train for and help with crowd control, though it remained unclear whether they acted in an official capacity on Saturday.Mr. Putin signed decrees on Monday outlining his goals, such as reducing poverty and, by the end of his six-year term, raising Russian life expectancy to 78 years, from 72 now. He signaled political continuity by nominating a longtime ally, Dmitri A. Medvedev, as prime minister.Whether Mr. Putin shifts gears on economic policy hinges on the possible appointment of a liberal economist, Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former finance minister, to a new post as economic adviser, analysts said. Kremlin hard-liners oppose Mr. Kudrin for advocating an easing of tensions with the West, as well as efforts to revive trade. Mr. Kudrin has also argued for raising taxes and the retirement age to shore up the budget.Mr. Putin first became president on Dec. 31, 1999, when Boris Yeltsin, ailing from heart troubles, resigned. Mr. Putin was then elected in 2000 and served twice, the constitutional limit for successive terms. He then became prime minister for one term, before returning to the presidency in 2012. For his third and now fourth spells as president, the term was extended to six years from four.While not short on pomp, the ceremony on Monday was less elaborate than his inauguration in 2012.In 2012, the police cordoned off much of the city center to allow Mr. Putin\u2019s motorcade to glide through quiet streets toward the Kremlin. Eerie images of the leader in an empty city sparked criticism that Mr. Putin had lost touch with the people.This year, he stayed within the Kremlin grounds. He walked from his office to a motorcade that drove from one Kremlin building to another, escorted by motorcycles.In the ceremony, Mr. Putin strode through several interlinked, gilded and chandeliered halls in an historical Kremlin palace before arriving at the Andreyevsky Hall, where guests waited. Few foreign dignitaries attended. Among those in the hall were Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the former German chancellor and longtime supporter of Mr. Putin.Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Potential Auto Tariffs Prompt Warnings From Industry and Allies", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump likes to keep allies and adversaries guessing, but his decision to begin a trade investigation that could trigger auto tariffs was met by surprise at home and abroad, and prompted warnings that it could destabilize global supply chains.Mr. Trump has argued that tariffs would encourage companies to move production back to American soil after years of offshoring and he has seized on levies as a way to force trading partners to make concessions, such as limiting exports to the United States.But critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach say the president is sowing uncertainty that threatens to undercut economic growth and send trading relations to a previously unseen level of disarray.Mr. Trump\u2019s latest tariff threat came Wednesday, in the middle of a series of foreign policy challenges: White House officials canceled a meeting with North Korea, drew the ire of lawmakers by considering easing penalties on a Chinese telecom firm and said they had secured a $200 billion trade concession with China, only to have the deal fall through.But that wasn\u2019t all. This week, India filed formal challenges to Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs at the World Trade Organization, joining the European Union, Japan, Russia and Turkey.Even members of the president\u2019s own party warned of the debilitating uncertainty businesses are facing from his scattershot approach.\u201cYou pass a permanent tax reform for corporations and say, let\u2019s do business in America,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the president of the American Action Forum, a conservative-leaning think tank, and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cAnd then every day, you don\u2019t know which of your goods will have a tariff wall around it. It makes no sense.\u201dPromises to shake up American trade were a mainstay for the president on the campaign trail, and the idea of auto tariffs graced the trade to-do list on the white board in the office of the former White House adviser Steve Bannon in the early months of the administration. On Thursday, the United Autoworkers President Dennis Williams was cautiously optimistic about the president\u2019s decision to examine auto imports on national security grounds. Mr. Williams said he believed the United States should have been looking into imports long ago.But beyond the president\u2019s base, the threat of tariffs on cars, trucks, S.U.V.s and auto parts appeared to provoke alarm from nearly every corner, with warnings that it would ultimately hurt American workers and consumers more than anyone else.\u201cIf this proposal is carried out, it would deal a staggering blow to the very industry it purports to protect and would threaten to ignite a global trade war,\u201d said Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, blasted the potential for tariffs on imported vehicles as a \u201cbad idea,\u201d and added, \u201cThis is a dangerous course and should be abandoned immediately.\u201dThe administration authorized the investigation under the same legal statute it used to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in March. As with that action, the Commerce Department on Wednesday said imported vehicles may pose a national security threat because they had degraded American manufacturing and put domestic technological development at risk.But many find the national security argument specious. Roughly 44 percent of cars, trucks and S.U.V.s sold in the United States last year were imported, but 98 percent of American car imports came from major allies, like Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Japan and South Korea.Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, said that the idea that there could be a national security threat posed by cars and car parts from Canada \u2014 many of which cross the border multiple times in their journey from the factory to the customer \u2014 was \u201cfrankly absurd.\u201d\u201cThat is a point that we are making very clearly to our U.S. partners and allies,\u201d she said.Margaritas Schinas, the senior spokesman for the European Commission, said there was \u201cno justification\u201d for the United States to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum on national security, grounds. \u201cInvoking national security would be even more far-fetched in the case of the car industry,\u201d he said.In an interview Thursday on CNBC, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who is leading the investigation, said the administration was defining national security \u201cbroadly,\u201d to include the impact on employment and other factors. \u201cEconomic security is military security,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd without economic security, you can\u2019t have military security.\u201dMr. Trump has framed the threat of tariffs as a potential source of leverage in talks to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement, which have largely stalled over rules governing how carmakers can qualify for Nafta\u2019s zero tariffs.On Wednesday, President Trump said automakers would be \u201cvery happy\u201d with his announcement. But few seemed pleased.While many companies said they were still waiting to see the likely effect of the measure, carmakers, auto parts suppliers and car dealers said it threatened to raise their costs, depress auto sales and jobs in the United States, and make American-made products less competitive worldwide. The industry has already been hit by the tariffs on steel and aluminum, which have weighed on their profit margins, and the threat of looming trade action against China, as well as potential Chinese retaliation.\u201cIf the tariffs actually went into effect, it would upend the supplier industry,\u201d said Ann Wilson, senior vice president for government affairs at Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents auto parts makers. \u201cWe are very dependent on the ability to bring in parts from other parts of the world for final production in the U.S., and if that\u2019s no longer financially viable, the question becomes, is the production of vehicles in this country going to be financially viable?\u201dKristin Dziczek, the vice president of Industry, Labor & Economics at the Center for Automotive Research, said automakers would be slow to adjust their own investment decisions until they see how any potential tariff decisions might come to pass.\u201cThis is an industry that is big and slow and costs lots of money to build up capacity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear how this all proceeds. But what it does immediately is introduce a lot more risk and uncertainty into an industry that doesn\u2019t deal well with uncertainty.\u201dDespite the president\u2019s vow to defend and strengthen American manufacturing, companies said they worried that the president and his advisers did not understand the complex web of materials and components that are sourced from around the world, and how they support vast numbers of American jobs. They also worried that foreign retaliation could hinder United States automakers from selling abroad.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, estimated that if partners do not retaliate, a 25 percent auto tariff would boost the size of the United States economy by 0.04 percent a year, adding 23,000 jobs in the process. Americans would buy 160,000 fewer vehicles in that time, he estimated, but domestic automobile production would increase by 300,000 vehicles because more of the cars purchased would be made in the United States.But if other countries were to retaliate with tariffs of their own, Mr. Zandi said, \u201cG.D.P. and jobs will decline.\u201dSeveral leading Democrats and Republicans criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s fondness for injecting confusion into trade matters.Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy \u201cstarts with bluster and it tends to end with uncertainty,\u201d said Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cThere\u2019s one arena in which measured responses are important, it\u2019s in the international trade arena. It\u2019s certainly going to have effects on investors and consumers.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the finance committee, called the talk of auto tariffs \u201cdeeply misguided.\u201d\u201cTaxing cars, trucks and auto parts coming into the country would directly hit American families who need a dependable vehicle,\u201d he said.Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, who has criticized Mr. Trump for exposing farmers and ranchers to retaliation from trading partners, said the president was \u201ctrading away our long-term interests in exchange for short-term headlines.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any coherence to either the trade policies that he\u2019s pursuing or how he engages our trading partners in the work of negotiating the agreement,\u201d he said.Milan Schreuer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies were frustrated that they, once again, had no advance warning of the new narrative, making it more difficult to discuss it adequately as surrogates on television.The president\u2019s tweets on Thursday had far more formal and legalistic language than his typical morning messages to the world, which often include words in all capital letters and are punctuated with exclamation points. \u201cMoney from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. It was not immediately clear whether the tweets were composed by Mr. Trump or if they were written by one of his attorneys or advisers, which happens on occasion.\u201cImagine if that came out on October 15th, 2016, in the middle of the, you know, last debate with Hillary Clinton,\u201d Giuliani told Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cCohen didn\u2019t even ask. Cohen made it go away. He did his job.\u201dMr. Cohen had worked for Mr. Trump for a decade and has said he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for him. Mr. Trump, however, treated Mr. Cohen poorly over the years, people familiar with their relationship have said.Paul Seamus Ryan, vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause, said the latest explanation of the payment \u2014 that Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen \u2014 does not eliminate the possibility that the payment violated campaign finance laws.\u201cA lot of contradictions coming out of Team Trump this morning,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in an interview with The New York Times.\u201cThis payment was to influence the election,\u201d he added. And he said new details about the payment and repayment could raise additional legal problems because it might violate campaign finance laws about straw donors that prohibit making a donation in the name of another person.Maggie Haberman in New York contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S.-China Trade Talks End With Strong Demands, but Few Signs of a Deal", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Senior Chinese and American officials concluded two days of negotiations on Friday with no deal and no date set for further talks, as the United States stepped up its demands for Chinese concessions to avert a potential trade war.The American negotiating team, which included Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the United States trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, headed for the airport after the talks and did not release a statement. But a list of demands that the group took into the meeting called for reducing the United States\u2019 trade gap with China by $200 billion over the next two years and a halt on Chinese subsidies for advanced manufacturing sectors.The demands, which spread on Chinese social media and were confirmed by a person close to the negotiations, suggested that both sides hardened their positions this week despite the two days of talks. Senior Chinese officials and their advisers were also sending a deliberate message to the West that the days of Beijing being conciliatory were over, and that China was staking out its own position in the negotiations.The person close to the negotiations insisted on anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities.The extensive list of United States trade demands was unexpectedly sweeping, and showed that the Trump administration has no intention of backing down despite Beijing\u2019s assertive stance in the last few days. \u201cThe list reads like the terms for a surrender rather than a basis for negotiation,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University.Here are the highlights of the demands:China must \u2026\u25a0 Cut its trade surplus by $100 billion in the 12 months starting in June, and by another $100 billion in the following 12 months.\u25a0 Halt all subsidies to advanced manufacturing industries in its so-called Made In China 2025 program. The program covers 10 sectors, including aircraft manufacturing, electric cars, robotics, computer microchips and artificial intelligence.\u25a0 Accept that the United States may restrict imports from the industries under Made in China 2025.\u25a0 Take \u201cimmediate, verifiable steps\u201d to halt cyberespionage into commercial networks in the United States.\u25a0 Strengthen intellectual property protections.\u25a0 Accept United States restrictions on Chinese investments in sensitive technologies without retaliating.\u25a0 Cut its tariffs, which currently average 10 percent, to the same level as in the United States, where they average 3.5 percent for all \u201cnoncritical sectors.\u201d\u25a0 Open up its services and agricultural sectors to full American competition.The United States also stipulated that the two sides should meet every quarter to review progress.Chinese officials put the talks in a positive light. \u201cThe two sides agreed that a sound and stable China-U.S. trade relationship is crucial for both, and they are committed to resolving relevant economic and trade issues through dialogue and consultation,\u201d Xinhua, the official news agency, said soon after the talks ended.But the negotiations also highlighted key differences \u2014 and the American delegation\u2019s tight-lipped departure from Diaoyutai, the parklike enclosure of guesthouses where the talks were held, suggested that the two sides had made little headway in solving them.Before the trade talks began, people involved in China\u2019s policymaking said, Beijing was willing to act on some concessions previously laid out by President Xi Jinping. Among the most notable was a willingness to make it slightly easier for foreign automakers and financial services companies to compete in China.But China has its own demands. Beijing wants the United States to relax restrictions on exports of high-tech commercial products that may have military applications. During the trade talks here this week, Chinese officials also took issue with the penalties that American officials imposed last month on ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company, for repeatedly violating United States sanctions on Iran.The Commerce Department banned all shipments of American wares to ZTE, including chips and other equipment that are essential to many of the company\u2019s products. The move appears to have strengthened China\u2019s resolve to continue its drive for self-sufficiency and to curb imports in various high-tech fields.China\u2019s push to upgrade its technology accounts for many of its disagreements with the United States. The American document reiterated Trump administration calls for a broad halt of Chinese subsidies to manufacturers in advanced technology industries. And Chinese officials have defended the Made in 2025 program as essential to upgrading the economy and have said they would not agree to any limits on the Made in China program.Beijing has said it would be willing to reduce some trade barriers, but only if the United States also lowered trade barriers. Chinese officials particularly object to American limits on the export of high-tech goods that have both civilian and military applications, contending that these restrictions prevent sizable potential exports.They also objected to United States demands for a specific cut in the bilateral surplus. Li Gang, the vice president of the Commerce Ministry\u2019s research and training institute, said in a separate interview last month that a $100 billion cut in the surplus was \u201cimpossible.\u201d China\u2019s surplus has been widening lately as the United States economy grows fairly strongly and takes in more imports.The Commerce Department announced on Thursday in Washington that the trade imbalance with China had widened slightly in March compared with the same month a year ago, although it narrowed slightly compared with February, possibly for seasonal reasons.The lack of a deal this week, as well as the failure to schedule further talks right away, does not rule out the possibility that Chinese negotiators will visit the United States next month for further talks. One possibility that American officials have considered is whether China might send Vice President Wang Qishan, who is close to Mr. Xi, on a follow-up trip.So far, the Chinese side has been led by Liu He, a Politburo member who is also the vice premier for finance, trade and technology.Trade experts have been saying for weeks that Chinese officials would like to resolve the dispute with the United States so that they can go back to focusing on issues closer to home.\u201cThat\u2019s the immediate problem, because it\u2019s a headache for them that\u2019s distracting from a very pressing domestic agenda,\u201d said Christopher K. Johnson, a former C.I.A. officer who analyzed China and now holds the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The Beijing talks were unlikely to result in a comprehensive deal, but experts said they could still be a first step toward reaching some sort of accord.\u201cThere\u2019s no way our team is going to risk signing up to something without getting back here and making sure that Trump is happy with it first,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s also some optics where Trump wants to be seen standing with Wang Qishan and striking the deal.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019re still several jumps down the track from that.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congress Approves First Big Dodd-Frank Rollback", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A decade after the global financial crisis tipped the United States into a recession, Congress agreed on Tuesday to free thousands of small and medium-sized banks from strict rules that had been enacted as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to prevent another meltdown.In a rare demonstration of bipartisanship, the House voted 258-159 to approve a regulatory rollback that passed the Senate this year, handing a significant victory to President Trump, who has promised to \u201cdo a big number on Dodd-Frank.\u201dThe bill stops far short of unwinding the toughened regulatory regime put in place to prevent the nation\u2019s biggest banks from engaging in risky behavior, but it represents a substantial watering down of Obama-era rules governing a large swath of the banking system. The legislation will leave fewer than 10 big banks in the United States subject to stricter federal oversight, freeing thousands of banks with less than $250 billion in assets from a post-crisis crackdown that they have long complained is too onerous.Republican lawmakers and the banking industry cheered a measure they said would help unshackle banks \u2014 and the economy \u2014 from regulatory burdens.Paul D. Ryan, the House Speaker and Wisconsin Republican, said the bill\u2019s passage was a step toward \u201cfreeing our economy from overregulation.\u201d\u201cOur smaller banks are engines of growth,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBy lending to small businesses and offering banking services for consumers, these institutions are and will remain vital for millions of Americans who participate in our economy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bad bill under the guise of helping community banks,\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic minority leader, said during debate on the House floor on Tuesday. \u201cThe bill would take us back to the days when unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited an historic financial meltdown.\u201dThe Dodd-Frank bill was a Democrat-led initiative that passed with the support of just three Republicans and it has been under constant attack from Republicans ever since. Left-leaning lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio have blasted their more moderate colleagues, like Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, for supporting the legislation, and Democratic leaders have tried to prevent any lawmakers from crossing the aisle to support the bill.Ms. Pelosi and Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, wrote a letter to their House colleagues urging them not to support the bill. \u201cWe must not allow the G.O.P. Congress to drag us back to the same lack of oversight that ignited the Great Recession,\u201d they wrote.The overtures did not prevent several Democrats from crossing party lines in favor of the legislation \u2014 33 Democrats voted for it, and one Republican, Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, voted against it.Once the bill is signed by Mr. Trump, small and medium-sized banks will no longer be required to undergo \u201cstress tests\u201d aimed at measuring their ability to withstand a severe economic downturn. The legislation also offers a reprieve to big \u2014 but not behemoth \u2014 banks, allowing large institutions like American Express and BB & T to no longer be deemed \u201csystemically important\u201d and subject to stricter oversight.The bill also exempts some loan originators, including small lenders, from certain disclosure requirements under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Democrats say this will open the door to discriminatory practices because the rules required collection of credit scores, loan amounts and interest rates in an effort to expose redlining and lending discrimination.While the legislation does little to help the very largest banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, the Trump administration has been working behind the scenes through its regulatory agencies to weaken capital requirements and ease other restrictions on such firms.Republicans saw Tuesday\u2019s vote as merely the beginning, not the end, of the Dodd-Frank legislative rollback.For years, House Republicans have been pushing for a more significant overhaul of Dodd-Frank and last year passed the Financial Choice Act, which would have crippled the consumer bureau and revoked the Volcker Rule. However, that bill stood no chance of gaining Democratic support in the Senate and Republicans, looking to score a victory before the midterm elections, ultimately chose the pragmatic path of approving the bipartisan Senate legislation.Republicans, and some Democrats, say that the Dodd-Frank law has unnecessarily hurt small- and medium-sized banks that did not play a role in the financial crisis and have been collateral damage in Washington\u2019s campaign to corral their bigger brethren. They say the regulations have cut off the flow of credit to many Americans who depend on smaller banks for business and personal loans.Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the bill was a victory for Americans who depend on small banks and credit unions.\u201cThe Main Street banks and credit unions that these people depend on, they\u2019ve been suffering, they\u2019ve been suffering for years under the weight, the load, the volume, the complexity and cost of heavy Washington bureaucratic red tape,\u201d he said.Mr. Hensarling said he remained hopeful that the Senate would consider some of the other, smaller deregulation bills that the House has passed, but their fates remain uncertain.Aaron Cutler, a former senior policy adviser to House Republicans and now a partner at Hogan Lovells, said the bill was just a first step. \u201cHopefully this is the first of many legislative pieces to come that improve financial regulations,\u201d he said.Conservative groups that have been strong opponents of Dodd-Frank say more must be done to fix the regulatory overreach created by the crisis.\u201cThe legislation unfortunately leaves intact the bulk of Dodd-Frank, including its most crushing burdens on consumers, investors, and entrepreneurs,\u201d said John Berlau, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank. \u201cTo provide real financial relief for Americans, much more is required of Congress, the president and regulatory agencies.\u201dTo those who lived through the financial crisis, the deregulatory efforts have prompted concern.Sarah Bloom Raskin, who was deputy Treasury Secretary during the Obama administration, said she was worried about the cumulative effect of the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory efforts. She said that there has been a troubling lack of economic analysis about the policies that are being put in place.\u201cOverall resilience is being weakened in unexamined ways,\u201d Ms. Raskin said.Senior White House officials said after the bill passed that they hoped to get it to Mr. Trump\u2019s desk for signing before Memorial Day. While they would not say that it fulfilled the president\u2019s promise of repealing Dodd-Frank, they called it an important step toward ridding the economy of regulations that have held back growth.Earlier versions of this article incorrectly identified the name of the think tank where John Berlau is a senior fellow. It is the Competitive Enterprise Institute, not the Conservative Enterprise Institute.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Save the Saudi Golden Goose", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Wald is the author of \u201cSaudi, Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom\u2019s Pursuit of Profit and Power.\u201dFor almost 40 years, Saudi Aramco has operated with a tremendous degree of independence for a national oil company. That has worked well for the company and for the country: Aramco has prospered financially and almost single-handedly funded the Saudi state and the royal family.But that could all be changing. Mohammed bin Salman, the hugely popular crown prince, is reshaping his country, and he seems intent on putting his stamp on Aramco. There are signs that the government is exerting new control over Aramco\u2019s most fundamental decisions.This is a mistake. Too much interference could destabilize the company and, by extension, a large part of the Saudi economy. When it comes to the future of Aramco, the government in Riyadh needs to let the professionals do their jobs.Aramco is unique among national oil companies. Rather than seizing the company through nationalization, the Saudi government purchased Aramco from its American owners in transactions in the 1970s. The Saudi leadership in the 1970s insisted on a legal purchase to avoid disrupting a hugely profitable enterprise.After the purchase, the Saudi government essentially left the business to Aramco employees who were, at the time, a mix of American and Saudi managers. In less than a decade, Saudi executives took the reins. Many of them had worked their way up within Aramco starting when they were teenagers. The professional oilmen were in charge.The company was owned by Saudi Arabia, but it collected its own revenue and controlled its own finances. Ali al-Naimi, Aramco\u2019s chief executive from 1988 to 1995, told me recently that the Saudi finance ministry tried to co-opt the company\u2019s finances in the 1980s. \u201cWhat they wanted was all the income to come to the ministry and they dole out our expenditures,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said no way. The income comes to us and we give you royalty, taxes and dividends from our profits. We cannot have the income come to you directly.\u201dThe king at the time, Fahd, sided with Mr. Naimi, because he understood that Aramco\u2019s independence was vital to the success of the venture and thus the wealth of the Saudi state, people and royal family.Therein lies the problem. The company has always made its own decisions about its next steps. It is now waiting for direction from the outside. Even the identity of this \u201cshareholder\u201d is unclear. Who really owns Aramco? The official company line is that it is owned by the Saudi government. But what does that mean? Mr. Naimi made sure that the finance ministry stayed far away from Aramco\u2019s revenue, and although the oil ministry represents Saudi Arabia in OPEC, it does not determine Aramco\u2019s strategy.But right now, and for the foreseeable future, Saudi Arabia still depends on Aramco for its wealth, and the monarchy depends on that wealth for its power. Without a strong, independent Aramco, power could be precarious.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Lords Savage Brexit Plan, Enraging Euroskeptics", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut, after inflicting its 14th defeat on the government\u2019s legislative preparations for leaving the European Union, or Brexit, the low-key second chamber of Britain\u2019s Parliament has put itself at the heart of a fraught debate and become something unfamiliar: a big political stage.In vote after vote, this holdover from Britain\u2019s aristocratic history has acted as a brake on the government\u2019s Brexit plans, sending them back to the House of Commons where they could face uncertain, knife-edge votes.Defenders say the House of Lords is merely fulfilling its constitutional duty by asking lawmakers to think again, and by making sure they have the details right about how, precisely, Britain will untangle itself from the European Union.Hard-line critics, however, accuse the House of Lords of seeking to sabotage Brexit, which a majority of its members did not support in the first place. A majority in the Commons did not want Brexit either, for that matter, but the lawmakers there are beholden to their voters, and live in fear of the tabloid press.The lords, having no constituents to answer to, are more at liberty to oppose the plans now, or at least to make sure that Brexit does not invite chaos.All of this is significantly complicating life for the already embattled Prime Minister Theresa May, and has made the House of Lords the object of fury from Euroskeptics. On Thursday the main front-page headline of the pro-Brexit Daily Mail read: \u201cIt\u2019s time to pull the plug on the Lords.\u201dBy contrast, the current, ninth, Duke of Wellington, Charles Wellesley, was siding with \u201cFrance, Germany and the rest of the European Union,\u201d wrote the Express, which accused him of seeking to \u201cthwart the British electorate and stop Brexit,\u201d in defiance of the 2016 referendum in which Britons voted by 52 percent to 48 percent to quit the bloc.Nowadays, most of the 781 members of the upper chamber, known as peers, are political appointees, rewarded for a career in politics or public service with a lifetime place in the Lords that brings status and influence \u2014 as well as a desk and parking space in central London, and a daily attendance allowance of 300 pounds, about $400.Over the years the numbers grew (before falling back a little recently), as prime ministers secured seats for allies who have mostly done low-key work, revising legislation or sitting on expert committees.But with Britain still bitterly divided over the merits of Brexit, the House of Lords has focused attention on political weak spots in Brexit plans, particularly over moves to abandon a customs union with the European Union, an issue so contentious that it has divided and paralyzed the cabinet.Lords have proposed numerous amendments to the Brexit bill. But experts believe that, if the Commons overturns those amendments \u2014 as the government hopes it will \u2014 the Lords will in any case back down, as custom dictates, even before reaching the legal limits of its delaying power.\u201cI don\u2019t think they are doing anything constitutionally dubious,\u201d said Prof. Meg Russell, director of the Constitution Unit at University College London. \u201cThere is nothing that the Lords has done that is a direct challenge to the principle of Brexit.\u201d\u201cAll the House of Lords ever \u2014 or nearly ever \u2014 does is essentially to throw the question back to the House of Commons and say: \u2018Are you sure about this?\u2019 \u201d she added.The 2016 referendum approved withdrawal in principle but left the details to the government and Parliament, and the amendments proposed by the House of Lords have stayed within its powers by focusing on these, Professor Russell said.Whatever the constitutional niceties, around 150 hours of discussion over Brexit has strained the subdued civility that usually envelopes debates in the ornate gold-and-red decorated chamber of the House of Lords.During one speech, Roger Roberts, a Liberal Democrat member, argued that the powers that could be handed to the government in the bill were comparable to legislation in 1933 that helped Hitler\u2019s rise to power.A Conservative, Nicholas Fairfax, accused pro-European members of the chamber of being \u201ca fifth column for Brussels,\u201d a reference to traitors who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II.For her part, Mrs. May presides over a bitterly divided Conservative Party and lost her Commons majority in a general election last year. She is by no means guaranteed to win key votes when the legislation returns to the more powerful lower chamber.One particularly tricky amendment for Mrs. May would press the government to pursue a customs union with the European Union. That would ensure tariff-free passage of goods to and from continental Europe.It would also help avoid controls at the border between Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union. The return of a hard border, many fear, would destabilize a settlement that has brought years of peace.Mrs. May has failed to get her cabinet to agree on a British negotiating position over customs arrangements. Indeed, her own foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has described her preferred scheme, a complex plan she calls a customs partnership, as \u201ccrazy.\u201dSo fractured is the cabinet that, according to the BBC, Mrs. May has split her top team into two working groups to try to improve both the so-called customs partnership and an alternative option that would use technology to track goods and reduce the need for border checks.The intervention of the Lords is sensitive because, in the Commons, there may not be a majority for either of Mrs. May\u2019s plans. Elected lawmakers might prefer to keep the changes inserted by the Lords that suggest retaining something like the status quo.\u201cGovernments tend to get hot under the collar about the House of Lords when they know they are on shaky grounds in the Commons,\u201d Professor Russell said.Another key amendment would ensure that, were Parliament to reject the agreement Mrs. May hopes to strike on a Brexit trade deal later this year, lawmakers \u2014 not the government \u2014 would decide what happens next.That would prevent Mrs. May from threatening that, unless her plan is rubber-stamped by Parliament, Britain would be forced to leave without any deal. Lawmakers could instead vote against, then ask her to go back and renegotiate, for example.Mrs. May should have known trouble was brewing in the upper chamber, where Conservatives are outnumbered, partly because of changes around the turn of the century that reduced the number of hereditary peers, who often tended to side with the Conservatives.Historically, there have been frequent clashes between the Lords and the government, but until recently this normally affected center-left administrations, Professor Russell said.Now many peers are politicians and former diplomats who have devoted decades to building Britain\u2019s presence in Brussels, and who see their life\u2019s work crumbling beneath them.But the chamber also has prominent Brexit supporters who spent years criticizing the European Union, such as Norman Lamont, a former chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister, who wrote earlier this month that \u201cif peers continue their present reckless approach the only solution will be the replacement of the present House by a properly elected one.\u201dHis article was published by The Daily Mail, which on Thursday devoted two critical pages to the behavior of the Lords, in addition to most of its front page.Yet, as The Daily Mail\u2019s critics pointed out, in 2012 \u2014 well before the Brexit referendum \u2014 the newspaper described the idea of reforming the second chamber as \u201can utterly irrelevant distraction,\u201d while in 2003 it praised \u201cthe robustly independent Lords, which has proved a more effective check on an over-mighty executive than the Commons.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe, Again Humiliated by Trump, Struggles to Defend Its Interests", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 It is by now a familiar, humiliating pattern. European leaders cajole, argue and beg, trying to persuade President Trump to change his mind on a vital issue for the trans-Atlantic alliance. Mr. Trump appears to enjoy the show, dangling them, before ultimately choosing not to listen.Instead, he demands compliance, seemingly bent on providing just the split with powerful and important allies that China, Iran and Russia would like to exploit.And with each breach, it becomes clearer that trans-Atlantic relations are in trouble, and that the options are not good for the United States\u2019 closest European allies.However angry and humiliated, those allies do not seem ready to confront Mr. Trump, wishing to believe that he and his aides can be influenced over time. To some, it is reminiscent of what Samuel Johnson said of second marriages: a triumph of hope over experience.\u201cThe allies are certainly sick of this but don\u2019t seem to have an alternative,\u201d said Jeremy Shapiro, a former career State Department official now at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cThe Europeans are invested down a path of trying to please the president, not out of belief but more hope against hope that they will convince him,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd they only pursue this at such a level of embarrassment because they don\u2019t have an alternative.\u201dAt least for now. After their statement on Tuesday regretting Mr. Trump\u2019s response and promising to work with Iran to preserve the deal, the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany are to meet on Monday with Iranian officials \u201cto consider the entire situation,\u201d said the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian.Already, Mr. Macron spoke by telephone on Wednesday with his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani. Afterward the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace issued a statement saying that it was \u201cthe will of France to continue to enforce the Iran nuclear deal in all its dimensions,\u201d potentially widening a breach with the Trump administration.\u201cHe pointed out the necessity for Iran to do the same,\u201d the statement added.But the real question for the Europeans, Mr. Shapiro said, \u201cis not if they stick with the deal but will they stand up to the American effort to unravel it and take active measures to protect their companies and banks trading in Iran?\u201d That would be \u201can extremely confrontational stance,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s not clear that their companies really want that.\u201dWhile some think that they should double down on what has now become a pattern \u2014 keep talking to Mr. Trump and his aides, hoping to convince them of the need for trans-Atlantic solidarity \u2014 others have had enough.There are increasing voices for rupture within the European Union. In a reflection of the mood, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s bureaucracy, said that under Mr. Trump, the United States is turning its back on multilateral relations and friendly cooperation \u201cwith a ferocity that can only surprise us.\u201dHe told Belgium\u2019s Flemish regional parliament that Washington \u201cno longer wants to cooperate with other parts in the world,\u201d according to The Associated Press. \u201cAt this point, we have to replace the United States, which as an international actor has lost vigor, and because of it, in the long term, influence,\u201d he said.In Britain, Emily Thornberry, the Labour Party spokeswoman on foreign affairs, said on Tuesday that it was time for Europeans to stop \u201cthis long and unnecessary indulgence of Donald Trump.\u201dA senior adviser to the European Union, Nathalie Tocci, said that the Iran deal was a lost cause, because \u201cTrump and Europe have fundamentally different objectives.\u201dShe said that Mr. Trump \u201cis not interested in keeping a nuclear nonproliferation agreement but in regime change in Iran \u2014 it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\u201cWe have to stop being wimps,\u201d she added.On climate and trade, on international law, and on the importance of multilateral institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, the rift with the Trump administration is real, said Ms. Tocci, director of the Italian Institute of International Relations and a close adviser to the European Union foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini.\u201cCan\u2019t we defend what our own interests are?\u201d Ms. Tocci asked. \u201cThere is something as fundamental at stake here as the trans-Atlantic bond, because Europe can\u2019t exist in a nonmultilateral space,\u201d a world of competing nationalism and protectionism.\u201cIsn\u2019t it wiser,\u201d she asked, \u201cto temporarily part ways with the Trump administration?\u201d After all, she noted, something similar happened in 2003 over the American-led invasion of Iraq, yet relations were repaired when a new president came along.Ivo H. Daalder, a former American ambassador to NATO, sees such as break as inevitable. \u201cAt some point \u2014 after having pushed the Europeans on NATO, Paris, the Jerusalem embassy move, trade and now Iran \u2014 the Europeans will come to the conclusion that they\u2019re better off going their own way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that point is rapidly approaching.\u201dBut whatever the mutterings in Berlin, London and Paris, European governments currently show no palpable sign that they are ready to make that sort of separation.On the Iran deal, Britain, France and Germany have already said that they will uphold the terms and will work to keep Iran in the agreement, while trying to protect their companies.That is likely to include euro-based financing for some companies and efforts at legislation to block secondary sanctions from the United States.The European Union has a \u201cblocking regulation\u201d dating from 1996, designed as a countermeasure against United States sanctions against Cuba and Iran, and later only Cuba, that seeks to prohibit compliance with foreign-trade restrictions. But it is rarely used, it would have to be amended to deal with United States sanctions on Iran, and it would not entirely reassure companies that also trade with the United States.The French also say that they will use the time before the sanctions come back into force to seek American exemptions for some of their companies.Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Europe was \u201cincreasingly irrelevant.\u201d\u201cFrom Washington\u2019s perspective, the Europeans seem happy to kick the can down the road, which is effectively hollowing out the deal the Europeans spent 10 years trying to conclude,\u201d she said.If the Europeans \u201care not willing or able to put more teeth into talks with Washington,\u201d she said, \u201cwe risk becoming irrelevant on the political side, too.\u201dThere are also calmer voices, more resigned to adaptation. \u201cNobody thinks the trans-Atlantic alliance is over,\u201d said Pierre Vimont, a former French ambassador to Washington.\u201cBut how do we make it work with a U.S. leadership that doesn\u2019t want to play the role of leader?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow do we move ahead in a world, not without the U.S., but with an American leadership not willing to play its traditional role?\u201dThe hard part for Europe, Mr. Vimont said, would be saving the partnership with Washington while avoiding \u201cthe slow drift toward confrontation between Iran and its neighbors and Washington.\u201dWith Europe pushed by the United States to side with Iran on the nuclear deal and to side with China on the trade deal, he said, \u201cit\u2019s going to be very tricky.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "At the Royal Wedding, Something Green", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:This week, even the climate team is getting in on the royal wedding coverage. Also, is the biggest hurdle for electric cars the car dealerships themselves? And, a NASA climate program is at the center of a budget battle.Royal wedding viewers may have had a few questions as they watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex (a.k.a. Harry and Meghan) drive off from Windsor Castle after the ceremony to a reception at Frogmore House a mile or so away. Such as: As for the happy couple\u2019s borrowed car, Climate Fwd: is pleased to report that it was a zero-emissions vehicle.The car is a vintage silver-blue 1968 Jaguar E-Type Roadster with one crucial, and major, modification: Its famous six-cylinder gasoline-powered XK motor was replaced with an all-electric drivetrain.All of that was done without cutting or otherwise modifying the car\u2019s frame, and the new drivetrain weighs about the same as the old one, so there was no need to change the suspension. Such \u201cnondestructive modification\u201d is important, said Nathan Hoyt, a spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover North America, because while owners of vintage Jaguars may wish to switch to an all-electric drive, they may want to reinstall the gasoline motor to sell the vehicle.\u201cIt gives customers options without having to worry about doing permanent harm to the car,\u201d Mr. Hoyt said.A few other changes were made: the dashboard was swapped out with a new one with gauges to monitor electrical performance, the vintage incandescent headlights were replaced with more efficient LED bulbs, and the gas tank fill tube was removed in favor of an electrical coupling for charging the battery. Many viewers noted that the steering wheel was on the left-hand side; Mr. Hoyt said this particular car, a one-off prototype that was first shown last fall, was originally exported to the American market after it was manufactured 50 years ago.Jaguar Land Rover has been weighing reaction to it and may decide to go ahead with a program in which customers could order a new, all-electric E-Type or have their existing vintage car converted at the factory.Either way, an electric Jaguar won\u2019t come cheap. Mr. Hoyt said that a complete factory restoration of an E-Type that remains gasoline-powered typically costs about $390,000. An electric version would cost even more.But this week, three researchers in Europe found that there\u2019s another potential hurdle for electric cars to clear: auto dealers.What they found was striking: In 77 percent of visits to dealerships that stocked electric cars, the sales staff didn\u2019t even discuss the vehicles as an option. Many dealerships were \u201cdismissive\u201d of electric cars or provided incorrect information about the technology, instead steering customers toward conventional gasoline or diesel models.There were some fairly benign explanations for this, the lead author, Gerardo Zarazua de Rubens of Aarhus University in Denmark, said. After interviewing dealers and industry experts, he found that salespeople were often just responding to incentives. They work on commission and have to sell cars as quickly as possible. It can take up to four times as long to explain the ins and outs of electric cars to unfamiliar customers who might be anxious about things like range and battery life. So dealers often stick with what\u2019s easiest.\u201cDealer apathy is still a serious issue for EVs,\u201d Mr. McKerracher said. But, \u201cas EVs get cheaper and more prevalent, I expect this all to get resolved.\u201d Once automakers start introducing many more plug-in models, he said, \u201cthe amount of customer education that a dealer needs to do in order to make a sale starts to fall.\u201d\u201cIt may turn out that the biggest barriers for electric vehicles are not technical,\u201d Dr. Sovacool said, \u201cbut social and cultural.\u201dThe Trump administration appears to be trying to kill off a program that you may have never heard of, in what critics say is a sign of the administration\u2019s hostility toward climate science.At $10 million per year, the Carbon Monitoring System is dwarfed by the multibillion-dollar NASA missions that launch satellites into space. It pays for research that gathers information from Earth-observing satellites and other tools to measure the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, oceans and forests around the world.\u201cIf you wanted to mitigate climate change, and therefore wanted to manage carbon, you can\u2019t do it unless you can measure it,\u201d said George Hurtt, a researcher at the University of Maryland who was the science team leader for the program.Philip B. Duffy, the president and executive director of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts, said canceling the program would be \u201ca blow to climate science.\u201d The 65 projects funded by the program have produced nearly 300 research papers since 2010, when Congress created it.The move comes down to politics, said Eddie Bernice Johnson, Democrat of Texas, who serves as ranking member of the House science committee. \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious to anyone that has been paying attention that this program is being canceled because it tracks carbon pollution, and that information would be used in efforts to understand and respond to climate change,\u201d she said.The Trump administration\u2019s fiscal year 2018 budget called for the program\u2019s end, but Congress provided adequate funding in its omnibus spending bill. That funding would usually mean that the program would continue, but NASA appears to have interpreted things differently.Advertisement"}

But given its current incarnation as a conglomerate of right-wing nationalists, Randian zealots and Christian fundamentalists all laser-focused on repealing different aspects of the 20th century while consigning our children to spend their golden years in a fiery hellscape, the situation starts to look potentially cataclysmic. A New Zealand diplomat posted to Washington summed it up in a recent tweet, telling Democrats in rather undiplomatic language to get it together \u201cor we will all die.\u201dSo it\u2019s not surprising that people are starting to think about ways to break out. In his short, bracing book, \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority in American Politics,\u201d David Faris, an associate professor of political science at Roosevelt University, argues that Democrats should immediately use every lever they have to gum up the works in Washington, to ensure they win full control of government in 2020.Then, they should set about unrigging the system.To end gerrymandering, Faris says, they should scrap the winner-take-all method we use to elect members of the House and replace it with a system known as \u201cranked choice voting\u201d that better reflects voter preferences. To fix the problem of Democratic underrepresentation in the Senate, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico should get statehood, and California should be split into seven separate states. Democrats should add seats to the Supreme Court and fill them with progressives. And they should reform voting laws to ban onerous voter ID requirements, re-enfranchise ex-felons and automatically register everyone to vote.With the exception of the California gambit, which would first need a ballot initiative and an act of the state legislature, all of these ideas could be achieved through normal congressional legislation. There are, of course, some obvious political obstacles. The last Democratic effort to play hardball \u2014 a plan to force a government shutdown over the fate of undocumented immigrants brought to America as young people \u2014 fizzled when several red-state Democratic senators up for re-election this year got cold feet. It\u2019s hard to imagine those same senators would vote to create a bunch of new blue states.But Faris\u2019s overriding goal is less to plot out a precise legislative agenda and more to focus attention on the urgency of the crisis. And it\u2019s telling that the only reasonable objections here are practical ones. The idea that we should think twice about this kind of hyperpartisan power grab lest it erode the mutual trust needed for effective government might have been worth entertaining a decade or more ago. Today, with the future of the country and maybe the world on the line, that notion sounds far more absurd than seven Californias.Zachary Roth is the author of \u201cThe Great Suppression: Voting Rights, Corporate Cash, and the Conservative Assault on Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hand-Me-Down Plane That Crashed Reflects a Cuban Air Industry in Crisis", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Almost 40 years old by the time it crashed on Friday just outside of Havana, killing 110 people, the aging Boeing 737 had changed ownership nearly a half-dozen times, passing from operators in the United States to Canada, from Cameroon to the Caribbean.\u201cI actually flew that exact plane,\u201d said John Cox, the head of the consultancy Safety Operating Systems, who traced the aircraft\u2019s ownership back to 1979, when it was new and belonged to Piedmont Airlines, his former employer.Though the cause of the crash has not been determined, the plane itself is a powerful symbol of Cuba\u2019s troubled aviation industry. As tourism to the island surges, Cuba\u2019s national airline finds itself struggling to acquire enough planes to meet the demand and maintain its decrepit fleet.Cuba\u2019s economy has long been in shambles, and experts say the troubles plaguing its aviation sector stem from the same obstacles that have bedeviled the country for decades: economic mismanagement and the United States embargo of the island.Cuba\u2019s problems have gotten so bad that, a few weeks ago, the country grounded most of its domestic flights because of safety concerns over its fleet. To continue flying, officials have been forced to lease planes from foreign outfits that sometimes use decades-old planes, like the one that crashed and burned right after takeoff on Friday, killing nearly everyone on board.The old Boeing 737 had been leased to Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n, the state airline, by a relatively unknown Mexican company with just three aircraft in its fleet.Some aviation industry analysts were taken aback at the plane\u2019s advanced age.\u201cThat\u2019s one of the oldest passenger jets I have heard of that is still in service,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, an aviation and aerospace consulting company in Fairfax, Va.Though Mexican officials said the plane had passed safety inspections as recently as November, it is one of just 100 of its model still in circulation across the globe, reflecting the limited options the Cuban government has in order to continue operating its state airline.\u201cWhether the airline is going to survive is an open question,\u201d said George Farinas, a retired Delta pilot who works as a civil aviation inspector and is writing a book about the history of Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n. \u201cThey are in a major crisis right now.\u201dMr. Farinas said that Cuban officials even decided in the past against working with the Mexican company, Damojh Aerol\u00edneas, also known as Global Air, after the flight crew that came with the lease got lost in the air on one trip. But they eventually reversed the decision, he said, \u201cprobably out of desperation.\u201dAdel Yzquierdo Rodr\u00edguez, Cuba\u2019s transportation minister, said Saturday that Cubana had been renting the plane for less than a month from Damojh, and that under the rental arrangement, the Mexican owner was responsible for the aircraft\u2019s maintenance.Analysts sometimes disagree about which is more to blame for Cuba\u2019s troubled aviation industry: the American embargo of the island or the country\u2019s own history of economic mismanagement.Some experts say the sanctions have crippled the nation\u2019s ability to gain access to the vendors and financing needed to get new aircraft. The Cubans themselves have made the case numerous times, blaming the decades-old sanctions for their aging planes, which include Russian-made aircraft that are difficult to find parts for.\u201cIf it were not for the embargo, they would be able to access a robust capital market for financing Western aircraft,\u201d said Samuel Engel, the senior vice president at ICF Consulting and an expert in the international airline industry.But many analysts say that, while a process is involved, Cuba can indeed get access to such markets, as well as planes.\u201cThe embargo does play a role in inhibiting business with Cuba, but there are policies to promote the sale of aircraft,\u201d said Dallas Woodrum, an associate at Akin Gump in the firm\u2019s Washington office. \u201cWhether businesses decide to take advantage of that is a different question, and a matter of their risk tolerance and what type of reward they see.\u201dCuba also suffers from a cash flow problem that further hinders the purchase of international goods \u2014 a product of the sanctions but also, critics say, its poor stewardship of the economy.\u201cThe challenge is that they don\u2019t manage the industry well,\u201d said Emilio Morales, president of the Miami-based Havana Consulting Group, which focuses on the Cuban economy. \u201cThe business requires capital; it requires financing to maintain the planes.\u201dFounded in 1929, Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n was once the pride of the Caribbean, replete with modern planes and top-flight maintenance. But as with so many elements of Cuba\u2019s infrastructure and transportation, that progress began to slowly, and then suddenly halt, following the revolution, economic sanctions and, later, the fall of the Soviet Union, which had helped keep the nation afloat financially.Cars hailing from the 1960s roll down pockmarked streets, past unpainted buildings and under worn bridges. And while the government has maintained its commitment to social services, whether free health care or education, money has grown scarce.That reality has set in for the airline industry, leaving the state airline with limited options to upgrade old planes or get new ones.Cubana has struggled with a spotty safety record in the past \u2014 including several crashes in the late 1990s that left scores dead. The tragedies include crashes in Ecuador, Guatemala, Venezuela and off the island\u2019s southeast coast.Friday\u2019s crash occurred just after noon, following the plane\u2019s departure from Havana for the eastern city of Holgu\u00edn. Emergency workers and nearby residents raced to the scene, where the battered remnants of the plane kicked up plumes of thick smoke, trying to rescue survivors.Ramiro Santana Mart\u00ednez, 46, a construction worker who lives about 50 yards from the crash site, said he was near his house when he heard an explosion, quickly followed by a second one.He joined neighbors and strangers who converged on the smoldering husk of the plane, looking for survivors. Mr. Santana said charred bodies, some dismembered, were scattered across the site; some had been thrown clear of the wreckage.A volunteer rescuer spotted movement under some fallen branches: a woman\u2019s hand. Mr. Santana and others rushed to help pull the crying woman out and get her to an ambulance. She was burned and bloodied but conscious.Mr. Santana said he also helped pull out two other people, both men, who were breathing at the time but inert. Cuban officials said three women ended up surviving the crash, though they were in listed in \u201cextreme critical\u201d condition on Saturday.Mr. Yzquierdo, the transportation minister, said that among the 110 dead were 99 Cuban passengers, two Argentine passengers and two passengers from a disputed area of the Western Sahara.Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Yzquierdo, said that 15 victims had been identified so far, including 10 adults and five children.Those on board the plane included five crew members, all Mexican. As part of its contract, Cubana hired them to operate the aircraft, an agreement known as a wet lease. There was no specific mention of their condition as of Saturday afternoon, but the three survivors identified by the Cuban government did not include the crew members.Leticia Nu\u00f1ez, the sister of the flight\u2019s captain, Jorge Luis Nu\u00f1ez Santos, said that her family had only heard the information reported in the media, and had not received any further details from Mexican authorities. Ms. Nu\u00f1ez said she assumed the worst, but was still waiting for official confirmation.\u201cSometimes crew members change, someone gets in late \u2014 we don\u2019t lose hope, we can\u2019t,\u201d she said in an interview over Facebook.Abigail Hern\u00e1ndez, another Mexican crew member, posted a picture on her Facebook page last February in which she is seen standing and smiling in front of a red telephone box, with the comment: \u201cHappy to get to know the world.\u201dThe transportation minister explained that it was \u201cnormal\u201d for the Cuban government to rent airplanes.\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cBecause it\u2019s convenient and also because of the problem of the embargo we face, which means we sometimes can\u2019t buy planes, the planes we need, and we have to rent them.\u201dFrances Robles contributed reporting from Key West, Fla., and Paulina Villegas from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Cuts Tariffs Ahead of U.S. Commerce Secretary\u2019s Visit to Beijing", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China announced Thursday evening that it would cut tariffs sharply on July 1 for an eclectic array of imported goods, the latest in a series of moves by Beijing to dismantle steep trade barriers at a time of rising frictions with the United States.The tariff cuts came less than two days before Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is due in Beijing for wide-ranging talks aimed at addressing American frustrations with China\u2019s $375 billion bilateral trade surplus with the United States. But the categories the Chinese Finance Ministry selected for tariff cuts cover few American goods, and appeared to be targeted at China\u2019s goal of developing sophisticated industries rather than low-value mass manufacturing.The moves came as China and the United States, the world\u2019s two biggest economies, continued their wide-ranging economic and diplomatic sparring. The countries have alternated between attacking each other over trade issues and working together on efforts to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons. At times, President Trump has praised his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at other times he has swiftly criticized Beijing for its trade practices, sometimes in quick succession.In its latest action, China is making a modest peace offering, without really giving up much.Some of the 1,449 categories of goods slated for tariff cuts involve food products from other countries, like fish, olives and grilled seaweed. Other categories include low-value manufactured goods like handbags and certain inexpensive garments, typically made in factories that have already been shifting from China to lower-wage competitors like Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Vietnam.Chinese workers\u2019 wages have soared over the past 15 years, and Beijing is engaged in a broad effort to steer the economy toward high-wage industries like semiconductors and away from factories making garments and handbags.\u201cThe goods seeing cuts are not relevant to trade with the U.S.,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a trade specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. \u201cFor China, it fits the goal of moving up the value chain \u2014 heavy subsidies for semiconductors and now less protection for textiles and consumer appliances.\u201dChristopher Rogers, a trade analyst at Panjiva, an international commerce data firm recently acquired by S.&P. Global Market Intelligence, estimated that the tariff cuts would cover about 1.1 percent of China\u2019s $1.95 trillion in annual imports. \u201cThe cuts are more to do with keeping a lid on inflation and improving consumer spending power than to do with keeping President Trump happy,\u201d he said.The Chinese move could nonetheless have political benefits for Beijing.China is energetically trying to rally other governments to its side in its showdown with the United States. Beijing\u2019s latest move could assuage concerns from many European countries and developing nations about their own trade deficits with China as well as loss of manufacturing jobs. At the same time, trade ministers elsewhere have been deeply troubled by the Trump administration\u2019s moves to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from around the world.But by cutting tariffs in more than 1,000 lightly traded categories, China could end up reducing its average tariff considerably without actually running the risk of a big surge in imports.Mr. Xi, China\u2019s president, had called during a speech in April for cuts in Chinese tariffs on imported cars and some consumer goods, as part of Beijing\u2019s long-term policy of gradually opening to international competition.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly at one point to President Xi Jinping of China.

Has anybody managed to create so much chaos so fast?\u201cRudy is a great guy, but he just started a day ago,\u201d Trump said on Friday, referring to the lawyer he hired last month. \u201cHe\u2019ll get his facts straight.\u201dYes, world, here\u2019s my new high-powered lawyer who\u2019s going to straighten out the debacle that is my presidency. I have total confidence that he\u2019ll eventually figure out how to discuss the case accurately.Giuliani made headlines this week when he went on Fox News and delivered a surprise announcement \u2014 that Trump had reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen for that $130,000 porn star payoff.It was a stunning revelation to all Americans who had believed Cohen\u2019s claim that he raised the money by borrowing against his home equity line of credit.But the point was to try to eliminate any suspicion that the $130,000 involved a campaign finance law violation. \u201cMoney from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll (sic) in this transaction,\u201d twittered Trump. As only he can.\u201cThis was for personal reasons,\u201d Giuliani told \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cThis was the president had been hurt, personally, not politically, personally so much. And the first lady, by some of the false allegations, that one more false allegation, six years old.\u201dWow, Trump\u2019s new lawyer talks just like him.So it comes down to this: The $130,000 that Stormy Daniels got to keep quiet during the campaign was from Trump. But it was not an illicit campaign contribution. Nonono, it was simply a charitable attempt to protect Melania from a broken heart.To come to this conclusion you would only have to do two things:A) Forget that on Thursday Giuliani said it had to be paid because \u201cImagine if that came out \u2026 in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton.\u201dB) Conclude that in buying off Stormy, Donald Trump was much, much more concerned about his wife\u2019s feelings than about getting elected president.Trump and Giuliani go way back. They\u2019re New Yorkers with lots in common, including three wives each, and a history of messy public breakups. (Trump carried on the adulterous affair that ended his first marriage, a story he promoted to the New York tabloids. Giuliani once announced his separation to the press corps before he told his wife.)The president reportedly bragged that he was hiring \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d as his first line of defense. It was, of course, a reference to Giuliani\u2019s role leading New York City after 9/11. During a recovery made even more difficult by the fact that Rudy had insisted on putting the city\u2019s emergency command center in the World Trade Center, which had already been bombed by terrorists once and which the police warned was a terrible location.Both men hyped their post-9/11 activities, each in his own special way. Trump seems to have imagined he visited the ruins immediately after the attack. Rudy did go there repeatedly, taking visitors to watch the workers who were laboring to clear the site in the toxic dust without protective gear.Back then, what would you have said if someone told you that Mayor Giuliani would eventually devote his legal skills to defending President Donald Trump from a porn star scandal? Yet here we are.Part of their rapidly evolving line of defense involves Trump giving Michael Cohen a kind of monthly retainer that he could dip into any time somebody needed to be paid off. \u201cThese agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth,\u201d Trump tweeted.O.K., Trump base, how does that hit you? It\u2019s not surprising that you\u2019ve pretty much ignored the sex scandal. But do you want a president who thinks of himself as a member of the untouchable elite \u2014 folks who\u2019ve got their own faithful retainers trotting at their heels, tossing out money to make unpleasant things like cranky ex-lovers go away?Giuliani\u2019s ability to put his foot in his mouth is so spectacular, you kind of expect him to be recruited by Cirque du Soleil. In a sit-down with Sean Hannity, he threatened to \u201cget on my charger and go right into their offices with a lance\u201d if investigators \u201cgo after Ivanka.\u201d Asked about her husband, Giuliani said that Jared Kushner was probably \u201ca fine man. \u2026 But men are, you know, disposable.\u201dO.K., this is offensive. On behalf of all the women of America, I want to say that we do not appreciate the suggestion that we have a right to get off the hook just because of our gender. And since Ivanka seems to think of herself as a feminist, I suggest that she volunteer to be immediately interviewed by the special prosecutor just to strike a blow for equality. \u2610Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blurred Lines Between Journalists and What We Cover", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 60______\u201cI\u2019m a foreign correspondent for The New York Times,\u201d I told her. \u201cI can\u2019t really help because at some point, somewhere, there\u2019s a good chance I may cover what you do.\u201dI always feel bad trying to explain journalistic detachment in such moments, and I often get looks of confusion in response.Young people in particular tend to question the limits that many of us at The Times take for granted: no marching for a cause, no advocacy and no giving or accepting of travel or gifts when dealing with sources or organizations that have an interest in news coverage.We are expected, in short, to avoid the \u201cappearance of bias\u201d and maintain a sense of healthy detachment from what we cover.But I believe in the limits. I think they make for better, more trustworthy (if still imperfect) journalism \u2014 and I\u2019ve been thinking more about that here in Australia because I often see them challenged.This week, a few examples come to mind:\u2022 Checkbook JournalismLet\u2019s start with Barnaby Joyce, the (former) deputy prime minister.The heat he\u2019s taken this week for accepting $150,000 from the Seven Network for an interview alongside Vikki Campion \u2014 his partner and former staff member who is the mother of his newborn child \u2014 is just the latest example of the mess made when money and access mingle.Watching the criticism that led him to take a leave of absence, I found myself wondering what was part of the negotiation. Would the public be getting a less candid interview if the price for access had been $50,000? Would we get more if it was $200,000? (These are Australian dollar amounts, in case you\u2019re wondering.)\u2022 The Lucrative Revolving DoorWhat about the other ways that journalists and government cozy up to each other?Neither seemed to be punished by their audiences or their bosses.Maybe that\u2019s just a function of a partisan media culture, where many politics reporters and editors have also acted as political advisers, or gone back and forth between both worlds. The revolving door is not unique to Australia \u2014 George Stephanopoulos worked in the Clinton White House before joining ABC News \u2014 but it\u2019s definitely common and accepted here.John Garnaut\u2019s case is also interesting.There\u2019s value, of course, in subject-specific expertise, but when there are so many blurred lines between government and journalism, it can be hard to figure out whether what we\u2019re learning from what we read or watch includes all the relevant details, or just those that serve a particular argument, political party or paying client.\u2022 The Junket IndustryThe calls and emails no longer surprise me: At least three or four times in the past year, a well-meaning and interesting Australian organization has offered to fly me somewhere and pay for my hotel accommodation so I could witness what it does.In every case, I\u2019ve said no and politely explained that our ethics guidelines forbid that sort of thing except in the most extreme circumstances (military flights in war zones, for example).I\u2019ve also turned down a number of freelance pitches that would have been financed by those seeking coverage \u2014 again, explaining that accepting payment from an organization or cause we are covering creates a problematic expectation of positive coverage, making it harder for us to be seen as dispassionate observers.I honestly don\u2019t know how common it is for journalism in Australia to be financed by those with a vested interest, but anecdotally, it seems to be on the rise. In a conversation with one of the organizations offering me a trip, I asked why and was told that with Australian media outlets making cutbacks, junkets were often the only way they could cover certain issues.In the latter case, in Good Weekend, there was a note providing much-needed transparency, stating, \u201cTim Elliott and Kate Geraghty traveled to Guatemala and Mexico with Australia for UNHCR, an Australian charity that raises funds to support the U.N. refugee agency.\u201dI couldn\u2019t see any sign of bias in the article, and I\u2019m sincerely torn about whether this kind of thing is cause for concern. If it was a choice between a story about Central America or no story at all, I suppose I would choose the story, with an explanation of who paid for the journey.But what all these examples show is that the boundary between source (or interest group) and journalist can be shaped, if not erased, in ways that threaten to hamper candid reporting.Given the context, saying no to signing a petition for Doctors Without Borders may seem extreme. And maybe it is. But when there are so many forces pushing journalism to abandon independence and nonpartisan storytelling, you have to draw the line somewhere.______It\u2019s changing Britain in ways big and small, as eight years of budget-cutting make the country look less like the rest of Europe and more like the United States, with a shrinking welfare state and spreading poverty.Peter S. Goodman\u2019s piece is one of many on the way that will look at Britain\u2019s moment of profound challenge in a post-Brexit world.______We published a special section this week on 30 of the world\u2019s greatest visionaries, those who are combining passion with science, technology, creativity and innovation.Meet five people using medical and scientific breakthroughs to improve the quality of life, from cancer to the white rhino.______Something about the reality of this really pleased me, both for those I\u2019ve been to and those I have not yet visited.______My \u201cTrump of the Week\u201d idea in last week\u2019s newsletter clearly bombed.

{"Headline": "Una Pizza Napoletana Returns to New York, With an Assist", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUna Pizza Napoletana is back.This news may be, at best, casually interesting to the average restaurant-goer in a city where the number of Pizza Restaurants Worth Caring About is well into the double digits. But for those who know the pizzeria \u2014 which has previously operated in three successive locations in New Jersey, the East Village and, for the past seven years, San Francisco \u2014 it is something else.In the trajectory of most restaurants, this would be viewed as an easy win for customer and cook alike. But Una Pizza\u2019s legend has been built on the astringent minimalism of its aesthetic and offerings, and the promise that Mr. Mangieri himself would, in his monastic and magical way, make every pie until he ran out of dough, which he still does every night.He has, until now, always worked almost alone. \u201cMe, I just make pizza,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou come eat pizza, who else is going to be making it? It\u2019s my pizzeria. I didn\u2019t think of it any other way.\u201dMr. Mangieri, 46, said he had been long contemplating an evolution, with some reservations. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve been able to pull it off\u201d \u2014 meaning food that is not hot and round \u2014 \u201cat the same level of what I already know I know how to do.\u201dThat concern is central to his choice to go into business with Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske Valtierra \u2014 young, celebrated cooks at the advent of their careers. Also, Mr. Mangieri said, \u201cof all the people that I met, they make decisions based on the beautiful aspects before the financial aspects. And most of these other people present a good case, but the reality is on the back end they\u2019re making decisions like Walmart\u2019s.\u201dMr. Stone said eating Mr. Mangieri\u2019s pizzas in the East Village restaurant more than a decade ago helped him appreciate, as an aspiring cook, that simplicity and pure intention could be as powerful as the cooking at the flashy multi-starred places he looked up to back then.\u201cAnthony said when he opened, he was trying to be very respectful of Neapolitan pizza,\u201d Mr. von Hauske Valtierra said. \u201cAnd now with the years he\u2019s been doing his own thing, the dough is very unique to him, and how he constructs the pizzas.\u201dThe chefs are looking to the flavor profile and ideas of Italy, but \u201ctrying to see what would be a tiramis\u00f9 if I\u2019ve never been to Italy and if I had the idea of it,\u201d Mr. von Hauske Valtierra said.There is some discussion that eventually, maybe, someone else could make the pizza. This has happened only once in Una Pizza\u2019s history, and, by Mr. Mangieri\u2019s account, the results were tragic. But a pileup of pressures have made him change his way of thinking about his craft.\u201cI\u2019m just physically and mentally not capable of doing, like, 150 pizzas a night anymore. It\u2019s just so consuming,\u201d he said. The ordering, the cleaning and the one-man-restaurant shtick became too much. \u201cIf the floors were being mopped, I was there.\u201dMr. Mangieri mentioned a chef he admires: Her daughter grew up doing homework in the restaurant and falling asleep on the banquettes \u2014 then went off to college estranged, and resentful of being raised in a dining room. Mr. Mangieri\u2019s daughter, Apollonia, has already spent many nights at his restaurant in San Francisco.\u201cI can\u2019t be a good dad or a husband either, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cNot for the level that I want it to be at.\u201dHe considered moving to \u201ca nice town in New Jersey\u201d \u2014 he is from the state and it sounds as if he will one day return \u2014 and opening a small-scale incarnation of Una Pizza a few nights a week. But the idea felt like a near-retirement, and a financial reality that he and his wife (who helped run the pizzeria in San Francisco) can\u2019t afford. It seems that Mr. Mangieri wasn\u2019t ready to abdicate his throne as a pizza master.He wanted to self-finance his New York reboot \u2014 he never had investors at the previous restaurants \u2014 but said that returning to the city was \u201csomewhat scary, honestly.\u201d He looked for partners who could help him take on the insane cost of opening a Manhattan restaurant in 2018, and found them in the team behind Contra and Wildair. Their support allowed a bigger, more ambitious restaurant (with about twice as many seats as the previous locations), and a chance for Mr. Mangieri to focus exclusively on pizza-making.It remains to be seen what diners and critics will make of Mr. Mangieri\u2019s midlife trust fall and the Contra-Wildair partners\u2019 first foray into running a kitchen together.When the crowd was let in and shown to their seats, a few veteran customers walked to the back of the space to visit Mr. Mangieri, who was standing outside the glass-walled, Popemobile-esque pizza-making station where he works.\u201cWelcome back,\u201d one customer said. \u201cWelcome home,\u201d said another. And then it was time to make the pizzas.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the name of a pizza with smoked mozzarella at Una Pizza Napoletana. It is Ilaria, not Illiana.Advertisement"}
