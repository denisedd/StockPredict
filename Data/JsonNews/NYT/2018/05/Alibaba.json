{"Headline": "A Temporary Cease-Fire in CBS\u2019s Fight With Redstones: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Shari Redstone\u2019s response to the CBS lawsuit.\u2022 A tough road ahead for the Trump administration on trade.\u2022 Who doesn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s lifeline to ZTE?Less than an hour before hearing, Ms. Redstone issued a change to the CBS bylaws that would grant her more control of the network\u2019s board. Under the new rules, decisions on dividends would need to be approved by a \u201csupermajority\u201d of CBS\u2019s board. That likely would have blocked a potential move by most of CBS\u2019s board to issue a special dividend to water down the Redstones\u2019 voting stake to 17 percent from 79 percent.The change to bylaws is now on hold: The judge said on Wednesday that he would issue his legal opinion on Ms. Redstone\u2019s change to the bylaws in his decision on Thursday.Ahead of the hearing, Ms. Redstone\u2019s National Amusements filed its legal response to a CBS lawsuit, seeking to prevent her from blocking a special meeting of its board on whether to water down her controlling stake.Here are some of the notable parts of the filing by lawyers for National Amusements:\u2022 On CBS\u2019s contention that Ms. Redstone intends to replace its board because of its resistance to a deal: \u201cN.A.I. does not have, and has never had, any intention of replacing the CBS board or taking other action to force a merger.\u201d\u2022 Why Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery should reject a CBS board move to dilute the Redstones\u2019 voting power to 17 percent from 79 percent: \u201cThis is an unprecedented usurpation of a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting power.\u201d Later, Ms. Redstone\u2019s lawyers add, \u201cThis court has held that, absent a compelling justification (which is non-existent here), a board of directors breaches its fiduciary duty of loyalty by acting for the primary purpose of diluting a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting rights.\u201d\u2022 The revelation of which CBS director National Amusements had suggested was involved in questionable activity. The filing includes an affidavit by Robert Klieger, a CBS board member and lawyer for the Redstones (whom other directors have argued is working on behalf of Ms. Redstone), regarding a call he had had last week with Bruce Gordon, the head of the CBS board\u2019s special committee:Specifically, I noted National Amusement Inc.\u2019s discomfort with the continued CBS board position of Charles K. Gifford given certain incidents that took place in 2016 and 2017. I also discussed the possibility of facilitating Mr. Gifford\u2019s exit from the CBS board with minimal disruption and public attention, including, in the event of a merger of CBS and Viacom, through his potential non-appointment to the board of a combined company.\u2022 A lament for what Ms. Redstone is her current predicament:\u201cPlaintiffs have forced CBS\u2019s controlling stockholder into a position of having to make a Hobson\u2019s choice\u2014of either accepting massive dilution of its voting power (thereby losing control of the company and suffering the economic detriment to its stake that entails), or acting as a stockholder to prevent such dilution and protect its voting power, knowing that doing so might trigger the departure of (and payment of massive parachute payments to) key management and directors of the company.CBS filed a response to National Amusements saying that Ms. Redstone\u2019s opposition to the special meeting is proof that CBS need a temporary restraining order.\u201cUnless restrained, defendants will use the consent process to replace directors or amend bylaws in advance of Thursday\u2019s board meeting.\u201dThe context\u2014 Michael de la MercedSenate Democrats narrowly won a vote on Wednesday to save so-called net neutrality rules.Cecilia Kang of the NYT reports:The Senate passed a resolution in a 52-47 vote to overturn a decision last December by the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle Obama-era rules that prevented broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast from blocking or speeding up streams and downloads of web content in exchange for extra fees. The commission\u2019s repeal of net neutrality is set to take effect in a few weeks.The rare victory for Democrats is sure to be short-lived, with a similar resolution expected to die in the House, where Republicans have a larger majority. Only three Republican senators voted in support of the resolution.Apple has quietly explored the idea of opening a campus for 20,000 employees in Northern Virginia, further advancing the possibility that the Washington area could evolve into an East Coast outpost for Silicon Valley.His planned appearance in Brussels highlights the breadth of the international concern over how Facebook failed to prevent political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica from obtaining and using the data of many as 87 million of its users.His visit will involve a closed-door session with leaders of the European Parliament\u2019s various blocs and the head of the body\u2019s civil liberties committee, which is holding hearings on Facebook\u2019s practices, as well as a stop in Paris, where Mr. Zuckerberg is set to have lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss a range of issues.\u2014 Prashant S. Rao and Sheera Frenkel\u2022 The job comes with big challenges. Whoever becomes C.E.O. will have to work across three companies with 1.2 million employees and develop solutions to bring down costs in a multi-trillion dollar industry. The group will also be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints\u201d That means whoever takes the job will have to \u201chandle the requisite long hours, extensive travel and public scrutiny of running a high-profile start-up, but probably without the allure of a big stock incentive plan, which is typically an attractive incentive in tech recruiting.\u201d\u2022 At Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting, Warren Buffett said the partnership hoped to announce a hire \u201cwithin a couple of months.\u201d But he seemed uncertain, though not unhopeful, about the effort as a whole.\u201cWhether we can bring the resources, bring the person, that C.E.O., is terribly important. Bring the person, support that person and somehow figure out a better way for people to continue to receive better medical care in the United States,\u201d he mused. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that will happen.\u201dLachlan Murdoch will become the chief executive officer and co-chairman of Fox, if Disney completes its deal for most of 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets, the company announced on Wednesday.Lachlan Murdoch currently serves as 21st Century Fox\u2019s executive chairman. Rupert Murch will be the other chairman of the new Fox.Top trade officials in the White House have tried to separate any discussions on ZTE from trade negotiations with China, calling it an enforcement action, not a trade dispute.The New Economy Forum is designed for a world where China\u2019s ascent looks unstoppable. So it\u2019s in Beijing, rather than the Swiss Alps. Participants include the former Treasury secretary Hank Paulson, Henry Kissinger, Janet Yellen and Gary Cohn.\u201cDavos has been around for a long time: It is a very big conference and it is focused on lots of world problems. This conference is focused on the world and China as an emerging power and how we all work together.\u201dThe famed author died yesterday at 88.

{"Headline": "How Much Is That Sneaker in the Window?", "Date": "2018-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo walk into the 3,000-square-foot Stadium Goods store in SoHo is to be confronted by rows and rows of pristine, shrink-wrapped athletic footwear. Look closely and you might be a little stunned by the price tags.This is clearly not Foot Locker.Sneaker fanatics have been around for decades, with swaps and buys largely happening on eBay or as personal transactions. But it\u2019s only in the last few years that the reseller market has accelerated and gone sharply upscale. John McPheters, who co-founded Stadium Goods with Jed Stiller, says the shift has been driven by \u201cmen who are now learning from childhood how to treat fashion as a sport \u2014 the way that women have always treated fashion.\u201dThe point is not utility, but rather about expressing identity. \u201cSneakers are the single most flexible and acceptable way to communicate personality for these new shopping-obsessed men,\u201d Mr. McPheters said.\u201cWith its advanced technology platform that is highly regarded in the luxury industry, we believe Farfetch is a terrific partner to help us expand our global reach,\u201d Mr. McPheters said in a statement when that deal was announced.Before starting Stadium Goods, Mr. McPheters did marketing and business development for Flight Club, a sneaker consignment shop, and later ran social media accounts for Nike while employed at the creative marketing agency Team Epiphany. Mr. Stiller had been an investor in various New York nightclubs. The two had previously done another start-up, Swarm Mobile, a retailing app, that was sold to Groupon in 2014.The demand for collectible sneakers and streetwear is particularly fervent in China, Mr. McPheters said, adding that he got his first taste of that market\u2019s potential when a Chinese customer dropped $10,000 in a single spree at the Stadium Goods store. \u201cOften, the shoes they want were never available in their country,\u201d he said.He and Mr. Stiller seized an opportunity to enter the market early, launching a brand page on Alibaba\u2019s TMall platform in 2016 just a year into its business.The partners believe the future of sneaker retail will be a hybrid model combining traditional channels and aftermarket selling. \u201cWe\u2019re a microcosm of what\u2019s hot,\u201d Mr. Stiller said, noting that in the sneaker world what\u2019s trending is not necessarily the newest item. \u201cWhere a lot of retailers are dependent on what brands are releasing at the moment, we\u2019re not. Ninety-five percent of our stock are styles that are no longer on the market.\u201dStadium Goods is hardly the only player in this fast-growing field, of course.With hot sneaker styles costing $300 and up, \u201cthe last thing you want to be spending your money on is fakes,\u201d said Eddy Lu, a co-founder and chief executive officer. \u201cFor us, it was let\u2019s build something that solves the growing problem of counterfeits and fakes.\u201dIt\u2019s built for the casual sneaker enthusiast looking for a good strike price on coveted Yeezys \u2014 like getting the Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Cream White when it is selling for $380 (original price $220) and not, say, $560 \u2014 but also for those who think of sneakers as a portfolio investment. \u201cWe\u2019re an evolution of eBay,\u201d Mr. Luber said. He added that StockX is now bringing in about $2 million a day in gross merchandise volume.\u201cAfter that, we allowed seven people who bought the shoes to resell without even touching the product,\u201d Mr. Luber said. \u201cThat\u2019s like true day trading.\u201dThese companies are shaking up how the resale market but they suffer from constraints, said Matt Powell, NPD Group\u2019s sports industry analyst.One issue is just how big this market is. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to tell what the true size is because there are always going to be transactions between two private individuals,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a $1 billion market like many are saying it is.\u201d He points to the math: \u201cWhen I look at the sneakers that are resold and then add a factor of three because of the higher resale value, I\u2019m getting closer to $300-$500 million.\u201dWith total sneaker sales in the United States around $38 billion last year, the resale market is still relatively minor, he said.The other obstacle to major growth is inventory; the major resellers specialize in limited-release styles. \u201cIf the manufacturer starts to get greedier,\u201d by increasing the product, \u201ca flood of inventory would crash the market,\u201d Mr. Powell said. Indeed, a glut of Jordans in early 2016 drove that resell market down.The resellers seem largely aware that sneakers can only take them so far. \u201cYes, our main business is sneakers right now but we\u2019re a stock market for things,\u201d Mr. Luber, said. StockX already sells watches, and streetwear from Supreme and Kith. The company has plans to roll out more product from streetwear designers like Fear of God. (Mr. Powell noted that streetwear has the same constraint: \u201cWhat really drives the streetwear market is most of those items are, again, limited in quantity.\u201d)But where the slick new resellers may have a leg up is their combination of product, content and convenience, said Joe La Puma, senior vice president of content strategy at Complex who hosts \u201cSneaker Shopping,\u201d a sneaker program on YouTube.\u201cThe industry is becoming more professionalized but also I\u2019m seeing that the customer is getting choosier about what sneaker he or she wants,\u201d Mr. La Puma said. \u201cSo instead of buying sneakers, say, every week, they\u2019re saving up to buy one shoe they really want.\u201dThat kind of cachet matters in this world and the top resellers all have it, Mr. La Puma emphasized. Sneakerhead consumers pay attention to what celebrities are wearing, he said.\u201cSpecifically, Kanye West, Travis Scott, ASAP Rocky, Virgil Abloh and Jared Leto are influential in their own circles,\u201d he said. \u201cNot every shoe starts out super special. There\u2019s the chance that if one of these celebrities wears it, it may then become super hot.\u201dAn earlier version of this article omitted the given name of the co-founder and chief executive of GOAT.

And although they are familiar with the American delegation\u2019s main players, they are less acquainted with who does what among lower-level advisers and officials when it comes to United States trade policy.\u201dGrowth in the solar industry is estimated to be about 11 percent lower than projections before the tariffs. Those diminished prospects are what prompted SunPower to bulk up its operations by pursuing the purchase of SolarWorld.\u201cThe industry is in a scramble to figure out what all of the impacts are,\u201d said Rob Freeman, chief executive of Tradewind Energy, which is based in Kansas outside Kansas City and develops industrial-scale solar and wind projects. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say it could be worse. I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s a significant negative.\u201dLet\u2019s recap:\u2022 Elon Musk dismissed a question from Sanford Bernstein\u2019s Toni Sacconaghi about capital expenditures and said, \u201cBoring, bonehead questions are not cool.\u201d\u2022 After RBC Capital Markets\u2019s Joe Spak asked about Model 3 reservations, Mr. Musk said that he\u2019d talk to retail investors because analysts\u2019 questions were \u201cso dry.\u201d\u2022 When asked if Tesla should keep its electric car charging network to itself as a strategic asset, Mr. Musk said, \u201cI think moats are lame.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein:\u201cTesla\u2019s Q1 earnings call was a unique experience, to say the least. For those who missed it \u2013 halfway through the call, CEO Elon Musk abruptly declared that our questions were \u2018boring\u2019 and \u2018not cool,\u2019 and pivoted to a 20-minute back-and-forth with a retail investor from YouTube. Beneath the bizarre theatrics, however, we see Tesla\u2019s Q1 as in-line with expectations on most metrics, including revenues, gross margins, and free cash flow.\u201dAdam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley:\u201cTo be clear. Tonight\u2019s conference call didn\u2019t go very well. Feedback we have received from investors during and following the call support this view. Irrespective of the Tesla CEO\u2019s annoyance with the genre of questions he was receiving from the analyst community, we note that an important part of Tesla\u2019s success has been its relationship with the capital markets in funding its ambitious plans.\u201dRyan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan:\u201cGiven that the market has seemed somewhat less focused on cash burn than we have been, initially we believed that the 1Q performance \u2014 combined with forceful management guidance for a strong 2H inflection in revenue, margin, and cash flow \u2014 would be enough to elicit a modestly positive reaction in the shares Thursday. Instead, we expect TSLA to fall today after CEO Elon Musk dismissed multiple analyst questions as \u2018dry\u2019 and \u2018boring\u2019 (including questions probing what we feel are key topics, such as profitability of the Model 3 and the company\u2019s capital requirements).\u201dAlexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Jaffray:\u201cManagement strongly rejected the need for new equity, while trimming its capex forecast and guiding for profitability in 2H. Model 3 choppiness notwithstanding, these results initially looked like a modest positive vs. bearish expectations. But then Elon Musk began dismissing analysts\u2019 questions and decided instead to field TWELVE questions from a YouTuber because it was \u2018way more interesting.\u2019 The unorthodox behavior sparked an after-hours sell-off. We still recommend TSLA, but in the next few months especially, we would expect significant volatility.\u201d\u201cIn March 2016, Iconix publicly announced a $169 million write down of Rocawear, and in March of this year, Iconix announced a further write down of $34 million. The S.E.C.\u2019s application states that the Commission seeks Carter\u2019s testimony to inquire about, among other things, Carter\u2019s joint ventures with Iconix.\u201dThe S.E.C. issued a subpoena in November seeking Mr. Carter\u2019s testimony, and a second subpoena in February after Mr. Carter changed lawyers.\u201cCarter failed to appear as required by the subpoenas and, through his counsel, Carter has declined to provide any additional dates on which he will agree to appear for investigative testimony.\u201dHenry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, K.K.R.\u2019s co-chairmen and co-C.E.O.s, said:\u201cKKR\u2019s conversion from a partnership to a corporation is designed to broaden our investor base, simplify our structure and make it easier to invest in our shares. We believe this change, together with continued strong performance, will increase our ability to generate significant long-term equity value for all of our shareholders.\u201dThe new structure will become effective on July 1.The announcement came a K.K.R. reported first-quarter results.Critics\u2019 cornerTom Buerkle of Breakingviews writes:\u201cThe real potential is in the valuation uplift that may come from more investors being able to buy KKR stock and analyze it like a traditional money manager. Along with other alternative asset firms, KKR trades around 10 times the next 12 months\u2019 forecast earnings, far short of BlackRock\u2019s multiple of more than 17 times.\u201dScreenshots from the company\u2019s internal chat service obtained by Gizmodo show a darkly comic mood in anticipation of the call. One employee shared bleakly titled Spotify playlists in Slack featuring songs like \u201cHigh and Dry\u201d by Radiohead, \u201cThe End\u201d by The Doors, and \u201cHelp!\u201d by The Beatles.Our picks? \u201cClosing Time\u201d by Semisonic and \u201cIt\u2019s the End of the World As We Know It\u201d by R.E.M.One problem: That delegation is split over how to negotiate, and even what to ask for. And Beijing has continued counterpunching.Your Xiaomi cribsheet: Much of its growth has come outside China, particularly in India. But the gross profit margins on its devices are just about 8.8 percent. (The latest iPhones\u2019 margins: an estimated 60 percent.)A deal open to any investors, rather than just wealthier, accredited ones, could open up the company\u2019s executives to more scrutiny, a timely concern given the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s recent focus on I.C.O.s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worried About Big Tech? Chinese Giants Make America\u2019s Look Tame", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Forget Google versus Facebook. Forget Uber versus Lyft. Forget Amazon versus \u2026 well, everybody.The technology world\u2019s most bruising battle for supremacy is taking place in China. And it could point to Big Tech\u2019s future everywhere else, too.Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group are ratcheting up their no-holds-barred contest to dominate the ways 770 million internet users communicate, shop, get around, entertain themselves and even invest their savings and visit the doctor.The two titans long ago branched out from their core businesses \u2014 games and social media for Tencent, e-commerce for Alibaba \u2014 to duke it out in ever more realms of Chinese life. They have competed in messaging, microblogging and delivering takeout. They go head-to-head in video streaming and cloud computing.But in the internet realm, China still offers a spooky potential vision of the future, one in which online behemoths like Tencent and Alibaba become the gatekeepers to the entire economy, wielding immense power over traditional industries and becoming very, very rich in the process.\u201cSometimes I think, \u2018Ah, we\u2019re competing in this now, too? All right then,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ma said, chuckling. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201d\u201cAs profitability reduces, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Now I need to monetize my customer base,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rajgopal said. \u201cThe innovation we\u2019re seeing in China could be seen in the U.S. in the next three to five years,\u201d he added. \u201cCustomers are demanding that.\u201d\u201cIf you can become so big, and so successful in so many areas, this in itself shows that you must have maintained very good, very friendly relations with the government,\u201d Mr. Hu said.Neither giant is done getting bigger.Each has a market capitalization of close to $500 billion, making them among the most highly valued technology firms on the planet. Google and Facebook still claim more users, but the Chinese heavyweights arguably do more \u2014 and more, and more \u2014 for theirs.They have both funded ventures that offer online education, make electric cars and rent out bicycles. For the giants, such initiatives represent new opportunities for people to use their digital wallets \u2014 Ant Financial\u2019s Alipay and Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay \u2014 and new ways to collect data on consumer behavior. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein counted 247 investment deals by Tencent in recent years and 156 by Alibaba, though given the pace of the companies\u2019 deal-making, they said their database was \u201clikely to be perennially incomplete.\u201dOnce the companies have locked people into their payment systems, they can become the enablers of commerce and financial services of even more kinds. In a sign of investors\u2019 excitement about the possibilities, Ant Financial is making plans to go public, in a blockbuster stock offering that could give the company a market value larger than Goldman Sachs\u2019s.China has become a model for tech\u2019s world-swallowing tendencies partly out of circumstance.With the country\u2019s high-speed churn of well-funded start-ups, planting flags on new turf is often the only way for large players not to be constantly losing ground.\u201cThe whole China internet market is way more competitive than the U.S. market,\u201d said Xiaoyan Wang, an analyst at 86Research in Shanghai. \u201cEveryone is trying to expand their presence in every sector.\u201dAlso, both Alibaba and Tencent have struggled to make much money outside their home market. That means their surest way to keep growing is to get more deeply involved in more areas of their Chinese users\u2019 lives.In a report this week, Morgan Stanley predicted that by 2027, the total market in China in which Alibaba could be making money will be worth $19 trillion \u2014 more than Amazon\u2019s potential market worldwide.At the moment, both Chinese giants are hustling to find more ways for people to transact using their wallet and not the other\u2019s. Alibaba\u2019s shopping sites and physical stores do not allow users to pay for stuff with WeChat. Tencent-backed companies, such as the retailer JD.com or the service platform Meituan-Dianping, either downplay Alipay as a payment option in their apps or do not accept it at all.Whether any of this will give either camp an enduring lead in payments is unclear. Eric Wen, the founder of Blue Lotus Research Institute, expects them to end up at roughly 50-50.The payments contest will at least propel both companies to keep expanding their kingdoms, including overseas. Alibaba is pouring billions of dollars into online shopping ventures in India and Southeast Asia. Tencent is backing start-ups around the world that have even a distant chance of enriching its ecosystem.George Favvas did not know too much about Tencent before it invested in his company in San Francisco, Circle Medical, whose app lets users summon doctors on demand. He also had no specific plans to take his business to China in the near future, if ever.\u201cMy first question was, \u2018Why are you interested in us?\u2019\u201d Mr. Favvas said.He gets it now, he says. \u201cThey\u2019re just such a big player, and health care is so broken,\u201d Mr. Favvas said. Tencent, he added, is interested in health care for the same reasons companies like Amazon and Apple are.\u201cIf anything, they\u2019re a couple of years ahead.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Feel the Squeeze as Xi Jinping Tightens His Grip", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "The government in China, long suspicious of internet companies, now sees ambitious titans like Tencent and Alibaba as useful partners.Supported byBEIJING \u2014 For the last decade or so, China has defied the truism that only free and open societies can innovate. Even as the Communist Party has kept an iron grip on politics and discourse, the country\u2019s technology industry has grown to rival Silicon Valley\u2019s in sophistication and ambition.As Mr. Xi starts his second term, the Chinese government, which once viewed the internet primarily as a threat to its stranglehold on information, is harnessing big tech companies\u2019 capital and knowledge to realize its broader goals for the country.At a time when the Trump administration is moving to counter China\u2019s tech prowess, Beijing\u2019s heavier hand could pose its own threat to the country\u2019s competitiveness, and to the innovation that has transformed Chinese firms into global heavyweights.For China\u2019s government, WeChat, the country\u2019s most popular messaging and social media service, has become a key tool for policing what people say and do. Political activists have reported being followed based on WeChat conversations; chat records have turned up as evidence in court. The e-commerce titan Alibaba, meanwhile, is helping city authorities manage traffic.In scientific research \u2014 a focus for Mr. Xi as economic growth becomes harder to sustain \u2014 tech giants have joined with government institutes to run labs in fields like quantum computing, deep learning and human-computer interaction. Soon, Chinese citizens may even be able to use their accounts on Tencent\u2019s and Alibaba\u2019s apps as digital versions of their national ID cards.American tech firms also do business with governments, of course. And they, too, are sometimes asked to hand over user data to law enforcement agencies.But in the United States, disagreements can be hammered out in court. China\u2019s judiciary is controlled by the Communist Party. Making themselves useful to the government is often the price that Chinese firms must pay for regulatory and financial blessings \u2014 even for the very right to exist as a business.Phoenix subsequently removed that portion of the interview from its website. A Sogou spokesman declined to comment.For many years, as Chinese companies became major players in online services, telecom gear, drones and more, the government neither boosted them nor meddled much in their operations. Now, though, as Beijing aims to make China a world technology leader, it is trying to steer private companies more directly, particularly in research and development.The government\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan, which seeks to upgrade national capabilities in electric cars, robotics, semiconductors and other advanced industries, is a big factor behind the spiraling trade tensions with the United States.Divvying up an industry before it has matured risks stifling competition, though. And shoehorning companies into specific activities could discourage them from exploring others.\u201cHaving the state define and pick winners and losers is not how long-term sustainable innovation really happens,\u201d said Tai Ming Cheung, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies technological development in China.Countries that have tried it, from the Soviet Union to Japan, \u201chaven\u2019t really fared well over the long run,\u201d Mr. Cheung said.China\u2019s record is mixed.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 What will Apple do with all that cash?\u2022 What happens after the imported metal tariff delay?\u2022 Why C.E.O.s might need to be more outspoken on social issues.\u2022 How the T-Mobile C.E.O.\u2019s success might be a mixed blessing.That\u2019s the sum Apple intends to spend on buying back its own stock. It sounds like a lot, but Apple has a huge stock market value and investors have grown accustomed to it repurchasing a large portion of its stock.Here\u2019s how it stacks up.If Apple spent $100 billion on its shares at the current stock price, it would buy back 571 million shares, equivalent to 11 percent of the company\u2019s total shares outstanding.Would investors be impressed with an 11 percent reduction? It depends on how quickly Apple carries it out. In the last five years, Apple\u2019s shares outstanding have fallen by 24 percent. In theory, then, if Apple completed the latest program in two years, it would be more or less on track with that five-year period.But Apple may move more quickly. In the three months through the end of March, Apple bought back $23.5 billion of shares, an unusually large sum by the company\u2019s standards. Executives are sometimes reluctant to repurchase shares if they look overvalued. And Apple\u2019s C.F.O., Luca Maestri, said on a conference call Tuesday that Apple wanted its buybacks to be \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201cefficient.\u201d But he also said he wanted them to be \u201cfast.\u201d- Peter EavisInvestors expected Apple to announce a large share repurchase program heading into this quarter\u2019s earnings, and the iPhone maker didn\u2019t disappoint. Apple announced a new $100 billion buyback program.The coffers of corporate America are straining under the weight of spare cash. And none more than Apple. Apple was forced to pay taxes on more than $250 billion held overseas as part of the tax overhaul President Trump signed into law late last year.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Apple reported a net income of $13.82 billion for its fiscal second quarter, up 25 percent from a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $2.73, above analysts expectations of $2.67 per share.\u2022 Revenue increased 16 percent to $61.1 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected sales of 60.82 billion.\u2022 Revenue from its services business hit a record of $9.2 billion.\u2022 Apple sold 52.2 million iPhones in the quarter, up 2.9 percent from a year ago.\u2022 Revenue from iPhone sales increased 14 percent from a year ago to $38.03 billion.\u2022 Apple\u2019s cash pile shrank to $267.2 billion from $285.1 billion at the end of its fiscal first quarter.Snap\u2019s recent redesign of its Snapchat app didn\u2019t go over well with its users. Now it is impacting its results.Nellie Bowles of the NYT writes:Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, cited Snapchat\u2019s redesign as a major factor for the disappointing performance.\u201cA change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,\u201d he said, referring later to \u201cheadwinds from the redesign.\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s decision on Monday to hold off on imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on a number of countries came as the United States is engaged in a separate trade battle with China and is negotiating changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.From the time the tariffs on steel and aluminum were announced in late February, they seemed the least promising part of Mr. Trump\u2019s combative trade policy. Not only were the measures directed in part at allies, the European Union and Canada among them, the administration convinced few with their argument that imports of the two metals were threatening national security.And when announcing the tariffs, the Trump administration immediately granted temporary exemptions to certain countries. The move suggested loopholes and concessions might be available, an impression that will likely persist after Mr. Trump on Monday extended negotiations with Mexico, Canada and the European Union for 30 days.The new deadline may help push along Nafta negotiations with Mexico and Canada, but the European Union is becoming a big problem for Mr. Trump\u2019s trade agenda. The bloc has gained another reprieve from the steel and aluminum tariffs and apparently has given up nothing.And the European Union\u2019s stance has hurt Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs strategy in another crucial way. The tariffs were said to be a cudgel to persuade allies to back the United States in its trade actions against China. The European Union, which shares some of the United States\u2019 frustrations with China\u2019s trade practices, may eventually back Mr. Trump against China. But the longer the tensions between the European Union and the United States persist, the less likely it is that they align.\u2014 Peter EavisAnd the delay poses a risk, per Ana Swanson of the NYT:It could fuel criticism that Mr. Trump is more bark than bite and increase the pressure on the White House to squeeze concessions from other nations.\u201cThis is an example of the kind of control we think you should have,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s something privacy advocates have been asking for \u2014 and we will work with them to make sure we get it right.\u201dWaiting to be interviewed for the British channel ITV News, Mr. Coupe, presumably unaware that the cameras were rolling, undercut the official line with an impromptu performance.\u201cWe\u2019re in the money. The sky is sunny. Let\u2019s lend it, spend it, send it rolling along.\u201dThe reaction on Twitter was predictably acerbic.Company chiefs increasingly wade into political issues like gun control and climate change. But a poll suggests they may not be moving fast enough.\u2022 64 percent say C.E.O.s should lead change rather than waiting for government action.\u2022 56 percent \u201chave no respect for C.E.O.s who remain silent on important issues.\u201d\u2022 All age groups expect C.E.O. to be personally visible in explaining a company\u2019s purpose and vision.The independence and protection of its users\u2019 data is a core tenet of WhatsApp that Koum and his co-founder, Brian Acton, promised to preserve when they sold their tiny start-up to Facebook. It doubled down on its pledge by adding encryption in 2016.Before joining the Trump administration as communications director, he quit the investment firm, having struck a deal to sell it to HNA of China. But the White House job lasted 10 days, and now the deal with HNA is off, too, so he\u2019ll come back as co-managing partner.More from Brooks Barnes of the NYT:Jeannie Suk Gersen, a professor at Harvard Law School who specializes in gender and sexual harassment issues, said Ms. Judd\u2019s complaint is notable because it \u201cspeaks to the fact that this is not just a sexual issue \u2014 that, beyond physical and emotional harm, it also involves economic harm.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tibetan Tried to Save His Language. China Handed Him 5 Years in Prison.", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 A Tibetan businessman who campaigned to preserve his native language from the encroaching dominance of Chinese was sentenced to five years in prison on Tuesday, after a contentious prosecution based on interviews that he gave to The New York Times.The businessman, Tashi Wangchuk, heard the verdict in Yushu, a heavily Tibetan town in Qinghai Province, northwest China, his defense lawyers, Liang Xiaojun and Lin Qilei, said by telephone. Mr. Tashi had warned that there and across many historically Tibetan areas in China, the Tibetan language was threatened by official policies to make Mandarin Chinese the language of schooling and government.\u201cTashi already told us before the verdict that he wanted to appeal if he was found guilty,\u201d Mr. Lin said. The two lawyers were not at the hearing in the remote town, but said Mr. Tashi\u2019s family told them of the verdict.\u201cJust two members of his family were allowed in to hear the verdict,\u201d Mr. Liang, the other lawyer, said. \u201cAt the hearing, Tashi was asked if he understood the verdict. He said, \u2018Understood\u2019 but didn\u2019t say much more.\u201dThe guilty verdict came as no surprise. China\u2019s Communist Party-controlled courts rarely find defendants in criminal trials innocent, and virtually never do so in politically charged cases like this.But human rights organizations and advocates of Tibetan self-determination promptly denounced the verdict as a sign of the Chinese government\u2019s growing intolerance of critics of its ethnic policies, even relatively mild ones like Mr. Tashi.\u201cHe has been criminalized for shedding light on China\u2019s failure to protect the basic human right to education and for taking entirely lawful steps to press for Tibetan language education,\u201d Tenzin Jigdal of the International Tibet Network, a coalition of groups supporting Tibetan self-determination, said in an email.A spokeswoman for the State Department, Heather Nauert, said: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed that the Chinese government convicted Tashi Wangchuk.\u201dThe Chinese Communist Party for decades maintained policies intended to keep ethnic minorities, especially Tibetans and Uighurs, under political control while giving them some space to preserve their own languages and cultures. But under Xi Jinping, the staunch Communist Party leader who came to power in 2012, China has adopted more assimilationist policies, designed to absorb these minorities into the fold of one Chinese nation.They added: \u201cFree exchange of views about state policies, including criticism against policies and actions that appear to have a negative impact on the lives of people, need to be protected.\u201dYushu, called Gyegu in Tibetan, is one of the predominantly Tibetan areas of China that lie outside the official Tibetan Autonomous Region, and the government has encouraged increasing use of Chinese language in schools and official settings across these areas.\u201cIn politics, it\u2019s said that if one nation wants to eliminate another nation, first they need to eliminate their spoken and written language,\u201d Mr. Tashi said in the video. \u201cIn effect, there is a systematic slaughter of our culture.\u201dTodd Stein, a former United States State Department official who dealt with China and Tibetan issues, said by email that the prosecution of Mr. Tashi raised difficult questions about how journalists should report on people whose views may rile the Chinese government.\u201cThey face the conundrum of how to report a story without becoming part of it, when the government is all too willing to use the story to punish the subject of the story,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cThe bad actor here is the Chinese government, which is punishing Mr. Wangchuk for nothing more than asserting his legal rights to protect his own language.\u201dMr. Tashi told Times journalists that he did not support Tibetan independence and just wanted the Tibetan language to be taught well in schools, and for Tibetan to be used in government offices. Asked about the risks of speaking out, Mr. Tashi had insisted on doing on-the-record interviews, saying that only those would give force to his words.\u201cNo one would want to live in an environment that\u2019s full of pressure and fear,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut I have no choice, because the whole Tibetan nation and culture is facing a situation and risk of disappearing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The other is a financial powerhouse with few offerings for everyday consumers.Now they\u2019re trying to join forces.Apple and Goldman Sachs have been working for months on a new credit card product that would bear the Apple Pay brand, according to two people familiar with the companies\u2019 talks. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were continuing.The product would be Goldman\u2019s first credit card offering and could help the bank\u2019s effort to expand its consumer products. For Apple, the deal could help it extend its Apple Pay brand, the technology giant\u2019s digital payment service.The two companies have been talking for months and haven\u2019t settled on all the details, said one of the people.Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. Christine Monaghan, an Apple spokeswoman, also declined to comment.The new card would fit into the suite of consumer products that Goldman recently began offering, like a savings account and an array of personal loans through its consumer banking service, Marcus. Goldman hopes to use those new products to reduce its reliance on trading revenue in the years to come.The card could help Goldman insert itself into the lives of iPhone users, who represent a far broader swath of consumers than the company now serves, and eventually open them up to the other services the bank has to offer.\u201cThis seems to make sense,\u201d said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, \u201cIt\u2019s just one piece of a much bigger puzzle that is forming that is Goldman Sachs\u2019s consumer finance business.\u201dPart of Goldman\u2019s recent consumer buildup has focused on credit cards. In December, the bank hired a team from a credit card start-up called Final. In April it bought a mobile app, Clarity Money, that helps users search for the best credit card deals. It has been downloaded a million times.Apple already has one branded credit card, offered by Barclays. That card allows users to earn points they can use for Apple gift cards or for financing the purchase of new Apple products.Apple executives have said they aim for Apple Pay to eventually replace cash and plastic as the primary way to pay. But Apple\u2019s payment service has a long way to go. One of the people familiar with the discussions between Apple and Goldman said that taking Apple Pay into the physical world would help expand its reach. With an Apple Pay credit card, loyal iPhone users could use Apple Pay even in places that don\u2019t yet accept digital payments, the person said.\u201cIt\u2019s such a competitive credit card marketplace right now, especially for higher end folks,\u201d said Matt Schulz, a CreditCards.com analyst. \u201cThe Apple Barclays card isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s going to turn that person\u2019s head, in terms of making them want to get a card.

But today, there is a Walmart within 10 miles of 90 percent of the population of the United States, leaving little room for expansion.A historically frugal company that has done very few deals of significance, Walmart is now spending billions as it seeks new overseas markets, tries to capture different demographics and bolsters its grocery offerings.Scott Mushkin, a retail analyst at Wolfe Research, said he worried about the wisdom of Walmart\u2019s desire to attack Amazon\u2019s strongholds.\u201cThey seem to be somewhat Amazon obsessed,\u201d he said.July 2016JD.com PartnershipJan. 2018Rakuten PartnershipApril 2018ASDA SaleMay 2018Flipkart AcquisitionIndia is the golden frontier of digital retailing to Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon.

After the Flipkart deal, the company shares sank more than 3 percent.Walmart is begging for Wall Street\u2019s patience. The company has been reordering its international business to free up cash and resources so that it can focus on high-growth markets and leave those that are lagging.In China, Walmart is deepening its ties and taking a small stake in JD.com, which competes with Amazon and the country\u2019s own e-commerce giant, Alibaba.While such moves make sense on the grand chessboard of global retailing, Walmart will need to deliver. It is going to cost billions for Walmart to turn Flipkart into a profitable business.The deal will cut into Walmart\u2019s overall earnings by about 60 cents per share next year.Oct. 2017Parcel AcquisitionMarch 2018Grocery DeliveryEverybody has to eat, and that essential truth is embedded in Walmart\u2019s growth strategy.Walmart is the largest grocery store in the United States and when it comes to fresh food it has a major head start on Amazon, which has been ramping up its efforts after acquiring Whole Foods last June.But mastering food delivery is a steep challenge for Walmart.The company has experimented with partnerships with Uber, and store workers are making deliveries on their way home from work.\u201cThe grocery business is hard,\u201d said Bill Dreher, a retail analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group. \u201cOnline grocery is even harder.\u201dAug. 2016Jet AcquisitionMarch 2017Modcloth AcquisitionJune 2017Bonobos AcquisitionKelly green golf pants.

{"Headline": "Xiaomi, Chinese Gadget Maker, Opens Floodgates for Hong Kong I.P.O.s", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A gadget maker. An online delivery service. And the electronic payment company tied to the tech giant Alibaba.These are among a spate of Chinese companies expected to open their doors to ordinary investors in Hong Kong over the next year through public listings, after a loosening of rules by the city\u2019s stock exchange. If many of them end up listing in Hong Kong, then China will have accomplished a major goal: keeping its hugely successful tech boom at home.The flurry of big-name Chinese companies potentially choosing to stay home, rather than go abroad, in search of funding is part of a broader push by China, which has sought to develop homegrown champions in an array of sectors. But the new regulations, which allow companies to retain more control, have also been criticized as an encroachment by Beijing on Hong Kong\u2019s legal system and corporate governance standards.Xiaomi, the gadget maker, announced on Thursday that it would list in Hong Kong, the first company to do so after the rule changes.\u201cThere has been somewhat of a campaign to bring companies home and remove them from foreign jurisdictions,\u201d Mr. Webb said.While Hong Kong is officially a special administrative region within the People\u2019s Republic of China, and has a separate legal and financial system, Beijing sees it as a part of the mainland. Some of China\u2019s biggest and most exciting technology start-ups, like Didi Chuxing, the ride-sharing rival to Uber, and Ant Financial, the financial arm of Alibaba, are making plans to go public over the next year.In the past, Chinese entrepreneurs like Jack Ma of Alibaba chose to list their shares in markets, like New York, where they could operate as if their companies were still private. They were able to offer so-called dual-class shares, which give shareholders little say in the operations of the business.Until last week, Hong Kong, which has stricter rules than New York, had not allowed such listings. In its filing on Thursday with Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange, Xiaomi appeared to be taking advantage of the new rules.The company, whose low-cost smartphones have won a loyal following not just in China but in other emerging markets like India as well, said it would raise an unspecified amount from the public in order to fund the development of new smartphones and other devices like household gadgets. The money will also help Xiaomi pursue expansion overseas.It could raise as much as $10 billion, according to two people with direct knowledge of the company but not authorized to speak on the record. That would make it the second-largest listing by a Chinese technology company since Alibaba in 2014.As part of the listing, which could come as soon as June, Xiaomi will offer dual-class shares, which allow for weighted voting rights. This will mean that Lei Jun, Xiaomi\u2019s founder, chairman and chief executive, will have the ultimate say over the company\u2019s operations, rather than investors who buy its shares, even if they end up owning more stock than he decides to hold on to.This share structure will allow the company to benefit from Mr. Lei\u2019s \u201cvision and leadership\u201d while allowing him to maintain its \u201clong-term prospects and strategy,\u201d Xiaomi said in its filing.The decision by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong to allow dual-class shares just one week ago has sparked fierce debate here. For the exchange, not allowing companies to list with such a structure meant it missed out on lucrative listings like Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion initial public offering. Alibaba opted to list in New York, where several large technology companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, operate with dual-class shares.But some in the city\u2019s investor community had pushed hard to prevent Hong Kong from changing its rules, arguing that it will mean less rigorous corporate governance.\u201cThere should not be unequal voting rights as they could allow management or minority share owners to override the wishes or best interests of majority shareholders for personal benefit and compromise accountability, leading to potential entrenchment issues,\u201d Mary Leung, head of advocacy for Asia at CFA Institute, an association of investment professionals, said in a statement.Some big institutional investors have criticized Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange for throwing out tighter regulations in a bid to compete with rivals.There are also longer-term concerns that companies will not be as closely scrutinized in the future in Hong Kong, which was once a British colony. As part of the British handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the territory was promised 50 years of self-administration. But in recent years, the city has experienced encroachment on its independence, and investors have raised concerns that its strong regulatory and legal institutions are slowly being eroded by Beijing.To these critics, Hong Kong\u2019s decision to allow dual-class shares is further evidence of that erosion.\u201cBeijing is much happier raising capital in a city that they can partially control rather than handing over all the listings to U.S. markets,\u201d said Andrew Collier, the founder of research firm Orient Capital Research. \u201cAt the end of the day, the Hong Kong stock market is going to be creeping slowly toward Chinese-style regulation.\u201dMr. Li did not respond to a request for comment. But in his blog post he said the exchange was \u201cintroducing additional safeguards to protect investors against the potential misuse of power,\u201d including more corporate governance requirements and certain limits on founding shareholders in these structures.The exchange\u2019s move to loosen its requirements is expected to trigger a spurt of initial public offerings this year and next amid growing appetite across global public markets for new technology companies.Meituan-Dianping, an online delivery service for food and consumer products, is making preparations for an initial public offering in Hong Kong this year, according to two people with direct knowledge of the company but not authorized to speak on the record.Ant Financial, the electronic financial services firm tied to Alibaba, is going through one final fund-raising round before it also decides whether to list its shares publicly late this year or early next year, according to these people.And the Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing is in talks for its own listing, according to one of these people. It is not clear where it would choose to list.Despite the criticism about corporate governance in Hong Kong, its rules remain stricter than New York\u2019s \u2014 for now.Tencent Music, the streaming service owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent, is in talks with various banks to help it go public. It is expected to choose New York, where companies can use the dual-class share structure even if the founding shareholder is a company and not an individual. This would allow Tencent, the parent of Tencent Music, to maintain control.In Hong Kong, the dual-class share structure is available only for individuals. But the city\u2019s stock exchange has already begun seeking feedback from the investor community about loosening this rule, too.An earlier version of this article misstated the relationship between Alibaba and Ant Financial. They are both controlled by Jack Ma; Alibaba does not own Ant Financial. The article also misstated the given name of the chief executive of Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange. He is Charles Li, not Richard Li.Advertisement"}

The company has moved to exit its finance arm, sold NBCUniversal and divested its appliance business that most people associated with G.E.Here\u2019s a timeline of some of G.E.\u2019s biggest transactions since the financial crisis.Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund lost when it took on Samsung three years ago. But the activist investor has claimed victory in its latest battle with a South Korean conglomerate, or chaebol.Here\u2019s how the hedge fund prevailed.The contextElliott said that the restructuring plan showed management \u201chas failed to act in the best interest of the companies and their respective shareholders.\u201d It instead proposed turning Hyundai Motor into a holding company that it said was more tax efficient and sustainable.Why Elliott could win this timeIn a presentation earlier this year, the hedge fund noted that Hyundai\u2019s proposed transaction was similar to what Samsung wanted to do in 2015, where the company sold an affiliate to the chaebol\u2019s holding company. There, Samsung was able to rally individual investors, who accounted for nearly a third of its shareholder base, to its cause.By contrast, retail investors comprise some 5 percent of Hyundai\u2019s shareholder base. Big international institutions, which make up the bulk of Hyundai\u2019s investors, are likely to be more immune to the entreaties of companies under attack from an activist if the campaign makes sense financially.\u2014 Michael de la MercedStock markets are up so far this month, suggesting in part that investors were betting that tensions between the United States and its largest trading partners would ease.That seemed to occur this weekend. The United States and China issued a joint statement on trade and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said planned tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods were on hold. China did not seem to commit to much that is concrete to gain a reprieve from the tariffs, a notable achievement for the country\u2019s negotiators.The joint statement said China would significantly increase its imports from the United States, but it did not say how much more it would buy and over what time period. The parts of the statement about investing in each other\u2019s country and protecting intellectual property were even vaguer.President Trump on Monday nevertheless promoted the statement as a win. But influential members of his administration who are still spoiling for a big trade fight will no doubt want to keep up the pressure on China \u2014 and Mr. Trump may at times share their desire in the coming months. Still, the events of recent weeks show that the United States was largely isolated in its trade fights and the Trump administration may have lacked the resolve or unity to keep up its hard-edged approach. The Trump administration can, of course,reintroduce the threat of tariffs if it believes China is failing to make concessions in the proceeding trade talks. But after stepping back this weekend, it will be harder for the Trump administration to make an aggressive stance appear credible.Indeed, the big question hanging over the Trump administration: Why did it withdraw its tariff threat now, before exacting hard, quantifiable concessions from China? One reason may be that the United States needs China\u2019s help in dealing with North Korea ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s summit with Kim Jong Un planned for June. Another reason may be that China was up for a long fight with the United States and signaled so. Whatever the cause, the takeaway for investors is that the Trump administration passed up an opportunity to show China that it meant what it said.Still, investors may not want to relax too much. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity has been rising even as he made combative moves on the trade front that at times roiled the market. In other words, there does not appear to be much political risk domestically, if any, to taking on China, and so Mr. Trump may use belligerent trade talk to stir up his base ahead of the midterm elections in November.But as long as he steps back from taking tough actions, investors will most likely take his rhetoric in stride. That stance has served them well. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is now up from where it was in mid-February when the Trump administration outlined its case for steel and aluminum tariffs.- Peter EavisAnalysts over at Goldman Sachs are out with a report on Monday looking at the holdings of 848 hedge funds with a combined $2.3 trillion in stock market bets.Here are some takeaways:Individual stocks\u2022 Hedge funds added bets on Facebook more than any other stock during the first quarter, followed by Microsoft, Aetna and Monsanto.\u2022 Amazon had the biggest reduction in wagers on it, followed by Apple, McDonald\u2019s and Citigroup.Sectors\u2022Tech remained the biggest holding among hedge funds but their holdings overall decreased during the first quarter.\u2022 Hedge funds boosted their bets on the energy sector.\u2022 They remain the most bullish on shares of consumer discretionary companies.\u2022 The hedge funds cut their exposure to financial stocks.The vote was 5 to 4, with the court\u2019s more conservative justices in the majority. The court\u2019s decision on the matter could affect some 25 million employment contracts.She tweeted:Steven Mnuchin said this weekend, \u201cWe\u2019re putting the trade war on hold.\u201d S.&P. 500 futures were up on the news. But the pressure is on the Trump administration to back up its tough talk on China \u2014 a task that may be more difficult without the leverage of potential tariffs.The fight inside the White House is still real. Free-trade supporters like Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, are still slinging arrows at hard-liners like the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro. (While Mr. Mnuchin said the tariffs were \u201con hold,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said they were still possible.)The two sides have agreed on a \u201cframework\u201d under which China would increase its purchases of American goods, while putting in place \u201cstructural\u201d changes to protect American technology and to make it easier for American companies to compete in China.G.E. was advised by Morgan Stanley and Dyal Company, the boutique investment bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs deal maker Gordon Dyal, as well as the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. Wabtec was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Jones Day.The chief executive of G.E., John Flannery, has pledged to reduce the company\u2019s byzantine structure and focus on its fastest-growing core businesses. Making train engines isn\u2019t part of that equation.Even for a private company like Theranos, disclosure is the bedrock of American capitalism \u2014 the \u201cdisinfectant\u201d that allows investors to gauge a company\u2019s prospects. Based on Carreyrou\u2019s dogged reporting, not even Enron lied so freely.Cybercrime is one of the greatest risks to the American financial sector, according to the Treasury Department.Former government cyberspies, soldiers and counterintelligence officials now dominate the top ranks of banks\u2019 security teams. They\u2019ve brought to their new jobs the tools and techniques used for national defense: combat exercises, intelligence hubs modeled on those used in counterterrorism work and threat analysts who monitor the internet\u2019s shadowy corners.\u201cShould we own 50 percent of every company in America? That\u2019s ridiculous, and we are a long way from that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Profit Slips as It Spends to Expand Its Empire", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHENZHEN, China \u2014 Alibaba, the online shopping giant, is increasingly going offline. That is making some investors nervous.The Chinese company on Friday reported a fall in profit of nearly 30 percent in the latest quarter, the first such decline in a year and a half. One reason: Alibaba got a bump in profit last year from selling its shares in a social media app. Another culprit, however, was heavy spending on Alibaba\u2019s businesses outside of e-commerce, including cloud computing and brick-and-mortar retail \u2014 which the company, counterintuitively, likes to call \u201cnew retail.\u201dThey remain well above their level a year ago, however, thanks to strength in Alibaba\u2019s core online business. In the first three months of the year, total revenue increased by more than 60 percent over the same period last year, the company said Friday. It added that it expects a similar pace of sales growth for the coming financial year.Modest minimarts these are not. A typical store might feature tanks of live lobsters and crabs, a bar with beer on tap and a grill where steaks are cooked to order. Bags of groceries zip on conveyors above shoppers\u2019 heads on their way to being delivered to nearby homes.All of these could someday help turn Alibaba into the vast digital enabler of on- and offline commerce that it wishes to be. But for now, they are new and unfamiliar activities for a company that prides itself on not owning much in the way of merchandise, warehouses, delivery trucks or other physical assets.It does not help that the company\u2019s archrival in China, the internet conglomerate Tencent, is also storming into many of these same businesses, including traditional retail.\u201cI like Hema,\u201d said Tian X. Hou, founder of T.H. Data Capital, a research firm in Beijing. \u201cBut Alibaba management is going to have to do a lot of thinking, and go through a lot of trial and error.\u201dDespite investors\u2019 worries, Ms. Hou said, Alibaba executives are at least sounding more resolute about their commitment to this new, offline future for the company.\u201cThey are fully communicating with the Street: \u2018We\u2019re doing it. And we actually do not care what you think, because we think it\u2019s great, and it is the way to reach offline customers. It\u2019s the way to sell in product categories that are not sold online.
