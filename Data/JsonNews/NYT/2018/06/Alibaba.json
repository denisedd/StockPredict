{"Headline": "Tibetan Advocate\u2019s Prison Term in China Is Condemned", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnited Nations human rights experts have formally condemned the punishment of a Tibetan education advocate who was sentenced to five years in prison after giving interviews to The New York Times.Since his detention in January 2016, the advocate, Tashi Wangchuk, 33, has become one of the most prominent symbols among critics of China\u2019s legal system and policies in Tibetan regions. In sentencing him on May 22, a court said he was guilty of \u201cinciting separatism.\u201d\u201cWe are gravely concerned,\u201d they said, \u201cabout the sentencing of Mr. Tashi Wangchuk, and the sanctioning of his right to freely express his opinion about the human rights of the Tibetan minority of China.\u201dMr. Tashi stood trial this January in his hometown, Yushu, known as Gyegu in Tibetan. He said he was not guilty of the charge of inciting separatism.In his interviews with Times journalists in 2015, Mr. Tashi said that he did not support Tibetan independence and that he was advocating simply for greater use of the Tibetan language in schools across Tibetan regions, including in his hometown. Chinese is the dominant language of education in the regions.In those interviews, Mr. Tashi also praised the leadership of President Xi Jinping and said he hoped Mr. Xi would govern according to the Chinese Constitution, which guarantees autonomous rights for ethnic minority areas.A former monk, Mr. Tashi lived with his elderly parents in the center of Yushu and ran a small shop. He was also an online entrepreneur, and the giant Chinese technology company Alibaba featured him in a promotional video. Before contacting Times journalists in 2015, Mr. Tashi had begun expressing his views on preserving the Tibetan language on a blog.The United States, several Western nations and international human rights groups denounced the sentencing of Mr. Tashi in May.In their statement on Wednesday, the United Nations experts said, \u201cGovernments should under no circumstances undermine or repress legitimate human rights advocacy and action, such as in this case, using national security, public order or antiterrorism discourses.\u201d\u201cWe asked the government to provide information about specific measures undertaken to promote and protect the linguistic and cultural rights of the Tibetan minority,\u201d the experts added. \u201cWe regret that, to date, the government of China has not yet provided us with a satisfactory response.\u201dMr. Tashi\u2019s time already served in detention counts as part of his sentence, so he will probably leave prison in early 2021, his lawyers said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Trade Slump May Yet Happen: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump broke with protocol by tweeting about jobs report\u2022 Investors have compared Facebook\u2019s actions to human rights violations\u2022 Deutsche Bank can\u2019t catch a break\u2022 Goldman\u2019s consumer finance plans are bigger than you thoughtBefore Donald Trump became president, many feared that the combative trade policies he was proposing would sock the U.S. economy and send unemployment higher.Is this unexpected state of affairs sustainable?If anything, the strength of the economy might persuade Mr. Trump that he can pursue his trade agenda without causing too much collateral damage at home. That could mean following through on his threats to impose tariffs on Chinese products totaling as much as $150 billion.Whether Mr. Trump does so should become clear soon. On June 15, the administration is scheduled to release a final list of $50 billion of Chinese goods subject to tariffs, which would then be imposed shortly thereafter.Some in the administration have warned that a protectionist trade policy could drag the economy and the stock market. But the longer the economy keeps churning out jobs, and the longer the stock market remains resilient, the harder it will be for those advisers to make their case. Indeed, the U.S. may be less sensitive to trade frictions than economists and investors previously believed.But that is a very optimistic scenario, and much could still go wrong.The metals tariffs, alone, are unlikely to crater the markets or hammer the economy. But a full-blown trade war with China, involving $150 billion of tariffs and everything China has promised in retaliation, would almost certainly shake the confidence of investors and businesses. Tomasz Wieladek, an economist at Barclays, in a report on Friday said the metals tariffs and those against China, along with retaliatory actions, could knock nearly a full percentage point off global growth.The fact that the stock market hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since mid-February,when the trade rhetoric heated up, suggests investors never really shrugged off the prospect of trade wars. Now, as a confrontation with China approaches, markets may become volatile as investors prepare for the fallout.It\u2019s also important to remember that the strength of the economy is not an unalloyed positive. If the buoyant conditions, and the impact of new tariffs, produce higher inflation, the Federal Reserve will have less leeway to relax monetary policy in response to a big trade shock or a stock market plunge. In other words, investors would have no protection from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.One way to view the current situation is that Mr. Trump is an opportunist who has astutely ridden an economic expansion that had long been underway \u2013 and is now hoping it will carry him through a drawn-out trade battle.It\u2019s a bold, far from certain, bet.\u2014Peter EavisThe Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely releases its monthly employment report on the first Friday of the month. The night before, under longstanding tradition, the president and several senior administration officials \u2014 including the Treasury secretary and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 are briefed on the numbers, which they are not supposed to disclose until the report is made public at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time the next morning.But Mr. Trump, who was briefed on the numbers Thursday evening, appeared to foreshadow the strength of the latest report on Friday morning on Twitter.Market watchers saw evidence that the tweet was moving markets.Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, pushed back on whether Mr. Trump broke with protocol.President Trump tweeted earlier this morning that he was looking forward to the jobs report. We now know why.Drew Armstrong, a reporter at Bloomberg, tweeted the strong reaction of the dollar after the report\u2019s release:SoftBank\u2019s investment in G.M.\u2019s driverless car division and Waymo\u2019s move to create a huge fleet of robot-taxis suggest maybe not.G.M.

Analysts have raised second-quarter earnings estimates for S.&P. 500 companies 0.2 percent during April and May, according to FactSet.That might not seem like much, but over the past 10 years, quarterly earnings estimates have declined, on average, 3.7 percent during the first two months of that quarter.The gain so far this quarter falls well short of the record set during the first two months of the first quarter of this year. As analysts factored in tax cuts signed into law in late 2017, they raised profit expectations 5.7 percent in January and February.Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the centrist Democrat from North Dakota who is fighting a pitched battle to save her seat, has gotten a lift from an unlikely source: the conservative billionaire Koch brothers.The ad is the latest evidence that the brothers, often at odds with President Trump, may be moving away from strictly partisan work on behalf of Republicans in favor of initiatives that will advance their libertarian-leaning legislative priorities, including free trade, immigration legislation and access to medicines, regardless of party affiliation.Ms. Heitkamp is one of 10 Democratic senators up for re-election in states won by Mr. Trump in 2016, but unlike other Democrats, she has drawn a top-flight challenger in Kevin Cramer, North Dakota\u2019s lone House member and a close ally of the president\u2019s. Her seat is one of the keys to Republican efforts to hold on to or expand the party\u2019s one-seat Senate majority.The former Treasury secretary has joined the board of the Financial Services Volunteer Corps, an organization that helps build up the banking systems in developing countries, the group announced on Friday.Founded in 1990 at the behest of President George H.

Its board includes Paul Volcker, Henry Kissinger, the former Goldman Sachs co-president John Thornton and the former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.Mr. Lew, who served a number of advisory roles in the Obama administration before becoming Treasury secretary in 2013, is taking the board seat that had been held by Randy Quarles, who is now the Fed\u2019s vice chair for supervision.From Mr. Lew\u2019s statement:And from a statement by Bill Donaldson, the former banker and S.E.C. chairman, who serves as the Corps\u2019s chairman:\u201cJack is an outstanding addition to our Board.

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26.The rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain. Fears of a trade war have made investors anxious; emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies have all sold off; and economic data in some regions has softened in recent weeks.\u201cIn an uncertain world with significant downside economic tail risks, technology has been seen to be, correctly, relatively stable,\u201d Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson, strategists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.Such economic uneasiness in the years since the financial crisis had caused investors to pour money into the sector. The likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have come to be viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver growth in most economic conditions. With interest rates at historic lows and economic growth lackluster, investors have found that appealing.In March, some of the best-performing tech stocks began to struggle. Facebook\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech companies and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms.The pullback was a rare dip for a sector that had risen consistently for the past several years. Since stock markets in the United States bottomed out in March 2009, shares of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet have all gained more than 500 percent; Netflix is up 6,500 percent. The S.&P. 500 has risen about 300 percent over that period.How long can the biggest tech stocks dominate the market? For a while, Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson said. They pointed out that earnings and sales growth, not a speculative increase in valuations, have driven the post-financial crisis run-up.\u201cUnlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson wrote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Coming Tech Battle With China", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sharma is\u00a0the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Arriving in Beijing last month, I knew I would not be able to connect to Google, Facebook or Uber. As strange as it was to go without these staples of online life in the West, it was even stranger to find that local Chinese didn\u2019t seem to feel deprived at all. They search through Baidu, get their social media fix on WeChat, hail rides on Didi, curate news through sites like Toutiao. And while they know Beijing is watching, they accept this surveillance as normal.The Chinese government has carved out an alternative internet universe with its own brands, rules and culture, in which privacy doesn\u2019t exist. But its real ambition is to break out of this parallel universe and dominate not just the internet but the technology industry worldwide. To contain Beijing, the United States and its allies are fighting back with a campaign of technoprotectionism, opening a perilous new front in the global trade battles.President Trump is the unlikely leader of the fight against Chinese tech dominance. Widely seen as a champion of rust belt industries, he recently slapped heavy tariffs on all the leading aluminum and steel exporters, drawing fierce protests not only from China but also from American allies like Germany and Canada. But steel is a side show compared with the emerging tech battle with China.Technology will decide which country emerges as the world\u2019s dominant economic power in the long run. While about 20 percent of per-capita gross domestic product growth is driven by labor and capital, the remaining 80 percent is determined by how rapidly an economy is developing and applying new technology to increase production. China\u2019s ambition to catch up to Western living standards thus depends largely on how rapidly it can match or surpass Western technology.Mr. Trump is both accelerating and expanding trade battles that began before he took office. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, countries around the world began to restrict cross-border flows of trade, capital and migrants. Globalization\u2019s champions predicted that borders would continue to fall in at least one area \u2014 digital tech and the internet \u2014 but China has shown that a determined government can build walls in the virtual sphere, too.The president\u2019s tough stand on trade with China may be more popular than he is. The overwhelming consensus in the West is that Beijing is catching up illegitimately, by forcing companies that invest in China to share their best technology, or dispatching hackers to steal it. Though borrowing from the leading tech power is a standard development strategy \u2014 think of 19th-century America copying British industrial technology and Japan\u2019s great success replicating American technology \u2014 the scale and organization of China\u2019s campaign makes the threat feel new.Beijing has banned some foreign competitors like Google and Facebook outright, and regulated others so heavily that they have been compelled to sell themselves to Chinese rivals (Uber) or forced to consider pulling out of China (Amazon). In essence, China has created domestic internet monopolies that are generating enough cash in their vast local market to finance aggressive expansion abroad. I have been told, for example, that Toutiao already sells its novel content curating service to one in 10 Japanese.Last year Beijing rebranded the manufacturing centers of the Pearl River delta as the \u201cGreater Bay Area\u201d and began urging the main cities there \u2014 Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong \u2014 to cooperate to become China\u2019s rival to Silicon Valley, which the Chinese would like to make the lesser Bay Area.In Beijing, the buzz was about how \u201cCreated in China\u201d is replacing \u201cMade in China,\u201d with some claiming that Shenzhen is now more innovative than Silicon Valley in key industries. Instead of just assembling simple goods from parts built elsewhere, China is now increasingly seen as a cutting-edge designer and developer of artificial intelligence, drones and other advanced technologies.Mr. Trump was willing to lift the ban on ZTE after the company paid a $1 billion fine and fired its top executives, but Congress was not. The Senate voted to reinstate the ban, which is likely to fuel trade battles to come. When I was in Beijing, many Chinese were talking about how the humiliation of ZTE was inspiring an official push to reduce China\u2019s dependence on the United States for semiconductors, software and other critical tech imports.The European Union recently imposed new data protection rules written largely to give consumers more control of information now in the hands of corporate giants like Facebook, but also to guard against the spread of a China-like surveillance state. The European Union is also pondering a new digital single market, in part to give European companies a market in which they have a chance to grow as large as Chinese rivals.This is how a digitally interconnected world could die by a thousand cuts, and technoprotectionism may get a further push during the next global downturn. From the United States to Europe and Japan, public debts are high and deficits are rising, which means these governments are poorly positioned to spend their way out of any slowdown. Central banks can\u2019t help much, either, since interest rates are still very low, with little room or reason to drop further right now. In this environment, governments may see protectionism as the only lever they have left to pull.For most of the postwar era, the consensus in support of free trade was so strong that governments rarely resorted to raising tariffs even when times were tough. The trade wars that broke out after 2008 have involved mainly nontariff or \u201cstealth\u201d trade barriers, including cheap state loans and subsidies for favored industries. But in the last two years, the rise of Mr. Trump and other antiglobal populists has given new currency to protectionism in all its forms, including technoprotectionism.The global financial markets had largely ignored the brewing trade battles, until recently. As the tariff threats grow in scale, and the battleground shifts from rust belt industries to new technologies, the markets are growing more skittish. So far, stocks have been hit harder in China than in the United States, but there will be no winners. The latest surveys of American investors and manufacturers show that their biggest concern is the threat of a trade war.The risks from deglobalization are growing. If the current skirmishes turn into a full-blown trade war, blame will fall heavily on the thousandth cut. But the real fault will lie with the 999 that came before.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

According to a JD.com spokesman, the deal will give Google less than 1 percent of the Chinese retailer\u2019s shares, which trade on the Nasdaq.Google pulled its search engine out of China in 2010, deciding that it would no longer censor its own search results as required by Beijing. But lately, the company has been looking for other ways to serve the planet\u2019s largest population of internet users.The company never quit China entirely, despite its travails. It has hundreds of employees working on research and product development in the country, which has become a major fount of engineering and scientific talent. Its online advertising business helps Chinese companies reach customers overseas.Still, mounting a broader return to the Chinese market would not be easy for Google, even if the authorities were to permit it. In the eight years since the company withdrew from China, local rivals have created formidable products in many areas in which it competes, including search, chat, video streaming and cloud computing.JD.com, meanwhile, is apparently hoping that Google\u2019s global reach will help it sell more products internationally. The company already counts Walmart as a major shareholder. It has extended its reach into Southeast Asia, setting up a local retail business in Indonesia, becoming a partner on an e-commerce venture in Thailand and backing another one in Vietnam.Across the world, however, JD.com will face tough competition.

And they are up 45 percent from the depths of the housing crisis in 2012.The big rebound in home prices and the lure of making a quick buck drew more than 200 people on Tuesday to a MidtownManhattan hotel for a two-hour free class on flipping houses. The lunchtime program I dropped in on was part of a sophisticated come-on for a paid three-day workshop that Nathaniel \u201cThan\u201d Merrill and his FortuneBuilders company plan to hold in the New York metropolitan area. An instructor at the event said the workshop normally costs $1,197, but the company was offering it for $197.Mr. Merrill, a former professional football player, has built something of a national reputation for pitching home flipping as a way to make money for just about anyone with a little cash and a dream to become a big time real estate investor. His FortuneBuilders company bills itself as an educational firm with many satisfied customers and success stories. The company is closely tied to a private lender called Grand Coast Capital that provides short-term financing to real estate investors,many of whom are past attendees of the three-day programs.The free class on Tuesday was something of a cross between a how-to guide to buying and selling homes and an evangelical experience.

Arm believes this joint venture, which will license Arm semiconductor technology to Chinese companies and locally develop Arm technology in China, will expand Arm\u2019s opportunities in the Chinese market.Arm estimates that 95 percent of all advanced chips designed in China last year were based on its technology. With China desperate to make its own chips in volume, and quickly (there\u2019s more on that theme below), the move could prove shrewd.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation is rushing to build semiconductor factories. But reports claiming that the Chinese government is probing chip makers over price-fixing demonstrate that it\u2019s not there yet.Reuters notes that, according to Trendforce, China accounts for 20 percent of all global DRAM memory sales.

George Sard, the firm\u2019s C.E.O., told Michael de la Merced that the government \u201cis pretty central to everything we\u2019re doing.\u201dJames Davis, the executive vice president of Freedom Partners, said the campaign was \u201ca demonstration of our long-term commitment to advance common-sense trade policies that will ensure America\u2019s brightest days are ahead, and to directly confront the protectionist ideas that would hold us back.\u201dSome highlights from Apple\u2019s annual developer conference yesterday:For Microsoft, the deal continues its break with the past. It made its name by selling proprietary software, while GitHub is one of the most popular platforms on which to develop free-to-use open-source software. But under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Microsoft is transforming itself into a cloud provider for businesses \u2014 and even adopting open-source technology. GitHub fits that vision neatly.Unless Microsoft treads carefully, some could flee to rival repositories like BitBucket or GitLab, which has seen a big spike in traffic since news of the deal broke.\u201cOf course it has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Move Over, China: U.S. Is Again Home to World\u2019s Speediest Supercomputer", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States just won bragging rights in the race to build the world\u2019s speediest supercomputer.For five years, China had the world\u2019s fastest computer, a symbolic achievement for a country trying to show that it is a tech powerhouse. But the United States retook the lead thanks to a machine, called Summit, built for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.Summit\u2019s speeds, announced on Friday, boggle the mind. It can do mathematical calculations at the rate of 200 quadrillion per second, or 200 petaflops. To put in human terms: A person doing one calculation a second would have to live for more than 6.3 billion years to match what the machine can do in a second.Still stupefying? Here is another analogy. If a stadium built for 100,000 people was full, and everyone in it had a modern laptop, it would take 20 stadiums to match the computing firepower of Summit.China still has the world\u2019s most supercomputers over all. And China, Japan and Europe are developing machines that are even faster, which could mean the American lead is short-lived.Supercomputers like Summit, which cost $200 million in government money to build, can accelerate the development of technologies at the frontier of computing, like artificial intelligence and the ability to handle vast amounts of data.Those skills can be used to help tackle daunting challenges in science, industry and national security \u2014 and are at the heart of an escalating rivalry between the United States and China over technology.Supercomputers now perform tasks that include simulating nuclear tests, predicting climate trends, finding oil deposits and cracking encryption codes. Scientists say that further gains and fresh discoveries in fields like medicine, new materials and energy technology will rely on the approach that Summit embodies.\u201cThese are big data and artificial intelligence machines,\u201d said John E. Kelly, who oversees IBM Research, which helped build Summit. \u201cThat\u2019s where the future lies.\u201dAt 200 petaflops, the new machine achieves more than twice the speed of the leading supercomputer in November, when the last Top 500 list was published. That machine is at China\u2019s National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi.Summit is made up of rows of black, refrigerator-size units that weigh a total of 340 tons and are housed in a 9,250 square-foot room. It is powered by 9,216 central processing chips from IBM and 27,648 graphics processors from Nvidia, another American tech company, that are lashed together with 185 miles of fiber-optic cable.Cooling Summit requires 4,000 gallons of water a minute, and the supercomputer consumes enough electricity to light up 8,100 American homes.The global supercomputer sprint comes as internet giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google in the United States and Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent in China take the lead in developing technologies like cloud computing and facial recognition.Supercomputers are a measure of a nation\u2019s technological prowess. It is a narrow measure, of course, because raw speed is only one ingredient in computing performance. Software, which bring the machines to life, is another.Scientists at the government labs like Oak Ridge are doing exploratory research in areas like new materials to make roads more robust, designs for energy storage that might apply to electric cars or energy grids, and potential power sources like harnessing fusion. All of those areas can benefit from supercomputing.Modeling the climate, for example, can require running code on a supercomputer for days, processing huge amounts of scientific data like moisture and wind patterns, and modeling all the real-world physics of the environment. It is not the sort of task that can run efficiently on the cloud computing services supplied by internet companies, said Ian Buck, a computer scientist and general manager of Nvidia\u2019s data center business.\u201cIndustry is great, and we work with them all the time,\u201d said Rick Stevens, an associate director of the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. \u201cBut Google is never going to design new materials or design a safe nuclear reactor.\u201dAt Oak Ridge, Thomas Zacharia, the lab director, cites a large health research project as an example of the future of supercomputing. Summit has begun ingesting and processing data generated by the Million Veteran Program, which enlists volunteers to give researchers access to all of their health records, contribute blood tests for genetic analysis, and answer survey questions about their lifestyles and habits. To date, 675,000 veterans have joined; the goal is to reach one million by 2021.The eventual insights, Mr. Zacharia said, could \u201chelp us find new ways to treat our veterans and contribute to the whole area of precision medicine.\u201dDr. J. Michael Gaziano, a principal investigator on the Million Veteran Program and a professor at the Harvard Medical School, said that the potential benefit might well be a modern, supercharged version of the Framingham Heart Study. That project, begun in 1948, tracked about 5,000 people in a Massachusetts town.Over a couple of decades, the Framingham study found that heart disease \u2014 far from previous single-cause explanations of disease \u2014 had multiple, contributing causes including blood cholesterol, diet, exercise and smoking.Today, given the flood of digital health data and supercomputers, Dr. Gaziano said that population science might be entering a new golden age.\u201cWe have all this big, messy data to create a new field \u2014 rethinking how we think about diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time.\u201dAlthough impressive, Summit can be seen as a placeholder. Supercomputers that are five times faster \u2014 1,000 petaflops, or an exaflop \u2014 are in the works, both abroad and in the United States. The Energy Department\u2019s budget for its advanced computing program is being increased by 39 percent in the two fiscal years ending September 2019, said Paul M. Dabbar, the Energy Department\u2019s under secretary for science.\u201cWe\u2019re doing this to help drive innovation in supercomputing and beyond,\u201d Mr. Dabbar said.An earlier version of this article, using calculations by Jack Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee who tracks supercomputer speeds, misstated how long it would take a person to do the calculations that the Summit supercomputer could do in one second. It would take 6.3 billion years, not 63 billion years. The error was repeated in the headline and in a mobile news alert. The article also misspelled the surname of the Energy Department\u2019s under secretary for science. He is Paul Dabbar, not Dabarr.Advertisement"}
