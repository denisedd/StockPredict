{"Headline": "As China Curbs Borrowing, Growth Shows Signs of Faltering", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s government has been trying to break the country\u2019s addiction to ever-rising debt, but its effort to crack down on easy money is starting to hit growth in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.Beijing has been concerned in recent years about the increased reliance on credit to keep the economy expanding briskly, worrying that it could lead to a financial crisis, or to a long period of stagnation like the one in Japan after the real estate market burst in the early 1990s.But curbing debt may have significant consequences in China and elsewhere. Countries around the world are much more closely tied to China than ever before, because of its role not just as the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer by far but also, increasingly, as a consumer. An economic slowdown in China \u2014 coupled with the knock-on effects of widening trade disputes and slowing growth in Europe \u2014 may augur poorly for a global economy that even recently seemed in rude health.Domestically, China\u2019s credit crackdown has affected smaller businesses hardest. Though the country often appears to be dominated by its vast conglomerates and hulking state-owned enterprises, its economy is, in reality, somewhat more reliant on small businesses than its Western counterparts. And the way Beijing has gone about curbing lending in recent months is unintentionally hitting the most entrepreneurial segments of the economy, the governor of China\u2019s central bank acknowledged in a speech on Thursday in Shanghai.Over all, there is growing evidence that a credit crunch is taking a toll on the Chinese economy.The National Bureau of Statistics released data in Beijing on Thursday showing that investment, retail sales and industrial production all slowed in May. The slowdowns in investment and retail sales were particularly sharp and unexpected.With that backdrop of eroding economic growth, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, conspicuously did not match on Thursday the Federal Reserve\u2019s increase to interest rates on Wednesday. It had at least partly matched previous Federal Reserve interest rate rises since the autumn.An index of 300 large-company stocks traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen dropped 0.4 percent on Thursday, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.9 percent on the poor economic news from the mainland.With the Chinese economy showing signs of slowing and the authorities making it harder to borrow, small businesses are particularly vulnerable. They represent about three-fifths of economic output in China, compared with around half in Germany, Japan and the United States, according to Yi Gang, the governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China.The downgrades were among many reasons the government has tightened some curbs on borrowing since the end of the autumn. Beijing has particularly clamped down on lending by online finance companies and other private sector businesses that bypass the state-controlled banking system.While commercial banks have continued to lend the money they hold from deposits, these conventional loans go mainly to state-owned enterprises. Private lenders, meanwhile, charge interest rates that are double or triple the 6 percent charged by banks, but they are often the only source of financing for small businesses.Despite the higher interest rates, \u201cwe should also fully affirm the significance of private loans, which are an important supplement\u201d to bank lending in the Chinese economy, said Mr. Yi, speaking at the Lujiazui Forum, a gathering in Shanghai of China\u2019s top financial regulators. The forum, held at the start of each summer, is one of the Chinese government\u2019s main channels for signaling the direction of Chinese monetary and financial policy.Even before deciding on Thursday morning not to match the Fed\u2019s rate increase, though, the Chinese government had already made a pair of moves that appear to have been elaborately crafted to channel more money to smaller, more entrepreneurial businesses.Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a Shanghai-based research group, said on the sidelines of the Lujiazui Forum that China\u2019s private-sector companies of all sizes, even large ones, had long faced challenges in obtaining loans. But the credit squeeze on them this spring has been particularly painful.\u201cIt\u2019s very bad, and we see not just small and medium-sized enterprises defaulting but even big companies defaulting,\u201d he said.Some financial regulators nevertheless appear determined to maintain the crackdown on informal lending.Speaking at the forum, Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, called for further rigor. He warned the audience against putting money into the dwindling number of online finance companies that still offered high returns on investment. While some informal lending operations provide valuable credit to small businesses, others have proved to be fraudulent.\u201cYou need to report them so we can find all these Ponzi-type schemes,\u201d Mr. Guo said.China\u2019s financial policymakers have made clear that they do not mind seeing a few defaults and some strains in the system. Retail auto sales slackened last month, and unsold cars have started accumulating at dealerships. A decision by the authorities to allow at least a dozen bond defaults in recent weeks, after years of preventing them, has rattled some investors.The Chinese economy is not crashing. By international standards, the pace of bond defaults is still negligible. While car sales have leveled off, they have done so at a very high level after two decades of strong growth, causing chronic traffic jams. Real estate demand is still buoyant, and so is the construction industry.But faced with a high level of debt across the economy, \u201cwhat regulators need to be careful is not to respond in such a heavy-handed way that it could essentially compound the risks,\u201d said Fred Hu, an influential Chinese economist who is now a hedge fund chairman in Hong Kong.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

Academically, I have no woes. It is the thought of living on my own, in the grown-up world, that troubles me. Society has become so focused on academics, test scores and GPA, that no school wants to spend time teaching kids about buying a house, or paying off loans. Because of this, I am going off to college with little to no knowledge about everyday skills.Professor David Perkins has looked at the issue of what is and is not taught in schools, and tells educators to ask themselves, \u201cWhat\u2019s worth learning in school?\u201d At a seminar that Perkins spoke at, he asked audience members to raise their hand if they had learned in school what mitosis, the process of cell division, was. Nearly every person raised their hand. When Perkins asked how many of them had used their knowledge of mitosis in the last ten years, only one hand went up.I am not arguing that public schools should up and abandon math or science or any subject, but if biology is a required course, why shouldn\u2019t accounting be too? Or home economics? Public schools are built around a curriculum that spends so much time teaching information that will likely never be used again. Instead, teaching important life skills needs to be integrated into the curriculum of public schools. Some courses, like accounting and home ec, are offered as elective classes, but very few kids take them because it won\u2019t make their college application look better or boost their GPA as much as taking the AP Statistics elective. Public schools are doing the bare minimum to make these useful classes available to students and in turn are sending kids off unprepared for their future lives outside of the academic world. There needs to be a bigger push toward making classes about life skills a requirement in public schools, so that people are not going into the workforce, wondering how to do their tax returns.Works CitedHough, Lory. \u201cWhat\u2019s Worth Learning in School?\u201d Harvard Graduate School of Education, 8 Jan. 2015.Ojalvo, Holly Epstein. \u201cWhat Are You Really Learning at School?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 7 Sept. 2011._________In the timeless words of Abraham Lincoln, \u201cAnd in the end, it is not the years in your life that count. It\u2019s the life in your years.\u201d The debate over whether the quality or quantity of life is more important has shaken up the grounds of ethics. Recently, physician-assisted suicide has become legalized in Oregon, Washington, Washington, D.C., Vermont, Montana, Colorado and California. Yet New York, just this past year, banned this end-of-life route.The Death with Dignity Act, passed in selected states, allows strictly qualified terminally ill patients to receive lethal medication from their doctors to end their lives. It is one end-of-life option among others including: palliative sedation, voluntary stopping of eating and drinking, and stopping treatment. All of these alleviate pain and hasten death, however, they are not always effective depending on the diagnoses. Brittany Maynard, who had terminal brain cancer, wrote an article explaining her choice of physician-assisted suicide: \u201cI considered passing away in hospice care \u2026 but even with palliative sedation, I could develop potentially morphine-resistant pain and suffer personality changes and verbal, cognitive and motor loss.\u201d Fundamentally, both physician-assisted suicide and other end-of-life options result in the same outcome. However, physician-assisted suicide is more immediate and less painful while the others, though legal, can result in intolerable, prolonged anguish. Some patients want to have the responsibility of choosing their own way of ending the suffering in the comfort of their own homes, surrounded by their loved ones. For this reason, physician-assisted suicide ought to be legal.By disallowing terminally ill patients from choosing the right to die with dignity, there is an infringement on the right to live a quality life, right to freedom, and right to autonomy. Physicians against assisted suicide claim that since the Hippocratic oath implies a doctor\u2019s responsibility is to heal, assisting patients to hasten their deaths is a violation of medical ethics. John Grohol, a psychologist, wrote a New York Times article stating, \u201cWhen doctors equate healing with quantity of life, they ignore the quality of life. If suffering is intolerable, it is inhumane not to end it.\u201d Therefore, if it is against the patient\u2019s will to continue suffering, disallowing the patient to die peacefully and painlessly is disregarding the patient\u2019s well being and, in fact, rejecting the oath.The Death with Dignity Act entitles a patient to make a decision about his own life and, for once, not allow the disease to dictate the body\u2019s fate. With strict regulations, such as psychiatric evaluations ensuring the patient\u2019s choice is individual and competent, New York should be the next state to adopt such end-of-life care and give people the option to live fully and freely.Works CitedGrohol, John M. \u201cDenying Someone a Peaceful Death Can Be Unethical\u201d The New York Times. 7 Oct. 2014.Maynard, Brittany. \u201cMy Right to Death With Dignity at 29.\u201d CNN, Cable News Network, 3 Nov. 2014._________In China, the competition is great and the opportunities are few. Children are faced with the burden of success the minute they are born. Before they are born, mothers are faced with the pressure of bearing the most well-advantaged offspring. In recent years, there has been an exponential rise in the number of couples who are opting to screen embryos during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Because of the financial burden, lack of facilities for, and social stigma of raising a handicapped child, Chinese parents are more willing to prioritize you sheng (which translates to \u201chealthy birth\u201d) over the protection of an embryo.One of the screening processes, known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), is currently used to detect embryos with single gene mutations that could cause diseases and disabilities like Tay Sachs disease or cystic fibrosis. Chinese law prohibits selection of embryos based on anything else (for instance, selecting for male embryos is illegal). However, a whole new array of problems will develop as we achieve a greater understanding of what genes influence intelligence.The trailblazer in this field is the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), which launched a project in 2012 to analyze the DNA of 2,000 of the world\u2019s smartest people. There are thousands of variants that influence mental abilities, but BGI aims to decipher the substantial genetic component of intelligence in the near future. While the study is purely academic, insight into the labyrinthine genetics of genius will define the future of genetic screenings; Pandora\u2019s box will be opened with no possibility for return.Fertility clinics may go from advertising for \u201ccancer-free babies\u201d to promising \u201cprodigy babies\u201d. The starting line for the rat race to the middle class will shift from family standing to predestined genetic design. PGD won\u2019t necessarily result in China mass-engineering super-citizens, but it will easily be misinterpreted by and desensitize result-driven consumers. \u201cSelecting for the smartest embryos\u201d overemphasizes the hereditary facet of intelligence and glosses over the influence of nurture. Clinics cannot guarantee smarter babies, but eager couples will still flock to them nonetheless. In addition, even with PGD for simpler single gene mutations there is the risk of false positives. Now, couples might unknowingly dispose of perfectly healthy embryos in pursuit of a prodigy.It is imperative that the Chinese government take proactive measures to oversee future PGD implementation. In addition to a moratorium so officials, scientists and consumers can deliberate, genetic counselors who are well-versed in bioethics need to lead a nationwide discussion on how far we are willing to let competition define us, literally. The human genome is indisputably the new frontier of exploration. However, unrestrained scientific ambition will move China forward before it is ready.Works CitedCyranoski, David. \u201cChina\u2019s Embrace of Embryo Selection Raises Thorny Questions.\u201d Scientific American, Nature America, Inc, 16 Aug. 2017.Eror, Aleks. \u201cChina Is Engineering Genius Babies.\u201d Vice, Vice Media, 15 March 2013.Kolata, Gina. \u201cBuilding a Better Human With Science?

Though Mr. Clinton was referring to her qualifications and unusually significant political role \u2014 she remains the only first lady ever to maintain an office in the West Wing \u2014 presidential couples always present voters \u201ctwo for the price of one.\u201d Presidents\u2019 spouses fulfill a variety of official responsibilities: They manage paid staffers, promote nonpartisan causes and entertain White House visitors. Crucially, the first lady is unpaid, and, as former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson once quipped, \u201celected by one person \u2014 her husband.\u201dAs every new election raises the prospect of a man in the office of first lady, this amorphous role has become awkward and archaic: The presidential spouse should be absolved of public obligations altogether. The position of first lady evolved within the context of a society that could not imagine a woman in power or a president\u2019s wife with a high-powered career, relegating her to the domestic sphere. It devalued traditionally feminine tasks such as event planning, deeming them unworthy of monetary compensation.Feminist advances have allowed successive presidential spouses to expand their public profiles, becoming vocal advocates for women\u2019s and children\u2019s issues. Thus, some have argued, as Professor Jean H. Baker proposed in The New York Times, that the office should \u201cbe defined as a paid public position, with salary and expectations.\u201dHowever, this change would only affirm the expectation that women subsume their identities into those of their powerful husbands. If the role of the presidential spouse is a \u201cfull-time job,\u201d as Baker claims, he or she would likely be compelled to relinquish their existing occupation, just as Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton gave up prestigious positions. Yet, a life of visiting elementary schools or choosing flower arrangements for the next White House dinner may not appeal to every spouse. Furthermore, since the first lady is eligible for office by virtue of being married to the president, greater politicization inevitably bumps up against charges of nepotism.A far simpler solution would be to abolish the office and treat the presidential spouse as a normal private citizen. After all, the position is dispensable. German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s husband, a theoretical physicist, has eschewed the public eye so unwaveringly that a German newspaper once labeled him \u201cas invisible as a molecule,\u201d a practice that has not impeded the smooth functioning of the German state.The United States can and should follow suit. We can only free ourselves of the sexist assumptions and stereotypes that currently underlie the role of first lady if we free presidential spouses from public servitude.Works CitedBaker, Jean H. \u201cGive First Ladies a Salary and Expectations.\u201d The New York Times. 9 March 2016.Cornwell, Rupert. \u201cBill and Hillary\u2019s Double Trouble: Clinton\u2019s Two for the Price of One\u2019 Pledge Is Returning to Haunt Him, Says Rupert Cornwell.\u201d Independent. 9 March 1994.Finkelstein, Sarina. \u201cWant to Fix Wage Inequality?

In this day and age, the extensive use of fuel-burning vehicles is becoming a larger issue as global warming develops into a growing threat \u2014 especially in the United States. While replacing all gasoline cars with electric vehicles (EVs) would be impractical, widespread change is necessary. A good place for us to begin is with some of our nation\u2019s most admired and respected individuals: police officers.According to the most recent law enforcement census, 17,985 police departments across the United States deploy thousands of police vehicles, becoming one of the country\u2019s largest contributors to greenhouse gases. Living in a city where EVs and hybrids are becoming increasingly common, the dozens of diesel police cars around me begin to feel archaic. Within the next decade, several departments can reasonably aim to replace a majority of their police fleets, or at least nonemergency fleets, with fuel efficient vehicles.In fact, plans for this system have already garnered support and are underway in New York City, one of the nation\u2019s greatest greenhouse gas emitters. For instance, recent city plans call for replacing just under a fifth of its 11,000 car fleet; this is estimated to reduce city government emissions by 50 percent, according to the New York Times article \u201cNew York City Aims for Vast Electric Car Fleet by 2025.\u201dAlbeit costly, replacing only 2,000 cars will pay for itself through fuel savings, while dramatically improving the environment of one of the world\u2019s busiest cities. Furthermore, police officers serve as an example to the public, which is why their use of green vehicles could cause a larger change to ripple across America.The variety and practicality of electric vehicles have grown tremendously in the past half decade, showing no signs of stopping. Some argue against this plan\u2019s practicality due to the failure of the most significant previous attempt in the LAPD, in which a 100 car fleet of EVs had seldom been used since its introduction in 2016. However, cars in this fleet were among first-generation mass market EVs and faced significant limitations.Most modern models have evolved past those limitations with greater durability, safety, speed, affordability and other factors that strengthen the practicality of the car. Some gasoline vehicles may remain for specialized missions, but their necessity is limited.The more Americans neglect the benefits of today\u2019s fuel efficient vehicles, the more dire our climate situation becomes. A solution is widely available, and a step forward taken by our nation\u2019s officials can push us toward a future of clean energy. With this advance, police officers can save more than just lives.Works CitedCity of New York Inventory of New York City\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Emissions, April 2017, by Cventure LLC, Cathy Pasion, Christianah Oyenuga, and Kate Gouin, Mayor\u2019s Office of Sustainability, New York, 2017.Grynbaum, Michael M. \u201cNew York City Aims for Vast Electric Car Fleet by 2025.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 1 Dec. 2015.King, Alanis. \u201cThat Fleet Of Electric Cars The LAPD Paid At Least $2.9 Million For?

Reynolds Tobacco hid and denied the health risks of smoking in pursuit of greater profits.The courts have forced the companies to release \u201ccorrective statements\u201d in newspapers and on major news channels. Although these statements are a step in the right direction, their sparse design does not catch people\u2019s attention and, therefore, does not effectively spread their information to the public.Tobacco advertisements in the 1900s were flashy and colorful; they featured pictures of grinning doctors endorsing the health benefits of cigarettes and attractive people smoking happily. These advertisements grabbed the reader\u2019s attention, but the corrective statements do just the opposite.The print and televised statements consist of plain black text in bullet points on a white background, with a monotonous, slow voice-over that is reminiscent of a digital assistant added to the televised ones. They appear designed to be unattractive and slip under the radar of viewers and readers.This is not how to get a message across.An antismoking campaign by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention entitled \u201cTips\u201d ran in 2012 and featured former smokers telling their stories with graphic images of their injuries.According to NBC News, this campaign led 1.6 million people to attempt to quit smoking, and 78 percent of surveyed smokers and 74 percent of surveyed nonsmokers recalled seeing at least one Tips advertisement. The CDC\u2019s advertisements made an impact because they caught people\u2019s attention; these corrective statements do not do that, so how will people see them?These statements reveal important information about smoking\u2019s adverse effects and the companies\u2019 deceitful actions. It is imperative that smokers and those considering smoking are fully aware of the negative consequences of their actions. In Texas, women seeking abortions must receive information about the procedure\u2019s risks and alternative options 24 hours beforehand. Don\u2019t smokers, whose choice to smoke exposes them and every person around them to numerous fatal diseases, deserve the same educational material?And how will they receive that information when it is practically invisible?When Kessler ordered these companies to release corrective statements, her intent was that the American public see and hear those statements. In their current form, these advertisements do not satisfy that condition.The courts cannot allow these ineffective statements to continue; the companies must release new advertisements that actually attract the eye to fulfill their obligation. We do not allow our children to avoid apologizing for misconduct; let us apply this same rule in this case. Altria, Lorillard, Philip Morris USA and R.J.

In fact, the 2015-16 Broadway season was praised for bringing diversity \u201cfront and center\u201d with shows emphasizing heritage, like \u201cOn Your Feet!\u201d and \u201cAllegiance.\u201d However, as diverse audience members search for representation on the Broadway stage, we must reevaluate: Do these shows offer Asian-American artists the same opportunities as those of other ethnicities? The Asian American Performers Action Coalition\u2019s report \u201cEthnic Representation on New York Stages\u201d confirms the trend of growing diversity: Between the 2006-07 and 2015-16 New York theater seasons, minority actors\u2019 representation increased from 15 percent to 35 percent while Asian-American actors\u2019 representation rose to only 9 percent.High Asian-American representation accompanies musicals such as \u201cThe King & I\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d \u2014 among the only shows to employ large Asian-American ensembles. According to the same report, the 2015 revival of \u201cThe King & I\u201d hired \u201calmost half of all Asian actors employed that season.\u201d Japanese-Canadian director Stafford Arima confirms their impact: \u201cYou would look at the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and just see 12 productions of the \u2018King and I\u2019 and nine productions of \u2018Miss Saigon\u2019.\u201dThese classic musicals, however, carry the remnants of a less racially-aware time. \u201cThe King & I\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d include large Asian ensembles, but consistently cast Asian-American actors as background to white story lines. Unlike the vibrant cultural celebrations of \u201cHamilton\u201d or \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d which pridefully explore ethnocultural roots through hip-hop or religion, these Asian-centric shows only \u201ccelebrate\u201d a long history of Anglo-European interference in Asia and the Pacific Islands.Asian-American actors deserve to play characters that embrace their history without focusing on the white man\u2019s role in it. They deserve to involve themselves in shows that look toward a future in which Asian-American pride is loud and present. They deserve the same opportunity to love, honor and celebrate their culture as the trailblazing African-American, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ actors currently shining on the Broadway stage.The theater community should take pride in its beacons of diversity \u2014 \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cOn Your Feet!\u201d and \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d \u2014 but should also recognize the inequality among actors of color. Modern musicals such as \u201cAllegiance,\u201d about Japanese-American internment, or \u201cHere Lies Love,\u201d about the political controversy of the Philippines, drive the industry in a positive direction, yet they have not closed the gap between Caucasian and minority \u2014 particularly, Asian \u2014 representation on Broadway. Let Broadway applaud itself for its monumental gains in the past decade, but never let it stop pushing for the equal, truthful and proud representation its diverse audience deserves.Works CitedBandhu, Pun.

My friends, who also have their driving permits, frequently joke with me about the woes of lane-changing, parallel parking and three-point turns as we prepare for our looming driver\u2019s license tests.Yet we remain part of a dwindling majority. In 1976, nearly 87 percent of high school seniors held a driver\u2019s license. By 2016, this percentage dropped to under 72, a decrease that may correlate with a climbing dependence on parental or public transportation, a lack of car ownership, or simply not needing to drive anywhere.Then add these declining rates to a rising innovation: autonomous cars. The introduction of effective autonomous cars could drastically reduce vehicular deaths, since 94 percent of traffic fatalities involve human error. Self-driving cars would eliminating the dangers of intoxicated driving, distracted driving or simply incompetent driving \u2015 and render learning to drive unnecessary.But, following the fatal Arizona crash between an autonomous Uber car and a pedestrian, Americans question the true safety of such technology. Company documents reveal that Uber\u2019s self-driving cars drove an average of only 13 miles before a human supervisor had to interfere to prevent a crash. In comparison, a study by Virginia Tech found that the average American driver crashes approximately once every 49,505 miles. Juxtaposed with the data of human drivers, Uber\u2019s autonomous cars appear laughably incompetent. Nevertheless, autonomous cars collectively travel about 113,636 miles per crash, indicating that they can and will be more reliable than humans.Autonomous cars remain far from flawlessly navigating the roads, but we often fail to consider that developers designed our traffic regulations with humans \u2014 and human error \u2014 in mind. An entire network of self-driving cars would optimize traffic congestion and pollution by reducing the number of cars on the road. Consequently, regulations such as speed bumps and parking spaces may become restrictive rather than protective. To take full advantage of autonomous cars, we must prepare to rescind and replace longstanding laws.As self-driving cars continue to improve, so does public reception of them. The percentage of Americans that distrust driverless cars decreased drastically from 74 percent in 2017 to 47 percent in 2018. If this downward trend continues, autonomous cars will soon be an accepted and integral part of society. Akin to penmanship and opera singing, human driving will soon be a practice of the past. And, given the potential security benefits and efficacy of autonomous cars, this is a future that we must accept \u2014 and even embrace.Works CitedBahrampour, Tara. \u201cNot Drinking or Driving, Teens Increasingly Put off Traditional Markers of Adulthood.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 19 Sept. 2017.Blanco, Myra. \u201cAutomated Vehicle Crash Rate Comparison Using Naturalistic Data.\u201d Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, Virginia Polytech Institute and State University, 8 Jan. 2016.\u201cCritical Reasons for Crashes Investigated in the National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey.\u201d National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Feb. 2015.Giffi, Craig A. \u201cA Reality Check on Advanced Vehicle Technologies.\u201d Deloitte Insights, Deloitte Insights, 5 Jan. 2018.Wakabayashi, Daisuke. \u201cUber\u2019s Self-Driving Cars Were Struggling Before Arizona Crash.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 23 March 2018._________Education has become an industry in which the upper-class\u2019s monopoly of resources is unchecked. A New York Times study of 38 top colleges in America, including five Ivy League schools, found that more students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire bottom 60 percent. China faces a similar conundrum, where rich families in urban areas can send their kids to \u201ckeypoint\u201d high schools. These schools receive more funding per student than average schools, have better teachers, and reliably place their students into elite colleges. In a world where income inequality is growing \u2014 China\u2019s bottom 25 percent owns less than 1 percent of the aggregate wealth while the top 1 percent owns over one-third \u2014 one wonders if people not born into wealth are doomed to poverty.However, in 2016, the Chinese Ministry of Education sparked hope when it announced 140,000 spaces \u2014 about 6.5 percent of spots in top colleges \u2014 would be reserved for students from less developed provinces. Unfortunately, this policy immediately ignited strong protests by urban parents. Under protest banners of \u201cfairness in education,\u201d protesters rallied to preserve using \u201cGaokao\u201d college-entrance examination score, as the sole metric. They noted that Gaokao mimics China\u2019s old imperial civil service exam (\u201cKeju\u201d) in relying purely on exam results and praised this meritocratic system as superior. Essentially, their argument is that in the long race of college applications, no one should be forced to run 6.5 percent further than their competitors.What these protesters failed to mention is that times have changed, and the race\u2019s participants begin on vastly different starting lines. The Keju system that was effective in bringing people from rural areas to government posts in cities, and thus increased social mobility, is not applicable in a country experiencing the fastest urbanization trend in history. As recently as 1993, over 40 percent of students in China\u2019s colleges were children of farmers or factory workers. But now social mobility is becoming an obsolete concept. Today, less than 10 percent of young people in the countryside go to senior high schools compared with 70 percent of their urban counterparts.Fairness in education is the right slogan, but a truly meritocratic system should not ignore complex social realities that put some students at a disadvantage from a young age. The Chinese government\u2019s new higher-education admissions policy is a step toward balancing the unequal \u2018starting lines\u2019 that poor, rural students face. More such creative, comprehensive policies should be encouraged. Without these measures, growing inequality in society cannot be redressed. Every citizen \u2014 regardless of location, family background or wealth \u2014 should have hope that hard work and dedication can transform their lives.Works CitedAisch, Gregor, et al. \u201cSome Colleges Have More Students From the Top 1 Percent Than the Bottom 60.

Today, our political climate is marked by increasingly acerbic and polarizing rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum. While we tend to blame those in Washington for splitting America into two, there is another major reason for this internal discord \u2014 ourselves. From social media to news outlets, we often shut ourselves in echo chambers that reinforce our existing views but exclude alternative views.Understandably, we naturally do so in the first place because we like hearing what we want to hear and because we feel confident when others accept our opinions, especially when we browse through and post on social media. But, why is this specifically bad?While some may contend that these platforms allow us to converse with like-minded individuals, echo chambers have silent, pernicious effects on the way we perceive truth. When we surround ourselves only with ideas that are similar to our own, we succumb to groupthink as we take everything we read as fact. This dangerous cycle perpetuates disinformation since we almost always don\u2019t take the time to independently verify what we read and view to be true in the echo chamber.Statistical data already proves this phenomenon. In a 2016 study published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, Swedish researchers analyzed 700,000 posts on a right-wing forum. The results were shocking: It took only six months for the average user to adopt the community\u2019s radical opinions and go from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cWe.\u201dOnce we fall under the influences of this \u201cmob mentality,\u201d we regard our beliefs as hard fact and refuse to engage in conflicting opinions, extinguishing civil discourse. For instance, when people of the same political affiliation were told to debate the merits behind denigrating rumors about the opposite party, the discussions notably veered toward reaffirming those erroneous statements.Despite the plethora of multifaceted and diverse opinions offered online, we still overwhelming choose to latch onto narrow viewpoints that we want to hear. Instead of willfully ignoring the other side, we must learn to engage in opposing perspectives to listen and understand rather than to respond or scorn at. Instead of taking everything we read in blind faith, we must learn to analyze and question it.So, at the end of the day, don\u2019t be afraid to question anything in life. Even if you feel like it\u2019s a \u201cdumb\u201d question, ask it. The more you learn, the less \u201cdumb\u201d questions you will have. But most importantly, learn to be prepared for the answer, too. It may not be what you want to hear, but that\u2019s the truth. The plain truth.Works CitedB\u00e4ck, Emma A., et al. \u201cFrom I to We: Group Formation and Linguistic Adaption in an Online Xenophobic Forum.\u201d 13 March 2018.

Although the wall hasn\u2019t been built yet, planning is underway and it\u2019s now possible to see eight prototype walls in Otay Mesa, San Diego. According to the Trump administration, this planned wall will reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants. However, building a wall is actually counterproductive and there are many more effective alternatives.It\u2019s true a wall may keep some undocumented immigrants out, which might decrease the number of these immigrants in the workforce. But, according to the Department of Homeland Security, \u201cmost undocumented immigrants now simply overstay legally obtained short-term visas \u2014 and do not sneak across the border.\u201d Simply flying to the U.S. as a tourist or visitor, many people arrive legally and then stay on as undocumented immigrants. Clearly, physically blocking people from crossing the border using a wall is not an effective way to solve the problem.Building the wall would also cut into the budget for other kinds of border control. The Trump administration plans to spend over 18 million dollars on building a border wall, or over 50 percent of the 33 billion border security budget. Spending so much to build the wall would mean budget cuts for routine spending on maintenance and border control upgrades during the wall\u2019s construction. Spending cuts would result in reductions in patrol routes, lights, cameras, sensors and personnel. This lack of maintenance and improvements would result in more undocumented immigrants crossing over during construction, not fewer.Instead of building a wall, there are more effective ways to solve the undocumented immigration issue. First, money budgeted for the wall could be spent on enhancing law enforcement efforts aimed at companies that hire undocumented immigrants. If hiring regulations are enforced and it becomes harder for undocumented immigrants to find jobs, the number of illegal border crossings would decrease. Another critical way to reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants is to continue investing in other forms of enhanced border control technology like drones and heat sensors, which would increase law enforcement\u2019s ability to find undocumented immigrants sneaking across border.If completed, the wall wouldn\u2019t be an effective protection against undocumented immigrants. Even China\u2019s Great Wall was ineffective at keeping out groups like the Mongolians or at keeping Han Chinese from leaving China to settle outside the wall illegally. Eventually, immigrants will always find ways to cross the physical obstacles that governments put in their paths. Therefore, the U.S. border security budget should be spent on actual solutions instead of on creating a big, inefficient wall that may eventually become just another tourist attraction like the one in China.Works CitedBurgos, Fredy. \u201cTrump\u2019s Mexico Border Wall Isn\u2019t Going to Stem the Flow of Undocumented Immigrants.\u201d Newsweek, 20 Dec. 2017.Nixon, Ron. \u201cTo Pay for Wall, Trump Would Cut Proven Border Security Measures.\u201d The New York Times, 8 Jan. 2018.Nixon, Ron. \u201cWhat Border Agents Say They Want (It\u2019s Not a Wall).\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 22 March 2018.Urrea, Luis Alberto. \u201cLooking at Trump\u2019s \u2018Beautiful Wall\u2019.\u201d The New York Times, 3 March 2018._________Many Americans characterize the Electoral College as a fair system that represents all Americans. Supporters point to the fact that small states like Wyoming and Delaware would be unimportant in a direct election for president and thus ignored. Under the Electoral College, they reason, candidates must pay attention to all states. Yet nearly every argument in support for the Electoral College is inconsistent.The truth is that small states are still ignored despite the extra representation. Rather than diversifying the states that candidates visit, the Electoral College forces candidates to focus on the swing states. This is because of its all-or-nothing approach to granting electors: If a candidate wins a majority in a state, he or she will win all the electors in the state. It matters not whether the candidate wins by 60 percent or 90 percent. The results of this are horrible. As The New York Times stated, \u201cIn 2016, two-thirds of all public campaign events were held in just six states\u2026.\u201dIn addition, there is not a clear reason why the small states should have their votes count more than the large states if the Electoral College does nothing to diversify the states candidates visit. Small states should have their votes count less precisely because they are smaller than the large states.Most in favor of abolishing the Electoral College want a direct national vote giving one vote to every person. However a direct national vote would still retain several problems of the Electoral College, most notably the spoiler effect. The spoiler effect occurs when a third candidate splits the vote of one of the two parties causing the candidate who would have won to lose and the candidate that a minority of Americans wanted to win. This has happened both to Republicans and Democrats and it discourages Americans from voting for a third party for fear of wasting their vote on a candidate who cannot win. Americans would still be stuck with two-party rule under this system.This problem could be alleviated with instant-runoff voting. Under this system, voters could rank their choices for candidates. If no candidate has a majority in the first round, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and the second choice of those who voted for that candidate is considered. This process is continued until one of the candidates has a majority. With instant-runoff voting, the fear of giving away an election would be eliminated because voters could choose third parties as higher choices and give lower priority to the major parties. This would diversify the political landscape of the United States and give Americans more choices for elections.Works CitedEdwards, George C., I.,II. \u201c5 Myths about the Electoral College.\u201d The Washington Post, Nov. 04, 2012, ProQuest.\u201cIt\u2019s Time to Give Instant Run-Off Balloting a Try.\u201d Montgomery Advertiser, Sept. 17, 2017, ProQuest.Lehnert, Tim. \u201cNo Vote \u2018Wasted\u2019 in This System.\u201d Telegram & Gazette, Dec. 30, 2016, ProQuest.\u201cLet the People Pick the President.\u201d Editorial.

Instead of squandering limited sources on policing an issue that history has proved impossible to eradicate, why not give sex work a legal framework that provides sex workers with medical help and legal protection against violence?Prostitution is a multimillion dollar business, yet no one is collecting taxes from it. According to Nevada brothel owner Dennis Hof, the city of Las Vegas alone could make $25 million a year, just from taxing prostitution. A study conducted by the University of California found that one American city spends on average of $2000 arresting one prostitute; this amounts to $125 million a year in enforcement costs nationwide. Legalizing sex work would turn it into a revenue maker, rather than a burden for the taxpayer.Making prostitution legal could minimize serious health concerns. Decriminalizing prostitution allows the government to regulate and monitor the trade. This, in turn, could ensure that HIV and other STD protection programs are carried out effectively, and research proves this to be true; according to expert Steffanie Strathdee\u2019s study, 46 percent of HIV infections could be averted in any of the Canadian, Kenyan and Indian cities she researched, simply by fully decriminalizing prostitution. An Australian study found that the prevalence of STDs was \u201c80 times greater in 63 illegal street prostitutes than in 753 of their legal brothel counterparts\u201d. Additionally, it was found that condom use was significantly higher in legalized sex work compared to illegal prostitution.It could be argued that authorizing sex work encourages ill treatment toward women. Research shows the opposite; legalizing prostitution actually reduces violence toward women. A study in the Netherlands found that opening designated legal street prostitution zones decreased rape and sexual abuse by 30-40 percent. It was also found that giving sex work a legal framework empowered women to demand safer sex and legal punishment of abuse. Furthermore, as Peter G. Hill brings up in his New York Times Letter to the Editor, legalizing prostitution allows the government to enforce age restrictions on sex trade, preventing underage teens from being lured into the trade.I am not proclaiming a moral judgment on prostitution; I am stating facts. Prostitution is a reality of the modern world. This modern world demands equality. It demands protection and change. Yet change, protection and equality are not being demanded for sex workers. It\u2019s time for the government to stop telling people how to live their lives, and it\u2019s time for the citizens to demand protection for those who need it.Works CitedAkers, Mick. \u201cThis Pimp Wants to End Sex Trafficking.\u201d LasVegasSun.com, 20 March 2017.Becklund, Laurie . \u201cProstitution Arrests Cost $2,000 Each, Study Finds.\u201d Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Times, 10 July 1987.Kastoryano, Stephen, et al. \u201cStreet Prostitution Zones and Crime.\u201d Cato Institute, 19 Apr. 2017.\u201cOpinion | Should Prostitution Be Legalized?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 7 Sept. 2015.\u201cProstitution, Public Health, and Human-Rights Law.\u201d The Lancet.\u201cSimple Way to Curb HIV?

I only recently recognized the connection between these two facets of myself \u2014 or rather, the lack of one: in all of my stories since childhood, I had never written about a Chinese American character. The reason? I\u2019d never really read about one either.The lack of ethnic representation in children\u2019s literature is stark. According to the publisher Lee & Low, only about 10 percent of children\u2019s books published in the last two decades contain diverse themes. Meanwhile, roughly 80 percent of people involved in children\u2019s literature \u2014 authors, illustrators, editors, publishers, etc. \u2014 are white. When people of color constitute roughly 39 percent of the current U.S. population, these numbers convey a serious problem. It has been said that books act as mirrors, allowing readers to reflect on their own identities. Children of color are deprived of the opportunity to truly see themselves in the pages they read, thus made to understand that they can never be the protagonists of their own stories.Too often, multicultural books are pushed aside because they can\u2019t connect with the majority of white readers. But to make such an argument when nonhuman characters are so popular in children\u2019s literature is to suggest that white children have more in common with animals than other children. Moreover, research has continuously shown that reading facilitates empathy and understanding. A study conducted by Laurel Hartmann specifically found that multicultural picture books \u201chelped encourage the students to search for similarities between their own lives and the lives of members of diverse cultures around the world.\u201d Thus, representative books may be just as important for white children as for children of color.In recent years, more and more attention has been brought to this issue. In 2014, an online campaign under the hashtag #WeNeedDiverseBooks turned into a nonprofit organization that advocates for diversity in children\u2019s literature. Independent publishers such as Lee & Low Books, ArtePublico Press\u2019 Pi\u00f1ata Imprint, and Just Us Books have introduced more diverse characters into print. It is up to us to support these efforts to ensure that children of color have a chance to see themselves and be seen, to remember that their stories are just as real, valid and deserving. It is up to us to buy diverse books from local bookstores, contact school libraries to ask for more inclusive selections, and promote minority writers who are representing their communities.And as a young minority writer myself, I am learning to find my voice and to speak out for all those who have lost their own. In doing so, I hope that the writers of the next generation will never learn to silence their heritage as I did.Works CitedHartmann, Laurel K. \u201cUsing Multicultural Literature in the Classroom to Encourage Tolerance and Respect.\u201d MS Thesis.

Beijing\u2019s municipal government is waging a targeted, unethical and destructive campaign against migrant communities.On November 18, 2017, a fire killed 19 people in a blue-collar apartment, prompting China\u2019s capital to initiate a safety blitz against \u201cillegal structures\u201d on its outskirts, seeking to \u201cimprove safety,\u201d according to government officials. Consequently, thousands of migrants living in these low-rent areas were forced to move or leave Beijing entirely with as little as one day\u2019s notice, as their homes and business were destroyed. These mass evictions trample on the human rights of Chinese citizens and were met with unusual public backlash. Over 100 Chinese intellectuals authored an open letter condemning the governmental actions and demanding an immediate termination of the campaign, compensation to the evicted, and increased awareness of the migrants\u2019 rights.Furthermore, the illegitimate displacements pose a serious threat to the psychological health of victims and deprive migrant children of equal access to education. At Yingbo, a private kindergarten in suburban Beijing, dozens of security officers forcibly evacuated students, causing significant trauma. Geoffrey Crothall, the director of China Labour Bulletin, explains that this coldblooded operation \u201creinforced [evictees\u2019] feelings of resentment and social exclusion.\u201dIn fact, this campaign fits into China\u2019s ongoing efforts to shrink Beijing\u2019s population. Home to approximately 21.7 million residents (including 8 million migrants), the city suffers from a \u201cmetropolitan disease\u201d and desperately needs a reduction in size. Last year, the level of annual per capita water resources was one-eightieth of the world average. In 2014, Beijing had the country\u2019s highest rates of congestion and per capita commuting time. In an attempt to transform the overcrowded capital into an upscale metropolis, Beijing aims to cap its population at 23 million by 2020.However, diluting the population of Beijing by evicting migrant workers has an acutely negative impact on the city. A Forbes study shows that the total GDP of Chinese cities is proportional to its migrant population. As Beijing\u2019s population ages, migrants are a vital bulwark against failing social and economic institutions. Li Tie, the president of the China City Development Center, states, \u201cBeijing cannot survive without them.\u201dPolicymakers must consider patterns of urban ecology when reforming Beijing. The government should allow more time for migrant families to move between houses, jobs and schools, as necessary. To empower this vital community, new employment opportunities and relocation compensation should be offered. As Beijing strives to transform into a world-class capital, it must stop treating migrants like second-class citizens.Works Cited\u201cBeijing\u2019s Total Water Consumption Will Be Less Than 4 Billion This Year.\u201d The Beijing News, 18 May 2017.Buckley, Chris. \u201cWhy Part of Beijing Looks Like a Devastated War Zone.\u201d The New York Times. 30 Nov. 2017.Hernandez, Javier and Zhao, Iris. \u201cOne Target in Beijing\u2019s Migrant Crackdown: Schoolchildren.\u201d The New York Times. 24 Dec. 2017.\u201cLi Tie: Beijing Cannot Survive without the Migrants.\u201d Sina Finance. 29 Nov. 2017.Ma, Beibei \u201cBeijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform Analyzes Four Major Causes of the \u2018Metropolitan Disease\u2019 of Beijing.\u201d China Youth Online. 23 Jan. 2016.\u201cNotice on Special Operations for Security Hazard.\u201d Beijing Municipal Work Safety Committee, 20 Nov. 2017.________Abortion is one of the most polarizing topics in the United States. For many on both sides, you\u2019re either with them or against them, and unwilling to compromise. But what if there was a way to reduce abortion rates without blocking women from getting them? The answer is simple: better sex education.For the past few decades there has been a large push to end the abstinence-only sex education implemented by many schools across the U.S. Several studies have found that an abstinence-only education does not work, as it is becoming increasingly unlikely to expect young people to remain abstinent until they are married, considering the increasing age of marriage. There has also been significant evidence that cohesive sex ed classes decrease the chances of unplanned pregnancy and abortion. In theory, abstinence is an idealistic solution, but it has been shown time and time again to be unsuccessful in practice.One program that has actually shown positive results is the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, which is evidence-based and funds a wide variety of organizations working to prevent teen pregnancy. In the past decade the CDC has reported the average teenage birthrate has dropped more than 40 percent, due to the help of the TPP and similar programs.After defunding the planned parenthood budget and closing 81 clinics in Texas, teen abortion rates were found to have risen a significant amount. Meanwhile, Colorado offered free birth control, and teen abortions decreased by 42 percent in just 4 years. This is just one example of how it has been shown that limiting access to family planning services such as planned parenthood actually drives up the need for abortions, while providing contraception and informing people of how to be safe drives the need for abortion down. Why is it then that Republican lawmakers continue to slash funding for these organizations?It would be logical to assume that an administration with a pro-life agenda would be eager to decrease abortions in any way they could, however, this seems to not be the case. Regardless of its proven benefits, the Trump administration canceled funding for 81 projects in the TPP program, while increasing funds for abstinence programs. The fact that the government is ignoring fact-based evidence under the guise of being \u201cpro-life\u201d is appalling. It has been shown that quality sex education is highly beneficial, and if the government truly wants to stop abortions from happening, this is the way to do it. Until then, we need to call them out for their blatant hypocrisy and urge legislators to pay attention to the facts, protect the rights of its citizens and remind others to stay informed.Works CitedBaker, Aspen. \u201cA Better Way to Talk about Abortion.\u201d TED: Ideas Worth Spreading, May 2015.Bassett, Laura. \u201cTeen Abortions Surged In Texas After Republicans Defunded Planned Parenthood.\u201d The Huffington Post, 12 July 2017.Bennet, James. \u201cOpinion | The Gathering Threat to Abortion Rights.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 31 Jan. 2018.Bump, Philip. \u201cAnalysis | How America Feels about Abortion.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 24 April 2017.Carroll, Aaron E. \u201cSex Education Based on Abstinence?

Discussions with my peers in the wake of the #MeToo movement have yielded shared feelings of disgust toward these abusers, and horror that we too may be part of the problem. This fear stems not from acknowledgment that we have facilitated harassment, but rather from the uncertainty of what constitutes reprehensible behavior. Our shared worry was not spurred by Harvey Weinstein or Matt Lauer ..., but instead from claims brought against Aziz Ansari. The allegations against Mr. Ansari appeared to be a landmark event, for instead of universally turning favor against him, they divided the community. Some notable feminists, including Bari Weiss, even began to back Ansari. Following the release of the allegations Weiss published an article in The New York Times in which she calls for women to be more vocal about their wishes, and states that lumping Ansari in with other accused abusers \u201ctrivializes what the #MeToo movement first stood for.\u201d This sentiment was shared by my peers. Following the publication of the original expos\u00e9, my morning commute was dominated by debates over whether what Ansari did was wrong, and whether his accuser went too far. The fact that such discussions occurred is evidence of a systematic problem across the younger generations; we are unsure what exactly constitutes inappropriate sexual behavior.The Economist recently published the results of a survey in which participants were asked whether they felt certain actions constituted sexual harassment. The findings were divided by nation, age and gender. The study concluded that in the U.S. there exists both a generational and gender gap. Older generations were shown to be less likely than younger generations to view actions such as commenting on attractiveness to be sexual harassment. Similarly, women were far more likely to view actions as harassment than their male counterparts. The divide demonstrated by the study coupled with the discourse surrounding Ansari paint a picture of a society confused, unsure and anxious. The only viable solution to such sentiments is further education.I propose redefining sexual harassment and restructuring the way young men are taught about relationships. I believe that boys should be taught from a young age what is and is not acceptable, similarly to how young children are taught the difference between a \u201cgood touch\u201d and a \u201cbad touch.\u201d While I understand my claims may be viewed as shortsighted or worse, defensive of predators, my intent is the opposite. We young men know we are the problem and that until we change these issues will still occur. We want to be a part of the solution and long for education.Works Cited\u201cOver-Friendly, or Sexual Harassment?

It\u2019s easy, often helpful, and most importantly: free.But soon, everything about that is going to change.On December 14, 2017, the Federal Commissions Committee (FCC) voted to repeal 2015\u2019s net neutrality rules, officially called Title II. These rules required internet service providers (ISPs) to give equal access to all content online without charging its consumers for higher quality, nor special treatment to certain websites. This repeal may not change the web drastically, but it will take the entire internet as we know it and chuck it down the drain.The ringleader behind the repeal, FCC chairman Ajit Pai, claimed last April that Title II \u201cabandon[s] successful policies solely because of hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom.\u201d But let\u2019s travel to net-neutrality-free countries like Portugal, where these hypothetical harms are already a reality. Portugal\u2019s wireless carrier, Meo, splits internet access into packages: a package where customers pay for traditional data, plus monthly paying packages for any other sites and apps they use \u2014 entertainment, shopping, communication. For instance, more data for both messaging apps and social networks cost \u20ac4.99 [$5.86] a month each. This means you could be paying up to $140.64 USD a year for both packages. Imagine losing almost $150 a year, just for your favorite messaging and social media sites.But wait, there\u2019s more! With no net neutrality, an ISP could block any access to an app unless the customer or the app company pays up. ISPs who view a site as a competitor, or even disagree with their political views, can be censored.And if Portugal can do that, what\u2019s stopping America from doing the same? Without the safety blanket of net neutrality, what\u2019s stopping them from silencing social movements like Black Lives Matter? Suppressing resources from communities that need them most like women, the LGBT+ and immigrants? It doesn\u2019t just hurt small businesses trying to expand, students living in poverty, or even long-distance relationships relying on the internet to communicate. It blocks any of our voices from being heard.Net neutrality is hanging by a thread, but there\u2019s still a small flicker of hope in the midst of the internet\u2019s impending doomsday. Recently, congressional Democrats introduced a resolution of disapproval to counter the FCC\u2019s repeal. Both the House and Senate must pass it in under 60 days.To my fellow Gen Z kids, and those older too \u2014 the clock is ticking. It\u2019s time to let these people know we want to save our messy, manic and magical internet.Works CitedCollins, Keith. \u201cWhy Net Neutrality Was Repealed and How It Affects You.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 14 Dec. 2017.

In a world where freedom is a luxury, underaged brides watch their aspirations die as they are sold into patriarchal family structures that display the very roots of male dominance. The underage marriage of Indian women must be eradicated in order to protect the interests of women worldwide.According to UNICEF\u2019s Child Marriage Statistics, an estimated 47 percent of girls in India continue to be involuntarily married before the age of eighteen \u2014 leaving them little time to grow and develop their social footing. Misogyny is inevitable for several of these girls \u2014 many of their fathers marry them off in an attempt to increase food rations and investments in men, who are regarded as more valuable in rural Indian societies. Unfortunately, girls are simply seen as a \u201cliability and a burden,\u201d according to Dinesh Shur, a village pastor, in a CBN article detailing child marriage in India.As such, futures remain desolate for child brides in rural India. Their educational careers are left on an indefinite hold as they bear children, often by the time they reach puberty. Instead, they spend their time doing dreary chores for their husband\u2019s families. \u201cAfter marriage, what is my work now? Washing dishes, cleaning the floor, washing clothes and cooking,\u201d states Seema, in an article written by Nel Hedayat that details the life of a child bride. With no education, no work experience and no one to turn to, child brides are left dependent on any support offered by their in-laws.What families don\u2019t realize is that by allowing girls to obtain an education rather than being forced into domestic labor could lead to the socioeconomic advancement of India as this enables potential members of the workforce. Additionally, jobs will provide women with financial security and a voice in a male-dominated society. The New York Times article \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t India\u2019s Women Working?\u201d states: \u201cWorking, and the control of assets it allows, lowers rates of domestic violence and increases women\u2019s decision-making in the household. And an economy where all the most able citizens can enter the labor force is more efficient and grows faster.\u201dAfter being upheld for thousands of years, child marriage may seem hard to stop; but it is all of our duties to help these girls through supporting and donating to educational, self-defense and women\u2019s rights groups in India. We must strive to make it possible that no young woman will ever have to see a day when a price tag is set upon her self worth and freedom again.Works CitedHedayat, Nel. \u201cWhat Is It like to Be a Child Bride?\u201d BBC News, BBC, 4 Oct. 2011.Pande, Rohini, and Charity Troyer Moore. \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t India\u2019s Women Working?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 23 Aug. 2015.Thomas, George. \u201cIndia\u2019s Innocent: Secret Weddings of Child Brides.\u201d CBN.com \u2014 The Christian Broadcasting Network, 26 March 2017.\u201cUNICEF Child Marriage Statistics.\u201d UNICEF.________It\u2019s a Saturday evening. You\u2019re flipping through the television channels when you stumble upon the movie \u201cShe\u2019s All That.\u201d Or \u201cAnother Cinderella Story.\u201d Or \u201cFreaky Friday.\u201d While each may have different characters, plot lines and messages, they are all classified as teen movies, which means they share one common feature: bullying.The bullying that occurs in these films is usually of a specific type: The football player and his buddies see the nerd with his calculator in the hallway and shove him into a locker. The cheerleaders fill the chubby girl\u2019s locker with soda so that when she opens it, she gets drenched. The huge bodybuilder of a senior beats up the scrawny freshman who accidentally bumped his backpack.I don\u2019t know if times have changed or movie writers have just forgotten what it felt like to be in high school, but in my four years of being a student, bullying has rarely been carried out in this manner. More often, it happens in whispers, through subtly closed off circles, through feigned compliments that turn into mocking giggles as soon as backs are turned. It happens over the internet: in group chats that exclude one specific person, in comments of \u201cGORGEOUS!\u201d under an Instagram post that the commenters definitely do not think is gorgeous. This cyberbullying is particularly prevalent in the lives of current teenagers, who have almost unlimited access to social media, and it \u201ccan have such a negative impact \u2026 [and] can do great harm to a whole peer group, or to school culture more generally.\u201d These more subtle types of harassment seem to be more prominent in a high school setting than physical attacks, and hurt much more.Most teen movies fail to capture this kind of bullying accurately, and in this way contribute to an unrealistic view of high school life. Bullying can have very strong effects on teenagers, \u201ccausing depression and anxiety \u2026 disrupting [teenagers\u2019] sleep, [and] causing gastrointestinal issues and headaches.\u201d If movies continue to portray bullying in the wrong way, not only may these symptoms be increased as teenagers begin to feel that their own experiences are invalid, but people will not be able to recognize true bullying behaviors. Kids are taught constantly in school not to be a bystander, but even the most noble of students cannot be expected to intervene when they don\u2019t realize that someone is being bullied. Teen movie writers need to take on the responsibility that comes with targeting the adolescent demographic, and complete research and focus groups to make sure that they are portraying one of the most common experiences in teenage life accurately. This, if nothing else, they owe to their viewers.Works CitedKlass, Perri. \u201cIn the Fight Against Bullying, a Glimmer of Hope.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 22 Dec. 2017.Strickland, Ashley. \u201cBullying Is a \u2018Serious Public Health Problem,\u2019 Experts Say.\u201d CNN, CNN, 21 June 2017._________\u201cI swear, I\u2019m so OCD,\u201d the girl says after neatly placing a bundle of colored pencils into a decorated pouch. I offer an awkward laugh, but all I can think about is my friend, who\u2019s OCD keeps him from going to school and hanging out with friends, or the article I read that says people with OCD are 10 times more likely than people without to commit suicide. How many times have you heard similar off-handed comments? \u201cThis class makes me depressed.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s so psycho.\u201d Today, a girl described the weather as \u201cbipolar.\u201d These comments are thrown around frequently without any thought to the harm they might be doing. Even I\u2019ve done it. Most of the time there\u2019s no malice, but comments like these, which trivialize serious illnesses, feed a society that stigmatizes the mentally ill, isolating them and making it impossible for them to live fulfilling lives.Using mental illnesses like descriptive adjectives and not serious disorders is trivializing, and contributes to the stigmatization of those afflicted. NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) estimates that 1 in 5 Americans suffers from a mental illness, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. \u2014 claiming well over 41,000 lives a year. In simpler words, mental illness is a big deal; such a big deal the World Health Organization sites depression \u2014 just one of many mental illnesses \u2014 as the leading cause of disability. So why do we act like they\u2019re not by using them as descriptors or for cheap laughs?Mental illness stigma leads to misunderstandings about the conditions and can create barriers to accessing treatment. In the New York Times piece \u201cAlone With My Husband\u2019s Secret,\u201d Carolyn Ali writes of her husband\u2019s struggle with depression. Even after telling his wife, he asked to keep his condition a secret from his family members because of fear of their reaction. Ali says the experience also took a tremendous toll on her. She wonders why these surprisingly common experiences are kept secret and why the stigma exists. This is just one story, but it underscores what experts say about stigma being a major cause of under-treatment.Although there are many things that lead to the stigmatization of mental illness, and many reasons for treatment barriers, the trivializing of these conditions through jokes and minimization of the severity of the conditions is contributing to the exacerbation of the problem. It can be easily addressed through increased understanding of the words we use to describe experiences and ourselves. Recognizing how serious these disorders are and choosing not to use them as merely descriptors for an exaggerated situation is one small step to a society where stigma won\u2019t prevent those from getting the treatment that they need.Works CitedAli, Carolyn. \u201cAlone With My Husband\u2019s Secret.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 1 Feb. 2018.Hawkes, Nigel. \u201cStigma Is Leading to under-Treatment of Mental Health Conditions, Says Leading Psychiatrist.\u201d The BMJ, British Medical Journal Publishing Group, 21 April 2016.\u201cMental Health By The Numbers.\u201d NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness, 12 March 2018.\u201cPatients with OCD Are 10 Times More Likely to Commit Suicide.\u201d ScienceDaily, ScienceDaily, 19 July 2016.Wilkerson, Abby L. \u201cShould I Tell My Students I Have Depression?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 14 Dec. 2016._______As R. David Lankes once said, \u201cBad libraries build collections, good libraries build services, and great libraries build communities.\u201d In an age where access to the internet is becoming more and more prevalent in people\u2019s lives, some argue that libraries are more of a financial burden than a benefit to society. However, libraries are more than an obsolete source of information. They are places of community and opportunity still important to this day, and thus should not be discarded but adapted for modern purposes.According to the Editorial Board from The New York Times, in 2015 more people visited New York\u2019s libraries than all the baseball stadiums, sports arenas, city-owned museums, gardens and zoos combined. This could be due to the fact that \u201cvirtually all libraries provide free access to the internet [and] WiFi\u201d as reported by the American Library Association. For some, libraries are even a safe haven. One woman called Sandra recalled, \u201c[Libraries were] a space to feel safe. During my high school years of hormone induced mental imbalance, I knew that I could depend on my local library.\u201d The continued use of libraries and the invaluable services they offer, such as technology training and workshops, proves the necessity of libraries in the modern world.Even more than a library\u2019s usefulness for information and support, they also provide a place for the city\u2019s community to gather. The American Library Association found that libraries have been used for book clubs, classes, forums and more. From study groups to citywide events, libraries are the ideal location for people to come together. And in an age where people\u2019s lives are becoming increasingly digitized and secluded, community is all the more important. As a high school student who utilizes the library at least once a week, I can sincerely say that I have built friendships between those bookshelves.Some people may argue that libraries still cling to archaic methods, which extremely diminishes their useful potential. And some libraries are indeed losing their effectiveness by sticking with old routines as the world shifts to a digital face. But many libraries have already adapted wonderfully to the changes. From starting online ebook libraries to integrating new software into their systems, these libraries prove that the answer is not to shut down libraries, but to help them change.Libraries are invaluable for their services, support and the opportunities they offer for the community. By helping them to adapt to current technology and modern techniques, we can ensure that libraries will continue to benefit their cities. So support your local library and take advantage of its services. Maybe you\u2019ll learn something new, or make an unexpected friend. And who knows? You may even read a book while you\u2019re there.Works Cited\u201cALA Library Fact Sheet 6.\u201d American Library Association.The Editorial Board. \u201cNew York City\u2019s Libraries Need Money.\u201d The New York Times.

Unfortunately, this is exactly the life of women in Saudi Arabia, where the treatment of women restricts their fundamental human rights.During my two years living in Dubai and Qatar, I went to Saudi Arabia three times with my father where I witnessed their discriminatory policies. In a mall in Riyadh, I was shocked to see a woman awkwardly eating noodles without taking off the veil of her niqab. She used a fork to lift the noodles toward the eye-opening, and slightly pulled the lower part away from her face, then pointed the fork down so the noodles would slide onto the inside of the veil without revealing her face.As it turns out, the Saudi government strictly prohibits women in public from ever taking off their niqabs. Saudi Arabia claims these restrictions are to ensure \u201cwomen\u2019s modesty\u201d commanded by Allah. Yet, not only are these restrictions undignifying, the Quran calls for \u201cboth men and women \u2018to cover and be modest.\u2019\u201d The fact that the Saudi government only restrict women reveals a double standard.However demeaning the requirement of wearing a niqab in public might be, it is only one symptom of a system that restricts women\u2019s fundamental rights. According to Human Rights Watch, Saudi females\u2019 lives are controlled by male guardians from birth to death due to its unique guardianship system. As hundreds of Saudi females have attested, this is a most inhuman policy as the male guardian decides whether \u201chis\u201d woman can see a doctor or even leave prison. Presumably, Saudi leadership, composed entirely of men, believes that women are unable to make the types of decisions that men make. Over time, the system gradually changes Saudi women\u2019s mind-sets, reducing them to men\u2019s property, even in their hearts. Rania, a 34-year-old Saudi woman, said, \u201cWe are entrusted with raising the next generation but you can\u2019t trust us with ourselves. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dWhile the Saudi government argues that these policies are protecting women, they have nothing to do with protection and everything to do with dehumanization. However, President Trump has proposed multiple economic collaborations with Saudi Arabia, and during his recent meeting with Prince Salman, \u201cover 20 people were at the table, yet none were women.\u201d This symbolic irony along with other policies reveal the U.S. government\u2019s unwillingness to address this gender disparity.It is time for our free nation to push for urgently-needed reforms by placing conditions of ending human rights violations to U.S.-Saudi trade deals. Instead of ignoring these human rights abuses, the United States of America should show the world that abuses are not tolerated.Works Cited\u201cBoxed In: Women and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Male Guardianship System.\u201d Human Rights Watch, 6 June 2017.Cochrane, Emily. \u201cOver 20 People Were at the Table When Trump Met the Saudis.

That is, well, tobacco in the form of cigarettes. Now, because of vape pens \u2014 technology that delivers nicotine through heated oils \u2014 American youth are experiencing the rapid rebranding of our favorite vice. While vape companies such as Juul are capitalizing on the image of a sleeker, less carcinogenic way of getting buzzed, vaping is simply a method of concealing nicotine use, without eliminating any of its physiological consequences. The discreet nature of vaping and the game of cat and mouse that it inspires between teachers and students is prompting a psychological shift among youth that enables drug consumption, while masquerading as doing the opposite.Joe Camel, the icon of tobacco conglomerate R.J. Reynolds, was executed in 1997, after nearly a decade of representing the Camel brand of cigarettes. The reasoning behind the federal government\u2019s decision to outlaw the swaggering camel was that he made smoking seem carefree and enticing to youth. Currently we are experiencing a more subtle version of the Joe Camel, in which vape pens such as Juul are reclaiming fun, risqu\u00e9 smoking. Not only do vapers have a nearly endless array of flavors to choose from, they also have apparatus that can disappear in a closed fist, according to a review of the Juul pen by NPR, in which owning a Juul is like a badge of honor. \u201cY\u2019all this kid came into my 7th period to get a juul and we all started laughing when he left so the teacher was really confused,\u201d according to @hyphyybriannaa, quoted in the study.A recent Times report on vaping attributes vaping partially to a decline in teenage cigarette smoking. While vaping is indeed helping teens move away from more carcinogenic forms of consuming nicotine, it also has the detrimental effect of making drug use seem more commonplace, cosmetic and convenient. After all, some brands of vaporizer can be charged in a laptop USB port, and concealed all day for undetectable puffing. Vaping might in fact just be hiding the harmful effect of drugs through a sleek image. In the National Institute on Drug Abuse study cited in the Times report, 51.8 percent of teens surveyed claimed that the substance inside vaporizers was \u201cjust liquid.\u201dDoes better technology make drug use permissive? No, but it certainly makes it easier. Vape pens are likely going to be short-lived in schools, which will make them only more appealing to youth. In order to truly lessen drug use, government and schools have to go after image, not just drugs themselves.Works CitedChen, Angus. \u201cTeenagers Embrace JUUL, Saying It\u2019s Discreet Enough To Vape In Class.\u201d NPR. 4 December 2017.Elliot, Stuart. \u201cJoe Camel, a Giant in Tobacco Marketing, Is Dead at 23.\u201d The New York Times. 11 July 1997.Hoffman, Jan. \u201cMarijuana and Vaping Are More Popular Than Cigarettes Among Teenagers.\u201d The New York Times. 14 December 2017.________Since 1970, the global Catholic population has nearly doubled. At the same time, 5,000 fewer priests are active in the Church, creating a worldwide priest shortage in which more than 20 percent of parishes lack a resident priest. To address this crisis, the Catholic Church should end the ban on female ordination.Although most supporters of a male-only clergy cite Church tradition, ordaining women only chafes against modern constraints. In fact, the Church didn\u2019t change their rules on ordination in this respect until the 11th century. To be clear, this means women served as priests, deaconesses and even bishops for nearly 1000 years. In the early Middle Ages, the changing Church not only closed these roles to men, but attempted to change contemporary and ancient records to obscure that women ever served in these roles, a campaign that has been remarkably successful through modern times.If tradition is not enough proof, then perhaps Scripture itself provides a better basis. In Paul\u2019s letter to the Romans, he refers to \u201cour sister Phoebe, a deacon\u201d (Rom 16:1). Further, his letter to the Galatians states that \u201cIn Christ there is no Jew or Greek, slave or citizen, male or female. All are one in Christ Jesus\u201d (Gal 3:28). Even the Gospels show the importance of women to Jesus\u2019s ministry. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is widely accepted as the first disciple, and the first Apostles, or witnesses to the Resurrection, are all women, including Mary Magdalene, who reveals the news to the initially disbelieving male disciples. When it comes to celebrating the Resurrection, the purpose of a Catholic Mass, Scripture proves women are equally qualified to do so.If there ever was a time to expand the priesthood, it is now. The Francis Effect has expanded the laity in new ways, welcoming lapsed Catholics disillusioned by social positions of the Church and the sexual abuse scandal, as well as LGBT Catholics. The energy of young people on the side of the Francis Effect can and should be harnessed by a movement to allow women to fulfill their vocation to the priesthood.However, proponents of ordaining women should acknowledge the difficulty of any movement in an institution as reluctant to change as the Church. Some dioceses in the United States don\u2019t even allow girls to altar serve, and Pope Francis, the face of the inclusive Church movement, has made clear his opposition to ordaining women. Still, if Church leaders want to recruit more priests to end the shortage, they would be wise to open the position to the other half of the population.Works CitedEgan, Timothy. \u201cA Francis Effect for a Broken System.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 24 Sept. 2015.\u201cFrequently Requested Church Statistics.\u201d CARA, Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, 2017.Macy, Gary. \u201cThe Hidden History of Women\u2019s Ordination: Female Clergy in the Medieval West.\u201d Oxford University Press, 2008._________In 1997, Tarana Burke was working at a youth camp when a 13-year-old girl told Ms. Burke that her stepfather had been sexually abusing her. Tarana was left speechless \u2014 what could she tell the girl, and hundreds of others in her position, that would convey that she understood and felt their pain? Ten years after that conversation, Ms. Burke finally found what she needed to say: me too.As a survivor of child sexual assault, I have been waiting for these two words for a very long time \u2014 seeing the #MeToo movement explode empowered me to share my experiences with others after years of being silent. The #MeToo movement brought me to a place in which I felt that I could openly discuss my experience without judgment or victim blaming. Saying #MeToo is a statement of understanding like no other. But what must remain fundamental is that the movement is about more than awareness and empathy. It is also about changes to laws and policies that perpetuate the imbalance of power between men and women. It is about challenging social norms and a culture in which the victim is instinctively blamed for the crime.This issue requires us, as a society, to examine ourselves and our culture that allows and encourages this type of behavior. At some point, we must ask ourselves if the \u201cproblem\u201d of sexual assault is an unintended consequence or the purposeful product of a system designed to systematically isolate, silence and marginalize those with lesser power. A report from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that 75 percent of workplace harassment incidents go unreported \u2014 for those who did speak out, 75 percent faced retaliation from their employer. A matter of such magnitude cannot be mended on a case-by-case basis. Comprehensively fixing this issue starts with providing women effective reporting options beyond filing a complaint with HR or talking to their managers \u2014 options that often have only the company\u2019s best interest at heart \u2014 and giving women decision-making roles in which they have the same chance for success as men.Although the #MeToo movement is not exempt from criticism, those who call it as a \u201cmoral panic\u201d are misdiagnosing it. What #MeToo is a social movement that finally holds powerful men accountable for their actions; as author David Perry writes, #MeToo is not an act of persecution, but rather a rebellion against the powers that persecute. In order for our culture to change and in order for future generations to grow up in an equitable world, we must build on #MeToo as a vehicle for reform in our courts, workplaces and schools.

{"Headline": "What Is the Trade Deficit?", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not a scorecard, and reducing it won\u2019t necessarily be good for jobs.A core idea that Donald J. Trump has embraced throughout his time in public life has been that the United States is losing in trade with the rest of the world, and that persistent trade deficits are evidence of this fact.In this accounting, the $69 billion United States trade deficit with Mexico or $336 billion gap with China is something of a scorecard reflecting diminishing American greatness. The vast majority of economists view it differently. In this mainstream view, trade deficits are not inherently good or bad. They can be either, depending on circumstances.As the president\u2019s emphasis on trade deficits puts the United States at odds with allies \u2014 in this case at the Group of 7 leaders meeting this weekend in Canada \u2014 the trade-offs in making this an overwhelming focus of economic diplomacy are becoming more clear.Trying to eliminate the trade deficit could mean giving up some of the key levers of power that allow the United States to get its way in international politics. The reasons have to do with the global reserve currency, economic diplomacy and something called the Triffin dilemma.What is the trade deficit?Imagine a world with only two countries, and only two products. One country makes cars; the other grows bananas.People in CarNation want bananas, so they buy $1 million worth from people in BananaLand. Residents of BananaLand want cars, so they buy $2 million of them from CarNation.That difference is the trade deficit: BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit; CarNation has a $1 million trade surplus.But this does not mean that BananaLand is \u201closing\u201d to CarNation. Cars are really useful, and BananaLanders got a lot of them in exchange for their money.Similarly, it\u2019s true that the United States has a large trade deficit with Mexico, for example. But it\u2019s not as if Americans were just flinging money across the Rio Grande out of charity. Americans get a lot of good stuff for that: avocados, for example, and Canc\u00fan vacations.If you want to think of it in terms of winners and losers, you could justifiably reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred framing: \u201cThose losers in Mexico gave us $69 billion more stuff than we gave them last year. Ha, ha, ha. We\u2019re winners.\u201dWhat does that have to do with savings and investment?When a country runs a trade deficit, there is a countervailing force. Think back to our pretend countries. BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit with CarNation. But that means that car producers in CarNation are sitting on an extra $1 million a year in income.Something has to happen with that $1 million. If CarNation doesn\u2019t want the value of its currency to rise, it has to take that $1 million trade surplus and plow it back into BananaLand. There are different ways it could do that. People in CarNation could buy stocks or bonds in BananaLand, or companies in CarNation could invest in factories in BananaLand, or the government of CarNation could buy assets directly.In effect, the flow of capital is the reverse of the flow of goods. And the trade deficit will be shaped not just by the mechanics of what products people in the two countries buy, but also by unrelated investment and savings decisions. The cause and effect goes both directions.So, for example, if a country enacts a giant tax cut that increases its budget deficit, it is effectively lowering its savings rate \u2014 which tends to increase its trade deficit.That, of course, is exactly the fiscal policy choice the United States has made, so the tax cut passed late last year will tend to increase the trade deficit relative to its level if tax rates had remained unchanged.But don\u2019t trade deficits mean fewer jobs?Maybe.It is true that a trade deficit subtracts from a country\u2019s gross domestic product. G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within a country\u2019s borders, so when a country is selling less stuff abroad than it buys from abroad, the country is making less stuff, and as a result there are fewer jobs. This piece of the Trump theory of trade is true.But the flow of capital into the country \u2014 the inverse of the trade deficit \u2014 creates benefits that can be good for jobs, by encouraging more domestic investment.This isn\u2019t just an abstraction. It\u2019s what has happened between the United States and China for the last couple of decades. China has had consistent trade surpluses, but it did not want its currency to rise in a way that would undermine its exporters. So money has flowed from China into the United States \u2014 both from the Chinese government\u2019s purchases of United States Treasury bonds and more recently in the form of direct investment from Chinese companies into the United States.When you see a headline about a Chinese company buying American hotels or factories, you\u2019re seeing the flip side of the trade deficit Mr. Trump bemoans. (The same when a citizen of China buys a luxury apartment in a Trump tower.) Money flowing into a country is usually considered a good thing. It makes borrowing money cheaper, drives up stock prices and can mean more investment in new businesses.So does a trade deficit mean fewer jobs? It depends on which force is more economically powerful: fewer jobs creating exports or investment dollars flowing into the country.So which is it?It depends on what the country does with the investment that comes in.In theory, that money could go toward long-lasting investments with positive economic returns: new factories and equipment; education for the work force; new roads and bridges, or repairs and improvements to existing ones.Unfortunately, how countries use these capital inflows is not always so fruitful. In the United States, the influx of foreign capital in the mid-2000s went in large part to fuel an unsustainable housing and mortgage bubble. Greece\u2019s capital inflows in the same time period went to fund bloated public spending.When the world is flinging money at you, it\u2019s important to use it for something productive. It\u2019s not that trade deficits (and the capital inflows that are their flip side) don\u2019t matter \u2014 but just knowing the numbers doesn\u2019t tell you much about whether they are good, bad or indifferent.Wouldn\u2019t it be better if the U.S. didn\u2019t run a deficit?It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s even an option, because the dollar isn\u2019t used just in trade between the United States and other countries.The dollar is a global reserve currency, meaning that it is used around the world in transactions that have nothing to do with the United States. When a Malaysian company does business with a German company, in many cases it will do business in dollars; when wealthy people in Dubai or Singapore\u2019s government investment fund want to sock away money, they do so in large part in dollar assets.That creates upward pressure on the dollar for reasons unrelated to trade flows between the United States and its partners. That, in turn, makes the dollar stronger \u2014 and American exporters less competitive \u2014 than they would be in a world where nobody used the dollar for anything except commerce involving the United States.The roughly $500 billion trade deficit that the United States runs each year isn\u2019t just about poorly negotiated trade deals and currency manipulation by this or that country. It\u2019s also, to some degree, a byproduct of the central role the United States plays in the global financial system.There\u2019s even a name for this: the Triffin dilemma. In the mid-20th century, the economist Robert Triffin warned that the provider of the global reserve currency would need to run perpetual trade deficits to keep the world financial system from freezing, with those trade deficits potentially fueling domestic booms and busts.If having the global reserve currency means bleeding jobs overseas, why keep it?Be careful what you wish for.There\u2019s no doubt that maintaining the global reserve currency creates costs for the United States, namely a less competitive export industry.But it also creates a lot of advantages. Lower interest rates and higher stock prices are among them (though they have the downside of also feeding debt-driven booms and busts). Even more important is what the dollar\u2019s prominence in global finance does for America\u2019s place in the world.It helps ensure that the United States can afford to finance wars, and it gives the government greater ability to fight recessions and panics. A country experiencing a banking panic will see money sent out of the country, causing its currency to fall and its interest rates to rise. All that limits a government\u2019s options for fixing the problem. In 2008, when the United States experienced a near collapse of the banking system, the opposite happened.The centrality of the dollar to global finance gives the United States power on the global stage that no other country can match. It has enforced sanctions on Iran, Russia, North Korea and terrorist groups with the implicit threat of cutting off access to the dollar payments system for any bank in the world that does not cooperate with American foreign policy.Part of what makes the United States powerful is the great importance of the dollar to global finance. And part of the price the United States pays for that status is a stronger currency and higher trade deficits than would be the case otherwise.The debate over the trade deficit is about more than Mexico and China, cars and bananas, or winning and losing. It\u2019s about what makes America great, and which of the country\u2019s priorities should come first.Advertisement"}

Gabriel Schulze, an American businessman with ties to both North Korea and to Jared Kushner, helped set things up.For Mr. Schulze, the scion of a family that made billions in mining, a thaw in America\u2019s relationship with North Korea would be potentially lucrative. His firm, SGI Frontier Capital, adopts a high-risk strategy of investing in so-called frontier markets \u2014 Ethiopia, Mongolia and elsewhere.

{"Headline": "What Trump Should Learn From the \u2018Banana War\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBy taking off the gloves, I mean that literally: a tariff on imported leather gloves would hit China, France, Belgium and Italy, which all are in President Trump\u2019s cross hairs.And why stop there? Luxury cars, perfume, handbags, wine, spirits and cheese are on a list drawn up by the White House of items that the United States could target for tariffs, according to an outside adviser to Mr. Trump with knowledge of the list.The Trump administration has already imposed 25 percent levies on steel, but few people go out and buy steel bars. Mercedes-Benzes, Lexuses and BMWs are another story \u2014 those are recognizable products that plenty of Americans shop for every day. Mr. Trump has already floated the possibility of a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, a dagger aimed directly at German and Japanese exporters.The idea of hitting luxury products has its attractions: It hurts exporting countries but not cost-conscious consumers, who presumably aren\u2019t buying many six-figure bottles of wine.But the Europeans backed off after the United States threatened to slap 100 percent tariffs on a total of about $520 million in European luxury exports.The targeted products included cashmere sweaters from Britain, Pecorino cheese from Italy and handbags from France. Roquefort, the pungent artisanal blue cheese from southwest France, was threatened with especially punitive 300 percent tariffs, prompting angry sheep farmers to storm a McDonald\u2019s in the town of Millau, the center of the Roquefort-producing region.Ten years later, the Bush administration actually imposed a 300 percent tariff on Roquefort (along with Spanish hams and Italian mineral water) after the European Union banned the import of hormone-treated beef from the United States. In a compromise, the bloc agreed to expand imports of hormone-free American beef (while keeping the hormone ban), and President Barack Obama scrapped the tariffs.To some trade warriors, luxury goods are especially appealing targets because there are readily available American-made substitutes, and affluent customers can afford the higher prices.American consumers may think otherwise.To assess the potential impact, I reached out to some retailers and residents in Palm Beach, Fla., a hotbed of wealthy Trump supporters, where the valet parking garage at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club is filled with Mercedes cars and Chanel\u2019s trademark quilted leather handbags are as common as canvas totes.Forbes estimates the average net worth of Palm Beach residents is $29.7 million.Maurice Amiel, who owns the French Wine Merchant there, told me this week that he had been in the wine trade for 40 years. Although he stocks wines from all over the world, 90 percent of what he sells comes from his native France. Stiff tariffs on French wine \u201cwould be terrible,\u201d he said, especially for producers, shippers and retailers like him.That\u2019s because there\u2019s so much competition among wine retailers that it would be hard to simply pass on the higher cost to consumers. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sell Beaujolais if a tariff causes the price per bottle to go from $20 to $40,\u201d he said, referring to wine from the region just south of Burgundy. \u201cI\u2019d have to absorb a lot of the increase.\u201dThat\u2019s not the case with the high-end \u201cgrand crus\u201d produced in Burgundy and Bordeaux. \u201cWe have some of the most affluent wine buyers in the world here\u201d in Palm Beach, he said. \u201cIf they love the wine they\u2019ll buy it, regardless of price.\u201dThey didn\u2019t blink when prices for first-growth Bordeaux in sought-after vintages like 2009 and 2010 climbed above $1,000 a bottle. (A bottle of 2009 Lafite-Rothschild currently goes for $1,595 at Sherry-Lehmann in New York.) As a result, Mr. Amiel said, he\u2019d concentrate more on selling first growths and expensive Burgundy.Mr. Amiel\u2019s greatest fear, he said, is that Mr. Trump will use tariffs to whip up anti-French, pro-American nationalist fervor. That happened in 2001, after France refused to support the American invasion of Iraq, and many Americans boycotted French products. Mr. Amiel\u2019s business barely survived. \u201cNo tariff can be as bad as that,\u201d he said.The United States is France\u2019s largest export market for wine. In 2017 those exports were nearly $3.5 billion.Mercedes-Benz of Palm Beach is one of the country\u2019s largest dealers. A Mercedes-Benz spokeswoman, Andrea Berg, stressed that tariffs on German luxury cars hurt Americans, not just Europeans.\u201cWe believe in the benefits of free trade and competition,\u201d she said. \u201cDaimler Group subsidiaries have been firmly established in the United States for decades. As employers, exporters and good corporate citizens, they provide billions of dollars in direct and indirect support to the United States economy.\u201dEdward Elson, a retail entrepreneur and Palm Beach resident who served as United States ambassador to Denmark under President Bill Clinton, agreed with Mr. Amiel that even punitive tariffs would have little immediate impact on many Palm Beach residents.\u201cYou see Mercedes everywhere, and all the women carry those handbags,\u201d he said, referring to the ubiquitous Chanels. \u201cTo be candid, they don\u2019t care that much about price.

{"Headline": "The Trump Trade Slump May Yet Happen: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump broke with protocol by tweeting about jobs report\u2022 Investors have compared Facebook\u2019s actions to human rights violations\u2022 Deutsche Bank can\u2019t catch a break\u2022 Goldman\u2019s consumer finance plans are bigger than you thoughtBefore Donald Trump became president, many feared that the combative trade policies he was proposing would sock the U.S. economy and send unemployment higher.Is this unexpected state of affairs sustainable?If anything, the strength of the economy might persuade Mr. Trump that he can pursue his trade agenda without causing too much collateral damage at home. That could mean following through on his threats to impose tariffs on Chinese products totaling as much as $150 billion.Whether Mr. Trump does so should become clear soon. On June 15, the administration is scheduled to release a final list of $50 billion of Chinese goods subject to tariffs, which would then be imposed shortly thereafter.Some in the administration have warned that a protectionist trade policy could drag the economy and the stock market. But the longer the economy keeps churning out jobs, and the longer the stock market remains resilient, the harder it will be for those advisers to make their case. Indeed, the U.S. may be less sensitive to trade frictions than economists and investors previously believed.But that is a very optimistic scenario, and much could still go wrong.The metals tariffs, alone, are unlikely to crater the markets or hammer the economy. But a full-blown trade war with China, involving $150 billion of tariffs and everything China has promised in retaliation, would almost certainly shake the confidence of investors and businesses. Tomasz Wieladek, an economist at Barclays, in a report on Friday said the metals tariffs and those against China, along with retaliatory actions, could knock nearly a full percentage point off global growth.The fact that the stock market hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since mid-February,when the trade rhetoric heated up, suggests investors never really shrugged off the prospect of trade wars. Now, as a confrontation with China approaches, markets may become volatile as investors prepare for the fallout.It\u2019s also important to remember that the strength of the economy is not an unalloyed positive. If the buoyant conditions, and the impact of new tariffs, produce higher inflation, the Federal Reserve will have less leeway to relax monetary policy in response to a big trade shock or a stock market plunge. In other words, investors would have no protection from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.One way to view the current situation is that Mr. Trump is an opportunist who has astutely ridden an economic expansion that had long been underway \u2013 and is now hoping it will carry him through a drawn-out trade battle.It\u2019s a bold, far from certain, bet.\u2014Peter EavisThe Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely releases its monthly employment report on the first Friday of the month. The night before, under longstanding tradition, the president and several senior administration officials \u2014 including the Treasury secretary and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 are briefed on the numbers, which they are not supposed to disclose until the report is made public at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time the next morning.But Mr. Trump, who was briefed on the numbers Thursday evening, appeared to foreshadow the strength of the latest report on Friday morning on Twitter.Market watchers saw evidence that the tweet was moving markets.Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, pushed back on whether Mr. Trump broke with protocol.President Trump tweeted earlier this morning that he was looking forward to the jobs report. We now know why.Drew Armstrong, a reporter at Bloomberg, tweeted the strong reaction of the dollar after the report\u2019s release:SoftBank\u2019s investment in G.M.\u2019s driverless car division and Waymo\u2019s move to create a huge fleet of robot-taxis suggest maybe not.G.M.

Analysts have raised second-quarter earnings estimates for S.&P. 500 companies 0.2 percent during April and May, according to FactSet.That might not seem like much, but over the past 10 years, quarterly earnings estimates have declined, on average, 3.7 percent during the first two months of that quarter.The gain so far this quarter falls well short of the record set during the first two months of the first quarter of this year. As analysts factored in tax cuts signed into law in late 2017, they raised profit expectations 5.7 percent in January and February.Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the centrist Democrat from North Dakota who is fighting a pitched battle to save her seat, has gotten a lift from an unlikely source: the conservative billionaire Koch brothers.The ad is the latest evidence that the brothers, often at odds with President Trump, may be moving away from strictly partisan work on behalf of Republicans in favor of initiatives that will advance their libertarian-leaning legislative priorities, including free trade, immigration legislation and access to medicines, regardless of party affiliation.Ms. Heitkamp is one of 10 Democratic senators up for re-election in states won by Mr. Trump in 2016, but unlike other Democrats, she has drawn a top-flight challenger in Kevin Cramer, North Dakota\u2019s lone House member and a close ally of the president\u2019s. Her seat is one of the keys to Republican efforts to hold on to or expand the party\u2019s one-seat Senate majority.The former Treasury secretary has joined the board of the Financial Services Volunteer Corps, an organization that helps build up the banking systems in developing countries, the group announced on Friday.Founded in 1990 at the behest of President George H. W. Bush to help Eastern European countries following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Corps now provides technical assistance to emerging economies worldwide. Its board includes Paul Volcker, Henry Kissinger, the former Goldman Sachs co-president John Thornton and the former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.Mr. Lew, who served a number of advisory roles in the Obama administration before becoming Treasury secretary in 2013, is taking the board seat that had been held by Randy Quarles, who is now the Fed\u2019s vice chair for supervision.From Mr. Lew\u2019s statement:And from a statement by Bill Donaldson, the former banker and S.E.C. chairman, who serves as the Corps\u2019s chairman:\u201cJack is an outstanding addition to our Board.

{"Headline": "Stock Markets Slip on Trade Policy Fears", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors have stopped not caring about a trade war.For months, financial markets shrugged off the escalating language and the imposition of tit-for-tat tariffs between the Trump administration and the United States\u2019 most important trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union and China.But in the past several trading sessions, that apathy has been replaced by what looks like mounting alarm about the prospect of a global race to erect trade barriers.On Monday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell sharply, ending the day down 1.4 percent, apparently spooked by signs that the growing trade war could have a negative impact on American companies. That decline, and similar ones in other benchmark indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average, came after the S.& P. slumped 0.9 percent last week.\u201cI think we\u2019re slowly slipping into a more serious stage in the trade war,\u201d said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cPeople are beginning to realize there\u2019s no sign of de-escalation in sight.\u201dThe sell-off is increasingly broad. Tech shares joined industrials in a sharp fall as American markets opened Monday, after reports that President Trump was considering restrictions on Chinese investments in American technology companies.The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index and the tech sector of the S.&P. 500 both fell more than 2 percent.Semiconductor companies were especially hard hit.The chip makers Micron Technology and AMD fell 6.9 percent and 4.4 percent. Intel dropped 3.4 percent. Concerns about the impact of a trade war seemed to be spreading to some giant tech companies, including Apple, Google\u2019s parent Alphabet, and Microsoft. Because of those companies\u2019 large sizes, moves in their stock prices have big impacts on stock market indexes.Industrials also continued to respond poorly to the trade rancor. The S.&P. 500\u2019s industrial sector fell more than 1 percent, led by drops in American manufacturers like the aircraft maker Boeing and the machinery manufacturer Caterpillar, both of which have large and important markets in China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Fret About a Trade War, but They Aren\u2019t Fleeing the Stock Market", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a conference held by a top investment bank in Manhattan last week, attendees were asked to submit what they thought was the biggest risk to the global economy. When their concerns showed up on the conference screen, these words were the most popular: Trump, trade war and protectionism.Outside, meanwhile, the stock market was having another up day.In recent weeks, against the expectations of many on Wall Street, investors have not run for the exits as President Trump has stepped up trade brawls with China, Canada and the European Union. On Friday, when the Trump administration and China announced tit-for-tat tariffs on $50 billion of goods from each country, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index finished barely lower. The index has gained 2 percent since the end of February, when Mr. Trump began to take action on trade in earnest, and it remains up 30 percent since his election in November 2016.Why have the markets held up when the prospect of a trade war unnerves many on Wall Street? The United States economy appears to be a picture of health and corporate earnings are surging. That seems to have investors betting that the collateral damage will be manageable.The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta predicted that the United States economy could grow at 4.8 percent rate in the second quarter, which would be the second-highest quarterly growth rate in the past decade. Unemployment is at multiyear lows, retail sales are strong, consumer confidence is high and the inflation rate remains relatively subdued. This strong run could continue if tax cuts for businesses and consumers prompt higher spending.And, most important to investors, companies\u2019 earnings are set to rise at their fastest pace since the years immediately following the financial crisis. Wall Street analysts expect the profits of companies in the S.&P. 500 to surge 26 percent this year, after a 17 percent rise last year.Rising profits might explain why investors are putting more money in the United States stock market while getting out of other countries. In the past six weeks, a net $29 billion has poured into funds that invest in United States stocks, while $13 billion flowed out of those focused on European stocks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. At the start of this year, analysts expected solid growth around the world, but now Europe\u2019s economy is showing signs of weakness, and turbulence has returned to the markets of some developing countries.But there are few signs in the United States that anxiety about trade is causing a significant pullback in business spending. \u201cWe really don\u2019t see it in the numbers,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s just not there.\u201dEconomists are not forecasting big hits to the United States economy from the trade policies either in effect or imminent. Goldman Sachs\u2019s economists predicted that the $50 billion of tariffs against China would shave no more than two-tenths of a percentage point off gross domestic product after two years.Of course, the trade battles could escalate instead. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose an additional $100 billion of tariffs on China, which would most likely retaliate with its own tariffs. That would do more economic damage and cause some nervy days in the stock market, but not necessarily calamity, said Brad W. Setser, a fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. Countries, he said, have ways to soften the blow. \u201cYou would start to see some real disruption and higher short-term costs but not the sort of costs that would trigger a recession\u201d in either the United States or China, he said.Still, there are signs of fear lurking in the stock market.The S.&P. 500 remains below its peak hit in January, and some analysts say the trade tensions may be holding it back. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the overall market made a new high considering all the fiscal stimulus?\u201d David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, said. Stocks of technology companies and smaller companies have done particularly well in recent weeks, indicating that investors right now are drawn to companies that are less vulnerable to trade wars, Mr. Rosenberg added.Also, it is too early to conclude that the United States can mostly shrug off trade battles. Many American businesses have operations abroad or get a large share of their revenue from foreign markets. The retaliation by other countries has barely begun.Tariffs push up the costs for businesses, which in turns crimps their profits. If companies start to warn that profits will come in below expectations because of trade, the stock markets in the United States could decline sharply.The United States economy could start to disappoint. Interest rates are rising, in part, because the United States federal government is borrowing large sums to cover the fiscal shortfall that resulted from the recent tax cuts. Higher interest rates can quickly crimp growth. This may happen as the economies in Europe are wobbling and those of several large developing countries are showing signs of stress. \u201cThere is reason to suspect that we slow the pace of growth in the second half,\u201d said James W. Paulsen, a stock market strategist at the Leuthold Group.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Investors Aren\u2019t Spooked by Cracks in the International Economic Order", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s policies are straining the international trading system that for decades has helped corporate America reap increasing profits. So why is the stock market moving higher, while relations between the United States and its largest trading partners are deteriorating?The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up on Monday, the first day of trading after Mr. Trump\u2019s pugnacious stance rattled the summit meeting of the Group of 7 nations that was held over the weekend.The calm makes some sense. Investors think that trade skirmishes could be outweighed by two major reasons to be bullish.First, economic growth in the United States, which has been relatively strong for some time, may now pick up even more. Recent tax cuts might encourage businesses and consumers to spend more. Wall Street analysts expect profits of the companies in the S.&P. 500 index to surge by 26 percent this year, which is a remarkable amount. And companies with top-performing stocks, such as Netflix and Microsoft, sell products and services that are unlikely to be the direct target of hostile trade actions.Second, when Wall Street analysts do drill down to try to discern the impact of specific tariffs on companies, their conclusions are not that worrisome. Take Mr. Trump\u2019s levies on steel and aluminum, which are now in effect. These have enraged other countries and will no doubt push up costs for many United States companies that use the metals. But the overall impact on corporate earnings might be muted.The stock prices of Ford and General Motors \u2014 two companies that should be hurting from the rising metal prices \u2014 have risen since mid-February, when it became clear that the Trump administration was intent on imposing its metals tariffs.Mr. Trump, of course, is threatening more than just metals tariffs. On Friday, the United States is scheduled to release its final list of products from China that will be covered by a further $50 billion of tariffs. The Trump administration said it would impose the tariffs soon afterward. China has threatened to retaliate.Yet investors, even though they know a trade war is looming, have not dumped stocks in some of the companies that look particularly vulnerable. Computer chip makers like Qualcomm have a large proportion of their sales in China, but Qualcomm\u2019s stock has recently rallied.Investors may be less bullish about the overall market than they look. The S.&P. 500 is up only 2 percent since mid-February, when the recent trade tensions began in earnest \u2014 and that small increase has relied heavily on a rally in technology stocks. If it wasn\u2019t for concerns over trade, Wall Street\u2019s recently upgraded earnings expectations might have pushed stocks to much higher levels than they are at right now.The imposition of $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods is likely to lead to some rocky days for the stock market. But unless investors believe that profits are going to get whacked, they appear willing to tolerate Mr. Trump\u2019s trade measures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Touts Jobs Report Before Official Release, Breaking Protocol", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump broke years of presidential protocol on Friday morning with a tweet that signaled a strong jobs report was on its way from the Labor Department, an hour before the report was released.While the White House brushed off any notion that Mr. Trump had crossed a line, legal experts said the tweet raised possible insider trading concerns and economists said it was a blatant misuse of presidential power.The Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely releases its monthly employment report on the first Friday of the month. The night before, under longstanding tradition, the president and several senior administration officials \u2014 including the Treasury secretary and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 are briefed on the numbers, which they are not supposed to disclose until the report is made public at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time the next morning.But Mr. Trump, who was briefed on the numbers Thursday evening, appeared to foreshadow the strength of the latest report on Friday morning on Twitter.\u201cLooking forward to seeing the unemployment numbers at 8:30 this morning,\u201d Mr. Trump posted at 7:21 a.m.White House officials downplayed the president\u2019s tweet. Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the National Economic Council, said that he had shared the jobs report on Thursday evening with the president but expressed no concern with Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet on Friday morning.\u201cI don\u2019t think he gave anything away, incidentally. I think this is all according to routine, law and custom,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on CNBC.But economists criticized Mr. Trump for breaking a longstanding practice, and possibly a federal regulation.Because it is widely known that presidents have early access to jobs numbers, and because Mr. Trump has never before tweeted that he was \u201clooking forward\u201d to a report release, \u201cI would be willing to bet that some people traded off of this,\u201d said Thomas O. Gorman, a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement official who is now a partner at the law firm Dorsey & Whitney.\u201cThe fact of the matter is, he knew it was good, it was good, and he signaled it,\u201d Mr. Gorman said, referring to the number in the jobs report. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say, by the way, company A is going to buy company B. You can just signal it. The word selection is very clear. He knew exactly what he was doing.\u201dA spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission would not comment on whether the agency was aware of any unusual market activity before the report was released. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission did not respond to a similar request for comment.On Wall Street, where the 8:30 a.m. release on Jobs Friday is a major event for the markets each month, traders disagreed on whether the tweet actually moved prices, which fluctuate constantly and make it difficult to determine if any single event pushed them in one direction or another.But observers also said it is clear that watching the presidential Twitter feed is now being incorporated into the ritual of preparing for the Bureau of Labor Statistics update.\u201cI think the markets certainly paid attention,\u201d said Aaron Kohli, a government bond market strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York, of the president\u2019s Friday tweet. \u201cAnd will do so next month should there be a tweet, or lack of one.\u201dMany trading firms already use computers to keep track of social media traffic in the hope of garnering trading signals.\u201cMost sophisticated firms these days are following Twitter, and in the age of Trump, a lot of firms have trading models that are following him,\u201d said Larry Tabb, founder of the Tabb Group, a financial markets research and advisory firm.Still, some expressed concern that the president could turn one of the most important signals about the health of the economy into a trading game that could destabilize financial markets by prompting a rapid sell-off in advance of future jobs reports if Mr. Trump did not tout the upcoming release.Washington has long tried to prevent market-moving data like the employment numbers from being prematurely released. In 1985, the White House Office of Management and Budget issued a regulation governing the release of embargoed federal data like the jobs report, including a requirement that employees of the executive branch not comment publicly on the data until an hour after its release.It is unclear whether the regulation applies to Mr. Trump, some legal experts said. \u201cI would be very cautious about assuming this applies to the president, who is generally not considered an employee\u201d of the executive branch, said Adam Scales, a law professor at Rutgers University who teaches administrative law.The Republican National Committee responded to the criticism of Mr. Trump on Friday afternoon by flagging an evening speech by President Barack Obama on Feb. 5, 2009, the night before the first jobs report release of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency.The economy was shedding jobs rapidly in the depths of the Great Recession and Mr. Obama, pushing for passage of an economic stimulus bill, told a congressional Democratic retreat that \u201cTomorrow we\u2019re expecting another dismal jobs report, on top of the half a million jobs that were lost last month, on top of the half a million jobs that were lost the month before that, on top of the 2.6 million jobs that were lost last year.\u201dEven before the numbers were released on Friday, economists said they were stunned at the prospect that Mr. Trump was giving hints about the report\u2019s content, which fast-acting traders in financial markets could seize on to place bets on an optimism-fueled market surge.Austan Goolsbee, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for a year during President Obama\u2019s first term, called Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet \u201ctotally inappropriate\u201d. If he or another official had sent a tweet like the president\u2019s, he said, he would have been investigated.\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a breakdown of a norm, this is really an abuse of the office,\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said.Other economists went further, raising the possibility that if Mr. Trump was willing to give Twitter users a premature hint at the strength of report, he could also have shared the numbers with a more select group even earlier.\u201cPresident Trump was sent the jobs numbers in advance,\u201d said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government who was Mr. Obama\u2019s final chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cSharing them with the public is destabilizing and inappropriate. A bigger concern is if he was bragging about them privately to his friends last night \u2014 friends who could make millions on the information.\u201dMr. Furman said during his tenure, he briefed the president in person in the early evening if Mr. Obama was in Washington, and usually gave him the numbers over a secure phone line if the president was traveling. Mr. Obama also received a paper summary of the next day\u2019s major economic releases around 7 p.m.Mr. Furman said he and other officials took the security of the numbers seriously. When he started at the White House, Mr. Furman said, he signed a memorandum of understanding with the Labor Department agreeing only to share the numbers with the handful of people authorized to see them. He said he did not believe the information was formally classified, but the staff treated it that way, discussing it via a secure line.Letting the numbers leak, Mr. Furman said, risked undermining public confidence in the integrity of economic data.Jim Tankersley reported from Washington and Matt Phillips from New York.

{"Headline": "One Firm Is Way Ahead of Wall Street on Bitcoin", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 While a number of large financial institutions have discussed trading Bitcoin, one firm has already begun doing it. Very quietly.The financial firm, Susquehanna International Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., just outside Philadelphia, is one of the largest players in trading traditional investments like stocks, options and exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s. Over the last two years, the privately owned company has also built up a trading desk of around a dozen people that buys and sells millions of dollars\u2019 worth of Bitcoin and other virtual or cryptocurrencies in private deals.Now the firm is opening trading to a small group of its 500 clients, with plans to expand.The move is the latest sign that the virtual currency markets, which were once relegated to the fringes of the financial world, are being embraced by big, mainstream investors.But Susquehanna, which has around 1,800 employees around the world, has a lot more money backing its trading desk \u2014 and a lot more ability to interact with clients \u2014 than the hedge funds and trading firms that have also been early participants in the virtual currency markets.The arrival of big financial institutions has raised concerns among some Bitcoin aficionados, who worry that it will harden Bitcoin\u2019s status as a speculative trading asset like gold and diminish hopes that it can be used in day-to-day transactions.The original Bitcoin software determined that only 21 million Bitcoin would ever be created. That cap isn\u2019t expected to be hit until 2140, and the limited number of tokens currently in circulation has made the online currency appealing as a commodity.\u201cWe believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever,\u201d he said.The firm decided to step up its operation, and go out to clients, after seeing the success of Bitcoin futures contracts, which were introduced by exchanges in Chicago late last year and have been growing volume in recent months.Susquehanna will trade futures, which are contracts tied to the future price of Bitcoin. It will also allow customers to buy and sell actual Bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Bitcoin Cash.To make these available to customers, Susquehanna recently amended the broker dealer license that it has on file with regulators. That change will allow the company to trade cryptocurrencies that are labeled by regulators as securities. Regulators in the United States have recently indicated that many newly created virtual currencies \u2014 though not Bitcoin \u2014 should likely be categorized as securities and traded only by regulated entities.Mr. Smith said he had not seen clear evidence of manipulation, but cryptocurrency markets are still very immature compared with the other markets where Susquehanna trades, especially given the lack of regulations for many of the largest exchanges holding cryptocurrencies.He said the single biggest problem for sophisticated investors was the security risk in holding virtual currencies. In other markets, Susquehanna doesn\u2019t have actual custody of stocks or bonds.Bitcoin was built so that users can hold and transfer their tokens with a password or private key that no one else knows. If the private key is compromised, a hacker can take the coins, and the owner has no way to get them back. That has led to big losses at several Bitcoin exchanges.Susquehanna built its own systems for storing the cryptocurrencies it is holding for more than a day. To deter hackers, the private keys are kept in devices in an off-site facility that is not connected to the rest of the company\u2019s computer systems.\u201cThere were no financial services firms out there two years ago that were storing and moving large amounts of cryptocurrencies, so there is no road map,\u201d he said.Then there is the matter of trying to figure out on a daily basis what a single Bitcoin or Ether token should be worth.There is still little agreement on what factors traders should take account of when deciding on a value for cryptocurrencies, given that many of the expected uses for digital tokens are still hypothetical. While Mr. Smith\u2019s teams look at the technical and security specifications of the coins, it is much harder to answer the most important question: Will they be used as something other than a digital commodity?\u201cThe value is: What do you think the best-case scenario of these different digital assets is in the future \u2014 and handicapping what is the percentage chance that they will get there,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when the cap on the 21 million Bitcoin to be created is expected to be reached. It is 2140, not 2040.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Yield Curve? \u2018A Powerful Signal of Recessions\u2019 Has Wall Street\u2019s Attention", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou can try to play down a trade war with China. You can brush off the impact of rising oil prices on corporate earnings.But if you\u2019re in the business of making economic predictions, it has become very difficult to disregard an important signal from the bond market.The so-called yield curve is perilously close to predicting a recession \u2014 something it has done before with surprising accuracy \u2014 and it\u2019s become a big topic on Wall Street.Terms like \u201cyield curve\u201d can be mind-numbing if you\u2019re not a bond trader, but the mechanics, practical impact and psychology of it are fairly straightforward. Here\u2019s what the fuss is all about.The yield curve is basically the difference between interest rates on short-term United States government bonds, say, two-year Treasury notes, and long-term government bonds, like 10-year Treasury notes.Typically, when an economy seems in good health, the rate on the longer-term bonds will be higher than short-term ones. The extra interest is to compensate, in part, for the risk that strong economic growth could set off a broad rise in prices, known as inflation. Lately, though, long-term bond yields have been stubbornly slow to rise \u2014 which suggests traders are concerned about long-term growth \u2014 even as the economy shows plenty of vitality.At the same time, the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term rates, so the yield curve has been \u201cflattening.\u201d In other words, the gap between short-term interest rates and long-term rates is shrinking.The gap between two-year and 10-year United States Treasury notes is roughly 0.34 percentage points. It was last at these levels in 2007 when the United States economy was heading into what was arguably the worst recession in almost 80 years.As scary as references to the financial crisis sound, flattening alone does not mean that the United States is doomed to slip into another recession. But if it keeps moving in this direction, eventually long-term interest rates will fall below short-term rates.When that happens, the yield curve has \u201cinverted.\u201d An inversion is seen as \u201ca powerful signal of recessions,\u201d as the president of the New York Fed, John Williams, said this year, and that\u2019s what everyone is watching for.Even if it hasn\u2019t happened yet, the move in that direction has Wall Street\u2019s attention.\u201cFor economists, of course it\u2019s always been traditionally a very good signal of directionality of the economy,\u201d said Sonja Gibbs, senior director of capital markets at the Institute of International Finance. \u201cThat\u2019s why everyone is bemoaning the flattening of the yield curve.\u201dSure, it seems like a strange time to be worried about recession. Unemployment is at an 18-year low, corporate investment is picking up steam, and consumer spending shows signs of rebounding.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see what\u2019s going to goose the economy further from these levels,\u201d Ms. Gibbs said.And the financial markets can sometimes sniff out problems with the economy before they show up in the official economic snapshots published on G.D.P. and unemployment. Another notable yield curve inversion occurred in February 2000, just before the stock market\u2019s dot-com bubble burst.In that sense, the government bond market isn\u2019t alone. Stocks have been in a sideways struggle since the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index last peaked on Jan. 26. Returns on corporate bonds are negative, as are some key commodities tied to industrial activity.An important caveat to the predictive power of the yield curve is that it can\u2019t predict precisely when a recession will begin. In the past the recession has come in as little as six months, or as long as two years, after the inversion, the San Francisco Fed\u2019s researchers note.In other words, there\u2019s a reason to look at the yield curve skeptically, despite its prowess at predicting recessions.As in all market moves, perceptions of its significance mean the yield curve can sometimes become a feedback loop.If enough investors begin to grow concerned about a recession, they will most likely put more and more money into the safety of long-term government bonds. That buying binge would likely help flatten, or invert, the yield curve.Then people will write articles about the curve\u2019s sending a stronger signal on recession. And that could, in turn, drive even more people to buy into long-term bonds. Rinse. Repeat.But it\u2019s not just psychology. The yield curve helps determine some of the decisions that are the most crucial to the health of the American economy.Specifically, the flattening yield curve makes banking, which is basically the business of borrowing money at short-term rates and lending it at long-term rates, less profitable. And if the yield curve inverts, it means lending money becomes a losing proposition.Either way, the flow of lending is likely to be curtailed. And in the United States, where borrowed money is the lifeblood of economic activity, that can slam the brakes on economic growth.There is an argument to be made against reading too much into the yield curve\u2019s moves \u2014 and it hangs on the idea that, rather than the free market, central banks have had a big influence on both the long-term and short-term rates.Since the last recession, central banks bought trillions of dollars of government bonds as they tried to push long-term interest rates lower in order to lend a helping hand to the economy.Even though they\u2019re reversing course now, central banks still own massive amounts of those bonds, and that may be keeping long-term interest rates lower than they would otherwise be.Also, the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates since December 2015 and has indicated it will keep doing so this year.So if long-term rates were pushed lower by central bank bond buying, and now short-term rates are being pushed higher as the Fed tightens its monetary policy, the yield curve has nowhere to go but flatter.\u201cIn the current environment, I think it\u2019s a less reliable indicator than it has been in the past,\u201d said Matthew Luzzetti, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War Spooks Markets as White House Waits for China to Blink", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration remained unmoved by those concerns, with a top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, insisting that China has more to lose from a trade fight than the United States. He also declared that Mr. Trump would not allow Beijing to simply buy its way out of an economic dispute by promising to import more American goods.\u201cPresident Trump has given China every chance to change its aggressive behavior,\u201d Mr. Navarro said in a call with reporters on Tuesday. \u201cChina does have much more to lose than we do.\u201dIn threatening tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods, the administration is betting that Beijing will blink first. It\u2019s a risky gamble by a White House that appears ready to forgo diplomatic negotiations in favor of punishing tariffs that could pinch consumers and companies on both sides of the Pacific.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he was ready for a fight, saying China would no longer take advantage of the United States.\u201cChina has been taking out $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuilding China,\u201d the president said during a speech in Washington before the National Federation of Independent Business. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken so much. It\u2019s time folks, it\u2019s time. So we\u2019re going to get smart, and we\u2019re going to do it right.\u201dMarkets sank on Tuesday in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement late Monday that his administration was preparing to impose even more tariffs than he originally threatened if China continued with its plan to retaliate against the United States.The benchmark Dow Jones index, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite all fell on Tuesday, following stock markets in Frankfurt, London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo and mainland China. Investors moved money into assets that are considered safe havens, like 10-year United States Treasury bonds and the Japanese yen.Shares of Boeing and Caterpillar, which are among America\u2019s leading exporters to China, fell sharply on Tuesday, along with soybean futures. China is the world\u2019s largest importer of soybeans, a key livestock feed, and Beijing has targeted American soybeans for retaliation with its own tariffs.Soybean prices dropped more than 7 percent at times during the morning before stabilizing in afternoon trading. Prices are at their lowest level in more than two years, creating a politically delicate issue for Mr. Trump, who has strong support from rural voters in farm states but whose trade policies have angered farmers and lawmakers who represent them.Senator Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement, \u201cThese aggressive trade actions will continue to have damaging consequences, including an impact on our commodity prices and farm futures, and increasing anxiety among the agricultural and business communities in Iowa.\u201d\u201cI think that the other side may have underestimated the strong resolve of President Donald J. Trump,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cIf they thought that they could buy us off cheap with a few extra products and allow them to continue to steal our intellectual property and crown jewels, that was a miscalculation. We hope going forward there are no more miscalculations.\u201dMr. Navarro said a trade clash would hurt China much more than the United States, given that the value of China\u2019s exports to the United States was nearly four times the value of what the United States exports to China.For weeks, the United States and China had appeared close to a deal that would have forestalled tariffs. Top advisers like Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, had advocated a deal that could avoid the devastating effects of a trade war, and spent hours in negotiations with Chinese officials.But after the Chinese refused to commit to a target for reducing their trade surplus with the United States or limit industrial subsidies, Mr. Trump rejected those proposals. And his resolve only hardened after lawmakers, including Democrats, criticized him as being weak on China when he agreed to help ease penalties on ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company accused of violating American sanctions.The president\u2019s approach has irritated some of Mr. Trump\u2019s own advisers, including Mr. Mnuchin, who has been frustrated by the process of the China talks, according to an official familiar with his thinking. Mr. Mnuchin has tried to explain in recent meetings how China is likely to respond to America\u2019s threats and the impact that retaliation could have on financial markets and the economy.He has also been trying to persuade Mr. Trump not to proceed with harsh restrictions on Chinese investment that would limit China\u2019s ability to do business in the United States. The Treasury Department is expected to release a proposal this month. Mr. Mnuchin, who is leading the effort, has been trying to convince Mr. Trump that the restrictions are unnecessary, given pending legislation that would expand national security reviews performed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.In late May, Mr. Mnuchin helped orchestrate a meeting between the president, top White House advisers and Republican lawmakers, where the Treasury secretary asked lawmakers to help make the case that legislation would be a more targeted way to police Chinese investment, three people with knowledge of the meeting said. But Mr. Navarro and Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who were also in the meeting, objected to that approach. The president ultimately overruled Mr. Mnuchin, saying that he supported the congressional legislation but that it alone wasn\u2019t enough.The decision to proceed with tariffs is a victory for hard-liners in the administration, like Mr. Navarro and Mr. Lighthizer. They had argued that the United States should not back down from trying to force China to make more fundamental changes to its economy, even if such measures would cause short-term pain for American businesses and consumers.On Tuesday, Mr. Navarro minimized the divisions between administration officials, saying the United States\u2019 negotiating process had not wavered and was \u201clinear.\u201d He said the idea of dropping the trade case in exchange for purchases \u2014 something the Chinese had offered the Americans in negotiations \u2014 had always been a \u201cnonstarter.\u201dIn his remarks Tuesday morning, Mr. Navarro took aim at China\u2019s internal plan to develop cutting-edge industries like robotics, new-energy vehicles, advanced rail and shipping, and aerospace. He said the country could not be allowed to dominate technologies that would be an important source of jobs and growth for the United States in decades to come.China has engaged in unfair practices, including cybertheft and \u201cinformation harvesting,\u201d to obtain technological secrets from the United States that would allow China to pull ahead in these industries, Mr. Navarro said.\u201cIt is important to note here that the actions President Trump has taken are purely defensive in nature,\u201d he said.There is broad agreement that China has engaged in unfair trade practices that have hurt American companies. But Mr. Trump\u2019s resort to tariffs as his primary negotiating tool has prompted swift condemnation from retail, technology and manufacturing companies, who said the approach could hurt American consumers and companies more than the White House realized.Jose Castaneda, spokesman for the Information Technology Industry Council, called the escalation of trade tensions with China \u201cirresponsible and counterproductive.\u201d\u201cWe appreciate President Trump\u2019s efforts to protect the United States\u2019 \u2018crown jewels,\u2019 but tariffs are simply the wrong way to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe White House needs to work with our allies to create lasting change with China. Too many jobs and livelihoods are at stake to get this wrong.\u201dMatt Priest, the president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said it was difficult to see how tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods wouldn\u2019t \u201cnegatively impact all Americans of every walk of life.\u201d\u201cThe president claimed that trade wars are easy to win, but what our industry has always known is coming true: Trade wars are costly, unnecessary and do harm to the American economy,\u201d he said.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington, Prashant S.

Alibaba and Facebook have done the same in recent days. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has returned to record territory, up 8 percent since the end of April. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26.The rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain. Fears of a trade war have made investors anxious; emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies have all sold off; and economic data in some regions has softened in recent weeks.\u201cIn an uncertain world with significant downside economic tail risks, technology has been seen to be, correctly, relatively stable,\u201d Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson, strategists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.Such economic uneasiness in the years since the financial crisis had caused investors to pour money into the sector. The likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have come to be viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver growth in most economic conditions. With interest rates at historic lows and economic growth lackluster, investors have found that appealing.In March, some of the best-performing tech stocks began to struggle. Facebook\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech companies and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms.The pullback was a rare dip for a sector that had risen consistently for the past several years. Since stock markets in the United States bottomed out in March 2009, shares of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet have all gained more than 500 percent; Netflix is up 6,500 percent. The S.&P. 500 has risen about 300 percent over that period.How long can the biggest tech stocks dominate the market? For a while, Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson said. They pointed out that earnings and sales growth, not a speculative increase in valuations, have driven the post-financial crisis run-up.\u201cUnlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson wrote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stock Investors Shrug Off an Intensifying Trade War", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe world\u2019s two largest economies appear to be escalating their trade war. In the United States, at least, investors do not seem to be terribly worried.An intensifying trade war \u2014 with the potential for pockets of painful economic fallout \u2014 is the kind of event that could spook investors. That has not happened.Stocks are off slightly, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index slipping 0.1 percent on Friday. Yields on bonds declined, a sign that investors were seeking a bit more safety. Commodities, the raw materials that fuel the global economy, dipped too. The price of American crude oil sank more than 2 percent on Friday.The decline in oil prices affected shares of energy giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Companies like Caterpillar, Boeing and Deere, which could be hit by Chinese tariffs, weighed on indexes.But the overall market drop has been mild compared with the steep slides \u2014 some of more than 2 percent in a day \u2014 that rattled global stock markets earlier this year, when investors were fretting about the possibility of rising interest rates. And there are some clear reasons that markets are reacting in a relatively blas\u00e9 fashion right now.\u201cThe simplest answer is that by our calculations the fiscal stimulus is about 10 times greater than the potential drag from trade,\u201d said Jason Trennert, chairman of the Wall Street research firm Strategas Research Partners.The stimulus he refers to is actually twofold: federal tax cuts and increased government spending. The twin propellers are pushing huge sums of money into the United States economy, which already appears to be in extremely good shape.In May, unemployment fell to 3.8 percent, a new 18-year low. After a lull earlier this year, consumer spending appears to be picking up again, a powerful boost given that consumption accounts for roughly 70 percent of the United States economy. By comparison, trade, the value of imports and exports, accounts for a little more than 25 percent.The increase in consumer spending is good news for companies, whose profits are already swelling because of the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts. Analysts expect that earnings for companies in the S. & P. 500 will be up more than 24 percent over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data.For now, in the stock market at least, investors are taking their cues from solid economic data rather than theoretical risks.And while the S. & P. 500 has not hit a new high since late January, it does seem to be gaining traction. The benchmark index is up more than 5 percent since the end of March.An earlier version of this article misstated how much the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has increased since the end of March. It has increased more than 5 percent, not more than 7 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade Threats Hit China\u2019s Stock Market and Currency", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Months of struggling with economic problems at home and bickering with President Trump over trade are starting to take their toll on China\u2019s financial health.China\u2019s stock market has now fallen close to levels not seen since a crash shocked global investors three years ago. An elite Chinese think tank affiliated with the government warned this week that the chances of a financial panic had risen significantly, shaking markets even more.Chinese officials are trying to help factories deal with American tariffs by weakening the value of the country\u2019s currency. That makes Chinese goods more competitive abroad, but it also gives investors inside and outside China a reason to take their money out of the country. And it offers Mr. Trump an opportunity to criticize Beijing \u2014 in the past, he has railed against the country for weakening its currency.The chances of a financial collapse that could shake the world are slim. The Chinese government has vast sums of money it can tap in the event of a crisis. And there are steep financial barriers to keep money from fleeing the country. While investors have ways around the barriers, they limit the possibility that such a flight could bring one of the world\u2019s most important growth engines to a halt.China\u2019s stock markets reflect the uncertainty. The Chinese stock market as of this week is down more than 20 percent from its January peak, making it a bear market. The country\u2019s main stock index lost nearly 1 percent on Thursday.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what Trump is going to do next,\u201d said Hong Hao, the chief market strategist in the international unit of the Bank of Communications, one of China\u2019s biggest banks. \u201cNormally at this level, there should be a technical rebound.\u201dChina\u2019s moves with its currency reflect its difficult balancing act. The Chinese central bank has guided the currency steadily lower against the dollar, particularly in the past two weeks, as the likelihood of further American tariffs on Chinese goods has increased. The currency is down more than 5 percent from its peak in February.The value of the renminbi has fallen somewhat faster lately in the less-regulated Hong Kong market than in Shanghai trading. A widening gap between the two markets has long been a sign that investors are worried about the currency.China faces still more obstacles. The United States Federal Reserve has begun raising short-term interest rates. That increases the cost of borrowing money for Americans and, given the vast influence of the American economy, for the rest of the world. Such rate increases have caused unpleasant economic surprises worldwide in the past, which could hurt China if growth slows in the markets where it sells its goods.As if investors did not already have enough to worry about in China, a deeply pessimistic internal government analysis has widely circulated on social media this week. The analysis was written by Li Yang, the chairman of the National Institution of Finance and Development, a Beijing-based research group, and by three other economists.A person who picked up the phone at the think tank said that the document was genuine and that its release had not been intended.The document said that with \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes and the long-term and highly uncertain trade conflicts between China and the United States, we believe that in China there is currently a high probability of financial panic.\u201dOther economists cautioned that the analysis should not necessarily be treated as representing a consensus view within the Chinese government.Mr. Li has a reputation as being more bearish during financial crises than other Chinese government economists. He has also used periods of financial stress in China to oppose economic reformers who seek the opening up of the country\u2019s financial system to greater competition and more international flows of money, Mr. Hong said.The document leaked this week said that the way to prevent a financial panic was to create a separate stabilization fund to prop up the currency, rather than selling dollars and shrinking the money supply. Such a move could help insulate China\u2019s economy, because reducing the money supply makes it harder for families and businesses to borrow for purchases and investments, from buying an apartment to building a factory.By contrast, many economic reformers say that China would benefit from more openness. The closed Chinese financial system tends to steer money to state-owned enterprises instead of smaller and more entrepreneurial private sector businesses.Predictions by the report\u2019s authors aren\u2019t gospel, said Qian Qimin, the director of wealth management research at Shenwan Securities, a Shanghai brokerage.\u201cThey consider problems from a theoretical perspective and they look forward and alert government to the worst consequences, which is understandable,\u201d he said.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Conservative Kentucky, Power of Female Candidates Is Tested in Key House Race", "Date": "2018-06-16", "News": "For Amy McGrath to win the race against Representative Andy Barr, she will have to win the votes of rural residents who feel alienated from the national Democratic Party.Supported byVERSAILLES, Ky. \u2014 Ben Chandler knows how it feels to win and lose Kentucky\u2019s Sixth Congressional District.The area rambles from the Bluegrass region to the Appalachian Mountains to the east. Overwhelmingly white and culturally conservative, it is an uneasy mix of working-class struggles and old-money prosperity \u2014 bourbon distilleries and luxuriant horse farms, one very large auto plant and the University of Kentucky. President Trump and the Second Amendment are popular here, but not in that order. Reverence for veterans runs deep.\u201cI didn\u2019t have the luxury of voting the way I felt or taking the positions I wanted to take or even the best positions,\u201d he said in an interview on the farm that has been in his family since 1784. \u201cI had to balance that with what the people I represented wanted.\u201dBy 2012, after four terms in office, Mr. Chandler found that formula no longer worked. In an increasingly polarized country, there was no longer a middle of the road in the Sixth District. A Republican, Andy Barr, defeated him and has won re-election two times since.Now, Ms. McGrath\u2019s race against Mr. Barr will test the limits of any Democratic wave in the midterm elections and of the power of female candidates in a year with a record number of women running for Congress. If Ms. McGrath and others like her can win, Democrats would almost certainly retake control of the House.She will have to run up large margins in the few heavily populated areas that lean Democratic, such as Lexington and Frankfort. More challenging, she will have to win the votes of rural residents who feel alienated from the national Democratic Party, stepping squarely into the culture wars over guns, same-sex rights and access to health care.A Democrat\u2019s path to victory starts in Lexington, a city of more than 300,000 in a county with the state\u2019s highest percentage of college graduates that often provides about 40 percent of the overall vote. Lexington is ringed by suburbs where Democrats are hoping Ms. McGrath can pick off the votes of suburban women and men who will be drawn to her military service.In the other 18 counties outside Fayette, Mr. Trump won with an average of 63 percent of the vote. Mr. Barr, who has deep reserves of trust and affection in rural precincts, won his race that year by 22 percentage points.But Ms. McGrath may have the kind of profile that can bring around some conservatives, win over moderates and appeal to liberals.\u201cThe word most people would apply to her is tough,\u201d said Al Cross, the director at the University of Kentucky\u2019s Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues. \u201cShe has a pretty well-defined identity.\u201dIn her primary victory over Mr. Gray, Ms. McGrath won handily in all of the rural counties, including Anderson, where tobacco farms have either gone to seed or given way to subdivisions as it has evolved into a bedroom community for Frankfort or Lexington. Mr. Trump won nearly 75 percent of the vote here.But Ms. McGrath decided early that she would compete for votes in the county. In November, she came to sit for an interview in the office of Ben Carlson, the editor and publisher of the weekly Anderson News, the principal source of local news, with a subscription price of $30 a year and a market penetration of 32 percent. \u201cCongressional candidates don\u2019t flock into The Anderson News asking us to interview them,\u201d Mr. Carlson said.He delivered a 3,500-word, front-page article, covering a number of issues, including ones that could cause Ms. McGrath trouble in the race against Mr. Barr. \u201cWhat really surprised me was how honest and open she was about things she knew dang well weren\u2019t going to be popular here,\u201d he said.Mr. Carlson attends dozens of community meetings a month and prides himself on being able to gauge sentiment. \u201cShe was accessible,\u201d he said of Ms. McGrath\u2019s campaign appearances. \u201cPeople love the Marine Corps thing.\u201dThey do not like her position on guns, he said, because Ms. McGrath calls for background checks and banning bump stocks on weapons. \u201cThis is very, very, very pro-gun country,\u201d Mr. Carlson said. \u201cAn assault rifle ban will go over like a lead balloon. There are more AR-15s in this county than you can shake a stick at.\u201dIn another rural area, Donna Barnes, the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Montgomery County, agrees. The people here \u201c are passionate about the Second Amendment,\u201d she said. \u201cMs. McGrath has changed her stance on gun control and when she did that, she actually lost some of the interest of Montgomery County.\u201dMs. Barnes also said that voters needed to hear more about Ms. McGrath than her biography. \u201cBasically, all we are hearing is \u2018I am a veteran, vote for me.\u2019\u201dFor many others, though, Ms. McGrath\u2019s military service will be appealing and could help to inoculate her on a number of issues. To break through, she has opened a number of field offices in rural counties, including Clark, where her staff has a presence on the historic Main Street in Winchester.Ed Burtner, the mayor of Winchester and former Marine who served in Vietnam, is no fan of Mr. Trump because of the president\u2019s criticism of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, but he said the president\u2019s support runs deep here. \u201cI haven\u2019t found a single person that said they voted for Trump that has also not said they wouldn\u2019t do it again,\u201d Mr. Burtner said.\u201cWe\u2019ve got that conservative base and in some cases ultra conservative base,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she has to recognize that\u2019s here, and that\u2019s going to be in a lot of the communities where she is running.\u201dHenry Branham, a local judge and Democrat, said that people did not engage him on the subject of the president, but that hardly meant an embrace of his party. \u201cClark County is so far from Nancy Pelosi, it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d Mr. Branham said.Republicans tried to quickly define Ms. McGrath as too liberal for the district.\u201cPeople accepted gay marriage; they don\u2019t like it,\u201d Mr. Carlson said of people in Anderson County. \u201cTransgender in the military. A lot of the feedback was, I really like her, but boy, she is awfully liberal.\u201dBut her military r\u00e9sum\u00e9 provides a strong counterpoint. Lawrenceburg, the Anderson County seat, has a healing field with flags to honor every Kentuckian who has been killed in the war on terrorism. The American Legion is the largest civic group.\u201cHow do you caricature someone as a liberal who has bombed terrorists?\u201d Mr. Chandler said. \u201cThat\u2019s ludicrous. I hope they try it. Look at Barr in the face and say how many terrorists have you killed?\u201d\u201cYoung woman wanted to be a fighter pilot at an early age,\u201d he went on. \u201cWent against all of the societal norms,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cA mother of three dropping bombs on terrorists \u2014 you don\u2019t run across that profile every day.\u201dFollow Michael Tackett on Twitter @tackettdcAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E. Dropped From the Dow After More Than a Century", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd then there were none.General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain.The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company\u2019s new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company\u2019s financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.Over the last year, G.E.\u2019s shares have fallen 55 percent, compared with a 15 percent gain for the Dow. G.E., which closed Tuesday at $12.95, has the lowest share price of any of the index\u2019s 30 components.S. & P. Dow Jones Indices \u2014 which owns the Dow \u2014 suggested that the slide in G.E.\u2019s stock price contributed to the decision to remove the company from the index, where it had been a member continuously since 1907. The Dow is a price-weighted index, which means higher priced stocks have a greater influence on its direction.\u201cThe low price of G.E. shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point,\u201d said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S. & P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cWalgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s share price is higher, and it will contribute more meaningfully to the index.\u201dThe move also is freighted with economic symbolism. With the inclusion of Walgreens Boots, the index \u201cwill be more representative of the consumer and health care sectors of the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Blitzer said.The removal of G.E., which will formally occur June 26, reflects a shift in the economic composition of the United States, which long ago tilted away from heavy industry and toward services, such as technology, finance and health care.And it also amounted to a milestone for General Electric. It was the last remaining original member of the index, when the stock market measure was introduced in 1896.Back then, just a few years after the company was formed through a merger of Thomas Edison\u2019s electric companies with a rival, G.E. was the modern-day equivalent of a technology stock, and the Dow itself was geared heavily toward the growth industries of the day such as railroads. In the more than 120 years that followed, the company was often at the center of American capitalism. And as recently as the 1990s. G.E. was at times the most-valuable American company by market value.Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are the five most valuable companies in the United States today.After G.E.\u2019s departure from the index, the company with the longest presence in the Dow will be Exxon Mobil, whose corporate predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey, joined the Dow in 1928, according to S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Stress? It's Good to Be a Bank", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat a time to be a bank.That banks are in such a position highlights the remarkable change in fortunes for an industry that was on life support a decade ago.Banks have more than doubled their capital, their main financial defense against losses. Profits are surging on the back of the stronger economy, and bank stocks have risen more than the broader stock market since the election of Donald J. Trump. Wall Street\u2019s chief executives are enjoying hefty paydays. The Trump administration has started to relax post-crisis regulation, and banks are angling for more loosening. Lenders are embracing exciting new technologies that could revolutionize parts of their industry.\u201cYou guys thought I was kidding when a few years ago I said you can have a golden age of banking,\u201d Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said this month, taking stock of trends in the industry. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re going to have a golden age of banking. You have a golden age of banking.\u201dBut the resurgence of the industry is a refutation of those who predicted that the post-crisis regulations would hamstring banks and damp the economy. Banks are not only safer than they were before, they are back to earning strong profits.The largest financial institutions find out for certain next week if the Federal Reserve has signed off on their plans to distribute capital to shareholders. The results on Thursday suggest that most will get what they want. Analysts at Barclays forecast that the banks, on average, are in a position to distribute all of their profits to investors. Banks can do this because they have quite a bit more capital than regulators require.Critics of the industry say the banks should be lending that money out or retaining it to strengthen their balance sheets. But Mr. Dimon rejected such assertions in an interview.\u201cIf you look at the growth of capital over all, it\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d he said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair as a blanket statement to say paying out is bad. Many banks have a huge amount of capital they can\u2019t deploy right away.\u201dAfter the crisis, policymakers believed that making the banks stronger would bolster their lending. In many ways, this outcome has occurred. Since the end of 2010, banks have added $2.5 trillion of loans, a 37 percent increase, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Over the same period, their profits have soared. In the first quarter, the industry as a whole reported its highest profits in recent decades, according to data compiled by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.The six largest American banks \u2014 JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2014 have done particularly well. They made $141 billion in pretax profits in 2017, nearly double the $75 billion they made in 2010. The tax cuts enacted last year have provided a particularly large lift to the bottom lines of banks. A strengthening economy and higher interest rates are expected to further increase earnings this year.Those behind the post-crisis regulatory overhaul say the robust economy shows that more or less the right amount of regulation was imposed. Barney Frank, the former congressman who helped sponsor the Dodd-Frank Act, said, \u201cI have been struck ever since Trump came into office by his bragging that we have the best economy that ever existed anywhere and his insistence that regulation was damaging the financial sector.\u201dThe stress tests suggest that the banks can withstand punishing losses. They assume, for instance, that Bank of America can suffer $50 billion of losses on its loans and still have ample capital.But good times in banking can lead to complacency among regulators and bankers. So while banks are definitely stronger, some prominent skeptics would prefer that more be done to make sure taxpayers are never called on again to bail out the banks.\u201cThe question is not: How do banks perform when the economy is strong?\u201d Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in an interview. \u201cThe question is: How do banks perform if there is a major economic downturn? And our analysis at the Minneapolis Fed says that the banks are still too big to fail.\u201dMr. Kashkari, who was a Treasury official during the crisis and oversaw the government\u2019s bailout of the banking industry, said he believed that a crucial part of regulators\u2019 post-crisis plans for winding down failing banks \u2014 turning a bank\u2019s debt into equity \u2014 would not work in a real crisis. To stop a collapse of the system, he said, taxpayer bailouts would almost certainly be required. Instead, regulators should have banks substantially increase their equity, Mr. Kashkari said.Banks would no doubt oppose such a move, saying it would make certain businesses unprofitable. But he said, \u201cIf the banks\u2019 business model requires taxpayer support, then they don\u2019t have a business model that works.\u201dInvestors hope deregulation will reduce the costs of complying with rules, give banks more freedom to pursue profitable business and allow them to pay out even more capital. Such hopes have helped drive bank stocks, measured by the KBW Bank Index, up 44 percent since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, compared with 29 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Bankers assert that they do not want a wholesale dismantling of the post-crisis rules. Instead, they say, they want to refine rules to make lending less costly and cumbersome. Mortgage lending, for instance, is one area that could benefit from looser rules, some banking experts contend.\u201cPeople say the banks are doing well, so we don\u2019t need to change,\u201d said Phillip L. Swagel, a professor of international economic policy at the University of Maryland and a Treasury official during the administration of George W. Bush. \u201cBut, no, if we can do it better, then let\u2019s make it better.\u201dBut critics of the banks say the banks could be doing more under the current rules to expand whom they lend to, especially when they have so much spare capital. Michael Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending, said deregulation could lead to less lending. He asserted that possible changes to the Community Reinvestment Act could reduce the presence of banks in certain less well-off areas.\u201cIs it too much for banks to provide basic banking services in their footprint?\u201d Mr. Calhoun asked.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "If Fund Managers Back Bitcoin", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few years ago, I asked a friend at a major Wall Street trading desk if her colleagues ever talked about cryptocurrencies. She responded that one person would occasionally bring up Bitcoin, then the room would clear out.This was during Wall Street\u2019s \u201cBitcoin is stupid\u201d period, which fell between the initial, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it\u201d era and the more recent \u201cit\u2019s a bubble\u201d phase. Since the advent of the first cryptocurrency nine years ago, professional money managers have almost universally dismissed it as a potential investment. Although many have come around on the power of the underlying technology, cryptocurrencies have often been ignored or ridiculed.Last year, as the price gains of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether were generating daily headlines, some fund managers went on the attack, calling the sector a pyramid scheme. Although they probably really felt that way, they might have also been a little jealous. Wall Street money managers are not used to standing on the sidelines while amateurs get rich off something the pros don\u2019t really understand, or worst yet, own.For the crypto faithful on the other hand, it\u2019s always been a question of when, not if, the rest of the world catches on. Their faith (despite the volatility) has put them on the right side of a powerful investment thesis, one best phrased as a question:What happens when institutional money managers, who collectively control most of the world\u2019s investment capital, enter a new asset class for the first time?When the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments.The answer lies in basic math. Institutions control so much money that they own half a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of Apple alone, and that\u2019s just one stock within a single asset class. If all the hedge funds and family offices out there decided to commit a fraction of that capital to a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies, they may double the size of the sector.I\u2019ve been making that argument to friends who work in institutional finance for years, but they\u2019ve always brushed me off, and for good reason. Contrary to what an outsider might think, people who manage other people\u2019s money don\u2019t base their decisions on how to maximize returns. Their first consideration is whether they could justify their actions should something go wrong.This is a smart way for individual managers to make investment decisions, even if the combined effect is a lot of groupthink and the familiar cycle of booms and busts. Traders who lost money in mortgages in 2007 still have a job today because most of their colleagues also blew up in that trade.That attitude is one reason no career-minded professional has wanted to be the first to dip toes into crypto. Or the second, or the 12th. Not if they wanted to have a long career. But with each passing month, as more people talk about Bitcoin and more conferences are held where more products aimed at institutions are introduced, the barrier to entry gets a little lower.Every chain reaction starts small and needs the help of at least one catalyst. The adoption of the crypto-asset class by institutional investors has recently enjoyed several, the biggest of which is the introduction of infrastructure that solves the crypto-custodian problem.Since blockchain technology gives cryptocurrencies certain physical properties, storage is a significant issue. An institution that invests in stocks doesn\u2019t have to worry about a hacker infiltrating their servers to steal shares, but in crypto, that kind of thing happens all the time. Several solutions to this problem have been introduced by reputable crypto companies in recent months, including hardware products that help institutions secure their own cryptocurrencies and a storage service where a third party does it for them.Then there are the recently introduced Bitcoin futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. These products allow institutions to gain exposure to crypto markets while bypassing the storage issue altogether. As an added bonus, their creation signaled a much-needed nod of approval from financial regulators, as did Goldman Sachs\u2019 decision to help clients trade them.None of this means that the world\u2019s pension funds and endowments are about to dive in. But for the bullish thesis to work, they don\u2019t have to. Just the fact that they will start to consider the option is a major change. Throw in a sputtering stock market and a stalled bull market in bonds, and the argument becomes even more compelling.On Wall Street, the only sin worse than being the first in a bad trade is being the last in a good one, or what crypto enthusiasts colloquially call FOMO \u2014 or fear of missing out. That fear drives a lot of investment booms, and nobody knows that better than the biggest stewards of institutional money: hedge funds.Twenty years ago, most people had never even heard of \u201calternative assets.\u201d Then the dot-com bubble burst, leading the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates, and it was no longer possible for pension funds and endowments to hit their annual return targets with only stocks and bonds. Within a few years, everyone was talking about the importance of allocating some capital to so-called absolute-return strategies, and the hedge fund boom was born.We are still years away from when institutional investors will fully embrace crypto as an asset class, but 2018 is shaping up to be the year of the tipping point.Omid Malekan is the author of \u201cThe Story of the Blockchain, a Beginner\u2019s Guide to the Technology Nobody Understands.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Time Split to the Nanosecond Is Precisely What Wall Street Wants", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Computer scientists at Stanford University and Google have created technology that can track time down to 100 billionths of a second. It could be just what Wall Street is looking for.For an exchange like Nasdaq, such refinement is essential to accurately order the millions of stock trades that are placed on their computer systems every second.Ultimately, this is about money. With stock trading now dominated by computers that make buying and selling decisions and execute them with blazing speed, keeping that order also means protecting profits. So-called high frequency trading firms place trades in a fraction of a second, sometimes in a bet that they can move faster than bigger competitors.The pressure to manage these high-speed trades grows when the stock market becomes more volatile, as it has been in recent months, in part to prevent the fastest traders from taking unfair advantage of slower firms. High frequency traders typically account for more than half of daily stock trading volume in the United States, according to data from the Tabb Group.\u201cThe financial industry has easily become the most obsessed with time,\u201d said Balaji Prabhakar, a Stanford University electrical engineer who is one of the designers of the new synchronization system.Because the orders are placed from locations around the world, they frequently arrive at the exchange\u2019s computers out of sequence. The new system allows each computer to time stamp an order when it takes place.As a result, the trades can be sorted and executed in correct sequence. In a networked marketplace, this precision is necessary not only to prevent illicit trading on advance information known as \u201cfront-running,\u201d but also to ensure the fair placement of orders.The importance of technical advances in measuring time was underscored by European regulations that went into effect in January and that require financial institutions to synchronize time-stamped trades with microsecond accuracy.\u201cThere are tickets needed, housing, people will need transportation,\u201d he said. \u201cThink of an electronic market almost like a massive flea market hosted by Nasdaq software.\u201dTo go from trading equities to managing all sorts of financial transactions will require more than an order of magnitude speedup in the company\u2019s networks of computers. It will be possible only if all of the exchange\u2019s computers agree on time with nanosecond accuracy.A generation ago, computing usually took place in a single mainframe or personal computer. Now it is routinely spread across thousands of independent processors in machines that can be separated by a few feet or entire continents.Chip designers have long struggled to maintain the precise timing needed to order mathematical operations inside individual computing chips. And synchronizing these vast ensembles of them has become the limiting factor in the speed and processing power of what Google describes as \u201cplanetary-scale\u201d computers.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind-boggling,\u201d said Peter Hochschild, a Google software engineer who specializes in the challenges associated with spreading software and data across networked computers. \u201cInside a processor, an enormous amount of stuff happens in a billionth of a second.\u201dA billionth of a second is roughly the time it takes light to travel one foot. It has long been viewed as a crucial measure in computing. In the 1960s, the computing pioneer Grace Murray Hopper would hand out 11.8-inch lengths of wire to illustrate how designing smaller electronic parts would create faster computers.Distance has become even more significant as software has begun to escape the boundaries of individual computers and make its way into the cloud \u2014 the web of giant computer data centers that have come to blanket the planet.Because software and data are no longer in the same place, correctly calculating the order of the events that may be separated by feet or miles has become the dominant factor in the speed with which data can be processed.\u201cSo much of our expectation about computing being correct depends essentially on knowing this order,\u201d said Krishna Palem, a theoretical computer scientist at Rice University.In the world of cloud computing, entire databases are scattered among different computers and data centers.Huygens, named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens, who invented the pendulum clock in 1656, uses so-called machine-learning techniques to synchronize a network of computers to within 100 billionths of a second. In contrast, the N.T.P. standard can synchronize computers no more accurately than a millisecond, or one thousandth of a second.To ensure that buyers and sellers are treated fairly, Nasdaq has for decades looked for ways to ensure that trades are processed in the order they are placed.While building a network for Nasdaq in the 1990s, Brian Reid, a computer scientist at Digital Equipment Corporation, experimented by coiling large rolls of cables of different lengths in a Massachusetts warehouse in order to insert tiny delays in the time it took data to travel in a network to make sure that messages were delivered fairly. He then employed timing information from satellites to synchronize clocks at different locations.Google would later use this method to synchronize computers based on GPS data and atomic clocks to make sure that their database system could correctly order transactions. But since the system requires super-accurate clocks and satellite receivers, it is more costly than the software-based Huygens approach.Mr. Reid built his original system in an era when the Securities and Exchange Commission required that all stock sales be entered by humans.\u201cFive millisecond accuracy in clock synchronization pleased everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took much longer than five milliseconds to press the \u2018Enter\u2019 key on the big green terminals that people used.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They search through Baidu, get their social media fix on WeChat, hail rides on Didi, curate news through sites like Toutiao. And while they know Beijing is watching, they accept this surveillance as normal.The Chinese government has carved out an alternative internet universe with its own brands, rules and culture, in which privacy doesn\u2019t exist. But its real ambition is to break out of this parallel universe and dominate not just the internet but the technology industry worldwide. To contain Beijing, the United States and its allies are fighting back with a campaign of technoprotectionism, opening a perilous new front in the global trade battles.President Trump is the unlikely leader of the fight against Chinese tech dominance. Widely seen as a champion of rust belt industries, he recently slapped heavy tariffs on all the leading aluminum and steel exporters, drawing fierce protests not only from China but also from American allies like Germany and Canada. But steel is a side show compared with the emerging tech battle with China.Technology will decide which country emerges as the world\u2019s dominant economic power in the long run. While about 20 percent of per-capita gross domestic product growth is driven by labor and capital, the remaining 80 percent is determined by how rapidly an economy is developing and applying new technology to increase production. China\u2019s ambition to catch up to Western living standards thus depends largely on how rapidly it can match or surpass Western technology.Mr. Trump is both accelerating and expanding trade battles that began before he took office. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, countries around the world began to restrict cross-border flows of trade, capital and migrants. Globalization\u2019s champions predicted that borders would continue to fall in at least one area \u2014 digital tech and the internet \u2014 but China has shown that a determined government can build walls in the virtual sphere, too.The president\u2019s tough stand on trade with China may be more popular than he is. The overwhelming consensus in the West is that Beijing is catching up illegitimately, by forcing companies that invest in China to share their best technology, or dispatching hackers to steal it. Though borrowing from the leading tech power is a standard development strategy \u2014 think of 19th-century America copying British industrial technology and Japan\u2019s great success replicating American technology \u2014 the scale and organization of China\u2019s campaign makes the threat feel new.Beijing has banned some foreign competitors like Google and Facebook outright, and regulated others so heavily that they have been compelled to sell themselves to Chinese rivals (Uber) or forced to consider pulling out of China (Amazon). In essence, China has created domestic internet monopolies that are generating enough cash in their vast local market to finance aggressive expansion abroad. I have been told, for example, that Toutiao already sells its novel content curating service to one in 10 Japanese.Last year Beijing rebranded the manufacturing centers of the Pearl River delta as the \u201cGreater Bay Area\u201d and began urging the main cities there \u2014 Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong \u2014 to cooperate to become China\u2019s rival to Silicon Valley, which the Chinese would like to make the lesser Bay Area.In Beijing, the buzz was about how \u201cCreated in China\u201d is replacing \u201cMade in China,\u201d with some claiming that Shenzhen is now more innovative than Silicon Valley in key industries. Instead of just assembling simple goods from parts built elsewhere, China is now increasingly seen as a cutting-edge designer and developer of artificial intelligence, drones and other advanced technologies.Mr. Trump was willing to lift the ban on ZTE after the company paid a $1 billion fine and fired its top executives, but Congress was not. The Senate voted to reinstate the ban, which is likely to fuel trade battles to come. When I was in Beijing, many Chinese were talking about how the humiliation of ZTE was inspiring an official push to reduce China\u2019s dependence on the United States for semiconductors, software and other critical tech imports.The European Union recently imposed new data protection rules written largely to give consumers more control of information now in the hands of corporate giants like Facebook, but also to guard against the spread of a China-like surveillance state. The European Union is also pondering a new digital single market, in part to give European companies a market in which they have a chance to grow as large as Chinese rivals.This is how a digitally interconnected world could die by a thousand cuts, and technoprotectionism may get a further push during the next global downturn. From the United States to Europe and Japan, public debts are high and deficits are rising, which means these governments are poorly positioned to spend their way out of any slowdown. Central banks can\u2019t help much, either, since interest rates are still very low, with little room or reason to drop further right now. In this environment, governments may see protectionism as the only lever they have left to pull.For most of the postwar era, the consensus in support of free trade was so strong that governments rarely resorted to raising tariffs even when times were tough. The trade wars that broke out after 2008 have involved mainly nontariff or \u201cstealth\u201d trade barriers, including cheap state loans and subsidies for favored industries. But in the last two years, the rise of Mr. Trump and other antiglobal populists has given new currency to protectionism in all its forms, including technoprotectionism.The global financial markets had largely ignored the brewing trade battles, until recently. As the tariff threats grow in scale, and the battleground shifts from rust belt industries to new technologies, the markets are growing more skittish. So far, stocks have been hit harder in China than in the United States, but there will be no winners. The latest surveys of American investors and manufacturers show that their biggest concern is the threat of a trade war.The risks from deglobalization are growing. If the current skirmishes turn into a full-blown trade war, blame will fall heavily on the thousandth cut. But the real fault will lie with the 999 that came before.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

But the patterns of migration from the poor South of people seeking a better life in the rich North are likely to change.While instability in Central America continues to drive people north, the vast traffic of low-skilled immigrants into the United States across the southern border has slowed. The demographic bulge of Mexican men in their teens and early 20s who flocked illegally to the United States from the 1990s until the Great Recession has petered out, in part a consequence of declining Mexican fertility since the 1970s. Today, Mexicans are older, on average. Fewer are willing to take the risk. And Mexico\u2019s economy is in better shape than in the 1980s and 1990s, when repeated crises drove many Mexicans from their homes.30%AustraliaSwitzerland25IsraelNewZealand20CanadaIrelandForeign-bornshare ofpopulationEstoniaAustriaBelgiumSpainSwedenLatviaUnitedStatesGermanyFranceBritainNorwayNetherlandsSlovenia10ItalyDenmarkRussiaPortugalGreeceCzechRepublicLithuania5HungaryFinlandChileJapanKoreaMexicoPoland0$10,00020,00030,00040,000G.D.P. per person30%AustraliaSwitzerland25IsraelNewZealand20CanadaForeign-bornshare ofpopulationIrelandEstoniaAustriaBelgium15SpainSwedenLatviaUnitedStatesGermanyFranceBritainNorwayNetherlandsSlovenia10ItalyDenmarkRussiaPortugalGreeceCzechRepublicLithuania5HungaryFinlandChileJapanKoreaBulgariaMexicoSlovakRepublicRomaniaPoland0$5,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,00045,000G.D.P. per person30%AustraliaSwitzerland25IsraelNewZealand20CanadaForeign-bornshare ofpopulationIrelandEstoniaAustriaBelgium15SpainSwedenLatviaUnitedStatesGermanyFranceBritainNorwayNetherlandsSlovenia10ItalyDenmarkRussiaPortugalGreeceCzechRepublicLithuania5HungaryFinlandChileJapanKoreaBulgariaMexicoSlovakRepublicRomaniaPoland0$5,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,00045,000G.D.P. per person30%AustraliaSwitzerland25IsraelNewZealandCanada20IrelandEstoniaAustriaBelgium15SpainSwedenLatviaUnitedStatesForeign-bornshare ofpopulationGermanyFranceBritainNorwayNetherlandsSlovenia10ItalyDenmarkRussiaPortugalGreeceCzechRepublicLithuania5HungaryFinlandChileJapanKoreaBulgariaMexicoSlovakRepublicRomaniaPoland0$5,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,00045,000G.D.P. per personAlthough immigration into the United States might have passed its high-water mark, other parts of the rich world \u2014 Europe, notably \u2014 are likely to experience more immigration than they have before.Demand for immigrant labor will probably rise in Europe as its population ages.

Across the countries in their study, people exposed to positive images of immigrants -- say, about their strong commitment to work -- become much less negative in general about immigration.Natives\u2019 views can also be manipulated in a negative direction, though, something currently reflected in the politics of many countries. Professor Stantcheva argues that negative portrayals of immigrants in the media could help explain the biased and erroneous views about immigrants\u2019 behavior. And as Professor Alesina notes, \u201cAnti-immigration parties foster these misperceptions in a variety of ways strategically to gain support for their anti-immigration stands.\u201dBut there are already plenty of walls, and they have done little to stop immigration. If rich countries want fewer immigrants, their best shot might be to help poor countries become rich, so that fewer people feel the urge to leave. That would include helping them adapt to climate change, and simply opening up their own markets to developing countries\u2019 exports. \u201cIf you want to have fewer immigrants, you would want poorer countries to take advantage of trade,\u201d Professor Alesina said. \u201cThe idea that because there is too much immigration you should restrict trade makes no sense.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, as Mr. Clemens argues, rich countries should probably start writing new rules and creating new institutions to manage the large immigration flows of the future. They could work to promote new destinations and develop mutually beneficial forms of migration (say, varieties of temporary work visas). They could establish mechanisms to assist vulnerable native-born people, whose jobs might be at stake.If properly handled, Mr. Clemens says, immigration is an opportunity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Goldman Sachs Fund Will Track Paul Tudor Jones\u2019s Feel-Good Companies", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThe spiritual guru Deepak Chopra had just finished teaching a class about ethics in business at Columbia Business School when he called the billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones II in the fall of 2012.\u201c\u2018Listen, one of my students has got a really good idea,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jones said Mr. Chopra had told him. The student had posed two questions: \u201cWhy can\u2019t companies be an instrument for goodness? Why can\u2019t companies focus their capital \u2014 human and financial \u2014 on being a change agent for societal betterment, a change agent for justness?\u201dUp until now, Mr. Jones\u2019s measure of corporate America was simply a list of companies, a ranking that he hoped would encourage chief executives to think more about doing right by society.But now it is about to become a financial product.On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs, using Mr. Jones\u2019s metrics, will introduce a new exchange-traded fund as part of series of social impact efforts by the firm.The fund is a feel-good selection of Russell 1000 companies, tracking the top 50 percent of those in each industry based on Just Capital\u2019s publicly available model, which scores businesses using a complex formula related to workers, customers, products, environment, jobs, communities and management. Only 6 percent of the calculation of the index relates to how well a company provides investor return.Whether the formula is a winning one for investors is a bit of an open question. The fund would have outperformed the Russell 1000 by 3.47 percent over the past two years. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is there is no way to test the formula any further back, and each year, the index changes based on shifts in the polling. If Americans become more concerned about job creation and less concerned about worker pay, different companies could be included.So it\u2019s a bit of a guess how well Just Capital\u2019s index will perform over the long term, a point Mr. Jones acknowledges up front.\u201cI think it outperforms\u201d similar indexes, he said. But he quickly warned that \u201cwhen we get in a bear market, this thing is going down 95 percent of what the other ones are, too.\u201d He added: \u201cLet\u2019s just all be honest about that. We are talking about relative outperformance.\u201dAccording to Just Capital, the companies in the fund outperformed the remainder of the Russell 1000 in a number of important, socially conscious ways: They paid 71 percent less in fines for consumer sales-terms violations and 94 percent less in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission fines, produced 45 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of revenue, and created American jobs at a 20 percent greater rate. Investors will pay a 0.2 percent fee, which is about half the price of most other E.S.G.-oriented funds.But Goldman Sachs and Mr. Jones aren\u2019t selling the fund as a quick-buck way for day traders to beat the stock market.Instead, it is being sold as a curated solution at a time when pension funds and other institutional investors are looking to shift their investments into socially responsible funds.\u201cWe are seeing clients think about this product in different ways,\u201d said John Goldstein, a managing director within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \u201cSome look to it as value-aligned market exposure, while others see a set of drivers of performance in a changing world.\u201dWhether social impact investing will turn out to be the most profitable way to invest has become one of the biggest questions within the investment world.Mr. Jones came to the same conclusion several years ago. He said he had been taken aback when he realized how a company\u2019s stock performance correlated with how responsibly it behaved.\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. The results were sufficiently profound to make him rethink his own business.\u201cI\u2019ve got to think about, even in my own business, how I am treating my employees, how we\u2019re running and operating this business,\u201d Mr. Jones said. (Among other changes, he said, he and his management team recently tripled the amount of profits his investment fund pays out to charity.)One major distinction between the new fund and the bevy of other socially responsible funds that have emerged is that it does not exclude any company based on a moral argument, except for tobacco. So the fund can include coal companies, for example, but only those that lead the industry based on his metrics.No matter their industry, he wants executives and board members to be thinking: \u201cWhat\u2019s my environmental footprint relative to every one else in my field? Where are my best business practices relative to my competitor? Am I doing as good a job as I possibly can, or is there someone doing better?\u201dWhile it may be in vogue to talk about socially responsible investments, until they prove they can perform better over a significant period of time, it will be hard for even the most virtuous investors to plow significant sums into them.For now, Mr. Jones is happy to get the conversation started.\u201cThe corporate mission as practiced today was designed in 1970 by Milton Friedman, when he famously said the social responsibility of the corporation is to improve its profits,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cThe biggest objective I think for those of us at Just is to begin the debate.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated an aspect of a new exchange-traded fund that is based on Just Capital\u2019s metrics. The fund will not include tobacco companies, even if they lead their industry according to the metrics.An earlier version of this column misquoted a comment by Paul Tudor Jones II. He said \u201cThe social responsibility of the corporation is to improve its profits,\u201d not its products. The column also referred imprecisely to Goldman Sachs\u2019s creation of the new fund. The fund is part of a broader series of social impact efforts by the firm, not its first foray into social impact investing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Crispr Conundrum: How Cells Fend Off Gene Editing", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatterHuman cells resist gene editing by turning on defenses against cancer, ceasing reproduction and sometimes dying, two teams of scientists have found.The findings, reported in the journal Nature Medicine, at first appeared to cast doubt on the viability of the most widely used form of gene editing, known as Crispr-Cas9 or simply Crispr, sending the stocks of some biotech companies into decline on Monday.Crispr Therapeutics fell by 13 percent shortly after the scientists\u2019 announcement. Intellia Therapeutics dipped, too, as did Editas Medicine. All three are developing medical treatments based on Crispr.But the scientists who published the research say that Crispr remains a promising technology, if a bit more difficult than had been known.\u201cThis is not something that should stop research on Crispr therapies,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s almost the other way \u2014 we should put more effort into such things.\u201dCrispr has stirred strong feelings ever since it came to light as a gene-editing technology five years ago. Already, it\u2019s a mainstay in the scientific tool kit.To edit genes with Crispr, scientists craft molecules that enter the nucleus of a cell. They zero in on a particular stretch of DNA and slice it out.The cell then repairs the two loose ends. If scientists add another piece of DNA, the cell may stitch it into the place where the excised gene once sat.Recently, Dr. Taipale and his colleagues set out to study cancer. They used Crispr to cut out genes from cancer cells to see which were essential to cancer\u2019s aggressive growth.For comparison, they also tried to remove genes from ordinary cells \u2014 in this case, a line of cells that originally came from a human retina. But while it was easy to cut genes from the cancer cells, the scientists did not succeed with the retinal cells.Such failure isn\u2019t unusual in the world of gene editing. But Dr. Taipale and his colleagues decided to spend some time to figure out why exactly they were failing.They soon discovered that one gene, p53, was largely responsible for preventing Crispr from working.p53 normally protects against cancer by preventing mutations from accumulating in cellular DNA. Mutations may arise when a cell tries to fix a break in its DNA strand. The process isn\u2019t perfect, and the repair may be faulty, resulting in a mutation.When cells sense that the strand has broken, the p53 gene may swing into action. It can stop a cell from making a new copy of its genes. Then the cell may simply stop multiplying, or it may die. This helps protect the body against cancer.If a cell gets a mutation in the p53 gene itself, however, the cell loses the ability to police itself for faulty DNA. It\u2019s no coincidence that many cancer cells carry disabled p53 genes.A new technique known as Crispr has revolutionized humans\u2019 ability to edit DNA. See if you can identify whether a given development has already happened, could eventually happen or is pure fiction.Dr. Taipale and his colleagues engineered retinal cells to stop using p53 genes. Just as they had predicted, Crispr now worked much more effectively in these cells.They set out to develop new versions of Crispr to edit the DNA in stem cells. They planned to turn the stem cells into neurons, enabling them to study brain diseases in Petri dishes.Someday, they hope, it may become possible to use Crispr to create cell lines that can be implanted in the body to treat diseases.When the Novartis team turned Crispr on stem cells, however, most of them died. The scientists found signs that Crispr had caused p53 to switch on, so they shut down the p53 gene in the stem cells.Now many of the stem cells survived having their DNA edited.The authors of both studies say their results raise some concerns about using Crispr to treat human disease.For one thing, the anticancer defenses in human cells could make Crispr less efficient than researchers may have hoped.One way to overcome this hurdle might be to put a temporary brake on p53. But then extra mutations may sneak into our DNA, perhaps leading to cancer.Another concern: Sometimes cells spontaneously acquire a mutation that disables the p53 gene. If scientists use Crispr on a mix of cells, the ones with disabled p53 cells are more likely to be successfully edited.But without p53, these edited cells would also be more prone to gaining dangerous mutations.One way to eliminate this risk might be to screen engineered cells for mutant p53 genes. But Steven A. McCarroll, a geneticist at Harvard University, warned that Crispr might select for other risky mutations.\u201cThese are important papers, since they remind everyone that genome editing isn\u2019t magic,\u201d said Jacob E. Corn, scientific director of the Innovative Genomics Institute in Berkeley, Calif.Crispr doesn\u2019t simply rewrite DNA like a word processing program, Dr. Corn said. Instead, it breaks DNA and coaxes cells to put it back together. And some cells may not tolerate such changes.While Dr. Corn said that rigorous tests for safety were essential, he doubted that the new studies pointed to a cancer risk from Crispr.The particular kinds of cells that were studied in the two new papers may be unusually sensitive to gene editing. Dr. Corn said he and his colleagues have not found similar problems in their own research on bone marrow cells.\u201cWe have all been looking for the possibility of cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is a warning for therapies.\u201d\u201cWe should definitely be cautious,\u201d said George Church, a geneticist at Harvard and a founding scientific adviser at Editas.He suspected that p53\u2019s behavior would not translate into any real risk of cancer, but \u201cit\u2019s a valid concern.\u201dAnd those concerns may be moot in a few years. The problem with Crispr is that it breaks DNA strands. But Dr. Church and other researchers are now investigating ways of editing DNA without breaking it.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a whole new generation of molecules that have nothing to do with Crispr,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stock market isn\u2019t a reflection of the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Betting on Crisis, Hedge Funds Short Italian Bonds", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive Star politicians, including the group\u2019s founder and current leader, pondered such radical cures to Italy\u2019s economic woes as restructuring its enormous debt and establishing a currency in addition to the euro.\u201cIt was clear to me then that these guys wanted to renegotiate the status quo in Europe,\u201d said Mr. Ondruch, the founder of Astellon Capital Partners, an investment manager based in London. In the months after the conference, he increased his bet that the prices of Italian bonds would fall sharply. \u201cI am surprised it took the markets so long to wake up to this,\u201d he said.The prices of Italian stocks and bonds plunged, and yields on short-term bonds rocketed to 2.7 percent from 0.24 percent. The euro\u2019s value relative to the dollar fell to an 11-month low.For hedge funds that were wagering on a new Italian debt crisis, the market turmoil was a profit bonanza. And they are betting there is more to come.Hedge funds have been building up their short positions for months, betting that Italian bonds will face another bout of selling pressure once investors recognize that the new government might consider taboo topics such as adopting a currency other than the euro and restructuring Italy\u2019s debt.Call it the return of the bond vigilantes \u2014 a term for investors who sell the bonds of governments when they run big deficits and appear to have unsustainable debt burdens.From 2010 to 2012, a parade of investors, deeply skeptical about the eurozone\u2019s ability to hold together, wagered that the bonds of debt-plagued countries like Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain would keep falling. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy as pension funds, mutual funds and banks sold these suddenly risky securities.The Continentwide fire sale was halted only when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, put in place an aggressive program to buy the bonds, which made their prices soar and their interest rates fall.Now, as the E.C.B.\u2019s bond-purchasing program draws to a close, the same strains that prompted the earlier bout of selling \u2014 weaker countries running up potentially unsustainable debts \u2014 are showing again.In Italy, for example, the new government is promising an aggressive spending program to spur the country\u2019s stagnant economy. The populists are not deterred by the fiscal restraints imposed on eurozone countries by Brussels.\u201cThese people feel very strongly that deficit limits make no sense,\u201d said Jens Nordvig, the founder of Exante Data, a financial research firm that provides trading ideas to hedge funds.Many large investors, he said, now \u201chave a short bias\u201d toward Italy, believing that a clash between Rome and Brussels over eurozone rules and regulations could lead to a sell-off. If Italy flouts European deficit restrictions, for example, investors and large banks are likely to sell the government\u2019s bonds, fearing deep losses.Mr. Nordvig said that a robust market for futures contracts tied to Italian government bonds had made it easy to bet against Italy. Futures contracts oblige an investor to buy or sell an asset at a specified date in the future. The popularity of the futures market in Italian bonds means it is simpler and cheaper than before to place speculative bets about coming price swings.According to Eurex, Europe\u2019s main exchange for trading derivatives, volume in short-term Italian bond futures was up 33 percent through April of this year compared with the same period in 2017.In addition to betting against bonds, many prominent hedge funds are calculating that the share prices of large Italian companies will fall drastically.For example, Bridgewater, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, has a number of short positions on Italian financial institutions, including UniCredit, Italy\u2019s biggest bank, according to data from Consob, Italy\u2019s financial regulator. Other funds betting against Italian companies include Steven Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management, Marshall Wace in London and the quantitative specialist AQR Capital Management. Bridgewater, Point72 and Marshall Wace declined to comment.Mr. Ondruch\u2019s Italian trade has been one of his most profitable positions this year. He has since pared his bet, pocketing the profit, but expects to make a similar wager soon.\u201cWhat we have had so far is a political event, not a credit event,\u201d he said, referring to the point when a country runs out of money. \u201cThe endgame is still 12 to 24 months out.\u201dWhat has spooked investors the most has been the Italian ruling party\u2019s flirtation with a second currency. Since the dire days of the Greek crisis, economists and bankers have floated the idea of another currency for highly indebted eurozone countries. Strapped Greek and Italian citizens could use this alternate currency to pay taxes and for things like gasoline or health care from the state.Such proposals have been opposed by officials in Brussels as a first step to abandoning the euro.The topic was taken up with gusto at the Five Star conference last year.\u201cIt was scary \u2014 it looked to me like a Plan B to get out of the euro,\u201d said Massimo Bonansinga, a portfolio manager for CI Investments, a fund management firm based in Toronto.But unlike many of his peers, Mr. Bonansinga took the view that more moderate minds would prevail and that an Italian government would not take such drastic steps.Accordingly, he has stuck by his investments in Italian stocks.\u201cItaly is a conservative country,\u201d Mr. Bonansinga said. \u201cI am just not sure that people want to leave the euro.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Global stock benchmarks and commodity prices fell.With the latest threat from Mr. Trump, the White House is warning that it could impose trade restrictions on as much as $450 billion of imports from China, a figure that is nearly equivalent to the total value of goods that China sold to the United States last year.On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, said the United States was \u201cabandoning all the consensus that has been achieved, changing its mind constantly.\u201dAcross financial markets, it appears that investors are starting to take seriously how such a trade conflict could become a drag on a global economy that\u2019s expected to grow at a relatively strong 3.9 percent in 2018, according to International Monetary Fund forecasts.In the United States, the Dow Jones Index, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite all fell on Tuesday. The Dow\u2019s drop of 1.2 percent was its worst day this month, and pushed it into slightly negative territory for the year.Industrial companies including Caterpillar and Boeing weighed heavily on the benchmarks, dropping more than 3 percent each.The trading followed declines in stock markets in Frankfurt, London and Paris. Shares in Hong Kong, Tokyo and mainland China also closed sharply lower.Investors moved their money into haven assets like 10-year United States Treasury bonds and the Japanese yen. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell below 2.90 percent early Tuesday, in a sign that at least some investors were concerned about risks to growth.In the markets for commodities, the raw materials on which the global economy runs, the declines were widespread. Copper, a barometer for industrial activity, was down, as was crude oil.Some of the sharpest drops were in the agricultural commodities markets, where the price for soybeans \u2014 a politically sensitive crop given Mr. Trump\u2019s support among farmers \u2014 plunged early Tuesday before stabilizing.

An instructor at the event said the workshop normally costs $1,197, but the company was offering it for $197.Mr. Merrill, a former professional football player, has built something of a national reputation for pitching home flipping as a way to make money for just about anyone with a little cash and a dream to become a big time real estate investor. His FortuneBuilders company bills itself as an educational firm with many satisfied customers and success stories. The company is closely tied to a private lender called Grand Coast Capital that provides short-term financing to real estate investors,many of whom are past attendees of the three-day programs.The free class on Tuesday was something of a cross between a how-to guide to buying and selling homes and an evangelical experience.

Arm believes this joint venture, which will license Arm semiconductor technology to Chinese companies and locally develop Arm technology in China, will expand Arm\u2019s opportunities in the Chinese market.Arm estimates that 95 percent of all advanced chips designed in China last year were based on its technology. With China desperate to make its own chips in volume, and quickly (there\u2019s more on that theme below), the move could prove shrewd.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation is rushing to build semiconductor factories. But reports claiming that the Chinese government is probing chip makers over price-fixing demonstrate that it\u2019s not there yet.Reuters notes that, according to Trendforce, China accounts for 20 percent of all global DRAM memory sales.

{"Headline": "Roiling Markets, U.S. Insists World Must Stop Buying Iranian Oil", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States said on Tuesday that it will impose sanctions against all importers of Iranian oil by Nov. 4, a surprisingly tough position that roiled oil markets and is likely to further alienate allies and adversaries alike.But a senior State Department official said Tuesday morning that such routine waivers were not likely to be issued by the Trump administration, although he did not rule them out entirely.Oil prices immediately rose on the news. The United States benchmark increased nearly 4 percent to $70.68 a barrel, while the international benchmark, Brent crude, rose 2.3 percent to $76.46 a barrel.American diplomats will not participate in the Vienna talks, set for next week, since the United States is no longer a party to the deal. But senior Trump administration officials will talk with European diplomats on the sidelines of the meeting about efforts to further restrain Iran.Sanctions experts expressed a mixture of bafflement and scorn at Tuesday\u2019s announcement. They noted that countries like India and China never entirely ended their imports of Iranian crude even before Tehran agreed to the 2015 nuclear accord.Following Washington\u2019s withdrawal from the deal, European allies vowed to resist reimposing of sanctions. And in the midst of an increasingly bitter trade war with China, the likelihood that Beijing will entirely end its imports of Iranian oil is dubious, analysts said.\u201cThey\u2019re going to go after the Central Bank of China just before the midterms?\u201d said Daniel Fried, a top White House and State Department official in the administration of President George W. Bush. \u201cThe next day\u2019s headline will be: \u2018Dow Drops 5,000 Points.\u2019\u201dPeter Harrell, a former sanctions official in the State Department, dismissed the idea outright. \u201cI don\u2019t see China and India going to zero,\u201d he said.Next week\u2019s meeting in Vienna will come just two days after President Hassan Rouhani of Iran is expected to visit the Austrian capital to discuss the nuclear deal.Briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, a top State Department official said that he had yet to visit India or China to discuss the re-imposition of sanctions.But he said that companies in both countries that continue to buy oil and other products from Iran after Nov. 4 will be barred from selling anything in the United States. The official acknowledged that other nations rarely want to voluntarily end imports but do so to preserve their relationships with the United States.European diplomats spent months negotiating a side agreement to the Iran deal with Brian Hook, a top State Department official, hoping such an agreement would persuade Mr. Trump to stay in the accord. In April, President Emmanuel Macron of France told Mr. Trump in the Oval Office that negotiations with Mr. Hook were about to yield a strong agreement. \u201cWho\u2019s Brian Hook?\u201d Mr. Trump responded, according to a person with knowledge of the exchange.Robert A. Pape, director of the University of Chicago\u2019s Project on Security and Threats, said that sanctions only work when a country\u2019s military suppliers participate in the effort. With Russia and China likely to continue to supply Iran with sophisticated hardware despite the sanctions, the Trump administration\u2019s efforts are not likely to succeed, he said.\u201cThis is big stick diplomacy, and that has a long history of failure,\u201d Mr. Pape said.On Wall Street, analysts said the coming months could see a series of price spikes in what is an increasingly tight oil market.Iran has been exporting over 2 million barrels a day. With Venezuelan output in decline and sporadic cutoffs occurring in Libya and elsewhere, analysts estimated that there is now only two to three million barrels a day of so-called spare capacity.\u201cThe spare capacity cushion could become very thin, if you take Iranian exports out,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an oil analyst at IHS Markit, a research firm.Big oil producers were jockeying to deal with the new realities of the oil market at meetings between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, like Russia, over the weekend in Vienna. The meetings appeared to mark the effective end of the 18 months of production cuts that have drained the oil glut and more than doubled prices from their lows in early 2016.Saudi Arabia and its allies \u2014 like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 pushed for production increases. Iran resisted, but the Saudis and their allies prevailed.Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi oil minister, said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia was already ramping up exports substantially. But analysts still predicted further price rises if Iran is entirely excluded from the market.Katherine Bauer, a former Treasury Department official, said that countries are likely to balk at the Trump administration\u2019s maximalist posture.\u201cThe risk is that you push countries to look for ways around sanctions,\u201d she said.Gardiner Harris reported from Washington and Stanley Reed from London.Advertisement"}
