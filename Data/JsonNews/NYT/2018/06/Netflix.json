You won\u2019t see \u201cForeign Language\u201d on the list; Netflix instead categorizes its foreign language films under \u201cInternational.\u201d I don\u2019t know the reason for this distinction, but my first guess is that international sounds less intimidating.The sheer amount of material may be the most impressive thing about the category. And for a mainstream platform like Netflix, international doesn\u2019t mean art house. Although the best of the four films in that category I watched recently leans toward that.After Chiara makes her subtle but memorable re-entry into Anabel\u2019s life (she shows up as a server at a catered event Anabel is hosting), she asks of her mother a single favor: to spend 10 days with her, in a house in a French forest just across the Spanish border \u2014 the house Anabel left when she abandoned Chiara. Old wounds are reopened and new understandings sought, but the movie avoids a pat conclusion.\u201cUs and Them\u201d depicts a decade\u2019s worth of Chinese New Year journeys through the eyes of Jianqing and Xiaoxiao (Zhou Dongyu), former lovers who went their separate ways and meet on a plane many years later; once the flight is canceled, they\u2019re thrown together in a hotel to reminisce about the past.The French Netflix Original \u201cTo Each, Her Own,\u201d directed by Myriam Aziza from a script she wrote with Denyse Rodriguez-Tom\u00e9, doesn\u2019t lack for fraught situations. Simone (Sarah Stern) has been living with her girlfriend, Claire, for three years but hasn\u2019t come out to her Orthodox Jewish parents. One of her brothers is gay; the other runs a Jewish dating service called MazelLov.com and sets Sarah up on a date. But she persuades a female non-Jewish co-worker to stand in for her. Then she begins to fall hard for Wali (Jean-Christophe Folly), a Senegalese chef who happens to be a man. Simone\u2019s a banker, and Wali wants not just her love, but also her help in opening a restaurant. In addition to the easy-to-predict snags you might imagine resulting from this scenario, there\u2019s the fact that much of Wali\u2019s crew is anti-Semitic.The movie maintains a light tone, bolstered by sunny albeit flat visuals, despite all of the provocative thematic threads. The movie insists on a breezy optimism that skirts glibness, then doubles down on it with a having-it-all finale that\u2019s as ridiculous as it is nervy.The most watchable portions of this fluff ball are the downright weird movie tributes, including a \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d parody in which Ms. Paola herself sings \u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have You,\u201d and does a credible job of it, and a surprising bit of business paying homage to \u201cGilda.\u201d It\u2019s soothing to know that at least these Mexican kids today have some regard for the classics. Or at least that this film\u2019s director, Rene Bueno, would like us to think so.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Was It a False Confession in \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019? The Supreme Court May Decide", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySidebarWASHINGTON \u2014 In 2015, millions of people watched \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d a Netflix documentary series about the murder prosecutions of two Wisconsin men. Opinions varied on the guilt of the program\u2019s central figure, Steven Avery, who was convicted of killing Teresa Halbach, a 25-year-old photographer.But many people were made powerfully uneasy by the treatment of Mr. Avery\u2019s nephew, Brendan Dassey, whose videotaped interrogation was among the most gripping parts of the series.Mr. Dassey, 16 at the time, was a study in pathos: hapless, lost, scared, painfully awkward, trusting, susceptible to suggestion and close to if not over the borderline of intellectual disability.Two investigators feigning fatherly concern fed Mr. Dassey crucial details and elicited a halting, mumbled and contradictory confession. On the strength of that confession and almost nothing else, Mr. Dassey was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for raping and murdering Ms. Halbach.On Thursday, the Supreme Court will consider whether to hear Mr. Dassey\u2019s appeal.Mr. Dassey was interviewed for hours without a lawyer, a parent or any other adult who might have been alert to his interests. But the investigators who questioned him assured him that he had nothing to fear from them.\u201cYeah, we\u2019re cops, we\u2019re investigators and stuff like that, but not right now,\u201d said Tom Fassbender, a special agent with the Wisconsin Department of Justice. \u201cI\u2019m a father that has a kid your age, too. I want to be here for you. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d like more than to come over and give you a hug.\u201dThe investigators teased out contradictory statements from Mr. Dassey, steering him toward their theory of the case.They knew, for instance, that Ms. Halbach had been shot in the head, though this fact had not yet been made public. What followed was like a game of 20 Questions.\u201cSomething else was done,\u201d said Mark Wiegert, an investigator with the Calumet County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cSomething with the head.\u201dMr. Dassey\u2019s first try: Mr. Avery had cut off Ms. Halbach\u2019s hair.His second try: Mr. Avery had punched her in the head.His third try: Mr. Avery had told him to cut Ms. Halbach\u2019s throat.At this point, Mr. Dassey gave up. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can remember,\u201d he said.But the investigators were not done. \u201cAll right,\u201d Mr. Wiegert said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to come out and ask you. Who shot her in the head?\u201dThus prompted, Mr. Dassey said that \u201che did,\u201d referring to his uncle.Asked why he had not mentioned that shocking assertion earlier, Mr. Dassey said, \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t think of it.\u201dBy the end of the interrogation, Mr. Dassey had confessed to gruesome crimes. Then he asked if he could return to school in time for a sixth-period class. He had a project due.When his mother asked him how he had been able to answer the investigators\u2019 questions, he said he had guessed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do with my homework,\u201d he added.Mr. Dassey and his family were completely overmatched by the criminal justice system. In a call to his mother from jail, for instance, Mr. Dassey said he had been told that some of his statements had been \u201cinconsistent.\u201d He did not know what the word meant, so he asked his mother. She did not know, either.In dissent, Chief Judge Diane P. Wood wrote that this was a \u201ctravesty of justice.\u201d\u201cIt affected the way everyday Americans view our justice system,\u201d the prosecutors wrote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Yellowstone\u2019 Wrangles Daddy Issues on the Range", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the second episode of \u201cYellowstone,\u201d Kayce Dutton (Luke Grimes), clearing a patch of Montana land, blows up a tree stump with explosives. In the resulting crater, he finds a half-exposed dinosaur fossil.But it also makes a pretty good metaphor for the series itself. \u201cYellowstone,\u201d which begins Wednesday on Paramount Network, has a few interesting things buried within. But you need to dig through a lot of drab, hard-packed filler to get to them. The series seems to do that almost inadvertently, and only partially.The surface layer of \u201cYellowstone\u201d is part modern-day Western, part family business saga \u2014 a kind of cowboy \u201cDynasty\u201d with some dark-cable ambitions. Standing atop it is the flinty personage of John Dutton (Kevin Costner, in ornery-cuss mode), the owner of Yellowstone Ranch, an expanse of grass, hills and testosterone the size of Rhode Island.Dutton, no heart and all cattle, runs Yellowstone half like a business empire, half like a Big Sky mafia. He uses and abuses his political connections and has his ranchmen and henchmen branded with Yellowstone\u2019s \u201cY.\u201dBut Dutton is beset on multiple sides. Thomas Rainwater (Gil Birmingham), the combative leader of the neighboring Indian reservation, is pressing a conflict over cattle-grazing rights, while a developer is encroaching with a plan to build homes for well-heeled urbanites craving elbow room.Dutton, not much of a compromiser, goes to the mattresses and calls on his grown kids. Lee (Dave Annable) is the only child who\u2019s stayed home, striving for his father\u2019s stingily given approval. Lee, Dutton tells him, sees his cattle the way a cowboy does (as lives to protect), not as a cattleman does (as investments to preserve). He does not mean it as a compliment.The other Dutton siblings are various shades of black sheep. Jamie (Wes Bentley) is a lawyer with an eye on state politics. Beth (Kelly Reilly) is a hard-charging businesswoman, racking up boardroom and bedroom conquests, who feels transplanted from a more unapologetically sudsy family saga.Dutton\u2019s most tortured relationship is with his son Kayce, who\u2019s married a Native American woman, Monica (Kelsey Asbille), and moved onto the reservation, nearby but a world away. Kayce, caught between cultures, becomes something like the protagonist of \u201cYellowstone,\u201d and its entree into the reservation.A few recent TV series have treated modern reservation life, like Sundance\u2019s \u201cThe Red Road\u201d and A&E and Netflix\u2019s \u201cLongmire.\u201d But it\u2019s still fairly unexplored, and this is where \u201cYellowstone\u201d feels most fresh, with its internal tribal politics and the culture clashes between Kayce and Monica\u2019s family.But the A-story of \u201cYellowstone\u201d is simply stale. Dutton is a hand-tooled role for Mr. Costner, but he\u2019s not a charismatic villain in the throwback mode of \u201cDallas,\u201d or a principled loner, or a complicated antihero. He\u2019s just a corrupt grouch on horseback.And the cast from top to bottom is burdened with stagy dialogue. By the time Jamie shouted at Beth, \u201cDrive your polluted soul back to the city where it belongs!,\u201d my will to continue was already motoring halfway to the horizon.There\u2019s no lack of talent on display. Ms. Reilly might have been a scene-stealer in a version of \u201cYellowstone\u201d that fully committed to an all-out trashy-rich saga. Mr. Birmingham might have been a captivating protagonist in one that dove deeper into reservation politics.\u201cYellowstone,\u201d of course, has the right to be exactly the show it wants to be, but for now (I\u2019ve seen three episodes, including the double-length pilot) it\u2019s an unsteady mix of several, held together by the sepia of basic-cable grittiness.It does, at least, deliver on a prerequisite of a modern Western: It looks grand. Mr. Sheridan shoots his locations (in Montana and Utah) to look both timeless and contemporary, loved but unromanticized.Images like that unearthed dinosaur suggest a series that might have a capacity to surprise. For now, though, \u201cYellowstone\u201d is a sprawling expanse whose potential is untapped.Advertisement"}

But it\u2019s the weekend! And almost summer! So I officially grant you a hard-news break and offer some thoughts on the important matter of junk food.A few weeks ago, I asked for your memories of forgotten Canadian candies and snacks, and the results were, well, sweet (and salty).Kristen Rossetti, a New Yorker from Smiths Falls, Ontario \u2014 the self proclaimed chocolate capital of Canada until its Hershey factory closed \u2014 said she pined for the Lowney\u2019s Cherry Blossom. \u201cIts core is a maraschino cherry and cherry syrup surrounded by a THICK layer of mixed chocolate, coconut and roasted peanuts,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThink of a giant and exponentially more delicious cherry cordial.\u201dAmong the most interesting people who answered my call was Jim Connell, the man who figured out how to put the vinegar into salt-and-vinegar potato chips, a perennial Canadian favorite.Mr. Connell is 93 and lives in Toronto. But he told me the flavoring breakthrough first happened in Britain. It was 1968 and Mr. Connell was working in the flavor development for the Canadian subsidiary of an American company, Griffith Laboratories, when he was sent off to Bristol, England, to help establish a joint venture there with an outfit that mostly made sausage ingredients.Shortly after his arrival, Mr. Connell said, he was approached by Imperial Tobacco, which at the time was expanding its spectrum of vices to include potato chips. Like Canadians, the British have long sprinkled vinegar on deep fried potatoes, something Mr. Connell said he suspected was about masking the flavor of the \u201crancid grease\u201d used by fish \u2018n\u2019 chip shops. In any case, the tobacco company figured that echoing the taste in potato chips \u2014 the British call them \u201ccrisps\u201d \u2014 would be a winner.The tobacco company ultimately passed on the product. But a much smaller and older British potato chip company that was struggling decided to bite, and was saved by salt and vinegar\u2019s immediate success. Griffith Labs, which is still a major force in the arcane world of flavorings, soon brought salt and vinegar to Canada.Mr. Connell said his lab modified salt and vinegar to create several other chips that were now Canadian icons, including ketchup and dill pickle. Those, he said, use actual dried tomato paste and dill, not chemical concoctions.Mr. Connell dodged my question about what flavor was his favorite child.\u201cI only eat them once in a while,\u201d he said. \u201cI like them all.\u201dThe Sports department at the The New York Times takes soccer seriously. And it pulls out all the stops for the World Cup, which gets underway next week in Russia. At least five reporters will be on the scene, Andrew Das, an editor in Sports, told me.They include Sarah Lyall, who is one of the finest writers in journalism, and who will be filing pieces about the culture of the event: watch for her articles even if you\u2019re not a soccer fan. There will also be live briefings for every game, and we\u2019ll be translating much of the report into Spanish.\u201cWe\u2019ll ping around the 12 stadiums (and 11 cities; Moscow has two sites), from Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg in the west, to Rostov and Sochi in the south, to Yekaterinburg way the hell out east,\u201d Andrew said.Team Canada won\u2019t be competing on the pitch this year. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be some Canadian action.On June 13, the day before the opening match, FIFA will be announcing the host for the 2026 World Cup, and Canada is part of a joint bid with the United States and Mexico. Their only rival is Morocco, Andrew said, and \u201cit\u2019s expected to be close.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Last Defense\u2019 Aims to Open Once-Shut Cases", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor four seasons, Viola Davis has starred for ABC in \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder.\u201d Her new series for the network, \u201cThe Last Defense,\u201d might well be called \u201cHow to Get Convicted of Murder.\u201dThe seven-part documentary, starting Tuesday, reargues cases of two prisoners awaiting execution. It begins with Ms. Davis (one of several executive producers) saying in a voice-over that every year an average of five prisoners on death row are exonerated.\u201cThe Last Defense\u201d may or may not add to that number. But it offers a powerful argument that people can be convicted as much by emotion and prejudice as by evidence.Ms. Routier called in the killing to 911, saying that an intruder had attacked her and the boys while they slept. (We hear the excruciating audio several times.) Though Ms. Routier was herself wounded badly, including a life-threatening slash to the throat, prosecutors soon charged her.Experts for the prosecution argued that Ms. Routier\u2019s knife wounds were self-inflicted and that blood spatter and broken glass found at the crime scene was inconsistent with her account.The documentary also notes a significant exculpatory piece of evidence \u2014 a sock, stained with both boys\u2019 blood, found down an alley from the house. \u201cThe Last Defense\u201d suggests that investigators minimized it because they were already invested in Ms. Routier as a suspect.But the most powerful part of the case against Ms. Routier \u2014 and the most disturbing, in the retelling \u2014 was an all-out character attack. Prosecutors painted her as a materialistic, \u201cself-centered\u201d woman for whom children were \u201can impediment to the good life.\u201dThe prosecution attacked Ms. Routier for spending on jewelry, for playing Coolio\u2019s \u201cGangsta\u2019s Paradise\u201d (the boys\u2019 favorite song, their father says) at their funeral, for having had breast-augmentation surgery. \u201cWho goes out and spends $2,000 on a set of breasts?\u201d one juror says.The strategy worked. A key element was a video Ms. Routier, friends and family celebrating what would have been one son\u2019s seventh birthday with a graveside \u201cparty,\u201d where they brought balloons and sprayed Silly String. The prosecution cast it as a desecration. The jurors replayed the video nine times.\u201cThe Last Defense\u201d is plainly a work of advocacy. But it\u2019s sensitive to the drive for justice. It\u2019s hard not to see the home-video footage of Ms. Routier\u2019s sons, the blood stains on the Power Rangers bedsheets, and not want someone to be punished. \u201cThe Last Defense\u201d questions whether that desire can overwhelm the evidence.The last three episodes cover the case of Julius Jones, an Oklahoma college student sentenced to death at 21 in a carjacking murder. The series suggests a theory that Mr. Jones may have been set up for the crime by an acquaintance and examines the potential role of racism in his trial: an African-American man accused of killing a white man in the suburbs.The episodes also tell a more depressingly familiar story: that Mr. Jones, regardless of his innocence or guilt, did not receive close to the best possible defense from the public defenders who represented him and that the system rigidly resists admitting any possible mistakes.What \u201cThe Last Defense\u201d does have is a clarity of moral purpose. Whether or not you find its arguments in these specific cases exonerating, it makes a disturbing argument about the potential for error in capital cases.Like some of its true-crime predecessors, \u201cThe Last Defense\u201d is a kind of anti-procedural. It asks the audience instead to confront uncertainty and to ask how willing we are to accept that in real nonscripted life the system can get the answer wrong.Advertisement"}

Some of the messages berated her by saying she had no friends, and others asked her when she would kill herself, the lawsuit says.She was called \u201cfat\u201d and \u201cjiggly\u201d and was made fun of for her \u201cfrizzy\u201d hair, according to the lawsuit filed in Morris County Superior Court, as part of \u201congoing and systematic bullying of Mallory.\u201dMs. Grossman, Mallory\u2019s mother, said in an interview that she routinely contacted administrators about the bullying, but that the school did not do enough in response.At one point, the school asked Mallory and her bullies to \u201chug each other,\u201d according to the lawsuit. When Mallory was bullied at lunch, the suit says, the school directed her to eat in a counselor\u2019s office.Hours before Mallory\u2019s suicide on June 14, 2017, at a meeting about the bullying, her principal handed Mallory a poker chip and asked her to inscribe her initials and the date on it, and used a poker metaphor to address the situation, according to the lawsuit.\u201cAre you all in?\u201d the principal asked Mallory, according to Ms. Grossman.\u201cThere is this attack on the victim to \u2018suck it up,\u2019\u201d Ms. Grossman said. \u201cI knew they weren\u2019t taking it seriously.\u201dThe lawsuit names the school district\u2019s board of education and a number of school officials, asserting that they were negligent in their responsibility to protect Mallory.

The biggest loser? 28 percent thought Mr. Trump; 27 percent thought leaders of the Group of 7.\u2022 About 80 percent of survey participants thought the AT&T decision was correct.\u2022 And 60 percent thought that the Justice Department had tried to block it for political, rather than legal, reasons.But by one measure \u2014 stock markets \u2014 the trade fight isn\u2019t having much impact.

{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Case Was So Closely Watched", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision was no less momentous for President Trump\u2019s Justice Department which, in suing to block the deal, was advocating a new approach to antitrust regulation.Here\u2019s a primer on what happened:The Justice Department said it would consider its options.CVS and Aetna also rose, while Express Scripts, which is being acquired by insurer Cigna, added about 5 percent. Cigna also rose.In the past, regulators have instead focused on keeping one company, or a small group of companies, from owning too much of any one specific industry. It comes up when companies buy their competitors \u2014 what\u2019s known as horizontal integration.What makes the AT&T decision noteworthy is that the deal was challenged even though it doesn\u2019t share all the characteristics of horizontal integration.\u201cVertical mergers do not fit the traditional horizontal-merger analytical framework used by the U.S. regulatory authorities,\u201d R. Mark McCareins, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, wrote in an online discussion about vertical mergers. It means the trade commission and the Department of Justice \u201care faced with pounding a square peg into a round hole.\u201dDoing so might have encouraged the Justice Department to act more aggressively when looking at deals in the future, and also could have prompted a rethink by companies with similar deals in the works.He could have approved it but attached conditions. The aim of the conditions could broadly have been to keep AT&T from using its control of providers like HBO or CNN as a weapon to increase costs for its rivals. The Justice Department argued that AT&T could charge rivals a high price for, say, HBO to make AT&T\u2019s own product more competitive.One way to address this could have been to appoint a third party to oversee disagreements between AT&T and the cable companies that want to license Time Warner content. The government didn\u2019t like that approach.Another option was to demand that AT&T and Time Warner sell off some plum assets. AT&T and Time Warner didn\u2019t like this approach, so was expected to appeal any such decision.Yup. Time Warner owns CNN, which President Trump has publicly and repeatedly attacked as fake news.An earlier version of this article misstated the structure of a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint.

{"Headline": "Fox News Faces Criticism of Family Separation Coverage From Inside Murdoch Empire", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, the Murdoch family has been able to maintain a separation between its Fox News network and its sprawling entertainment empire.Those tweets came several days after Seth MacFarlane, the creator of \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d said he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d to work at 21st Century Fox after the Fox News host Tucker Carlson told viewers not to trust other news networks.The criticism has erupted as the future of 21st Century Fox remains in limbo. Both The Walt Disney Company and Comcast are bidding tens of billions of dollars for control of most of the entertainment assets owned by Rupert Murdoch. Fox News would not be part of either sale, and would remain under Murdoch control.But with the Fox entertainment empire on the brink of being severed from the Murdochs, there appeared to be a newfound willingness to take on Fox News, an enormously profitable arm of 21st Century Fox. The Murdoch-owned company has varied offerings, ranging from its Hollywood-based television and movie studios, the cable channels FX, FS1 and National Geographic, and the TV operator Star India.Whether this was a temporary show of unrest or it signaled a more prolonged period of intra-company squabbling remained to be seen, but any sale of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets to either Disney or Comcast could take at least a year to be completed.In recent days, several Fox News commentators defended the zero-tolerance immigration policy that has resulted in more than 2,300 children being taken from their parents after crossing the border.Ms. Ingraham then said that \u201cliberals have seized on the \u2018separated children\u2019\u201d \u2014 putting the term in air quotes \u2014 \u201cand turned the entire image into a political weapon, attempting to emotionally manipulate the public perception of immigration enforcement.\u201dLater in her show, Ms. Ingraham noted that there were \u201ca lot of people very upset\u201d about her \u201csummer camps\u201d comments. She then again referenced The San Diego Union-Tribune article and said, \u201cI will stick to there are some of them like boarding schools.\u201d She also called for looser rules to allow Americans to adopt children from Central America.Fox News declined to comment on the outcry from entertainers, but the news network did defend Ms. Ingraham from the call for an advertiser boycott by David Hogg, a survivor of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.\u201cFox News will never tolerate or give in to attempts to silence diverse viewpoints by agenda-driven intimidation efforts,\u201d the network said in a statement. Twenty First Century Fox declined to comment.\u201cThis is one of those moments that tells you everything about our ruling class,\u201d he said. \u201cThey care far more about foreigners than about their own people.\u201dTurning to face the camera, she asked President Trump to \u201cnot fall for it.\u201dMr. Hilton said in a statement that he did not endorse Ms. Coulter\u2019s comments \u201cor anything else said by anyone other than myself.\u201d\u201cMy article illustrates the complexities of the asylum system,\u201d Mr. Mehta wrote, \u201cand how even those with a legitimate claim to asylum are forced to create or embellish narratives that will satisfy the whims of a broken system.\u201dOn Tuesday, the filmmaker Judd Apatow implored those working for Fox\u2019s entertainment companies to condemn Fox News for how it was handling the border debate.Mr. Levitan, the \u201cModern Family\u201d creator, said there were many people at the TV studio who shared his concerns with Fox News \u201cbut aren\u2019t in the position to speak out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Ups Its Bid for 21st Century Fox to $71.3 Billion", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Walt Disney Company sharply increased its offer for 21st Century Fox on Wednesday, as it looks to win a bidding war with Comcast for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s entertainment conglomerate.The Comcast chief executive, Brian L. Roberts, is equally motivated to reach an agreement with Mr. Murdoch, who has spent a lifetime forging a media empire that spans three continents, including Hollywood studios, cable networks and streaming businesses.But Disney has the pole position for now. \u201cWe remain convinced that the combination of 21CF\u2019s iconic assets, brands and franchises with Disney\u2019s will create one of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world,\u201d Mr. Murdoch said in the statement.Comcast declined to comment.At stake in this bidding war is the 20th Century Fox film studio, the FX and National Geographic cable channels, almost two dozen regional sports networks, and a large stake in a pair of sought-after international media businesses: the European pay-TV operator Sky and Star India. Not included in the sale are Fox News, the Fox broadcast network, a chain of local television stations and the FS1 sports network.Separately, Comcast is bidding against Fox for the 61 percent of Sky not already owned by Fox.Fox\u2019s robust foreign assets are a central reason Comcast and Disney are pursuing a deal as they, like other media companies, grapple with a challenge to their cornerstone business: the loss of cable and satellite customers.Gaining Fox\u2019s assets would also give the winner control over the streaming service Hulu, which added three million subscribers in the first four months of this year, for a total of 20 million. Selling TV shows directly to viewers is the latest strategy for media businesses under threat from Silicon Valley, where cash-rich behemoths like Netflix, Google and Amazon are competing for ad dollars and audiences.\u201cAt a time of dynamic change in the entertainment industry, the combination of Disney\u2019s and Fox\u2019s unparalleled collection of businesses and franchises will allow us to create more appealing high-quality content,\u201d Mr. Iger said in a statement.Disney\u2019s increased offer comprises an equal mix of cash and stock: $35.7 billion in cash and 343 million shares in Disney. Fox shareholders can elect to receive either $38 in cash for every Fox share or Disney stock at an equivalent value. Disney plans to offer a ratio of its shares for every Fox share to make sure investors receive a value of $38 per share, what is known as a collar.Fox has postponed its scheduled July 10 shareholder vote so that investors will have time to consider the new bid. A new date has not been set.Mr. Iger disagreed with the notion that the AT&T ruling had paved the way for other big mergers. \u201cIt\u2019s just simply an apples-to-oranges comparison,\u201d he said on a call with analysts Wednesday, citing Judge Richard J. Leon\u2019s warning that any attempt to apply his decision to future deals should be avoided.And Comcast apparently does not have the fondest feelings for Disney: The Jurassic Park rides at the company\u2019s Universal theme parks include Disney\u2019s famous mouse-ears hat floating in the water next to a raft that a dinosaur has destroyed.\u201cHe essentially didn\u2019t want to be known as the guy who destroyed Disney,\u201d Mr. Wieser added. \u201cThere\u2019s something to the idea that you don\u2019t leave it in a bad place.\u201dMr. Iger\u2019s latest maneuver puts Mr. Roberts on his back foot. The leader of Comcast has big ambitions to seal his family's legacy. His father started the company in 1963 and transformed it from a small cable service in Tupelo, Miss., into the nation\u2019s largest cable provider, with nearly 30 million subscribers.Mr. Roberts has handed operational duties to his executives \u2014 Stephen B. Burke leads NBCUniversal group and David N. Watson runs the cable business \u2014 as he spends most of his time analyzing acquisitions, several people familiar with him have said. In other words, mergers are his specialty.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised by another potentially compelling response from Comcast,\u201d said Tuna Amobi, a research analyst with CFRA, raising concerns of a \u201cprotracted bidding war.\u201dA revised bid would mean more borrowing for Comcast. Both the Fox and separate Sky deals would mean assuming the debt of each company in addition to the extra borrowing, a sum that would total $170 billion, according to credit ratings firm Moody\u2019s.Disney also counts a steep debt load at about $25 billion, which does not include its latest offer of $35.7 billion in cash and an assumption of nearly $14 billion of Fox\u2019s debt.Analysts have bruited about the notion that Comcast and Disney might team up and divide Fox\u2019s assets to prevent a drawn-out bidding war \u2014 a turn of events that Mr. Iger has dismissed. \u201cWe have an agreement in place with 21st Century Fox that precludes that from occurring,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

You\u2019ve got these testosterone-spraying serious bikers \u2014 \u201d\u201c \u2014 The Screaming Lycra-Legged Mad Men!\u201d the alien interrupted, excitedly. \u201cIt is said they grab infants from the arms of the mothers who dare impinge upon the path and heave them into the Hudson.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s galactic legend,\u201d I said. \u201cNew York mothers do not carry infants; fathers do in order to score sensitivity points. You see it a lot Sunday mornings, when they do bagel runs. Let\u2019s get back to the Greenway bike path. Where were we?\u201d\u201cThe Screaming Lycra-Legged Mad Men,\u201d the alien said. \u201cBut what is testosterone?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a substance manufactured in the bodies of men \u2014 those earth creatures who have just one of the three things you have \u2014 which allows them to rise to the top of their professions even when women are better qualified,\u201d I said. \u201cIt also makes them aggressive. This is why you hear Lycra-Legged Mad Men screaming at people. But they generally do not get off the bike and slug it out. It slows down their time. It\u2019s when they crash into someone you\u2019ll see fights.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the alien said. \u201cI have seen some memorable bouts between Thermal Pack Carriers of Foodstuffs and the Lycra-Legged. Their expletives were extraordinarily foul. We would print them in one of our own newspapers, but our culture is more advanced. The Lycra-Legged Mad Men and the Thermal Pack Carriers are natural enemies are they not?\u201d\u201cWe call them food delivery guys,\u201d I said. \u201cThey have to be fast so they use electric bikes and ignore one-way street signs and stop lights. We fear them more than Scooter Brats, those squat creatures who dart at our ankles like insects but which, unlike insects, we are forbidden to swat.\u201d\u201cWe know the Scooter Brats well,\u201d the alien said. \u201cI made some major money in a side bet involving a Scooter Brat and a Lycra-Legged Screamer. The Screamer was approaching warp speed south of the boat basin when a Scooter Brat flashed out of the playground. The Lycra-Legged Screamer swerved, clipped a nun on a Unicycle and was impaled on a selfie stick. I\u2019ve got in on my phone, want to see?\u201d\u201cIf we can get back to the cement barriers,\u201d I said.\u201cI\u2019m all ears,\u201d the alien said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t freak you out anymore, does it?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI was just surprised to find so many on your shoulders. But now that I know I don\u2019t have to blow in every one of them I\u2019m cool. O.K., some history: the cement barriers were put up on the bike path last fall, after a terrorist drove a pickup truck onto the path, killing eight people. It was horrible. The idea was that if we put up barriers that could never happen again.\u201d\u201cBut many of the barricades are in the middle of the path, not the sides,\u201d the alien said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that severely minimize the space?\u201d\u201cYes, it does,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a little scary, especially when a Lycra-Leg comes racing through. If you fall, you hit a cement wall. But what choice do we have? Take down the barriers just so we can have a relaxed ride alongside a beautiful park? What kind of message does that send our enemies? Anyway, from an entertainment point of view, the barriers have made the conflicts on the path more entertaining and ferocious.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d the alien said. \u201cThat stretch where the ocean liners dock and you have the Debarking Wheelie Baggers, the Clueless Tourists, and the Lycra-Legged \u2014 our sports bars are packed when those ships come in. I bet I kick back a dozen Tide Pod shots.\u201d\u201cYou drink those?\u201d I said.\u201cWhat do you think I have all those ears for?\u201d the alien said.\u201cGot it,\u201d I said. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019ve been wondering. There are so many bikers on the Greenway, why did you choose me to ask about the barriers?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the way you wobble when you ride,\u201d the alien said. \u201cNobody in New York City wobbles as much as you. That\u2019s the sign of a superior biker, is it not?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Tries to Thread the Needle With New Fox Bid", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s no change to what Disney would acquire. It would take control of the 20th Century Fox movie and television studios, cable channels like National Geographic and FX, 22 regional sports networks, a 30 percent stake in the online video platform Hulu, 39 percent of the European satellite broadcaster Sky and control of the Indian broadcaster Star.(The Murdochs would keep Fox News, the Fox broadcast networks and the national sports networks FS1 and FS2.)\u201cThis reflects our continued belief in the strategic rationale of this transaction,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday.The higher overall bid is notable. But the way it\u2019s structured might be even more important.Adding a cash component to the bid is a response to Comcast\u2019s all-cash offer. It is meant to appeal to Fox shareholders, who simply want to be paid out now, rather than betting on the performance of Disney shares in the future.But the Murdoch family is in a different position.Receiving cash would expose it to a big tax bill, since Rupert Murdoch created the company and has enjoyed an enormous rise in the value of his holdings. And Mr. Murdoch does want in on the future: He has said that he thinks combining the Fox businesses with Disney would yield a media colossus that could take on streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.The option of still being paid in Disney stock appears to have been crucial in keeping the support of the Murdochs, as shown by Fox\u2019s board signing onto the new offer. But the family represents only 17 percent of the shares that can be voted in this deal, so other investors will have to feel comfortable with it as well.\u25a0 Shares in Fox were up 6.4 percent in early morning trading, at $47.57. Shareholders could be betting that the battle between Disney and Comcast is far from over.\u25a0 Disney\u2019s stock was up 1 percent in early morning trading, at $107.26, as investors may believe that the sweetened bid is financially sustainable.\u25a0 And Comcast\u2019s shares were up 0.7 percent, at $33.04. That\u2019s perhaps because of a hope that the company would walk away from an increasingly expensive bidding war.Disney executives could raise their bid even higher if necessary. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Christine McCarthy, told analysts that the company was financing the entire cash portion of the new offer through borrowed money and asserted that its balance sheet remained healthy despite the extra debt.Fox and Disney will reschedule votes on Disney\u2019s takeover bid, which was originally set for July 10. That still gives Comcast time to consider its options \u2014 and Disney time to prepare another counterpunch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In HBO\u2019s \u2018Succession,\u2019 the Family That Preys Together", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhich is interesting, or at least odd, because \u201cSuccession\u201d is primarily a straightforward family-dynasty melodrama, wrapped in chilly but ostentatious displays of wealth and favoring overheated profanity as a communication method. The balance shifts away from satire and toward drama as the season progresses, but even well into the season \u2014 when one of the Roys conducts a family-business therapy retreat, ostensibly to heal the wounds of corporate battle but really to repair the company\u2019s image \u2014 the Bluthian impulse is strong.It might be an indication of where the show\u2019s heart, or commercial instincts, truly lie that the cast, which performs admirably, is made up of performers who are not primarily known for comedy. Brian Cox is predictably fine as the patriarch, Logan Roy, whose absent-minded benevolence is often swamped by deep tides of anger and hurt pride.Jeremy Strong and Kieran Culkin do good work as the sons who fight for power within Waystar Royco while hungering for their father\u2019s approval, as does Sarah Snook as their sister, a political consultant who watches from the sidelines. The distinguished Arab-Israeli actress Hiam Abbass provides some gravity as their stepmother, Roy\u2019s apparently loyal wife, who will almost certainly turn out to have her own agenda.These actors carry the water in the main story line, where Kendall (Mr. Strong), the older brother, tries to bring the company into the digital age (and stay sober) despite his father\u2019s conservatism. It\u2019s a struggle that turns bloody, and requires the taking of sides, when Roy\u2019s health issues present Kendall with a chance to shake things up.Meanwhile, a second set of performers, in their own connected but distinct plots, provide the comic relief: Alan Ruck as the oldest sibling, son of Roy\u2019s first wife, who makes a show of staying out of the business while sticking his nose in wherever he can; Nicholas Braun as a bumpkin cousin who stumbles into a role at the company; and especially Matthew Macfadyen as the sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9, a feckless suck-up out of a Waugh novel who\u2019s Mr. Armstrong\u2019s most original creation.But the Roys\u2019 battles over board seats, trusts and emotional codependence are meant to be taken seriously, and the problem with \u201cSuccession\u201d is that the drama, while proficiently made and well acted, doesn\u2019t have enough of a charge. The stakes don\u2019t feel high enough, partly because the strong element of satire leaves us with the nagging feeling that everyone involved (except Logan) is a lightweight or an idiot. The Roys are halfway between the Bluths and the Corleones, which, as it turns out, isn\u2019t that interesting a place to be.Advertisement"}

The result was \u201cSex and the City\u201d meets \u201cThe First Wives Club,\u201d a sharp dramedy about multiple divorces and how they ripple outward, affecting other relationships within a privileged California community.\u201cGetting this role at the age of then 48, playing a woman who is having fun with a variety of men, is drinking way too much, eating way too little, is going through menopause in couture gowns and all the while trying to find a career and raise her kids [was] a gold mine,\u201d Ms. Edelstein, now 52, said.\u201cWe have all the \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 shows to thank for our fabulous wardrobe,\u201d she added. \u201cThe one thing we had to make sure of was that the show looked as \u2018Bravolicious\u2019 as the rest of them.\u201dIn a recent phone conversation, Ms. Edelstein talked about why \u201cGirlfriends\u2019 Guide\u201d resonated with its fans, what it did for her and whether Abby\u2019s story will have a happy ending. These are edited excerpts from the interview.There really wasn\u2019t anything like \u201cGirlfriends\u2019 Guide.\u201d It felt like \u201cThe First Wives Club\u201d but more family-oriented.It\u2019s a true dramedy. We get big laughs; we get really raw. That\u2019s the incredible fun of it. By the way, there\u2019s not even a category for it in the Emmys. According to the Academy of Television you can\u2019t be a comedy if you are an hour long. So annoying! So we compete with \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dHow did the show affect you on a personal level?The show was notably frank in its depiction of divorce. Did you get the sense that it resonated with people?It\u2019s true, people really take this show personally. It\u2019s not just a show: It\u2019s medicine somehow, and it\u2019s a mirror of their own struggles, albeit with amazing clothes and ridiculous shoes. I have heard from so many people who used it to cry and laugh their way through their own relationship and life woes. It\u2019s pretty great to know that your job means that much to some people. There were plenty of moments within the life of the show that people have told me directly mirrored their experiences. It was so personal to Marti, that is not surprising. No matter where you live, some experiences are just universal.How did her experiences get reflected in the show?I believe it was her personal need to talk about all the \u201cfeels\u201d she was having post-divorce that drove this show into existence. Once she met Vicki Iovine [who divorced the music mogul Jimmy Iovine in 2009] and heard her story, she had her character\u2019s inspiration.How do you think Abby has grown?Poor Abby! So much of who she thought she was, was just attachment to outside ideas. Little by little, over the five seasons of our show, through struggle and plenty of wrong \u2014 read: hilarious! \u2014 moves, Abby has found the right path for her, minus the expectations.Will all of her exes end up in the final season? I don\u2019t think so. Some of them, maybe.Will Abby and Jake\u2019s relationship be resolved?There is a beautiful Jake and Abby episode at the end of the season. I love where it went. I love working with Paul [Adelstein]. I think every character gets his or her story at least pointed in a hopeful and satisfying direction by show\u2019s end, but we are not a fairy tale, and we don\u2019t want to spin fantasy yarns. We want to tell stories people see their lives reflected in and, well, nothing is perfect.Will Abby get a happy ending?Because we as a show knew we were ending at the end of Season 5, the writers really got to write a satisfying conclusion. \u201cHappy\u201d isn\u2019t really a goal; it\u2019s a side effect. But I think we leave Abby on a path that feels good and feels more solid \u2026 at least for the moment.Is \u201cGirlfriends\u2019 Guide\u201d ending at the right time?I wish all shows knew when they were ending. It makes the writing stronger and the performances more focused. That said, there are plenty more stories to tell about divorce; we only barely skim the surface of stepparenting, for example, in Season 5. And the show was a dream come true for me, getting to play the lead role, getting to act my face off and make people laugh, and getting to write and direct. Is it ever time to end that? No, but I consider it one of the best experiences, work-wise, I\u2019ve ever had.Advertisement"}

I don\u2019t try to make people cry any more.\u201dRead \u201cA Night Out With Anthony Bourdain\u201dFor one of T Magazine\u2019s famous illustrated interviews, Bourdain sketched a quick, funny caricature of himself \u2014 and said that the one food he would never touch was a cheeseburger from Johnny Rockets.Read The Illustrated Interview: Anthony BourdainIn a 2017 \u201cBy the Book\u201d column, Bourdain confessed that the best book about food that he has ever read was A.J. Liebling\u2019s \u201cBetween Meals,\u201d a \u201cmemoir of meals in Paris before and after the war. He described Liebling as \u201can enthusiastic lover of food and wine, very knowledgeable but never a snob.\u201d And he called the book \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cthe benchmark for great food writing.\u201dRead \u201cAnthony Bourdain: By the Book\u201dIn a lengthy 2017 profile of Bourdain in The New Yorker, fellow chef Eric Ripert told the magazine that he thought Bourdain was driven, at least in part, \u201c\u2018by a fear of what he might get up to if he ever stopped working.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a guy who needs a lot of projects,\u2019 Bourdain acknowledged. \u2018I would probably have been happy as an air-traffic controller.\u2019\u201dRead \u201cAnthony Bourdain\u2019s Moveable Feast\u201dIn her review of \u201cBone in the Throat,\u201d Bourdain\u2019s first novel, The Times crime columnist Marilyn Stasio, wrote, \u201cThe author\u2019s comic vision goes beyond original. It is deliciously depraved.\u201dRead the review.Of the book that put Bourdain on the map \u2014 a no-holds-barred look at how a restaurant kitchen really works \u2014 The Times wrote, \u201cIn a style partaking of Hunter S. Thompson, Iggy Pop and a little Jonathan Swift, Bourdain gleefully rips through the scenery to reveal private backstage horrors little dreamed of by the trusting public.\u201dBourdain sat down with Fresh Air\u2019s Dave Davies in 2016 for a wide-ranging interview in which he admitted, \u201cWhen I cook at home it\u2019s with a 9-year-old girl in mind. I mean, she\u2019s who I need to please, and if she\u2019s not happy, I\u2019m not happy.\u201dListen to the interview.Bourdain, fellow chef Danny Bowien and The Times\u2019s Kim Severson spent a lively hour discussing global food waste in a Times Talk.Watch the interview.Bourdain\u2019s travel and food show, currently in its 11th season on CNN, has been a cultural force since its inception, winning five Emmys and a Peabody Award so far. (Eight seasons are available right now on Netflix.) The series uses food as an entryway to nuanced conversations with people across the world about their politics, their daily lives, their hopes and fears, and there is seemingly nowhere \u201cParts\u201d hasn\u2019t explored \u2014 including Myanmar in the early 2010s, as well as countries and regions like Gaza and the West Bank and Iran, offering local perspectives rarely seen on Western TV. The show\u2019s punk stylings, the obvious delight Bourdain takes in eating with Michelin star chefs and roadside food vendors alike, and the show\u2019s diverse array of special guests (President Barack Obama, Iggy Pop and the director Darren Aronofsky are just a few) combine to make \u201cParts\u201d a thoughtful and exciting world tour.\u201cNo Reservations\u201d is where Bourdain\u2019s TV career really took off. The show debuted on the Travel Channel in 2005, showcasing Bourdain\u2019s signature curiosity, swagger and lyricism. As food- and travel-blogging exploded, \u201cNo Reservations\u201d became the gold standard for thoughtful adventure \u2014 and because the Travel Channel felt awfully obscure, the show sometimes felt like a hip secret. That secret got out in 2006, when Bourdain and his crew got stuck in Beirut during an armed conflict; that episode is among the show\u2019s most interesting because it\u2019s the exact opposite of other lifestyle shows. \u201cNo Reservations\u201d went on to 12 Emmy nominations (and two wins). The show is available for purchase on Amazon.Bourdain produced and narrated this brainier, more personal approach to the shameless pleasures of food porn. Still, he kept himself mostly out of the spotlight, training it instead on a rotating cast of Michelin-approved chefs and restaurateurs as they explained their relationships to specific foods or regions. In one installment, the Momofuku mastermind David Chang effuses about his lifelong passion for ramen; in another, the British virtuoso April Bloomfield gives a survey of bangers and mash. It\u2019s a light and positive celebration of food and culture \u2014 a departure from the quick-cut chaos of such crowd-pleasers as \u201cIron Chef\u201d or \u201cChopped\u201d \u2014 with fresh insights from authoritative and camera-friendly personalities. The show ran for five seasons on BBC and PBS, which are all available on Netflix. (A sixth aired last year on Facebook Watch.)Bourdain was someone everyone wanted to eat with \u2014 knowing his enthusiasm could get them into restaurants, and to experience food, they otherwise never would. This was best shown in 2016, when the White House asked if President Barack Obama could eat with him during an official visit to Vietnam.Bourdain was candid about past drug use, which included cocaine and heroin. He was also unafraid to discuss drugs in his TV show. In this clip from an episode of \u201cParts Unknown\u201d in Morocco he learned Moroccans make hashish-containing sweets.\u201cOf course network standards and practices prohibit me from even tasting this delicious and reportedly mind-altering treat,\u201d he said.\u201cAn irony free zone where everything is beautiful and nothing hurts,\u201d is how Mr. Bourdain describes the Waffle House. \u201cWhere everybody regardless of race, creed, color or degree of inebriation is welcome.\u201dBourdain was so associated with globe-trotting it is easy to forget his love of the United States\u2019 own cuisine, and it comes across fully in this ode to a waffle house. It is \u201ca beacon of hope and salvation inviting the hungry, the lost, the seriously hammered, all across the South to come inside,\u201d he added.\u201cParts Unknown\u201d often felt like a commentary on foreign policy. In this episode in Iran, for instance, Bourdain experiences the country\u2019s hospitality in full force by eating in a family home.It is \u201ca very hopeful place, filled with yearning, where people every day, particularly women I think, are in very small ways testing the limits of what is permissible, trying to define in fits and starts who they want to be as a country,\u201d he said.Charles Bramesco, Margaret Lyons, Alex Marshall and Eleanor Stanford contributed reporting.An earlier version incorrectly referred to Charleston, S.C. as what Mr. Bourdain called \"an irony free zone.\" He was referring to the Waffle House.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Staircase\u2019 on Netflix Revisits a Genre-Defining Trial", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome Netflix subscribers who stumble across \u201cThe Staircase\u201d might wonder if it was influenced by \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d \u201cThe Jinx\u201d or \u201cThe Keepers,\u201d which are just a few of the multipart crime documentaries that have captured the public\u2019s attention in recent years.Actually, it\u2019s the other way around. \u201cThe Staircase,\u201d which debuted in America in 2005 and gets an update Friday on Netflix, helped create the modern template for true-crime TV, a booming subgenre that shows no signs of slowing down (and even generated its own pitch-perfect parody, Netflix\u2019s \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d).Some of the influence is aesthetic. As is the case with \u201cThe Keepers\u201d or \u201cO.J.: Made in America,\u201d \u201cThe Staircase\u201d is deliberate and quietly observational; it never relies on an exploitative tone or a prurient approach to achieve its goals.This version of \u201cThe Staircase\u201d is both old and new. It chronicles the years of legal travails that followed the death of the telecom executive Kathleen Peterson, who met her end in late 2001 at the bottom of a set of stairs in her well-appointed home in Durham, N.C. Her novelist husband, Michael Peterson, was charged with her murder. The compulsively binge-able 13-part Netflix series is a collection of three different stages of the tale: The original eight-part series tracking the case and trial, which aired on SundanceTV in 2005; a two-part update from 2013; and three new episodes produced for Netflix.The final installment does indeed wrap up the legal aspects of the story. But the knotty, ambiguous elements of \u201cThe Staircase,\u201d which clearly influenced many later crime documentaries and were even mined by a number of scripted dramas, are likely to linger in the viewer\u2019s mind.The question of whether Ms. Peterson\u2019s death was the result of a murder or a horrible accident is unlikely to ever be settled to the satisfaction of everyone connected to the case. Her sisters, a small but vocal part of the documentary, make it clear they think she was killed. Four of her family\u2019s children stuck by Mr. Peterson through many dark days, but Ms. Peterson\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage sat on the prosecution\u2019s side of the courtroom.Which faction is right? \u201cThe Staircase,\u201d which focuses on whether Mr. Peterson was treated fairly by the legal system, doesn\u2019t answer that question. In the show\u2019s press kit, Mr. de Lestrade says, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I know more about Michael Peterson than the first day I met him.\u201d Viewers may end up feeling the same way, even as they willingly travel down the rabbit hole of the stranger-than-fiction Peterson case.Mr. Peterson had far more money and resources than that defendant, but he had also been a newspaper columnist who had needled Durham politicians and prosecutors. It also emerged that he is bisexual, a fact prosecutors relentlessly used to imply that he could not be trusted, not just as a spouse but as a human being. Without going into details that would spoil key aspects of the show, other elements of the prosecution proved even more problematic. As one lawyer says late in the season, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty devastating to see what can pass for science and justice in a courtroom.\u201dDespite Mr. de Lestrade\u2019s compassionate approach, there are gruesome elements, and in lesser hands, \u201cThe Staircase\u201d could have been a vehicle for crude voyeurism. Instead, the series is infused by a sense of intelligent curiosity and unforced immediacy. One expects to hear Mr. Peterson\u2019s 911 call and to see late-night conferences among fatigued lawyers, but Mr. de Lestrade also follows family members as they visit Ms. Peterson\u2019s grave, throw birthday parties or simply stare into space after the latest devastating setback.There\u2019s an element of luck at play \u2014 there\u2019s no way Mr. de Lestrade could have seen some of the case\u2019s most jaw-dropping twists coming \u2014 but he deftly folds even the most shocking developments into measured episodes that rarely wander or overstay their welcomes. And despite the grief at its heart, \u201cThe Staircase\u201d never lapses into grimness or plodding pessimism. People laugh and make dark jokes, and Mr. de Lestrade allows quiet moments to breathe. His outdoor compositions are particularly evocative; a scene in which a woman detaches rose petals from a stem as she stands over a grave is both gorgeous and elegiac.Mr. Peterson is generally affable and chatty, however badly things are going, and sometimes he puffs on a pipe or sips red wine as he discusses various bizarre and humbling situations. His lawyer, David Rudolf, is every bit his talkative match, combining a competitive drive with a very human sense of exhaustion and frustration as the case grinds on.The most stealthy and welcome twist of the last third of \u201cThe Staircase\u201d is how it turns into the story of Martha Ratliff and her sister, Margaret Blakemore (formerly Ratliff), whose entire adult lives have been shaped by this strange, overwhelming story. After their parents passed away when they were very young (and the eerie circumstances of their mother\u2019s death figures into the narrative of \u201cThe Staircase\u201d), the Ratliffs were adopted by Mr. Peterson, and once they became part of a blended family that included his two sons and Ms. Peterson\u2019s daughter, Ms. Ratliff and Ms. Blakemore called them Mom and Dad.The sisters weren\u2019t long out of high school when the saga began; over the ensuing 17 years, they\u2019ve spend countless hours in courtrooms, watching almost every moment of testimony and sometimes silently crying on each other\u2019s shoulders. Whether or not Mr. Peterson is guilty, everyone around him paid a price, and the suffering and resilience of these women, tragic upon first viewing in 2005, now comes off as inspirational without being cloying (Mr. de Lestrade doesn\u2019t do sappy).The sisters lost not one family, but two, and came back from an unfathomable series of tragedies to build what appear to be meaningful lives. The bleak indictment of \u201cThe Staircase\u201d on North Carolina\u2019s legal system is more than offset by the sisters\u2019 unrelenting devotion to their family \u2014 and to each other.\u201cTrue crime\u201d is all the rage, perhaps in part because the label contains a trace of wish fulfillment, a suggestion that we can finally learn the truth of a tragedy if we only delve deeply enough into its details. What really happened in this case? I have my theories, but they\u2019re only that \u2014 imperfect conjectures. The only claim I can make with confidence is that \u201cThe Staircase,\u201d ruminative and humane to the end, remains one of the finest examples of this genre. With the right approach, a complicated whodunit can supply truths about the best and worst of the human condition, even when the \u201ctruth\u201d of the case is destined to remain beyond our grasp.Because of inaccurate information provided by Netflix, an earlier version of this review incorrectly described the relationship between the director Jean-Xavier de Lestrade and the team behind \u201cMaking a Murderer.\u201d Mr. de Lestrade met with a producer who later left the project; he did not meet with one of the creators.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Pity the Tech B-List", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsI spent most of the week at the Code Conference, where the tech world\u2019s elite gathered to discuss the current state of the tech industry. It was a fascinating event, less in the sense of newsy product announcements (which there weren\u2019t many of) and more in the general finger-in-the-wind sense of how the tech industry is thinking about itself.Notable at this year\u2019s Code was that there seems to be a growing rift between the largest tech companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 and the rest of the industry.The shadow of the big tech companies loomed large over the conference, even if their presence was minimal. No executives from Apple, Amazon or Google spoke at Code, and when executives from Microsoft and Facebook did take the stage, they mostly talked about the past. (Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, offered some historical perspective on the company\u2019s antitrust woes from the late 1990s; Sheryl Sandberg and Mike Schroepfer from Facebook did yet another rote recitation of the company\u2019s post-Cambridge Analytica \u201cwe\u2019ll do better\u201d script.)Instead, much of the stage time went to leaders of companies just outside the tech A-list \u2014 large, popular companies that in any other era would be considered enormous success stories, but that have spent years locked in a fight for survival against their bigger, more entrenched rivals.From the perspective of the tech B-list, there are two huge fights to be won. First, you need to establish a foothold in a market, either by out-innovating old-line incumbents \u2014 taxis, hotels, music labels \u2014 or by creating a new market altogether. Then, once you\u2019re established and growing, a bigger worry emerges: What if one of the Big Five squashes you?A good example of a tech B-lister is Spotify, which appears to be winning its battle with its biggest suppliers \u2014 the three labels that provide the vast majority of Spotify\u2019s music \u2014 but lives in perpetual danger of being steamrollered by a tech giant. Onstage at Code, Spotify\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Ek, fielded several questions about whether he worried about competitors like Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which have their own music streaming services and, more important, control the hardware platforms (iOS, Android, Alexa) on which people consume music.Mr. Ek mostly deflected, saying that there are \u201cvery, very few opportunities that a billion-plus people around the world care about,\u201d and that the giants\u2019 interest in music streaming showed the attractiveness of the category.Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, sounded a similar note at the conference when asked about Facebook\u2019s habit of blatantly copying Snapchat\u2019s most distinctive product features. (Mr. Spiegel\u2019s sassy comeback \u2014 \u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also\u201d \u2014 was the best line there.)\u201cWell, I believe if you don\u2019t create a pure, vertical, integrated capability, vertically integrated capability \u2014 from distribution all the way through content creation and advertising models \u2014 you\u2019re going to have a hard time competing with these guys. And the statistic we throw out, and since we announced this deal in November of 2016, the FANG market caps have gone up over $1 trillion. You better figure out how to vertically integrate here if you want to compete with those players.\u201dIt\u2019s not unusual to see small firms complaining about the difficulty of breaking into established markets. It\u2019s more unusual to see those complaints coming from the leader of a $200 billion telecom giant. And it shows just how dominant the tech A-list has become, and how difficult overcoming its concentration of market power is proving to be.Here are a few other tech stories of note this past week:Advertisement"}

Your Move, Mr. Trump.", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWang Yi, China\u2019s top diplomat, on Thursday warned Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, not to take a choice that would involve \u201cconfrontation and mutual loss.\u201dSkeptics worry that a telecom company focused on justifying every penny will impede the creativity of a media darling where producers, writers and actors are sacred. They could be right. But the stakes are high for AT&T, as Netflix continues to close in on HBO\u2019s position as the king of the content hill.

Populists have taken power in Italy, posing a new threat to the euro. Growth is sluggish, and there is even talk of another banking crisis. It would not seem the ideal time to put the brakes on Europe\u2019s economy.The fate of that deal has been hanging in the balance for at least 18 months. Eight other nations have waved it through. But China has held out, using it as a bargaining chip in its trade standoff with the U.S., and particularly to help ensure that the White House relaxes penalties on the Chinese telecom company ZTE.But Mr. Hinman added that securities regulations are \u201cimportant safeguards, and they are appropriate for most I.C.O.s.\u201d What\u2019s the difference?

With such a dramatic decline, the chances of challengers graduating to the next stage and eventually taking on the incumbents is inevitably reduced.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Decision Shows Need to Rethink Antitrust Laws", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThere had not been a federal court ruling on a vertical merger \u2014 a combination of a buyer and a supplier \u2014 since 1979. As a result, Judge Leon\u2019s opinion, which cleared the way for the merger of AT&T and Time Warner, \u201cwill be enormously significant,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an influential antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cTo a significant extent, this court was writing on a clean slate.\u201dJudge Leon himself cited a \u201cdearth\u201d of modern judicial precedent.For many antitrust experts, it was high time \u2014 no matter the outcome.When it comes to vertical mergers like AT&T and Time Warner, \u201cantitrust law is stuck in the 1980s,\u201d said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School who has called for more vigorous antitrust enforcement against vertical mergers.The last time the government brought such a case was in 1979. The Federal Trade Commission challenged the merger of Fruehauf, then the country\u2019s largest manufacturer of truck trailers, and Kelsey-Hayes, which made truck components like heavy-duty wheels and antiskid brakes. The government lost.Credit for the lack of such cases goes largely to Robert H. Bork.Mr. Bork is best known as the solicitor general who fired the Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox and as a doomed Supreme Court nominee, not as an antitrust trailblazer.The Clayton Antitrust Act, which dates to 1914, bans mergers that may \u201csubstantially lessen\u201d competition or \u201ctend to create a monopoly.\u201d It makes no distinction between vertical mergers and horizontal ones, in which a company buys a rival, thereby reducing the number of competitors in an industry. But in large part thanks to Mr. Bork\u2019s analysis, horizontal mergers continue to receive intense scrutiny from the federal government, while most vertical mergers go forward, albeit often with conditions.From the publication of \u201cThe Antitrust Paradox\u201d through 2016, the government has challenged only 52 of the thousands of vertical mergers, and many of those challenges were focused on horizontal aspects of the deals. None of those cases went to trial. Most were resolved through consent decrees, including Comcast\u2019s 2009 bid for NBCUniversal, which went forward after Comcast and the government agreed to a long list of restrictions on the combined company\u2019s behavior.The Justice Department last rewrote its vertical merger guidelines in 1984. (The horizontal guidelines have been revised three times since then.) The department largely embraced Mr. Bork\u2019s logic.But over the ensuing decades, more antitrust experts have questioned Mr. Bork\u2019s laissez-faire approach to vertical merger enforcement, especially in cases involving media and intellectual property.The most immediate impacts of the ruling on Tuesday are the removal of an obstacle to a megamerger and the likely bursting of a dam of mergers that were waiting the decision.But the most important aspect of Judge Leon\u2019s opinion is that it essentially embraces the Bork approach, which rested on a few premises: that markets are inherently competitive; that a firm\u2019s dominance in one market cannot be leveraged into another; and that market success is a result of maximizing consumer welfare, not anti-competitive behavior. The theory is that vertical mergers produce efficiencies that can be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, higher quality or both.Not surprisingly, AT&T argued in court that it had no incentive to withhold Time Warner\u2019s programming from other distributors, that consumers would derive many benefits from the merger and that the combined companies would be in a better position to compete with upstarts like Amazon and Netflix, which already are vertically integrated.This analysis may still hold true for mergers of essentially fungible components, like the truck beds and brakes at issue in the Fruehauf case.But it\u2019s not clear that logic holds in a case like AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner. Not only does AT&T occupy a dominant position in a highly concentrated telecommunications market, but Time Warner product\u2019s \u2014 like HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN \u2014 aren\u2019t at all fungible. If AT&T wants to withhold \u201cmust have\u201d programming from a rival telecom company, or charge more for it, that company cannot readily replace it. That was the crux of the government\u2019s case \u2014 that vertical mergers, at least in this context, can reduce competition and harm consumers.\u201cThe big question was whether Judge Leon would accept where academics and economists have gone with this, or whether he\u2019d stick with the old approach,\u201d said Mr. Wu, the Columbia law professor, who is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.Although Mr. Bork\u2019s fingerprints are all over the opinion, Judge Leon departed from Mr. Bork\u2019s doctrine by acknowledging that vertical mergers \u201care not invariably innocuous.\u201dBut the emergence of competitors like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu loomed large in his analysis. \u201cI simply cannot evaluate the government\u2019s theories,\u201d he wrote in his opinion, without considering \u201cthe dramatic changes that are transforming how consumers are viewing video content.\u201dNo matter the outcome if the decision is appealed, the Justice Department \u201cis going to have to update the vertical merger guidelines,\u201d said Steven C. Salop, professor of law and economics at Georgetown University Law Center.Using that approach, the AT&T-Time Warner merger should have been blocked, he contends. Judge Leon\u2019s opinion in many ways embraced Professor Salop\u2019s approach \u2014 and cited him in the opinion \u2014 while reaching the opposite result.Mr. Hovenkamp, of the University of Pennsylvania, argues that it\u2019s not wise or appropriate to view antitrust cases through the prism of a pre-internet, pre-broadband age. That\u2019s especially true when the stakes include principles like consumers\u2019 ability to engage in (or at least watch on TV) a free exchange of ideas.\u201cAntitrust is only a piece of this,\u201d Mr. Hovenkamp said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never roll back the clock,\u201d he added, to an era when \u201cthe phone companies and most cable companies had nothing to do with media.\u201d\u201cNow everyone thinks they have to be fully integrated to keep up,\u201d he continued. \u201cI feel uncomfortable with that both for antitrust and First Amendment reasons.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Investors Aren\u2019t Spooked by Cracks in the International Economic Order", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s policies are straining the international trading system that for decades has helped corporate America reap increasing profits. So why is the stock market moving higher, while relations between the United States and its largest trading partners are deteriorating?The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up on Monday, the first day of trading after Mr. Trump\u2019s pugnacious stance rattled the summit meeting of the Group of 7 nations that was held over the weekend.The calm makes some sense. Investors think that trade skirmishes could be outweighed by two major reasons to be bullish.First, economic growth in the United States, which has been relatively strong for some time, may now pick up even more. Recent tax cuts might encourage businesses and consumers to spend more. Wall Street analysts expect profits of the companies in the S.&P. 500 index to surge by 26 percent this year, which is a remarkable amount. And companies with top-performing stocks, such as Netflix and Microsoft, sell products and services that are unlikely to be the direct target of hostile trade actions.Second, when Wall Street analysts do drill down to try to discern the impact of specific tariffs on companies, their conclusions are not that worrisome. Take Mr. Trump\u2019s levies on steel and aluminum, which are now in effect. These have enraged other countries and will no doubt push up costs for many United States companies that use the metals. But the overall impact on corporate earnings might be muted.The stock prices of Ford and General Motors \u2014 two companies that should be hurting from the rising metal prices \u2014 have risen since mid-February, when it became clear that the Trump administration was intent on imposing its metals tariffs.Mr. Trump, of course, is threatening more than just metals tariffs. On Friday, the United States is scheduled to release its final list of products from China that will be covered by a further $50 billion of tariffs. The Trump administration said it would impose the tariffs soon afterward. China has threatened to retaliate.Yet investors, even though they know a trade war is looming, have not dumped stocks in some of the companies that look particularly vulnerable. Computer chip makers like Qualcomm have a large proportion of their sales in China, but Qualcomm\u2019s stock has recently rallied.Investors may be less bullish about the overall market than they look. The S.&P. 500 is up only 2 percent since mid-February, when the recent trade tensions began in earnest \u2014 and that small increase has relied heavily on a rally in technology stocks. If it wasn\u2019t for concerns over trade, Wall Street\u2019s recently upgraded earnings expectations might have pushed stocks to much higher levels than they are at right now.The imposition of $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods is likely to lead to some rocky days for the stock market. But unless investors believe that profits are going to get whacked, they appear willing to tolerate Mr. Trump\u2019s trade measures.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stay or Go? Two Puerto Ricans on the Choices They Made", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Atlantic hurricane season is underway. Many people in Puerto Rico and the rest of the Caribbean are still suffering, nine months after Hurricane Maria devastated their homes. We asked two colleagues from Puerto Rico to reflect on the decision to leave or stay.We\u2019d like to hear from readers who have had to make that choice: How were you affected by the storms? What choices did you make? What factors did you consider?By Charo Henr\u00edquezI confess I\u2019m terrible at goodbyes.I have always been that person at social gatherings that is either one of the last to leave or the one that disappears, just to avoid saying goodbye. But three years ago I decided to leave, not a party, but my home.Moving to New York from Puerto Rico was never part of my plan, at least not in the way some people visualize themselves leaving as the endgame to some master life plan. In my case, family and career prospects aligned at a time when the island\u2019s economic situation had begun to get progressively worse and it became clear that it wasn\u2019t going to get better anytime soon. So I joined the \u201cbrain drain\u201d \u2014 the diaspora of Puerto Ricans with the means and professional prospects to start somewhere else.I adjusted to new routines. I learned to find comfort in places and people that reminded me of home, and I kept connected to my family and friends through lengthy video and group chats.I went back for a high school reunion in August. There were many conversations about people having left or those planning to leave, but my visit left me with a happy sense of nostalgia.Then Hurricane Maria hit in September.Hurricanes are a part of life on the island. From the first day of June until the last day of November, there is a general awareness that you need to be prepared for a storm. Still, there was nothing that could have prepared us, inside and outside of Puerto Rico, for what happened.Watching this monster pummel the island from afar, while not being able to communicate, was devastating. For those of us who left, our contact was lost, our lifelines were gone.With too much information and enormous guilt, the only way not to feel helpless was to find things to do for the island. But was that enough? How could it be enough? We left. We weren\u2019t there when it happened. Could we do more from here than there?To say that Puerto Rico is a complicated place is an understatement. Our political, economic, cultural and social situations, historic and current, have made us hard to be understood and even harder to explain. We feel too close to our Latin American roots to be completely a part of the United States, but we are American citizens nonetheless.That predicament, along with a new set of concerns over how this crisis was managed, left us in the diaspora feeling a very lonely type of trauma. We couldn\u2019t seek comfort in friends and family who were actually there. We couldn\u2019t talk about the anxiety, the hurt and the overwhelming sense of failure we felt for not having been there, not done enough.The first time I went back home after Maria was in January. Enough time had gone by that nature had replenished itself, but not enough for things to feel back to normal. It was beautiful to see the people I love, but talking to them I could hear their struggles and the hardships they went through during those first days, weeks and months after Maria. As I listened to the stories of friends and family, I felt the lump in my throat and the guilt wash over me again. Why wasn\u2019t I there? Is this their new normal? How is this normal?The arrival of hurricane season brings wonder and worry about what\u2019s to come.I left because sometimes you have to. I left because I like to think doing things and going places where you represent your homeland is a way to metaphorically grow that piece of land beyond its natural borders.I left because maybe my voice can reach farther here and my words will always carry home. I left because maybe I can help make things better from here, much more than I could there.Or at least I hope I can.Charo Henr\u00edquez was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

The price we have paid for this has been high, but nobody really understands the currency we have been using to pay it.The Puerto Rican educator Nilita Vient\u00f3s Gast\u00f3n articulated it best when she said: \u201cPuerto Ricans are not taught to be Puerto Ricans.\u201d With two flags, two anthems and two languages, it is difficult to be certain about anything. You can\u2019t be cat and dog at the same time. This is a terrible and, sadly, precise metaphor. The cost of this uncertainty has been high because we don\u2019t understand who we are fighting and where our loyalties lie. There are exceptions, but those are few.Moving \u201cOut There\u201d is a natural possibility. When you become a foreigner in your own country \u2014 not an independent state, but a nation in the most natural sense of the word \u2014 then it\u2019s normal to go to that \u201cOther Country\u201d which you have been told is also yours, even if you don\u2019t entirely understand the language in which they explained it to you.This ideal exile started off with a great misunderstanding. In English, the political status of Puerto Rico was deemed a Commonwealth, but the literal translation should be \u201cAssociated Free State,\u201d an oxymoron in so many ways. Why translate this as \u201cCommonwealth\u201d?Different meanings and interpretations were born from this mere act of naming, so Puerto Ricans have lived in political ambiguity. That is the diffuse and confusing peculiarity of our exile. After Hurricane Maria, this exile feels more like an expulsion than ever, as the question looms in all families: Are we staying or leaving?My father, who is a Puerto Rican patriot and rejects everything American on principle, told me weeks after the hurricane: Go, there\u2019s nothing here for you.I felt the defeat of his whole life\u2019s creed in that sentence. I asked myself: Would I be a traitor for abandoning my country in its most vulnerable moment? Whom will the country belong to if we all leave? Are Puerto Ricans condemned to become docile servants of their new owners? How is it that the best option appears to be escaping from paradise? Am I more helpful inside or outside? I want to stay, but why do they make it so difficult for me to start over? How can I contribute to my country in my field if my industry is dying? Am I contradicting myself if I express that I love my country, but I want my children to grow up in a place where they have, at least, clean drinking water and electricity?I stayed. I remembered the words that a colleague told me once: If I\u2019m going to eat soil, that will be MY soil. I know that the world will move on and that I am probably going to be left behind, as it happens in all the islands. But I decided that staying means you don\u2019t just keep your body here, you fully occupy the space.I stay because the Puerto Rican culture cultivated from the island cannot be extinguished, although our diaspora is glorious and immense, and sustained us during these most violent winds.I stay to hold on to the certainty that even without a state, this land exists and is mine.I stay because it\u2019s time to remember that time when we all wanted to stay.Ana Teresa Toro was born and raised in Aibonito, Puerto Rico.

{"Headline": "\u2018Somewhere in Australia,\u2019 Explained", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 64______A few of the stories just happened to have that line in the text, but mostly it was a dateline on stories from Australia during World War II.\u201cSomewhere in Australia\u201d essentially meant \u201csomewhere with the United States military in Australia, but we can\u2019t say where for security reasons.\u201dThese last little stories brought to life the Australian-American alliance on a human scale. They also revealed the fruits of simple curiosity, the way journalists try to make sense of their world and share the results.These stories were among my favorites.Language, not surprisingly, was clearly of interest to correspondents then, as it is now.\u201cAustralian slang is virtually a language apart and American soldiers who ran into it in its most concentrated form were quite baffled for a time,\u201d it read. \u201cNow they are getting the hang of it and even the Yanks are saying everything is \u2018dinkum.\u2019\u201dSome of the slang identified then is still around today \u2014 like \u201ccobber,\u201d which means \u201cbuddy\u201d \u2014 but does anyone still stay \u201ccurling the moe,\u201d which apparently meant \u201ceverything going along at its best\u201d?I\u2019m pretty sure \u201ctriddlybit\u201d (threepence piece) is out of fashion, too.All of these stories erred on the side of light, making them a good entry point, but the thing about historical research is that you never know what you\u2019ll find. And in addition to these, I also discovered the story of Byron Darnton.He was among the first New York Times correspondents sent to Australia in 1942, and he was killed while reporting near what is now Papua New Guinea.I had recently connected with John when a tour group came through Australia, so I sent him an email Thursday morning.I\u2019m not sure what I was looking for, but I think I wanted to know more about what his father had written (many stories lacked bylines back then) so I could better imagine him here in Australia and traveling through the region.John wrote back right away.\u201cThanks for your intriguing email,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, my father was killed as a war correspondent in the Pacific theater in Oct., 1942.\u201dTurns out his father spent several months in Australia \u201cmostly fighting the censors who protected Gen. Douglas MacArthur and censored anything that indicated, truthfully, that he was far from the front.\u201dWhile the United States military was eager to have stories about \u201cAllied troops,\u201d John said, Byron Darnton, who went by Barney, always wrote and fought for the use of \u201cAustralian troops.\u201dHe also wrote a lot of stories about Aussie soldiers \u2014 including that story above about the slang they used.His death came as a shock to the entire foreign press corps.John later did his own reporting, uncovering previously unknown details.\u201cIt turns out he was killed off the coast of Papua New Guinea, just south of Buna, where the first battle occurred, the first time U.S. troops took on the Japanese on land. My father, Barney Darnton, was the only reporter on an advance craft, a converted fishing boat called the King John, moving up the coast toward Buna in the run-up to the battle.\u201d\u201cEarly in the morning, he took notes. He wrote, at one point, \u2018plane overhead. Jap or ours?\u2019 The plane returned and bombed the ship. There was no direct hit, but exploding shrapnel struck my father in the neck and also killed another man. It turned out Barney\u2019s note was apt. The plane that bombed him was an American B-25.\u201dI wondered if John had gone back to the area \u2014 and he had. He went to a village near where the accident occurred, interviewing two tribal elders.\u201cOne of them recalled the bombing as a 6-year-old on his way to school. We talked for a while, through a translator. Then he tugged my sleeve and the two of us walked down to the beach. He pointed at a spot in the sand. I didn\u2019t need the translator to figure out what he was saying: That\u2019s where my father\u2019s body was laid.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe exactly what I was feeling. When we pulled away and we reached the spot where I imagined the King John at anchor, I felt a rush of contradictory feelings, anger certainly, but also, for the first time really, a sense of the loss for our family and especially our mother, who dreamed of sitting under a tree with him and sipping Tom Collins once the war was only a memory.\u201dJohn ended his email simply \u2014 \u201cHope this helps, Damien.\u201dIt did.Sometimes it\u2019s easy to forget that journalism is a profession of connection, of people in conversation across boundaries of power, time and distant \u201csomewheres.\u201d Sometimes a look to the past can shed light on how close history can be, reminding us all that small moments and words still matter.______In 2015, McKinsey & Company (the \u201cgodfather of management consulting\u201d) took on a risky contract with a flailing, state-owned South African power company \u2014 lured by the potential reward of $700 million.______I loved \u201cThe Corrections,\u201d and have followed Jonathan Franzen\u2019s angst for years. Now he\u2019s moved to California and seems content, but can you really remove yourself from public feedback without withdrawing from life?She also vows not to go birding with Jonathan Franzen. Then she of course goes birding with Jonathan Franzen.______As Sri Lanka\u2019s president sank the country deeper and deeper into debt over his ambitious port project, Chinese allies continued to hand out loans and assistance, even when other lenders refused.This case is one of many in which China has used loans to gain influence \u2014 and played hardball to collect.____________Via Tacey Rychter, our audience editor, who also helped select the stories above:A postscript: I\u2019ll be off for the next two weeks.

Because phone and cable companies couldn\u2019t easily dictate what happened online, the internet was exploding in dozens of genuinely new ideas. Among those back then were blogs, Skype, file-sharing, YouTube, Friendster, Netflix \u2014 ideas that scrambled our sense of what was possible in media and communication, and, in the process, posed existential threats to the established giants.Other than the phone and cable companies themselves, I couldn\u2019t see why anyone might oppose the simple premise of protecting the environment that had made all these things possible. Did they hate clean water, too?Net neutrality was too good for us. And even if rules are restored, the notion that the internet should afford at least a minimally competitive landscape for new entrants now seems as antiquated as Friendster.Today, the internet is run by giants.

{"Headline": "Is True Crime as Entertainment Morally Defensible?", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContestsBelow, an essay by Rachel Chestnut, age 17._______Real life acts of violence have long been masqueraded before the public eye, in modes ranging from crime pamphlets to investigative documentaries, but the true crime genre has only recently risen in prestige. Delving deeper into real tragedies and revealing them to the public has its benefits, such as re-evaluating botched or unjust criminal trials and allowing viewers to think critically. Unfortunately, these advantages are outweighed by the genre\u2019s tendency to exploit suffering, lean toward a preconceived narrative, prioritize ratings over morality and manipulate public opinion.Aside from the initial use of actual crimes as entertainment, victims and their families have no real way to opt out of media coverage, as public footage can be used without their consent. For the sake of the perfect murder story, tragedy is ruthlessly dissected in the limelight without considering those actually affected. Although the coverage of crimes often converts them to tales for public consumption, the prolonged suffering of these victims is gut-wrenchingly real, yet often forgotten by engrossed viewers.Additionally, the true crime genre is inescapably prone to subjectivity. \u201cIf you start out with a presumption of [an individual\u2019s] guilt, you read the documents one way, and another way if you presume his innocence,\u201d according to Janet Malcolm, an acclaimed author. Producers often have their own theories prior to investigation, and thus consciously or unconsciously shape their entire narrative around proving themselves right. To support these preconceived notions, creators can even manipulate evidence by omitting, under analyzing or changing inconvenient yet crucial facts.Furthermore, producers often sideline ethics in order to sensationalize the coverage of heinous crimes. To captivate viewers, the true crime genre sacrifices reality for dramatic flourishes. For example, the creators of \u201cThe Jinx\u201d withheld their prime suspect\u2019s confession from the authorities until the bombshell finale aired, thus suspending justice for theatrics. Apparently, the producers\u2019 slavish commitment to ratings exceeded their moral obligation to condemn the man they are convinced is a serial killer.Finally, despite its subjective and under-regulated nature, true crime media has a disproportionate influence over public opinion. Investigative documentaries, especially those that heavily imply a person\u2019s guilt or innocence, can easily convince viewers of their conclusions. This inadequately informed consensus can have disastrous consequences, such as waves of hate mail directed at unfortunate individuals linked to a crime investigation.The true crime genre has the potential to open minds and act as a public judicial review, but in order for it to successfully do so, it must abandon the sensationalisation of tragedy for entertainment\u2019s sake. Otherwise, its inherent flaws overshadow any possible benefits. Additionally, viewers must remain conscious of what they consume and never accept subjective interpretations as indisputable fact.Works CitedAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Data Has Done to Capitalism", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I\u2019m regularly frustrated by the process of searching for hotel accommodations for my family of five. We know what we want: a basic suite, like at a Residence Inn, with four beds, two bedrooms and a bathroom off the common area. But we struggle to find it, because hotel search engines make it surprisingly difficult to figure out the specifications of rooms.Lacking that information, I sometimes end up calling a hotel reservations agent, who typically can\u2019t tell me much more than I can read online. Then I go back to the search engine, make a decision based on price and hope for the best. If someone \u2014 either a hotel chain or an aggregator \u2014 built a better search engine, I would happily use it. I would also be willing to pay a bit more for the kind of room my family wants, rather than shopping almost exclusively by price.After reading this new book by Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Thomas Ramge, \u201cReinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data,\u201d I now have a name for what I\u2019m looking for: a data-rich market. And I\u2019m optimistic that it will one day come to the hotel business. Data-rich markets are sweeping across the global economy. \u201cUntil recently, communicating such rich information in markets was difficult and costly. So we used a workaround and condensed all of this information into a single metric: price,\u201d they write. \u201cIn data-rich markets, we no longer have to condense our preferences into price and can abandon the oversimplification that was necessary because of communicative and cognitive limits.\u201dAmazon, with its many product specifications and customer reviews, is often a data-rich market. So are Spotify, Netflix, Lyft, StubHub, Rent the Runway, Tinder and Airbnb (which provides a much better search for lodging than hotels do). These markets aren\u2019t just about first-world convenience, either. In the Indian state of Kerala, among other places, a data-rich market has transformed the fishing business. Fishermen no longer have to guess which seaside market needs their catch. They can use their mobile phones to tell them which markets have a gap between supply and demand.All in all, the move to data-rich markets is for the good. It is of a piece with the ideals of Francis Bacon, Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Immanuel Kant. Knowledge spreads, and people are able to act on it. Fishermen sell more fish. Fish eaters have more choice. In one realm after another, people are able to find products and services they want, rather than having to settle for something less useful.Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the University of Oxford, and Ramge, a writer for The Economist, explain all of these advantages. To their credit, though, they spend more time in their book on the downsides of data-rich markets. These include the potential to put people out of work and to concentrate corporate power among a small number of firms that control the most valuable data. The book echoes some of the themes of Tim Wu\u2019s 2010 history, \u201cThe Master Switch,\u201d which documented the tendency of information technology to produce cartels and monopolies. The only way to avoid this fate, all of these authors agree, is a smart, activist government dedicated to protecting its citizens\u2019 interests.This new book starts its story with the ancient idea of human coordination. \u201cIf there is a single crucial thread that has persisted through human history,\u201d the authors write, \u201cit is the importance of coordination.\u201d Coordination allows communities to accomplish tasks that individuals working alone cannot. People can build on one another\u2019s strengths and make up for one another\u2019s weaknesses. Coordination made possible the library of Alexandria, the Great Wall of China, the Suez Canal and the moon landing. Coordination, in turn, depends on communication \u2014 the exchange of information that allows people to work together.In modern times, the most effective way to coordinate behavior, other than through government, has been through a company, also known as a firm. Firms tend to follow a top-down approach to coordination. A canonical example is Henry Ford\u2019s automobile firm. There, workers were divided into specialized groups. Information flowed up from these groups through a tightly controlled management structure that culminated with an imperial chief executive. Decisions came down from the top.But the firm is not the only way for the private sector to coordinate. The market offers a different model for doing so, one that both complements and competes with the firm\u2019s hierarchical approach. The market is decentralized. It has no top-down authority. Participants come and go with ease.In the market, the dominant mechanism for coordination and communication has long been price. It\u2019s simple to understand, often too simple. It is one-dimensional. That\u2019s why firms have long provided a more efficient way for people to coordinate, because they could better synthesize a rich stream of information and then act on it. Today, however, the explosion of computing power has enabled many more people to gather information and analyze it quickly, which has allowed the lingua franca of the market to become more sophisticated. In response, many firms are reorganizing themselves to mimic markets. They have become less strictly hierarchical and spread decision-making power to a larger number of people.For all their differences, the firm and the market do share a central flaw. They often are not self-correcting. Early winners can use their strength to beat back competition, amassing yet more strength \u2014 and ultimately hurting the public interest. It happened with the railroad trusts, Standard Oil and AT&T, and it is beginning to happen with the big winners in today\u2019s data-rich, market-oriented economy. Superstar companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google earn enormous profits, while employing a surprisingly small work force relative to their scale. They are adept at avoiding taxes. And they continue to amass data about human behavior that will help them grow even stronger.Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Ramge offer several intriguing ideas for limiting the excesses of data-rich capitalism. One idea is a \u201crobo tax\u201d as a partial replacement for the payroll tax \u2014 machines would be taxed more and human employment less. Another idea is mandated data sharing \u2014 an echo of the patent system, which also depends on disclosure, the authors note \u2014 to allow new entrants a fair chance to compete.These ideas won\u2019t get much of a hearing in today\u2019s Washington. But the shift toward an information-based economy will outlast the current administration. Eventually, this country will have a government interested in encouraging the best parts of modern capitalism while restraining the worst.David Leonhardt is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.Advertisement"}

Having witnessed the epidemic in her own backyard, she craved stories of hope that countered the addiction stigmas and stereotypes that have become synonymous with \u201ccoal country.\u201d The \u201cothering\u201d has been frustrating, she said, ultimately motivating her to create her own nuanced portrayals of West Virginia\u2019s opioid struggle \u2014 the \u201cgood, bad, ugly\u201d along with \u201cwhat\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\u201cI had seen enough in the media about the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to show life through the eyes of people in recovery.\u201d\u201cWhen we embarked on this, it really was trying to find something that gave me hope,\u201d Ms. Sheldon said. \u201cI wanted to find people who were actively trying to do something about the situation.\u201dMs. Sheldon, 30, discussed \u201cRecovery Boys\u201d by phone from her home in Charleston, W.V. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.When did you notice changes in your community from the opioid epidemic? How did it affect you personally? I grew up in a small town called Logan, W.Va., which has been flooded with opioids. I saw the effects of it. I saw a lot of workers getting hurt and getting addicted. But, I personally, as a kid, didn\u2019t know what I was seeing.Once I graduated college, that\u2019s when I really started seeing people dying, seeing more mug shots of girls and guys I went to high school with and [seeing them] getting their kids taken away. It felt like every other person I knew from my science class in high school was, in some way, impacted by this.Do you worry that a film about addiction and recovery in West Virginia might feed into existing stereotypes about the region? There\u2019s always a risk when you\u2019re covering a serious topic that people will make their assumptions about West Virginia or Appalachia. This film could be made anywhere in America, but it\u2019s made here in my backyard. I want to see this place change, and I want to see it improve. I want to help people understand recovery is day-to-day. This is a lifelong effort for these guys, and we have to sort of change that perception and understand that relapse is part of a lot of people\u2019s recovery, and not shame them.It\u2019s a tight rope to walk when I live here. I personally have an amazing life in West Virginia. I love living here. I choose to live here. My life is not always reflected in the films I make, and that\u2019s a point of tension for me.\u201cRecovery Boys\u201d is a very intimate film. What did you need to do to establish trust between you and the men in the film? Did you get any resistance?Our relationship grew over the six months. Some days we\u2019d show up, and they\u2019d say they were really excited to see us. It was like having your friends around. There were moments when we would put the cameras down and meditate with them. Or maybe we would put the cameras down and work on the farm with them. I can\u2019t really explain why I did that. I wanted to do it. The most important moments were when the camera was down, and we were showing up day after day.We were yet another person in this very compassionate space that was rooting for them because, at the end of the day, we want to see all of them live happy, healthy lives. Did you ever want to step in and help or offer advice while filming? It\u2019s really hard watching people struggle. You want to step in and help, but that\u2019s not really your role. There were times when Adam needed a place to sleep and I asked Kerrin, my husband, \u201cShould I let him sleep on our couch?\u201d And we decided no \u2014 that was an ethical boundary we just couldn\u2019t cross. The motive is always do no harm; your job is to tell the truth, and document what\u2019s happening.That doesn\u2019t mean that when the scene has sort of lived out its life and ended, you don\u2019t put the camera down and sympathize with them and talk through things that you wouldn\u2019t talk through on camera, human-to-human.Have you noticed more interest from networks in films set in rural America since the election? While the demand is greater, I\u2019m not seeing foundations and networks finding people like myself who are embedded in communities. I\u2019m seeing [organizations] give money to folks that are distant from those communities. I\u2019m excited that there\u2019s more attention drawn to the issues and the stories of this place, but I worry that it\u2019s just more of the same. More of this outside view looking in.I always get really defensive when people call places like where I\u2019m from \u201cTrump Country,\u201d even calling this place \u201ccoal country.\u201d It\u2019s an \u201cothering\u201d that really bothers me, and it\u2019s not wholly true. West Virginia went for Bernie [Sanders] pretty hard, actually, and we don\u2019t talk about that. Rural America is not that hard to understand. It\u2019s pretty similar to a lot of the other places that we look at. What do you think other filmmakers or writers get wrong about West Virginia and Appalachia?When people come to a place like Appalachia, they\u2019re coming here because the overdose rates are high, because the child welfare system is overwhelmed. That\u2019s their angle, rather than trying to find the resilience or the hope for the change makers that are actually doing things about it.When you\u2019re dropping in and out, and you\u2019re not staying for long \u2014 or long enough \u2014 you don\u2019t get to see the beauty, the resilience, the humor, all the layers of a crisis. People continue to change their lives. And if you\u2019re only coming in for a day, you\u2019re not going to see that.Is \u201cRecovery Boys\u201d the next chapter after \u201cHeroin(e)\u201d? Where do we go from here? We feel we have contributed to the conversation that\u2019s already happening, with \u201cHeroin(e)\u201d seeing what\u2019s happening on the front lines from a community response and \u201cRecovery Boys\u201d from an individual response \u2014 Dr. Blankenship stepping up to help these guys taking the steps to change their lives.But I think one of the bigger stories is what\u2019s going to happen to the kids \u2014 the generation behind the people currently suffering from substance abuse disorder, overdosing and dying, locked-up in prison, or getting their kids taken away from them. [That is] the next impending crisis that we have to look at.Advertisement"}

But to Mr. Bushard and his buddy, both of whom grew up in San Diego, they were an invitation to wallow in Day-Glo nostalgia for a series that is their cohort\u2019s beloved counterpart to the Gen X favorite \u201cThe Brady Bunch.\u201dThe brainchild of three Chicago entrepreneurs \u2014 Derek Berry, Zack Eastman and Steve Harris, who all have experience as club promoters \u2014 Saved by the Max meticulously recreates the neon-lit cafe where the kids from Bayside High School in the fictional Los Angeles suburb of Palisades liked to hang after class.Mr. Haskins had this reaction when he visited a Chicago incarnation of Saved by the Max in 2016 when it opened in the city\u2019s Wicker Park neighborhood. That restaurant, which at 2,500 square feet was less than half the size of the California version, was supposed to be open only for a month but proved to be \u201ccrazily popular,\u201d as one local Zagat reviewer put it. \u201cWhen we put tickets on sale, they sold out in a matter of minutes,\u201d Mr. Berry said. \u201cWe found ourselves going a full year, until we decided to put Saved by the Max on tour.\u201dThe West Hollywood edition is taking reservations through September 2019. Tickets, which include an appetizer and entree, cost $40. Some nights, visitors might get a cast member as a chaser.But how is the food?Mr. Fisher was a fan of the show, he said. \u201cOh yeah, big time. I was the perfect age.\u201d (35.) One of the reasons the show resonated with him and others who watched, suggested an executive producer, Bennett Tramer, is because the show\u2019s actors were the same age as their characters, then a rarity in television. \u201cOn \u2018Head of the Class,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Tramer, referring to the 1986-1991 ABC sitcom about gifted high school students, \u201cThey had to take their midterms and then apply for Social Security.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s extremely flattering that so many people are fans of the show,\u201d said Mr. Lopez. \u201cThere was a fun cheesiness that I think everyone enjoys. Plus, there was a certain innocence and charm to it.\u201dUniversal, which owns \u201cSaved by the Bell,\u201d did not commission the pop-up restaurant, but has enthusiastically sanctioned it and become a partner. Reviving classic entertainment properties, said Carol Nygren, senior vice president of Worldwide Live Entertainment, Universal Brand Development, \u201cis always a popular trend, and being able to recreate scenes that play into fans\u2019 memories of popular shows is so much fun.\u201dEnthusiasm for \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d-related experiences, however, may outplay all of those properties. \u201cIt\u2019s the right time for \u201cSaved by the Bell,\u201d Mr. Eastman said. \u201cPeople\u2019s interest in the show hasn\u2019t died.

{"Headline": "Betty Gilpin: The First Time I Bought a Crumbling 1834 Farmhouse", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe First TimeWe spent a year of weekends stepping through houses that had been on the market for years, their pictures conveniently omitting the beached uranium barge on the lawn. Every house closed my throat tighter. Slowly my Gwyneth of Green Gables fantasy turned into \u201cDeliverance.\u201d My husband was the happiest I\u2019ve seen him. I stood in one kitchen marveling at a sink full of dusty ghost shoes when from deep in the woods he shouted, \u201cThis is where we\u2019d build the compostable toilet!\u201dAfter my husband took me on a tour of the thousands of fix-it projects he was raring to complete, he unveiled the grand finale: Hiding in an old chicken coop was a new drum kit. \u201cI\u2019m going to learn the drums!\u201d he proclaimed. I slid onto the grass and screamed. I suddenly knew what was waiting for me here.Have you ever seen a woman realize that she has toothpaste on her shirt, nervously laugh for your benefit, then slowly look like she\u2019s going to murder six people? Believe her and step away.There is a very convincing threat for some women that if we don\u2019t find the right job or serum or therapist or life secret, if we don\u2019t solidify our confidence in time, the monster that splattered the toothpaste will take over and rule for eternity. When she\u2019s in charge, she stashes important mail in a wicker basket for six months, lets your hair tangle into a sad nest, puts the kettle on and promptly leaves the house. The monster appears periodically to remind you that she\u2019s waiting for her grand takeover, laughing at your adorable attempt to organize the closet. I spent my teens running terrified from her. I got in cars I shouldn\u2019t have, had regrettable experiences on futons, copied the vocal inflections of the ringleader. My identity was up for grabs.Then I became an actor. As a young actress, you are made to believe that the clock is rapidly running out, and you\u2019d better scramble through every version of yourself before your sellable qualities expire. Change your hair color, dye it again, be softer, be tougher, be a paper doll. Then, at 27, you\u2019re auditioning to play mothers of teenagers. You haven\u2019t put a tack in a wall in years because every space is temporary; you\u2019ve forgotten to ask yourself the big questions because you were trying to lose five pounds to be the hot cop in a show that would insult your 12-year-old dreams. I felt the monster snapping at my ankles as I ran, believing the world when it told me that men had the answer and girls had to guess.At first the house only confirmed this belief. My husband skipped around the property with tools that looked like Tower of London souvenirs, gleefully ripping out drywall. He was flourishing. I was drowning. So much of my life as a woman had been dedicated to running, calculating, morphing on command. I didn\u2019t know how to do anything permanent. And here was a house whose roots went to the core of the earth. Little by little, it showed itself to me.When we ripped up the carpet in the kitchen and then the wood underneath that, we found oak floors with burn marks where the oven had once been. Under one layer of floral wallpaper was another, a hand-painted scene of a woman walking down an Italian street. Brushing my teeth one night, I noticed a small slit inside the ancient medicine cabinet. A swift Googling told me that\u2019s where old-timey people would dispose of razor blades, and that the entire wall was probably full of them. We pulled a bright green back seat out of the attic and put it on the front porch. Months later a neighbor told us she\u2019d ridden in the car it belonged to as a girl. The next time we arrived she\u2019d left iris bulbs at our door.Gardening, that\u2019s something I could do, I realized. I\u2019d had a summer job as a gardener when I was 18, but even that was a pose: a pack of teenage girls deadheading pansies in string bikinis, desperately hoping the bro-mowers would tell us where that night\u2019s kegger was. There we\u2019d all meet, our flat-ironed hair soaking in bonfire smoke, laughing at bad jokes and swallowing our own. A frantic race to be accepted as the person we were not. Before the monster could get us.At the farmhouse, the spade I found in the garage broke by the fourth bulb so I just used my hands for the rest. In an hour I was covered in dirt and mud. But I was surprised at how much I remembered, how natural it was. I had assumed my 18-year-old self was too busy being an apologizing chameleon to retain anything as eternal as the subtleties of soil.Maybe I was wrong in assuming my life had been an impermanent scramble for identity. Maybe if I turned around and faced the toothpaste monster, I\u2019d see she had never wanted to kill me. Instead she\u2019d been watching me, picking up the things I\u2019d thrown aside as useless or terrifying and secretly braiding them into an identity more powerful and ancient and beautiful than any paper doll. Maybe the greatest trick of all is to convince girls that their roots are weeds, that their powers are curses. Maybe we\u2019re taught to run and change because if we stopped and stood, the world would change.People driving by saw a laughing mud woman on her lawn, hundreds of years wiser and full of razor blades.Advertisement"}

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26.The rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain. Fears of a trade war have made investors anxious; emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies have all sold off; and economic data in some regions has softened in recent weeks.\u201cIn an uncertain world with significant downside economic tail risks, technology has been seen to be, correctly, relatively stable,\u201d Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson, strategists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.Such economic uneasiness in the years since the financial crisis had caused investors to pour money into the sector. The likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have come to be viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver growth in most economic conditions. With interest rates at historic lows and economic growth lackluster, investors have found that appealing.In March, some of the best-performing tech stocks began to struggle. Facebook\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech companies and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms.The pullback was a rare dip for a sector that had risen consistently for the past several years. Since stock markets in the United States bottomed out in March 2009, shares of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet have all gained more than 500 percent; Netflix is up 6,500 percent. The S.&P. 500 has risen about 300 percent over that period.How long can the biggest tech stocks dominate the market? For a while, Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson said. They pointed out that earnings and sales growth, not a speculative increase in valuations, have driven the post-financial crisis run-up.\u201cUnlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson wrote.Advertisement"}

At the California Institute of the Arts, where she studied acting, she had a penchant for streaking. (\u201cThe rules at school were very accommodating to nudists,\u201d Ms. Brie said.) At 17, she spent a summer as a birthday clown, which inoculated her from future forms of humiliation.\u201cI think that idea that you can\u2019t show any fear in front of these little monsters has translated into the ring as, like, \u2018Never show fear. Just do it. Run at it,\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Brie was game, if skeptical. \u201cThere are always fad workouts going on, and it just doesn\u2019t interest me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a long time to get into SoulCycle, because people just preached about it too much. And then of course once I tried it I was like, \u2018Oh, this is really fun!\u2019\u201dAt Rumble\u2019s West 23rd Street location, she was greeted by a founding trainer named Erika Hammond, who wore a black sports bra and a ponytail. Ms. Brie changed into workout gear and followed her into a private studio tricked out in faux graffiti. She removed her engagement ring (she is married to the actor Dave Franco) and donned fingerless hand wraps, to protect her knuckles.\u201cAre you a lefty or a righty?\u201d Ms. Hammond said, before taking her through Rumble\u2019s six basic punches: jab, cross, front hook, back hook, front uppercut and back uppercut. \u201cBreathe on each punch,\u201d Ms. Hammond said, as they practiced side by side in the mirror. \u201cYou want to start from the ground up, so you get some power from the hip.\u201dWith the moves down (more or less), Ms. Brie put on puffy white boxing gloves, while Ms. Hammond slipped on a pair of black mitts. They circled each other, and, as Ms. Hammond called out numbered combinations (\u201cOne! Two! One! Two! Roll!\u201d), Ms. Brie threw a suite of punches. \u201cAlways stay in that same fighter stance,\u201d Ms. Hammond said.Ms. Brie said, \u201cSimilar to wrestling!\u201dHer character on \u201cGLOW\u201d is a metaphorical punching bag, but was Ms. Brie ready to try a real one? \u201cI want to you to throw hooks on this,\u201d Ms. Hammond said, leading her to a teardrop-shaped bag at the back of the room. Ms. Brie hit it from the bottom and then the side, as Ms. Hammond shouted, \u201cFaster with the uppercuts. Boom! Boom! Boom!\u201dNext up: defense. Ms. Hammond showed Ms. Brie how to do a slip, where you move your head to the side and shift your knees to evade a jab. The trainer held up two foam noodles and said, \u201cWith these, I am going to hit you.\u201dSoon Ms. Brie was hunching her shoulders to dodge noodle thwacks, right then left.

It used to be three to four but now, on \u2018The Daily Show,\u2019 I\u2019m usually on the road six days total.\u201d Despite this, he rarely has time to enjoy a new city. \u201cThe weird thing about \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 is the show goes someplace nice but because we\u2019re there to get the story and get the hell out, you don\u2019t really have enough time to sit and enjoy the place.\u201dHis accommodation needs are minimal. \u201cI\u2019m coming from the road, where I was a guy who was thankful just to have the room. You know, you start out sleeping in your car, you\u2019re sleeping in motor lodges, and then Super 8s, and then you work your way up to a really nice Marriott. You\u2019re just happy that you\u2019re not in a Super 8 where homeless people and prostitutes are knocking on your door at 2 in the morning, asking if they can borrow your toilet. As long as no one\u2019s knocking on my door asking if they can use my toilet, as long as I\u2019m in a hotel room where I don\u2019t have to open my door to check on my car \u2014 which is sitting right there \u2014 I\u2019m comfortable. The closer your car is to the front door of your hotel room, the harder you need to work as a comedian.\u201dHere\u2019s what he packs for every trip.Gaming equipment\u201cI just bought a Nintendo Switch that I think is going to be pretty essential going forward. I enjoy video games, but I hate traveling with a console. Thankfully, the PlayStation has something called Remote Play where you can stream your PlayStation to your laptop. So I found a single PlayStation controller. Remote play is more for people playing alone. You\u2019re not going to have a good house party on a 13-inch laptop.\u201dGalaxy Tab S3\u201cIt does a lot of cool stuff, but one of its primary purposes is access to my home DVR when I\u2019m on the road.

And for me, it\u2019s something that helps to clear my mind. I love playing number games, and puzzles, stuff like that. Before a show it\u2019s something that I enjoy doing, because my brain feels like a cable news channel where there\u2019s three squares, and there\u2019s scrolls and there\u2019s a rundown on the side, and the weather is coming in on another bar, and there\u2019s just a million things going on. When I just really need to clear my mind and really settle, Sudoku has a way of doing that for me. And also, if I\u2019m having trouble falling asleep on the plane, I just start a Sudoku and I fall asleep every time. Because it\u2019s hard, and the harder it gets, the more boring it gets, and then I just want to sleep.\u201dFour-wheel bags\u201cIt\u2019s probably the only thing I\u2019m a stickler for. I like four-wheel upright bags because they roll easier. Samsonites are always good. Maybe one day in life when I\u2019m successful, I can afford that nice Tumi bag that I\u2019ve always been waiting on. That\u2019s my goal in life: a nice four-wheel upright Tumi.\u201dCandle\u201cThere\u2019s this brown-sugar candle from Fresh that I like. And if I remember to pack it, that usually puts the hotel room in a really nice kind of mood if I\u2019m writing. That\u2019s just from me opening for other comedians and going backstage at their shows and seeing the flowers and the scents and all types of stuff, and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Oh yeah, I forgot!

There is not a way to neutralize the emotion and history behind the word in any context.\u201dHe wrote that the company would help its employees understand the \u201cmany difficult ways that race, nationality, gender identity and privilege play out in society and our organization.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The titular character, a bulletproof ex-convict with superhuman strength who rids Harlem of its criminals, made the series ripe for comparisons to the Black Lives Matter movement.The second season arrives on Friday, and while much within the culture has changed since 2016, the objectives for \u201cLuke Cage\u201d have not, said the showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker.\u201cI just always feel that any black art should address our perpetual struggle for progress and freedom, period,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it. The thing is you can never predict what the next injustice is going to be. Unfortunately, it\u2019s part of being black and conscious in America.\u201dIn a phone interview, Mr. Coker, 45, discussed the new season\u2019s female directors and Caribbean influences, his disregard for respectability politics and his unabashed love for all things musical. \u201cThe reason I keep making so many musical metaphors with \u2018Luke Cage\u2019 is that I don\u2019t view it as much a television show as I do a concept album with dialogue,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always said it\u2019s like a bulletproof version of [Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s] \u2018Lemonade.\u2019\u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation.When Season 1 dropped, Colin Kaepernick had only just started making headlines for kneeling before games and the presidential election was in its final stretch. Did you feel as though you had to address these social and political issues in Season 2? There\u2019s no way I could have anticipated that not only would we have a president this obtuse, but this most recent thing, separating children from their families in terms of these border crossings. It\u2019s unconscionable. Honestly, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve been thinking about right now. Not only if we can possibly address this kind of stuff in Season 3, but more just on a human level.In art you can\u2019t predict that, so the only thing you can do is basically be reactive from the standpoint of always being conscious. Sometimes you can anticipate it, sometimes you can\u2019t. The power that you have as a storyteller is to be able to tell stories that are at once entertaining but also never lose sight of what\u2019s going on in the real world. Whether it\u2019s \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d or \u201cBlack Panther\u201d or us, \u201cLuke Cage.\u201d Whether it\u2019s \u201cQueen Sugar,\u201d even \u201cAtlanta,\u201d\u2014especially \u201cAtlanta\u201d \u2014 all of us in different ways have figured out ways to speak to both.I think what happens with a quote-unquote \u201cbrawny\u201d action show, people say, \u201cOh well, great, if you have a female director she\u2019s going to be great with the emotions, but then when it comes to the camera, when it comes to action, she\u2019s not going to know what to do with it.\u201d And that\u2019s just really \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s frankly [expletive].But, if you want to see real change, it has to start in places where people wouldn\u2019t expect to see a female director, and that was one of the things that was important to me, my co-executive producer this season A\u00efda [Mashaka] Croal and Tom Lieber, one of the drama heads at Marvel television. We were also very much supported by Netflix on this. So six of our 13 directors are women, and the thing is, they all defy that stereotype, because if anyone wants to say that they can\u2019t direct action, look at Episode 4 in terms of our signature kick with Bushmaster, really handing Luke Cage\u2019s [expletive]. That was Salli\u2019s episode, and that actual shot was her idea, because initially the script called for just a devastating punch. And then she called from the set and said, \u201cLook, we kind of worked things out with the coordinator, but I think this is a chance for a more signature moment.\u201d And I pulled the trigger, said go for it, and bam: It\u2019s the kick that we\u2019re marketing the entire show around.With Bushmaster\u2019s arrival as a new villain, he brings this facet of blackness that we didn\u2019t see much of in Season 1: Caribbean culture. What kinds of discussions did you have in the writers\u2019 room and on set when you were enfolding this into the narrative?Before even getting the room together when I was thinking about what the season could be about, I started looking through the various Marvel dossiers and looking through old issues of \u201cLuke Cage\u201d and when Bushmaster\u2019s character came up, looking at his background, he\u2019s from the Caribbean. And I said, perfect, that\u2019s going to be our window to really talk about Jamaican culture. Even though I\u2019m not Jamaican, I\u2019ve always loved Jamaican culture because to me it\u2019s the island of magic, it\u2019s the island of politics, of resistance.At first, in talking to the powers that be, there was a little bit of resistance. There was, \u201cFine, he has a Jamaican background, but does he have to speak with a Jamaican accent? Could he be Jamaican-American? How are you going to connect it to Harlem? How are you going to connect it to the club?\u201d And in trying to answer the questions for both Marvel and Netflix, it helped us in terms of the writers\u2019 room of realizing here\u2019s how we expand New York. Because Brooklyn has always kind of been the epicenter of Jamaican America, Brooklyn and Queens. So, this expands our universe outside of Harlem.Luke was dubbed by many as the \u201cBlack Lives Matter superhero,\u201d though others have read him as being more politically conservative, particularly when it comes to the N-word. [Laughs.] Here we go.What do you make of the critiques of his and other characters\u2019 leanings toward respectability politics? Is that an accurate description?What about the fights that I had to have with Marvel to even use that word? So people want to talk to me about respectability politics without even realizing all the different levels of fights that I had to have to even use the word within a Marvel property. What\u2019s even more offensive than me having characters using the word \u201cnigger\u201d is you telling me that I can\u2019t use this word. [laughs]You\u2019ve talked about having responsibility as a black showrunner. Often people like you talk about wanting to represent their community and where they are from. But do you ever think, I don\u2019t want to do this anymore \u2014 I just want to make purely fun art?You\u2019re not necessarily dancing, but you can do both. You always strive to be entertaining, because the best way to reach somebody\u2019s politics is to entertain them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justices Send Gay Rights and Voting Cases Back to Lower Courts", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it would not consider sequels to its decisions this month on a baker who refused to serve a gay couple and on challenges to voting maps warped by politics.In a pair of one-sentence orders, the court instead sent appeals in similar disputes back to lower courts for further proceedings, passing up opportunities to clarify its inconclusive rulings in some of the most closely watched cases this term.The case, Arlene\u2019s Flowers v. State of Washington, No. 17-108, started in 2013, when the florist, Barronelle Stutzman, turned down a request from a longtime customer, Robert Ingersoll, to provide flowers for his wedding to another man, Curt Freed. Ms. Stutzman said her religious principles did not allow her to do so.She said she should not have to participate in same-sex weddings, which had been recognized in Washington the previous year.\u201cSince 2012, same-sex couples all over the state have been free to act on their beliefs about marriage,\u201d Ms. Stutzman wrote, \u201cbut because I follow the Bible\u2019s teaching that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, I am no longer free to act on my beliefs.\u201dThe couple and the state both sued, and they won in the state courts.The Supreme Court had put the Washington case on hold while it considered the one from Colorado. But it ended up deciding the Colorado case on narrow grounds specific to the dispute, saying the baker there had faced religious hostility from members of a state civil rights commission that had ruled against him.The Supreme Court also passed up an opportunity on Monday to take another look at whether the Constitution bars extreme partisan gerrymandering, returning a case from North Carolina to a trial court there for a further examination of whether the challengers had suffered the sort of direct injury that would give them standing to sue.The judges noted that the legislator responsible for drawing the map had not disguised his intentions. \u201cI think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats,\u201d said the legislator, Representative David Lewis, a Republican. \u201cSo I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.\u201dThe plan worked. In 2016, the court said, Republican congressional candidates won 53 percent of the statewide vote. But they won in 10 of the 13 congressional districts, or 77 percent of them.The Supreme Court has ruled that racial gerrymandering can violate the Constitution. But it has never struck down a voting map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.In another development on Monday, the court said it would not hear an appeal from Brendan Dassey, a Wisconsin man whose case was featured in a Netflix documentary series, \u201cMaking a Murderer.\u201d The series included excerpts from a videotaped confession from Mr. Dassey, who was 16 at the time and has significant mental limitations.Mr. Dassey\u2019s lawyers had urged the Supreme Court to use the case, Dassey v. Dittmann, No. 17-1172, as an opportunity to instruct lower courts about how to evaluate confessions obtained from juveniles and people with mental deficits. The court turned down the request without comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Ruling Has Dealmakers Bracing", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisney\u2019s offer to buy 21st Century Fox. CVS\u2019s bid for Aetna. T-Mobile\u2019s proposed merger with Sprint.The path for these blockbuster deals and others could be transformed in an instant on Tuesday, when a federal judge is expected to issue his opinion on the government\u2019s effort to block AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner. It is one of the most influential antitrust cases in decades, enthralling Hollywood, Silicon Valley and Madison Avenue.If the merger is blocked, some executives are likely to slim down their deal aspirations. If the deal ends up going through, expect a cascade of mergers and acquisitions.\u201cIt could have a collateral effect on every other transaction,\u201d said Blair Levin, an adviser to New Street Research and a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications Commission.The case will be decided by Richard J. Leon, a plain-spoken judge appointed by President George W. Bush. He is expected to give a shortened version of his opinion in remarks around 4 p.m. on Tuesday. The full opinion, released around the same time, could be more than 200 pages and will be closely read.Although Judge Leon has given few clues about his thinking, many analysts expect the companies to prevail because of the history of similar cases that were approved. Some have also said the government struggled in the trial to show that the deal would cause substantial harm.But the decision may not be clear cut. The judge may allow the merger with several conditions, such as restrictions on how AT&T negotiates with rival cable companies that want to run Time Warner content.\u201cAnything is possible, and the reality is that any side that loses will be appealing,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research.The appeal process could change the final outcome. But since the companies are faced with a tight deadline later this month to close their merger, shareholders may push Time Warner to bring AT&T back to the negotiating table for more money if they have to wait out a prolonged legal battle, some analysts say.About $816 billion worth of transactions in the United States were announced this year through May, according to Thomson Reuters, up 71 percent from a year earlier.The reason: Companies need growth, and buying other companies remains one of the fastest and most effective ways to achieve it. Despite recent interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, borrowing the vast sums of money needed for deal making remains cheap by historical standards.But there is little doubt that Judge Leon\u2019s decision will reverberate widely. The vertical deals already reached could be at greater risk, for example.Here are potential implications of the three general outcomes.If Judge Leon clears the way for the merger without any restrictions, expect other companies to see it as a green light for more consolidation.\u201cWe expect a Comcast bid for Fox under almost any circumstance, unless there is problematic language in the AT&T-Time Warner court decision that makes the prospect of vertical media mergers untenable going forward,\u201d Mr. Greenfield of BTIG Research wrote on Wednesday.The outcome of the AT&T case could also prompt a range of smaller entertainment companies to join forces as a competitive maneuver. Speculation surrounds Lionsgate, which owns Starz; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which controls the rights to the James Bond franchise; Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has rebounded at the box office; and Discovery Communications, the TV powerhouse.Media and telecom companies will also look for any signs that the judge agrees with AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s assertion that Silicon Valley is a competitive threat and should also be defined as part of the media ecosystem \u2014 adding new competitors for regulators to consider.If so, companies like Verizon and Dish could view the court decision as a sign that they could buy media companies. T-Mobile and Sprint could also point to the court decision to support their pending wireless merger, which they say would bring better mobile service as companies like Comcast enter the wireless market.\u201cYou will see a rush to consolidate major media and transmission assets,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, an antitrust official during the Barack Obama administration.A victory for the Justice Department could encourage the department to act more aggressively on similar deals.Makan Delrahim, the antitrust chief at the Justice Department, has been adamant that competitive concerns in mergers cannot be resolved through promises to hold back on certain anticompetitive practices. Those requirements, called behavioral remedies, are common in vertical mergers. Comcast\u2019s merger with NBCUniversal in 2011, for example, was granted with more than 100 conditions, such as a requirement that the combined company give competitors access to its programming.Instead, Mr. Delrahim has said the best way to resolve antitrust problems is to sell off assets. The department offered AT&T and Time Warner a settlement that would allow them to merge as long as they sold Turner Broadcasting or DirecTV. The companies rejected the proposal, leading to the suit to block the deal.Establishing his standard as the new norm would send a chill through markets, which had become accustomed to government approval of mergers with restrictions. The investment bankers, public relations operatives and media executives working on deals could go back to their corners.It would mean the Justice Department could be tougher on mergers and demand companies sell off assets to resolve antitrust concerns.\u201cMakan Delrahim strongly believes that behavioral remedies are regulations of sorts, and he doesn\u2019t want to turn the D.O.J. into a regulatory agency,\u201d said Paul Glenchur, a senior policy analyst at Hedgeye Potomac Research.Judge Leon could also allow the deal but insist that the parties agree to certain conditions, a middle ground that could go in multiple directions.For example, during the trial, Judge Leon asked about promises by AT&T and Time Warner to appoint a third party to oversee disagreements between AT&T and rival cable companies over the fees to license Time Warner content. The companies have argued that arbitration would resolve concerns that AT&T could use Time Warner content like CNN, TNT and TBS as a weapon to increase costs for rivals.The Justice Department has argued that the promises of arbitration aren\u2019t strong enough. Analysts viewed the judge\u2019s questions on arbitration as an area where he could find compromise and may use them to resolve competitive problems with the deal.He may also demand divestitures like those proposed by the Justice Department. But AT&T and Time Warner would almost certainly fight such a decision in an appeal. They have been adamant that they would not sell parts in order to get the deal approved.Such a decision on divestitures would be a rare move by a judge in a vertical merger and, like a decision to block the deal entirely, could have a chilling effect on other vertical mergers.Judge Leon, experts say, is keenly aware of the ramifications of his opinion. And he will most likely make his findings narrow, which would limit the scope of an appeal.\u201cConventional wisdom is that AT&T and Time Warner will win,\u201d Mr. Glenchur said. \u201cBut even we who are in the business of trying to predict what will happen can only really say that we really can\u2019t know at this point.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Roberts and his counterpart at Disney, Robert A. Iger, who has staked his legacy on this deal.\u201cComcast seems hellbent on winning this time, and I think the narrative in Philadelphia is that Brian should have listened to his gut in 2004 and bought Disney,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a co-founder of the research firm MoffettNathanson and a longtime media analyst, referring to Comcast\u2019s headquarters. \u201cHe seems very personally committed to this.\u201dIn a statement, Fox said it planned to review Comcast\u2019s offer. Representatives for Disney declined to comment.There are questions about how hard Disney will fight. As Doug Creutz, a media analyst at Cowen and Company, put it in a client note on Wednesday, Mr. Iger \u201chas never (as far as we are aware) been put in a position where a proposed acquisition faced a significant competitive challenge such as this, so it\u2019s hard to gauge his sensitivity to price.\u201dMr. Iger does have a history of paying premiums for properties he wants, albeit on a much smaller scale. The most obvious example is Pixar, which Disney bought in 2006 for $7.4 billion, or $9.4 billion in today\u2019s money. The price was criticized at the time as exorbitant \u2014 wrongly, as it turned out, given the value that Disney has since gotten from the animation studio.Comcast\u2019s new offer is about 19 percent higher than Disney\u2019s proposal, according to its statement. It also includes contractual assurances such as a reverse breakup fee \u2014 worth about $2.5 billion \u2014 in the event a transaction is blocked by the government.Mr. Murdoch and his company\u2019s board had rejected Comcast\u2019s earlier offer partly because of concerns that the government would block the deal, but the AT&T-Time Warner decision allayed many of those worries.Mr. Roberts wrote in a 700-word letter to Mr. Murdoch and his sons \u2014 James, the chief executive of Fox, and Lachlan, the executive chairman \u2014 that he \u201clong admired what the Murdoch family has built,\u201d but that he and his company were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Fox\u2019s decision to engage Disney.\u201cIn light of yesterday\u2019s decision in the AT&T/Time Warner case,\u201d Mr. Roberts continued, \u201cwe are pleased to present a new, all-cash proposal that fully addresses the board\u2019s stated concerns with our prior proposal.\u201dThe businesses that Mr. Murdoch has agreed to sell include the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios, almost two dozen regional sports networks like the Yankees\u2019 YES channel, a lineup of cable networks that include FX, and a 30 percent ownership stake in the streaming service Hulu.But the key attractions for Comcast are Fox\u2019s broad international assets. Among them are Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in the European pay-TV operator Sky and its control of Star, one of India\u2019s largest media companies, which reaches 700 million people every month, according to the company.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s overseas business accounts for 27 percent of annual sales, about $7.8 billion. Comcast, whose cable business is strictly a domestic operation, draws in only 9 percent of its revenue from foreign agreements, largely through NBCUniversal.Comcast has already made an offer to buy the other 61 percent of Sky in a separate deal. The Fox News cable network, the Fox broadcast stations, the Fox Business Network and the sports network FS1 would not be part of a transaction.A Fox combination could help Comcast amplify its streaming services. Netflix, YouTube, Apple and Facebook are spending billions of dollars a year to create original series and are competing directly for content and sports programming.Hulu, which has more than 17 million subscribers, would come under Comcast\u2019s control if it pulls off the acquisition. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a wonderful asset,\u201d NBCUniversal\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Burke, said Wednesday on a conference call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s an important part of this deal, and we\u2019d be very interested in growing that business in the future.\u201dAT&T\u2019s decisive court victory \u2014 the judge said the merger could move forward without requiring the telecommunications giant or Time Warner to divest any assets \u2014 creates a blueprint for Comcast. Both AT&T and Comcast are distributors seeking to buy content companies that they do not directly compete with, in what is known as a vertical acquisition. Comcast, for example, already pays Fox for the right to carry its channels like FX and Fox News.\u201cThe AT&T ruling pretty much eliminated the vertical issue from at least where the world stands now,\u201d said Ketan Jhaveri, a former antitrust lawyer for the Justice Department, which had sued to block the merger. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to make the comparison from AT&T buying Time Warner to Comcast buying Fox.\u201dEven so, the combination of Comcast and Fox would put more content and distribution under one company\u2019s control than even the AT&T deal with Time Warner. In his ruling, the judge wrote that \u201cthe temptation by some to view this decision as being something more than a resolution of this specific case should be resisted by one and all!\u201dIn the weeks ahead, Comcast and Disney are expected to work overtime to convince Fox shareholders that each will have an easier time passing regulatory muster.Mr. Iger is expected to contend that Disney\u2019s regulatory process will be faster because it has a head start, having announced its deal in December. Comcast maintains that the two timelines will be comparable.Unlike its merger with NBCUniversal in 2011, Comcast said, a deal with 21st Century Fox would not undergo a regulatory review by the Federal Communications Commission because the transaction would not involve the transfer of broadcast licenses, which requires a rigorous public interest and competition review by the agency.Either merger would be the first test for the Department of Justice since its sweeping court defeat this week. Analysts say it may be reluctant to challenge another major media deal.\u201cThe regulatory backdrop is now more positive for companies in a \u2018get big\u2019 environment,\u201d Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie Research, said.Two businesses that would receive particular regulatory scrutiny would be Fox\u2019s film business and its 22 regional sports networks.In 2017, Disney and Fox controlled a combined 35 percent of the box office in North America. This year, the two make up 50 percent. Comcast and Fox controlled a combined 28 percent last year; this year, the total is 25 percent.As for sports, NBCUniversal owns nine regional networks of its own, while Disney owns ESPN, the most popular national sports network.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Dassey, 28, was convicted of participating with his uncle Steven Avery in the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach, a 25-year-old photographer in Manitowoc, Wis.The Supreme Court did not offer a reasoning for its decision.In a statement, Laura Nirider, a lawyer for Mr. Dassey, said, \u201cWe will continue to fight to free Brendan Dassey.\u201d\u201cBrendan was a sixteen-year old with intellectual and social disabilities when he confessed to a crime he did not commit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe video of Brendan\u2019s interrogation shows a confused boy who was manipulated by experienced police officers into accepting their story of how the murder of Teresa Halbach happened.\u201dThe Wisconsin attorney general, Brad Schimel, said in a statement he was pleased by the decision.\u201cWe hope the family and friends of Ms. Halbach can find comfort in knowing this ordeal has finally come to a close,\u201d he said.\u201cThe investigators repeatedly claimed to already know what happened on October 31 and assured Dassey that he had nothing to worry about,\u201d Judge Duffin wrote in his court order. \u201cThese repeated false promises, when considered in conjunction with all relevant factors, most especially Dassey\u2019s age, intellectual deficits, and the absence of a supportive adult, rendered Dassey\u2019s confession involuntary under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201dHis lawyers appealed, setting up Monday\u2019s Supreme Court decision.

{"Headline": "The Tech You Need to Travel Better", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile no product can guarantee a seat upgrade or make your delayed flight arrive on time, a few smart investments can make your next trip more comfortable, more relaxing and less stressful.\u201cWhen we first looked into smart luggage, we concluded that buying a suitcase that had a USB-battery pack, scale, and Bluetooth tracker embedded wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d said Christine Ryan, an editor at Wirecutter. \u201cWe thought it smarter (sorry!) to buy those things separately and use them with the bag you already have, and hopefully love. Two years later, we stand by that decision, especially now that two of the major \u2018smart bag\u2019 companies have folded.\u201dSpeaking of batteries, you shouldn\u2019t travel without an external battery pack (to keep all the other electronics in this list charged) and a portable surge protector to turn the only outlet in reach in your hotel room into two or three. Ria Misra, another Wirecutter editor, called out the hotel/airport outlet problem: \u201cOutlets aren\u2019t always readily available or convenient when you\u2019re traveling, particularly on international trips where you may also need an additional adapter to get the plug to work. I take a charged USB battery pack with me when I head out on the road, especially if I know I\u2019m going to be using my phone\u2019s GPS to navigate unfamiliar terrain, which can drain a battery fast. It\u2019s also great to bring along when I plan to take public transport at my destination, so that I can charge up while in transit on a bus, train, or even on a long walk.\u201dIf you have trouble sleeping, especially when you travel, a white noise machine may make a world of difference. At home I keep a fan on while I sleep, and I find the sound (and breeze) soothing. But when I\u2019m on the road, I don\u2019t have that luxury.It\u2019s affordable, only about $50, and easy to use, even in the dark. If that sounds like $50 too much, I\u2019ve had some luck recording the sound of my fan at home and then playing it back on my phone while I sleep, but Wirecutter also suggests a few apps for your smartphone that can create their own white noise. Not every hotel has HDTVs where you can access the ports, but many do, specifically for this purpose. With a Chromecast or Roku Stick in your bag, you get to choose what you watch on the hotel TV, and it\u2019s great to log into your own Netflix account and continue the series you\u2019ve been binge watching. Even better, if you\u2019re traveling with children, you can pull up shows you know they enjoy, rather than try to find something from the TV\u2019s on-demand or cable choices.Frequent airline travelers know that a good pair of noise canceling headphones makes all the difference between a relaxing, pleasant flight, and one punctuated with engine noise, inconsolable children or overly chatty seatmates. At the very least, they dull the noise of the engines so you can get some sleep, or play your favorite tunes so you can enjoy that instead of the sounds of the people around you. \u201cPacking cubes make it easy to neatly compress your clothes to save space in your suitcase,\u201d Ms. Misra said, \u201cbut, I\u2019ve also found them especially useful in keeping my things organized throughout my travels. Even after I\u2019ve dug to the very bottom of my suitcase in search of a lost item or two, my clothes are still tidily folded and zipped away.\u201dThese last few things may not be apps, or gadgets you can plug in, but they\u2019ll make sure your next trip is that much more manageable \u2014 and most importantly, less stressful.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Wins Approval for $85.4 Billion Time Warner Deal in Defeat for Justice Dept.", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday approved the blockbuster merger between AT&T and Time Warner, rebuffing the government\u2019s effort to stop the $85.4 billion deal, in a decision that is expected to unleash a wave of corporate takeovers.The judge, Richard J. Leon of United States District Court in Washington, said the Justice Department had not proved that the telecom company\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner would lead to fewer choices for consumers and higher prices for television and internet services.The merger would create a media and telecommunications powerhouse, reshaping the landscape of those industries. The combined company would have a library that includes HBO\u2019s hit \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and channels like CNN, along with vast distribution reach through wireless and satellite television services across the country.Media executives increasingly say content creation and distribution must be married to survive against technology companies like Amazon and Netflix. Those companies started producing their own shows in just the last several years. But they now spend billions of dollars a year on original programming, and users can stream the video on apps in homes and on mobile devices, putting pressure on traditional media businesses.Executives and investors of other companies had watched the six-week trial closely for signs about how it might affect their ambitions. Comcast, for example, would like to beat out the Walt Disney Company for some of 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets, but has held off from making a formal bid until the trial ended.The ruling is a major setback for the Justice Department and its antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, whose decision to sue to block the merger broke with convention. Deals such as this one, in which the two companies are in related industries but do not produce competing products, are usually approved by federal regulators.Mr. Delrahim had insisted that the two companies sell some major parts before getting government approval, a demand that the executives rejected. That led the Justice Department to file its lawsuit in November. Judge Leon\u2019s decision essentially confirmed the conventional thinking about antitrust law.Mr. Delrahim appeared somber after the decision. He said he was disappointed and would review the 172-page opinion before deciding whether the government would ask a higher court to issue a stay of the ruling. The Justice Department could appeal the decision even if it did not get an injunction.\u201cI\u2019ve taken an oath to uphold competition,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said. \u201cWe are going to take the next steps as necessary.\u201dJudge Leon took the unusual step of warning the government not to try to seek a stay, saying it would hurt the defendants, which had already gone through an 18-month regulatory and legal battle for their review. The companies face a June 21 deadline to close their deal.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that it took 18 months to get here,\u201d Daniel Petrocelli, the lead litigator for AT&T and Time Warner, said outside the courthouse after the opinion. \u201cBut we are relieved it is finally behind us and we look forward to closing the transaction in the upcoming days.\u201dShares in AT&T fell 5.5 percent in morning trading on Wednesday, while shares in Time Warner rose 2.7 percent.The deal was hatched in August 2016 when Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&T, called Jeff Bewkes, his counterpart at Time Warner. Mr. Bewkes\u2019s company, with its popular HBO shows, live N.B.A. and N.C.A.A. sports broadcasting rights, and CNN, has been a takeover target for years.The two then had a long lunch in the Time Warner dining room in New York and agreed that their industries were under siege. The purchase of Time Warner would give AT&T the premium television content it needed to make its bundle of wireless, television and broadband services more attractive to customers.The deal would put AT&T in charge of Time Warner\u2019s vast portfolio, which includes HBO and CNN, rights to major sports leagues, and valuable film franchises such as Harry Potter. John Stankey, an AT&T executive, would oversee the integration of these units into AT&T and eventually lead the Time Warner business.\u201cWe want people engaged with their mobile devices all day watching movies and video,\u201d Mr. Stephenson testified at the trial.Presidential politics clouded the merger from almost the moment it was announced. President Trump, while still a candidate, said he would block the deal \u201cbecause it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201dThose comments and his repeated criticism of CNN, which is owned by Time Warner\u2019s Turner Broadcasting unit, raised speculation that Mr. Trump had pushed Mr. Delrahim and the Justice Department to block the deal.But Mr. Delrahim swore to the court that he was not influenced by the White House, and Judge Leon stopped the companies from introducing evidence about possible political interference.\u201cWe always believed that the motivations for bringing this case were questionable at best,\u201d Gary Ginsberg, an executive vice president for Time Warner, said on Tuesday. \u201cThe court\u2019s verdict resoundingly supported that view.\u201dMr. Delrahim had argued that the only way antitrust concerns could be resolved was through the sale of major businesses. Last fall, he presented AT&T and Time Warner with two options: Sell the majority stake in either DirecTV, which is AT&T\u2019s satellite television company, or Turner Broadcasting. The companies rejected both options.Mr. Delrahim\u2019s position, which the White House said it supported, also had the backing of some left-leaning politicians and antitrust experts. They have been increasingly calling for the government to break up Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon and to prevent greater consolidation in health care, media, transportation and agriculture.Judge Leon, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, tried to limit the reach of his opinion, writing that \u201cthe temptation by some to view this decision as being something more than a resolution of this specific case should be resisted by one and all!\u201dBut many antitrust experts and analysts believe the decision will embolden companies to pursue deals.The decision \u201cwill give AT&T market power to raise the price of Time Warner content, and, secondly, it will lead to further vertical mergers in this industry that will harm consumers,\u201d said Steven Salop, an economics and law professor at Georgetown University who has pushed for stronger government regulation.The trial drew large crowds that included executives, hedge fund managers and financial analysts. Mr. Delrahim attended occasionally, and so did Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes. The two executives each took the witness stand to defend the merger.Judge Leon asked few questions during the trial and gave little indication of where he was leaning before his opinion on Tuesday. But many experts felt that the government had struggled to make its case.After Judge Leon delivered his decision to a packed courtroom, representatives from AT&T and Time Warner lined the small hallway just outside. The men and women embraced and clapped one another on the back, beaming as they whispered congratulations.\u201cIt\u2019s a receiving line,\u201d one woman joked, her hands outstretched for the next hug.Cecilia Kang and Emily Cochrane reported from Washington, and Edmund Lee from New York.Advertisement"}

Ms. Robinson is a standup comedian and podcaster who has worked on \u201cBroad City\u201d and other shows. If many of the scenes look as though the writer Lauryn Kahn and the director Alex Richanbach let these three funny people loose, that\u2019s not too far from the truth. \u201cThe voice of the characters is the voice of the movie,\u201d Mr. Richanbach said in a phone interview. \u201cOnce the movie was cast\u201d \u2014 Ms. Kahn and Mr. Richanbach have been working on the picture since 2015 \u2014 \u201cthe script was tailored to Gillian, Vanessa and Phoebe, and we all went out to Europe well before shooting so we could create scenes based on their reactions to the place.\u201dThe most interesting thing about \u201cIbiza,\u201d not to get too highfalutin, is its positive treatment of female desire. (Spoilers, sort of, are ahead.) Harper goes after a liaison she wants, gets it, enjoys it and isn\u2019t punished for it. The filmmakers know that they\u2019re doing something unconventional here, because the scenario also includes a typical rom-com bait-and-switch. On the plane to Ibiza, Harper meets another man, someone who\u2019s not an EDM D.J. and hence more traditionally \u201cright\u201d for her. He\u2019s a completely good guy, but he\u2019s not who she wants. And that\u2019s that.The movie celebrates its heroine\u2019s disinclination to make what some viewers would call \u201cappropriate\u201d choices. \u201cI love rom-coms, but I want to see them grow,\u201d Mr. Richanbach said of the story line\u2019s slight but crucial twist. \u201cGillian, of course, was very game for an approach where we can challenge the norms and make it funny, and fun, to watch.\u201dI\u2019ve read accounts of this movie praising the depiction of female high school stoners as some kind of feminist/revolutionary act, but I wasn\u2019t entirely impressed. That could be because the women portraying the 12th graders are all clearly in their mid- to late 20s. For its first 50 minutes or so, following a traumatic experience that its lead characters aren\u2019t too eager to contend with, \u201cDude\u201d meanders. Lily (Lucy Hale), Chloe (Kathryn Prescott), Amelia (Alexandra Shipp) and Rebecca (Awkwafina) draw off a device they call \u201cDonkey Bong\u201d and mix existential musings (\u201cDo you ever feel as if your parents only see you as an extension of their own ego?\u201d) with mostly monochromatic comedic vulgarity.The movie becomes more involving as it finds its focus: Lily\u2019s romantic travails and her increasingly panicked realization that graduation and college are breaking up the old gang of hers. Ms. Hale does an excellent job portraying a popular overachiever understandably resisting the inevitable.Written and directed by Vince Marcello, and based on a young adult novel by Beth Reekles, \u201cThe Kissing Booth\u201d is an odd hybrid of \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d and a Hallmark movie. It\u2019s more the latter; check out the pizzicato strings used by the score composer, Patrick Kirst, to add perkiness to a comic exchange between the heroine, Elle (Joey King), and three intimidating popular girls in their school cafeteria.The movie initially centers on Elle and her best male friend from birth, Lee (Joel Courtney). They\u2019re super pals with no sexual spark. And they\u2019ve made a set of friendship rules to abide by. Things get complicated when Elle begins to blossom, so to speak; several male characters comment on the sudden appearance of certain secondary sexual characteristics. Always sticking up for her at these loutish occasions is Lee\u2019s smart, hunky older brother, Noah (Jacob Elordi).One day, she rips open a pair of pants and is forced to go to school in an old and way-too-short skirt. \u201cWearing a skirt like that is asking for it,\u201d Noah, Elle\u2019s dreamy object of desire, remarks. After her eyeroll he concedes \u201cI kind of played that whole sexist conversation in my head and it always ended with me sounding\u201d like a jerk. He\u2019s just too perfect. Only problem is that one of Elle and Lee\u2019s rules have put Noah off limits for her.As cinema either theatrical or televisual is concerned, \u201cThe Kissing Booth\u201d is negligible. It is fascinating, though, as a study in the semiotics of the high school movie, especially in the ways it\u2019s been recodified since \u201cyoung adult\u201d became a real genre.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One-Season Wednesdays: \u2018Aliens in America\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bysummer watchingEvery Wednesday this summer, we\u2019ll be recommending a one-season show for low-commitment, high-enjoyment summer viewing. Updated weekly.\u201cAliens in America\u201d debuted on the CW in 2007, when comedies were in a weird place. That was the fall when \u201cCavemen\u201d also debuted on ABC, when \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d was still dominating the CBS comedy lineup, when \u201cEntourage\u201d was still being nominated for Emmys, when \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d was competing as a comedy. Not long, and yet very long ago. So a sitcom about a Muslim Pakistani exchange student who finds himself living with a white, nominally Christian family in Wisconsin \u2014 airing on a network that was only a year old \u2014 did not make the impression it perhaps could have.\u201cAliens\u201d aired just 18 episodes. Absolutely skip the first three, where the show is at its most expository and labored, and just know this: Justin (Dan Byrd), our narrator, is a high school dorkus whose social life is so crummy that his mother, Franny (Amy Pietz), agrees to house a foreign exchange student, Raja (Adhir Kalyan), in the hopes that Justin will make a friend and gain some social footing. It sort of works. Justin remains at the very bottom of the social ladder, but he and Raja are instantly and sweetly best friends.The show is often called a \u201cfish out of water story,\u201d but that\u2019s not quite right. There\u2019s no water, or maybe no fish: No one here is totally comfortable, and none of the characters find their environment completely suitable. Franny is frustrated by her family\u2019s indifference to her (sometimes smothering) efforts. Her husband, Gary (Scott Patterson), loses his job and, with it, his identity. Their daughter, Claire (Lindsey Shaw), thrives on the cutthroat popularity game, but she also craves more meaningful validation. Justin refers to himself as an alien, having no idea how to fit in better.So \u201cAliens\u201d is really just a family comedy. It has a lot in common with \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d or \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d right down to the not-always-necessary narration, the clear sibling roles, the contrived but deeply revered suburban rituals.Revisiting the show this week, I was struck by how darling it is, how gently it regards that floppy, scary, badly dressed, constantly stressed time of teenhood, when boys wear the ugliest sandals on earth and eat 17 cupcakes in a sitting. (I was also struck by the occasional use of the word retarded, a term that has rightly been banished since the show aired.)This ensemble cast is where \u201cKitchen Confidential\u201d really shines: John Cho, Nicholas Brendon, Jaime King, John Francis Daley and Bonnie Somerville have great chemistry and alternately squabble, flirt and get up to high jinks against the backdrop of the glitzy Manhattan restaurant scene. (One episode is focused around the star power of Lindsay Lohan\u2019s dog.)Do you ever feel like you\u2019re being gaslit by members of the underworld? Then look no further than this demon-hunting comedy on Netflix, by way of Channel 4, which offers a roadmap for women navigating personal, and actual, demons.In \u201cCrazyhead,\u201d Susan Wokoma and Cara Theobold star as Raquel and Amy, two young women in Bristol who have the ability to see the malevolent, supernatural beings who walk among us. Since this isn\u2019t a common gift, they are treated as if they were unwell, resulting in both having a justified skepticism of prescription-happy doctors and psychiatric institutions. This all helps to cement their friendship. Fast.Which is good, because the demons, who occupy Southwest England have been up to no good. It\u2019s a fast-paced romp through bowling alleys and night clubs, full of scatological, dark humor.Our picks for One-Season Wednesdays have usually been shows you might have missed a few years ago. Here, for a change, is a great show that was airing just two weeks ago, but chances are you weren\u2019t watching it. Fox\u2019s \u201cGhosted,\u201d a charming series that was part paranormal police procedural, part workplace sitcom, ended its first and, as far as we know, only season on July 22.During its short life it had an onerous distinction: It was jerked around in a classic broadcast-network fashion that we\u2019re less used to seeing in the short-season, streaming era. Fox seemed to be in the show\u2019s corner after it debuted last fall, announcing an order for an additional six episodes (bringing the total to 16). But in January it yanked the show from the schedule for six months, burning off the extra episodes this summer.The first nine weeks were an \u201cX-Files\u201d parody involving mismatched partners solving wacky-alien cases of the week. But then, Fox switched showrunners midstream \u2014 Paul Lieberstein, an \u201cOffice\u201d alumnus, replaced Kevin Etten \u2014 and \u201cGhosted\u201d ended up being two different series in a single season. The final six episodes dropped the existing plot lines for a more serialized and naturalistic comedy about office underdogs. The result is a season that is not a natural binge, but each of the two sections of the season works on its own terms, centered as they both are on the comic teamwork of Craig Robinson and Adam Scott, who play a police detective turned mall cop and a physics professor turned bookstore clerk. Recruited to a clandestine government E.T.-hunting agency, they\u2019re a low-rent Scully and Mulder with something to prove, and Robinson and Scott are equally funny in the season\u2019s more raucous first half and its more melancholy second.Remember that time that Baz Luhrmann, the Australian filmmaker famed for his indulgence of dizzying pastiche in \u201cRomeo + Juliet\u201d and \u201cMoulin Rouge,\u201d decided to create a series about the last days of disco, the birth of hip-hop and political corruption in the Bronx? No, it was not the stuff mad libs are made of. It was Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d a musical extravaganza set during the late \u201970s, which has an impressive ensemble of reliable character actors and vibrant newcomers \u2014 and a sick soundtrack.At the center of this delightful pop opera are two young dreamers: Mylene (Herizen F. Guardiola), a pastor\u2019s daughter torn between abiding by her strict religious upbringing and becoming the next Donna Summer, and Ezekiel (Justice Smith), a smart poet who aspires to escape the Bronx. Guardiola and Smith make a convincing pair as high school kids in love, evoking all the awkwardness and uncertainty of their age. They play against a backdrop of story lines touching on race, class and religion (for starters) with a sensory overload of elaborate production numbers, cultural references (Star Wars, kung fu, Grandmaster Flash) and wildly alternating cinematic styles.I\u2019ll admit my bias up front: I love John Cho. I think he is a fine actor who is also quite charming and extremely good looking! I would watch anything that cast him as a romantic lead. And that is pretty much exclusively the short-lived 2014 ABC sitcom \u201cSelfie.\u201d\u201cSelfie\u201d is ostensibly a \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d update set in the offices of a children\u2019s pharmaceutical company. Cho plays Henry Higgs, a stuffy marketing guru tasked with rebranding Karen Gillan\u2019s Eliza Dooley, a social-media famous sales rep who can\u2019t socialize in real life. The premise is silly, and the internet references were stale even four years ago. But the show\u2019s charms reveal themselves as the relationship between the leads transcends those priors.\u201cSelfie\u201d is about the acts we put on to distance ourselves from one another, online and off, but once the show allows Cho and Gillan to get close, they spark. Things really get going around Episode 6, in which Eliza and Henry touch, in a sexy way, for the first time, then recoil back into their defensive poses. At which point: ABC promptly canceled the show. But on Hulu, you can watch the remainder of the first truncated season and marinate in their will-they-or-won\u2019t-they thing for a full 13 episodes.This show might also have been too weird. It transported the biblical story of David to a world that looked a lot like America in 2009, but it was accented with motifs found in dystopian futuristic fantasies, such as a \u201cHunger Games\u201d-like decadence in the capital city. Beyond that, it was vaguely religious, with frequent, jarring mentions of God and sincere invocations of divine right.Yet it\u2019s utterly binge-worthy, and perfect summer-watching fun.After all, what operatic plot isn\u2019t? There\u2019s palace intrigue, young love, closeted homosexuality, illegitimate children, war, assassination \u2014 the list goes on, much of it absurd, such as a kaleidoscope of monarch butterflies that land on David\u2019s head like a crown. (Get it?) Prepare yourself, though: This show was canceled before the writers could achieve much resolution. For the nearly 10 years since the season finale, I\u2019ve been wondering what happened to David, who was hapless yet destined for great things.It\u2019s been a joy to revisit \u201cKings\u201d recently, not only for the delicious plot but also for the fun of trying to figure out its filming locations, like watching a Nora Ephron or Woody Allen movie. The series takes place in a city called Shiloh, but it\u2019s clearly just New York with the Empire State Building edited out and a few glossy skyscrapers added in.Filled with irreverent jokes fired like fastballs, the 13 episodes of this Fox comedy are a breeze to binge and are smartly satisfying, even as they leave a bitter aftertaste. \u201cAction\u201d debuted in 1999, placing it a few years (and a few bleeps) too ahead of its time to last longer than a single season on broadcast TV. But the audacity of its satire, which skewered the very Hollywood industry that created it, is still surprising, even now.Jay Mohr stars as Peter Dragon, a Hollywood movie producer who is reeling from an action-movie flop and in desperate need of a hit. That means the frequent demeaning of others and himself as he fights to stay on top: He\u2019s queasily lecherous, he\u2019s conniving, and he\u2019s perfectly willing to throw a colleague to the wolves in order to make a deal.Later in the week, Kate, who feels like a \u201cweird Craigslist roommate\u201d living with Pete and his three children from two previous marriages, tells Pete she wants more parental responsibilities. So he offers her a herculean task: putting Bert to sleep.\u201cTrophy Wife\u201d is full of arcs like this: good, clean comedy in the style of \u201cModern Family,\u201d with humor that ranges from silly to absurd. Most of the main plot lines center on Kate\u2019s struggle to define her role in a family that includes the precocious and cheeky Bert (\u201cI get a horndog?\u201d he exclaims when his parents buy him a puppy, having overheard a word he shouldn\u2019t), as well as two teenagers and two ex-wives: Diane Buckley (Marcia Gay Harden), a no-nonsense surgeon with an unmatched talent for beer pong, and Jackie Fisher (Michaela Watkins), an obsessive yoga-meditation-reiki-farmers\u2019-market lover with no interest in boundaries.Here is what you can expect from the first five minutes of \u201cSwingtown,\u201d a one-season fantasy that opens in July 1976. With \u201cYour Love Is Lifting Me Higher\u201d as the backing track, you get: a simulated simulated sex act; a simulated actual sex act; the sentence \u201cMy wife is going to love you\u201d; Grant Show, bred in a lab for just this role, sporting a pornstache and a white tank top; a large can of Tab with a soft aluminum pull; a threesome; Lana Parrilla; the sentence \u201cI feel like I\u2019m ready for the next thing.\u201dThe episode goes on to include: a Harvey Wallbanger; a glass of Chablis; the line dance where you roll your hands; polyester halter dresses; the phrase \u201cWe missed the whole Woodstock counterculture thing\u201d; the response \u201cThe train is still boarding\u201d; cocaine being done with $100 bill; cocaine being rubbed on the gums; sunglasses that start dark but fade toward the bottom; quaaludes; hair so feathered that it might take off at the next breeze; did I mention the basement orgy?But for all its flamboyance and audacity, \u201cSwingtown\u201d does a good job of exploring a generation of people who aren\u2019t quite sure why they fell for the traditional value of marriage, which (like swinging, to me at least), seems like more trouble than it\u2019s worth. It\u2019s a meditation on conservatism, risk, values, fidelity and aging. And swinging.Why did it have to die? Why was it pulled away from us too soon? Why was it gone before it could answer the question of whether people who have key parties bought the fishbowl just for the key party or if there was a dead fish in its past? \u201cSwingtown\u201d was a midseason replacement in the summer of 2008. Entities like the American Family Association and Parents Television Council wrote strongly worded letters to CBS to try to get a boycott going. Man, I miss those swingers. There were cliffhangers in the season finale that I still think about. Mostly I\u2019m grateful for \u201cSwingtown\u201d because it allows me to continue to participate in my fantasy that I think we all share about swingers, which is that all they think about is swinging \u2014 that it consumes their every day, that their lives are built around it.I\u2019m pretty sure the denizens of \u201cSwingtown\u201d would agree with me when I say that I don\u2019t think guilty pleasures exist. Pleasure exists \u2014 I know they\u2019d agree with me about that. But I beg you, do not feel guilty about the pleasure that \u201cSwingtown\u201d can bring you over the course of its 13 delicious hours. Like its predecessor and successor, this 2012-13 ABC Family (R.I.P.) series is a show about starting over. Here, it\u2019s Michelle (the Broadway veteran Sutton Foster) going through upheaval. A classically trained ballerina stranded in a Vegas chorus line, she winds up \u2014 through a first-episode twist I won\u2019t spoil \u2014 alone and jobless in the small town of Paradise, Calif., teaching dance.In some surface ways, \u201cBunheads\u201d plays like a \u201cGilmore\u201d revival. Paradise is more or less Stars Hollow but warmer (meteorologically and culturally). The cast includes Kelly Bishop as Fanny Flowers, the imperious dance teacher who takes Michelle on; other familiar \u201cGilmore\u201d faces include Liza Weil and Sean Gunn in a cameo as a haughty barista. (Also a recurring favorite from \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d: coffee.) But the true secret weapons of \u201cBunheads\u201d are the four teenage students whom Michelle and Fanny mentor, whose show the series gradually becomes. Artistic aspiration and teen coming-of-age are two bittersweet tastes that taste great together, each with its own flavor profile of longing, rejection and fumbling toward identity. This German series (with English subtitles) clocks in at only eight episodes, and it\u2019s too intense to binge; don\u2019t watch more than two at a time unless you want to feel extremely trashola about everything. That\u2019s not to say the show is wall-to-wall violence \u2014 it\u2019s not, and there are poppy, fun moments, and sweet and silly ones. But a lot of brutality and sorrow, too. The show is, as you might expect, set in a divided Germany in 1983. Martin (Jonas Nay) is a young East German soldier with the odd luck of looking a lot like a West German soldier named Moritz, who is preparing to become an aide to a powerful general. East German forces kill Moritz, and Martin is recruited to pose as him in West Berlin, thus collecting all kinds of valuable intelligence.Unlike the spies in most stories, Martin is largely mediocre. In one memorable training montage, he can barely learn how to hand off small parcels discreetly. He\u2019s also utterly taken with the food and music and culture of West Berlin. But he\u2019s not there for shenanigans, and his responsibilities to his country, his family and himself sometimes pull him in opposing directions. This is further complicated by the fact that his aunt is one of his Stasi bosses.In \u201cCrashing,\u201d Waller-Bridge plays Lulu, a luminous troublemaker who moves into the hospital to follow her old friend Anthony, who lives there with his uptight fianc\u00e9e, Kate. This of course creates tension. There\u2019s also the moody French artist Melody, the sex-crazed and often offensive Sam, and the lovable, anxious Fred.Lulu sees herself as cool and whimsical, but she\u2019s really just callous and irresponsible. When she shows up with her ukulele in tow, strumming improvised songs, Kate is immediately a little put off. \u201cWow, quirky!\u201d she says. \u201cThanks, I try really hard,\u201d Lulu jokes. Well, sort of jokes. Lulu is the quintessence of the kind of woman other women see as artificial but men see as charming, and Waller-Bridge devilishly plays with these types and conventions in interesting but still empathetic ways.There\u2019s an abundance of love and romance and sex on \u201cCrashing,\u201d much of it completely charming. There\u2019s also genuine friction among the characters, along with struggles to set healthy boundaries and to be decent people.Advertisement"}

One by one on Thursday, reporters from various publications were invited over \u2014 never mind those pictures still waiting to be hung \u2014 to briefly chat about her strategy while snacking on cheese and crackers.Her message to Hollywood\u2019s creative community boiled down to this: Amazon now has its act together \u2014 come join us.One television kingpin seen as potentially being available in the next year or two is Dick Wolf, whose \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and \u201cChicago\u201d series have powered NBC for two decades.\u201cDick is a very close friend of mine,\u201d Ms. Salke said, putting her hand on her heart. \u201cHe and I are talking. In fact, we\u2019re talking about developing something together.\u201dShe added: \u201cA few months in, I\u2019m not going to be publicly poaching. But I\u2019m going to be out there like I was with Jordan, proactively approaching people who are available or coming available.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re homing in on a strategy,\u201d she said of the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d adaptation. \u201cThe estate has actually been super helpful. Offering insight. Giving permission to make some big moves. They\u2019re not being precious.\u201dFor a company that spent an estimated $4.5 billion on programming last year, however, the programing slate is thin.\u201cWe\u2019re not going for something small and niche,\u201d said Ms. Salke, describing her strategy. \u201cYou can still have something that feels specific. But it needs to invite people in.\u201dThat\u2019s certainly how her bosses in Seattle feel. Because Amazon\u2019s hefty investment in content has yielded only mixed results in Hollywood, it is up to Ms. Salke to change that as quickly as possible.\u201cThe pressure on Amazon is their Prime membership growth has been slowing,\u201d said Greg Melich, a retail analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cAs a result, they need the members they have to get that much more engaged. And people that stream content also shop more frequently, spend more and are more likely to renew their Prime membership.\u201dMs. Salke comes to Amazon with a proven track record. She helped orchestrate a turnaround for NBC, taking it from a nadir when it briefly abandoned 10 p.m. dramas to first place for each of the last two seasons. During her tenure, NBC found the smash hit \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d Ms. Salke previously worked at Fox\u2019s television production studio, where she guided notable shows like \u201cGlee\u201d for Fox and \u201cModern Family\u201d for ABC.Dan Fogelman, the creator of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d credited Ms. Salke with taking an interest in his drama even before it became a runaway hit.\u201cWhen she is impassioned about a project, she is more intimately involved with the material than a quote-unquote entertainment president normally would be,\u201d he said.Ms. Salke may luck out with another film from the Price era, however \u2014 one from Mr. Fogelman. He directed \u201cLife Itself,\u201d a romantic drama about intersecting lives over multiple generations that is scheduled for release by Amazon in September. Amazon has high box office hopes for the film, which could also figure in the Academy Awards race.Ms. Salke will probably add a senior executive to Amazon\u2019s film team. With movies, \u201cwe want to maintain the level of excellence,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, we do want to widen the aperture a little bit.\u201dBrooks Barnes reported from Culver City, and John Koblin from New York.Advertisement"}

Yes, it\u2019s a story of struggle \u2014 the AIDS crisis is a constant shadow \u2014 but it spotlights its characters\u2019 aspirations. It\u2019s sincere, buoyant and fun, stunningly designed, mindful that a show about balls should be capable of having one.At its heart is an underdog story. Blanca (Mj Rodriguez) breaks away from the imperious ball legend Elektra (Dominique Jackson), mother of the House of Abundance, to form her own house, which she christens the House of Evangelista. (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has nothing on the regal nomenclature here.)A \u201chouse\u201d is both a team and, literally, a home, and Blanca assembles a crew of misfits and castoffs in her apartment. She forms an especially maternal bond with Damon (Ryan Jamaal Swain), a gay teenager and aspiring classical dancer from Pennsylvania who was kicked out of his home.The pilot, kinetically directed by Mr. Murphy, introduces a world \u2014 familiar from the 1990 documentary \u201cParis Is Burning\u201d but never detailed like this in series TV \u2014 without feeling mechanical or overexpository. The vogue battles, choreographed by Leiomy Maldonado and Danielle Polanco, are thrilling, art-as-combat duels. Mr. Porter (\u201cKinky Boots\u201d) makes Pray Tell a wry guide to both the balls and the larger community around them.At its periphery is a more familiar, heavy-handed story of greed-is-good-era New York City, with a ubiquitous 2018 hook. Stan (Evan Peters), a social-climbing young businessman from New Jersey, lands a job with, yep, the Trump Organization.The company\u2019s celebrity leader is spoken of but not seen. Stan\u2019s boss, Matt (James Van Der Beek), personifies the age\u2019s conspicuous consumption and velociraptor aggression. Mr. Van Der Beek has a gift for playing this kind of cocky boor, but when the show introduces him saying, \u201cGod Bless Ronald Reagan\u201d while hoovering lines of coke, it manages to be both on and up the nose.The two worlds connect when Stan falls for Angel (Indya Moore), a prostitute and house member. (The series\u2019 casting in general is a coup; Ms. Moore, a model, is a relative newcomer to acting but you wouldn\u2019t know it from her presence and shaded performance.) They begin a long-term affair even as he and his wife, Patty (Kate Mara), build an overspent life in the suburbs; his life, too, is about the cultivation of appearances.\u201cRealness\u201d is a recurring theme in \u201cPose,\u201d which is nuanced about the conscious and unconscious assumptions the term can involve. Elektra uses authenticity as a cudgel with Blanca, whom she insults for not \u201cpassing\u201d well enough; a gay-bar manager ejects Blanca, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not throwing a costume party.\u201d A later episode deals with the pressure to get often-dangerous augmentations and injections.But \u201cPose\u201d is broadly empathetic and nonjudgmental. Each character is making complicated decisions about how to define her- or himself, including Elektra, who presents herself as unbreakable but is wrestling with getting gender-confirmation surgery that her lover (Chris Meloni) is vehemently against.The series is not afraid of melodrama, the first four episodes suffer peak-TV bloat (at a full hour and up) and the scripts veer into the kind of speechy dialogue that comes across as read more than spoken. But the rough patches are lofted by its vitality and refusal to draw its characters in terms of tragedy. As a sometimes-competitor to Elektra puts it: \u201cHow lucky are we? We create ourselves.\u201dLike its characters, who sift through a larger culture\u2019s looks and iconography to create a custom-fit expression, \u201cPose\u201d at its best produces a hybrid \u2014 an old-fashioned story of surrogate family and putting on a show, remixed into something novel. It is not flawless, but it defines its own category.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dangerous \u2018Bigness\u2019 of the AT&T-Time Warner Merger", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust and telecommunications.When Congress enacted the Anti-Merger Act of 1950, the law by which American courts still adjudge corporate mergers, it did so with the repeatedly stated goal of fighting excessive economic concentration. The \u201cdominant\u201d concern, as the Supreme Court wrote in a 1962 merger case that analyzed the law, was about \u201ca rising tide of economic concentration in the American economy.\u201d At the time, the court explained, a wave of corporate consolidation posed the threat of an \u201caccelerated concentration of economic power\u201d and also a \u201cthreat to other values,\u201d like the independence of smaller businesses and local control of industry. In particular Congress had said it intended the new law to stop a wave of mergers in its \u201cincipiency.\u201dJudge Leon\u2019s decision shows just how far the law has wandered from congressional intent. The law has become a license for near-uncontrolled consolidation and concentration in almost every sector of economy. Whether involving airlines, hospitals, the pharmaceutical industry, cable television or the major tech platforms, mergers leading to oligopolies or monopolies have become commonplace.Reading Judge Leon\u2019s opinion makes it clear how this has happened. The decision barely touches on Congress\u2019s concerns about excessive concentration of economic power or other guiding principles or values. Instead, the opinion is mostly a tedious dissection of whether customers might end up paying an extra 45 cents per month for pay-TV service. How did a battle over 45 cents become how we decide the future of the media industries? Yes, higher prices for consumers are a bad thing, but they are not the only thing, and certainly not what Congress cared most about. In fact, the law itself doesn\u2019t even mention prices: It instructs courts to bar mergers when the effect \u201cmay be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\u201dThe case could have centered on what Congress really cared about: competition, concentration and the direction of the industry. On its face, despite being a \u201cvertical\u201d merger between two companies at different levels in the supply chain, the marriage of such large and powerful players in the media industry looks anything but harmless. One of AT&T\u2019s defenses of the merger was that it wanted to take on internet companies like Google, Facebook and Netflix. But was that really a creditable goal of this deal? Was there good evidence of an effort to prevent new business models from taking flight? And what about the risk of setting off a wave of consolidations, leaving a fully integrated industry immune to new competition?These kinds of considerations would have yielded the question Congress wanted answered: Was the likely effect of the merger to diminish the level of competition in the media industries? Yet in vain pursuit of numerical certainty about the monthly cost of pay-TV service, the ruling never really came to address this broader question.What Congress cared about in 1950 is even more important today. The public cares about the aggregation of wealth in the top echelons, the suppression of wages and the shrinking of the middle class, all of which are linked to industry concentration. That\u2019s why Congress, in the wake of repeated affirmations that the anti-merger laws no longer work, needs to act. It should reassert that Congress in 1950 really did intend to preserve a competitive economy \u2014 one that is free, if possible, from what the Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201dTim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hello, You Must Be Going: Hulu Parts With a Top Executive", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast summer, the executive Joel Stillerman started work at Hulu as its first-ever chief content officer. On Friday, the streaming platform announced that he was out.Hulu hired Mr. Stillerman to pursue ambitious original programming and acquire shows from other networks for its expanding library. But soon after he moved from New York, where AMC has its headquarters, to Santa Monica, Calif., where Hulu is based, he ran into knotty complications.Mr. Stillerman\u2019s vision for Hulu\u2019s future did not impress his corporate overlords, and there were some chemistry issues with Mr. Freer, said three people familiar with the reasoning behind his departure. Mr. Freer, now seven months into the job, made the decision to reorganize the company.A Hulu spokeswoman said, \u201cThis change was entirely due to the reorganization, and not at all about performance.\u201d Mr. Stillerman declined to comment.Even before he took the job of chief content officer, the position was not exactly seen as one of the hottest jobs in Hollywood. It had taken Hulu several months to fill it, partly because of the company\u2019s unique \u2014 some would say tangled \u2014 corporate structure.Unlike Netflix executives, who have the freedom to make deals with little oversight, Hulu\u2019s leaders must answer to many masters: the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner, all partial owners.The merger mania sweeping through corporate media means that the latest reshuffling may stay in place for only so long. If Disney prevails in its bid to acquire most of 21st Century Fox, it will become Hulu\u2019s majority owner. On the other hand, if Comcast succeeds with its rogue bid for most of 21st Century Fox, it will assume 60 percent of the company. Whatever the outcome, Hulu is likely to have a majority owner for the first time \u2014 and, with it, a new content strategy.For the time being, the position of chief content officer has been expunged.As Hulu has introduced a live TV service and expanded its original programming and its library of content, which now includes vintage shows like \u201cER\u201d and \u201c30 Rock,\u201d its number of subscribers has surpassed 20 million. And yet the losses are mounting: In 2017, the company lost nearly $1 billion, a figure that will climb to more than $1.5 billion this year, according to the firm BTIG.Spending freely seems to be part of doing business in streaming, however: Netflix is expected to have a negative free cash flow of anywhere between $3 billion and $4 billion this year.Hulu, which is available only domestically, has undergone shifts in its identity several times since it started in 2007. Until the success of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d it was seen primarily as a place where viewers could click their way to last night\u2019s episode of a network television show.In addition to the news about Mr. Stillerman, Hulu announced that the senior vice president of experience, Ben Smith, and the head of partnerships and distribution. Tim Connolly, were no longer with the company.\u201cBen, Tim and Joel have all played a significant role in getting Hulu to the strong position it is in today,\u201d Mr. Freer, the chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cThey will forever be a part of Hulu\u2019s success story, and we wish them the very best in their next endeavors.\u201dBut it wasn\u2019t all departures. The streaming service has hired Dan Phillips, the former chief operating officer of TiVo, as its new chief technology officer. Jaya Kolhatkar, formerly a Walmart executive, will become Hulu\u2019s first chief data officer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018Set It Up\u2019 and 2 Other Netflix Comedies, No One Emerges Unscathed", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreaming\u201cSet It Up\u201d is a new Netflix Original romantic comedy written by Katie Silberman and directed by Claire Scanlon. But the expectation that a female-written, female-directed effort would yield something refreshingly different is scotched within the first few minutes.The movie\u2019s opening montage depicts a view of today\u2019s gig economy in New York City, specifically the sorry lot of the personal assistant. \u201cI have a master\u2019s in sociology and nothing else to do today,\u201d one such young person says into a phone as he is about to be put on hold. Big lights will inspire you, indeed.Eventually the film alights on Harper, the personal assistant to an icy sports reporter and website master, Kirsten Stevens (Lucy Liu), and then on Charlie, the assistant to a venture capitalist, Rick Owen (Taye Diggs, his inherent charisma subsumed in a truly nasty role).Harper (Zoey Deutch, charming) and Charlie (Glen Powell, unable to transcend his character\u2019s smarmy game face) meet semi-cute working late, fetching their bosses\u2019 dinners.Ms. Silberman\u2019s attention to trendy detail is exemplified by some one-liners here. When Harper is told the wait time for her order of truffle mac and cheese, she retorts: \u201cTwenty-five minutes? Are you sniffing for the truffles yourself?\u201d Charlie, on the other hand, waxes indignant. \u201cWhat kind of grocery store doesn\u2019t serve saffron-infused Kobe beef, medium-rare?\u201d he says.The movie\u2019s humor can be full-on unpleasant, as when an obese delivery man begins stripping, then urinating, while on a stalled elevator car. The liberal use of profanity and sexual innuendo actually succeeds in achieving gratuitousness. Mr. Powell\u2019s character makes no fewer than four penis jokes in the first hour, three of them about his own. Remember, this is the guy that the female protagonist is destined to fall for in the end.I found all of these characters depressing. I\u2019m happy that my profession does not require me to find out if they have real-life analogues.Another Netflix comedy, \u201cI\u2019m Not an Easy Man,\u201d which debuted in April, is also the work of a female director, El\u00e9onore Pourriat, who wrote the film as well. Alas, it, too, is not very good.The premise is simple: Extreme male chauvinist bumps his head on a Paris street sign, passes out and wakes up in a gender-reversed world. The street sign was for P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery; when he wakes up, it\u2019s for M\u00e8re Lachaise. John Steinbeck is Jane Steinbeck. Women don\u2019t wear makeup and are sexual aggressors, while men are required to shave their chests and inner thighs. And so on and so on.One could fill a 98-minute movie with such minutiae, but why would you want to? This picture is a heavy-handed pursuit of diminishing returns, given that the male lead, Vincent Elbaz, is equally unappealing as a creepy alpha male and a befuddled representative of oppressed manhood. As it happens, this movie is an expansion of Ms. Pourriat\u2019s 2010 short film, \u201cOppressed Majority,\u201d which was a punchier, and not particularly comedic, allegory of sexual assault. That picture can be found on YouTube; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good either, but it\u2019s more genuinely thought-provoking than its expansion.An academic having an early midlife crisis who neglects his wife, flirts with a student and stresses over a more successful colleague sounds like a scenario out of, if you\u2019ll forgive me, a Woody Allen film. In this case, it\u2019s the premise of a South African Netflix comedy, \u201cCatching Feelings,\u201d written and directed by and starring Kagiso Lediga, a popular stand-up comedian and television performer in his country. It is notable both for its considerable comedic flair and its detailed depiction of Johannesburg.Mr. Lediga\u2019s character, Max, is a creative writing teacher whom we first see performing a daringly lewd lecture on the cuckold-growing-horns myth. He\u2019s financially overextended, drinks too much and soon falls under twin spells \u2014 one woven by a female student, the other by a famous white writer who has returned to South Africa after a long self-imposed exile.Heiner, the writer (a boisterous Andrew Buckland), tells Max that he found his debut novel, \u201cBlossom of the Roses,\u201d promising and invites Max to spar with him about politics in front of a female interviewer who\u2019s entranced \u2014 by Heiner. At one of Heiner\u2019s parties, Max encounters a group of his students, including the flirtatious one (Zandile Tisani) who introduces him to cocaine. We next see Max holding court under the influence, proclaiming, \u201cYou cannot compare Hitler to Shaka Zulu,\u201d the warrior king. Many of the laugh lines here are similarly unexpected.After a Viagra-induced heart attack, Heiner moves in with Max and his beautiful journalist wife (Pearl Thusi), and Max starts imagining his own cuckold\u2019s tale happening to him. \u201cCatching Feelings\u201d starts to sag a little at this point; cultural specificity or no, the spectacle of a man exploding his own life for no good reason is a familiar one. But the feeling I was left with when all was said and done was the satisfying one of having encountered a fresh new comedic voice.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "White People Are Noticing Something New: Their Own Whiteness", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsBeing white in America has long been treated, at least by white people, as too familiar to be of much interest. It\u2019s been the default identity, the cultural wallpaper \u2014 something described, when described at all, using bland metaphors like milk and vanilla and codes like \u201ccornfed\u201d and \u201call-American.\u201d Grass is green, the sky is blue and, until very recently, a product described as \u201cnude\u201d or \u201cflesh-colored\u201d probably looked like white people\u2019s skin.In each of these cases, as well as a string of others, white people didn\u2019t get the usual benefit of assumed normalcy. They were portrayed, instead, as a distinct subculture with bizarre and threatening habits. \u201cWhite people\u201d were suddenly identified as the subgroup of Americans most likely to call the police on black people over a barbecue or to complain about whether every single football player stands for the anthem \u2014 stereotypes that rang true even to other white people.For a long time, many white people assumed it was our due, as the majority, to encounter various racial others and marvel at the exotic things they ate, built or wore. Now we can go online and find people of color doing the gawking, offering jokes and anthropological scrutiny about white people\u2019s underseasoning food, mistreating potato salad or eschewing washcloths.Even as the \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of whiteness remained porous and inconsistent, those included within it often treated it as a kind of noble calling \u2014 the \u201cwhite man\u2019s burden,\u201d a mission to civilize the globe\u2019s others, perhaps even by divine right. These beliefs are now recognized as objectionable; they\u2019ve been replaced, ostensibly, by an acceptance of pluralism and diversity \u2014 though not a deep commitment to integration. And yet as long as white people continue to see ourselves as the norm and the neutral, we haven\u2019t replaced as much as we might imagine. We continue to act as racial managers, clinging to the job of setting the culture\u2019s terms and measuring everyone else\u2019s otherness against those terms.People of color have described the darkness at the heart of whiteness each step of the way \u2014 as the poet and lawyer James Weldon Johnson observed a century ago, \u201cthe colored people of this country know and understand the white people better than the white people know and understand them.\u201d In an 1829 tract, David Walker, who wrote for the country\u2019s first black-owned newspaper, argued that the central feature of white identity was murder; today Ta-Nehisi Coates calls it plunder. In \u201cThe Fire Next Time,\u201d his stunning book of 1963, James Baldwin wrote that white people could resolve their position only by looking inward. \u201cWhite people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand when they have achieved this \u2014 which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never \u2014 the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed.\u201dThe growing self-recognition among white people, prodded into being by demographic change and broader conversations about how racial identity works, could certainly lead toward self-acceptance and harmony, sure. The Parkland student activists, for example, have seemed almost intuitively savvy about such things, finding ways to interweave their goals and share their stage with kids of color who had, as one put it, \u201calways stared down the barrel of a gun.\u201d But we\u2019re also staring at copious evidence of this self-recognition swinging in the other direction. When white Americans burrow into their group identity, the switch that Painter described often flips, from nothingness to awfulness. Some of us fixate on maintaining racial dominance, conjuring ethnonationalist states or a magical immigration formula that somehow imports half of Scandinavia. A majority of white Americans currently believe that their own race is discriminated against. News accounts fill with white resentment and torch-lit white-power marches. White Americans, who \u201cseem lost,\u201d are searching for something important: how to see ourselves without turning awful in the process.Emily Bazelon is a staff writer for the magazine and the Truman Capote fellow at Yale Law School.Advertisement"}

Helen (Maura Tierney) and her ex, Noah (Dominic West), are now in Southern California. Luckily for viewers, the move to warmer climes doesn\u2019t make her any less uptight, controlling and clueless or him any less angry, abrasive and insecure. In each other\u2019s eyes, anyway. (Seasons 1-4 can be streamed at showtime.com and on Showtime\u2019s Amazon Prime channel.)HUMANS (AMC, Tuesday) Set a year after the climax of Season 2 \u2014 when the world\u2019s entire population of robots was given the consciousness and emotions previously possessed by a handful \u2014 the new season of this terrific British drama becomes more of an allegory of contemporary racial and political divides. The \u201csynths\u201d who had been on the run are now internal exiles, facing issues like trafficking, refugee status and whether to pursue peaceful protest or violent rebellion. (Seasons 1-2 can be streamed at Amazon Prime.)LUKE CAGE (Netflix, June 22) The second season of this Marvel series about a bulletproof superhero (Mike Colter) trying to keep the peace in Harlem features the final screen performance of the deep-voiced, Emmy-winning actor Reg E. Cathey, who filmed his role as Cage\u2019s father before his death in February. He\u2019s introduced early in the season-opening episode, rehearsing a sermon alone before a mirror.SPIRAL (MHz Choice, Tuesday) The first series from France (where it\u2019s called \u201cEngrenages,\u201d or gears) to break through in the United States, this brusque policier has completed six seasons since its debut in 2005. Season 6, like its predecessors, begins with the discovery of a corpse, this time missing head, hands and feet. \u201cSpiral,\u201d with its procedural crime-solving and wide focus on cops, lawyers and judges, has been compared to the \u201cLaw & Order\u201d shows, but it differs by continually incorporating the characters\u2019 personal lives. In the new season, whose 12 episodes were written by Anne Landois, that includes the frequent need of the main cop, Captain Laure Berthaud (Caroline Proust), to pump breast milk, even at crime scenes. Vive la difference. (Seasons 1-5 can be streamed at Hulu.)CASUAL (Hulu, July 31) The siblings Valerie and Alex (Michaela Watkins and Tommy Dewey) have a shortened, eight-episode fourth and final season to resolve their commitment issues. Originally a melancholy sitcom about adult dating, \u201cCasual\u201d has grown into a melancholy (but still sharply funny) meditation on belonging, happiness and the many meanings of family. Megan Ferguson brings the screwball-comedy vibe she showed in \u201cThe Comedians\u201d to the role of a neighbor with an eye for Alex.THE FOSTERS (Freeform, Monday-Wednesday) It\u2019s not a good moment to be losing this touching young-adult melodrama, one of TV\u2019s most overt celebrations of tolerance and diversity. At least the preternaturally sane lesbian mom and wife Lena (Sherri Saum) is considering a run for the California Assembly as the fifth and final season ends. The three-night finale centers on the destination wedding of Brandon (David Lambert) \u2014 assuming his series-long feelings for his adoptive sister Callie (Maia Mitchell) don\u2019t get in the way \u2014 so there are hookups, excessive drinking and bad resort music mixed with the sentimental flashback montages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pipelines, the Stuff of Canadian Politics: the Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGiven that Canada\u2019s economy still relies to a substantial degree on chopping down trees, digging up minerals and pumping out oil and gas, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that pipelines are one of the nation\u2019s hot-button issues.That move had a familiar ring to any of us who have taken even a high school course in Canadian history. In 1956, a Liberal government\u2019s efforts to use public money to make sure the construction of a major pipeline could begin by a June deadline ended up in a legendarily raucous parliamentary debate \u2014 and became a key factor in the Liberals\u2019 defeat in the next election.Back then, the government of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent brought in a bill to spend 118 million Canadian dollars \u2014 1.1 billion in today\u2019s money \u2014 to build part of the Trans-Canada Pipeline from Alberta to Eastern Canada, and also to lend money to the group of companies set up to run and own the project. (TransCanada, as it\u2019s known today, is also the outfit now behind Keystone XL.)John Diefenbaker, the Conservative leader at the time, was known for his jowly speaking style, which allowed him to summon righteous indignation like few Canadian politicians before or since.Mr. Diefenbaker challenged the project\u2019s American control. Members of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, the precursor to today\u2019s New Democratic Party, pushed for public ownership. The volume rose and tensions flared in the House of Commons. Then the Liberals, with an anxious eye on their construction deadline, used a ham-handed parliamentary procedure to shut down debate and force a vote.Mr. Trudeau appears to be gambling on the notion that most Canadians sit somewhere in the middle, and like him believe that Canada can balance environmental protection and a strong energy industry.I\u2019ll bet this becomes a defining issue in next year\u2019s election.\u201cCanuck Lit Lover\u201d from British Columbia: \u201cI am finally relieved that our Prime Minister has stood up to the neighborhood bully. So many of us have waited with bated breath, in disappointed and disbelief that Trudeau seemed to have checked his duty to defend our honor, avoided calling out hateful and antagonistic speech, and sidestepped critical moments that could have drawn some kind of line between us and the frightening devolution of political and moral standards in this American government.\u201dBrian in Toronto: \u201cAmerica\u2019s allies will trade with each other, and with China, and America will become less and less relevant in the world. As it becomes less relevant, it will become poorer, starting with the heartland.\u201dMark, somewhere in Canada: \u201cThe silver lining to this mess is that it will finally teach Canadians a lesson they should have learned since the 1950s: don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.

{"Headline": "Sometimes You Have to Quit to Get Ahead", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWinners are just people who know when to quit \u2014 and do it often.We\u2019ve all heard the saying: \u201cWinners never quit, and quitters never win.\u201dLet\u2019s say you want to write a book. That\u2019s a monstrous, energy-consuming undertaking that, in all likelihood, will require you to \u201cquit\u201d your other creative pursuits or hobbies, according to Mark Manson, author of \u201cThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a \u2014-.\u201d\u201cWhat I give up when I\u2019m writing a book is creativity in other arenas,\u201d Mr. Manson said. \u201cI have a limited amount of creative juice to use each day,\u201d so writing a book gets the majority of that creativity quota.\u201cIt\u2019s better to just start the things that you know you have the resources to finish. You don\u2019t want to be surprised by the hard parts, you want to expect the hard parts,\u201d Mr. Godin said. \u201cThe challenge we have is how we\u2019re going to find the effort and the resources to break through.\u201d In the experiment, 32 participants played a computer game and were asked to repeatedly pick one out of nine possible doors to enter. Each door participants chose to enter and explore rewarded them with a variable amount of treasure, which determined their compensation. But in some versions of this game, doors that were left unopened eventually disappeared. Under this condition, researchers observed that participants were willing to forgo a bigger reward to keep those options viable.In other words, trying to do and cling to too many things cannibalizes our precious limited resources that might be better spent elsewhere \u2014 but we\u2019d never know.That\u2019s where strategic quitting \u2014 and understanding opportunity costs \u2014 comes in. Simply put, this is the idea that in order to pursue one option, we must forgo certain others, Mr. Godin said. This means choosing between four hours of \u201cThe Office\u201d on Netflix, or working on your masterpiece or studying a new skill.\u201cThat\u2019s really expensive,\u201d Mr. Godin said, \u201cbecause all these hours you could have spent reading a book, coaching the local handball team, or giving back to the community, you chose to be watching television.\u201d At that point, the monetary cost of Netflix is far surpassed by the opportunity cost it represents, he said. But refusing to abandon those investments can be costly. For every moment you double down on something that\u2019s not working out, you are forgoing other potentially valuable opportunities. \u201cThe right way to look at sunk cost is to say, \u2018I got a gift from my other self, my old self,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Godin said. \u201cOnce you realize that whatever you\u2019re quitting is a gift from your former self, you don\u2019t have to accept.\u201d\u201cIt definitely is kind of an issue of ego or self-esteem because we believe that we want to be a success, and in our eyes, quitting is a type of failure,\u201d said Dr. Kristin Neff, an associate professor at the University of Texas who specializes in educational psychology. It\u2019s this association with failure that makes it emotionally painful to accept quitting things, Dr. Neff said.Still, quitting at the right time is difficult. So how do you know when to grind out your goal and when to quit it and pivot?Dr. Neff recommended that you pretend you are giving advice to a good friend or family member who is in the exact situation.\u201cWe tend to be wiser and more supportive for others than we are to ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think about it, it gives you some perspective you aren\u2019t thinking about.\u201d\u201cWhen you travel around frequently, you don\u2019t get an opportunity to build a deep history with people, so the friendships end up being more superficial and more short term,\u201d Mr. Manson said. And that can wear on you emotionally, according to Mr. Manson. The point is, once you figure out the associated costs with your goals, you can assess whether it is attainable with the current resources that you have available to you, Mr. Godin said. And more important, you know what you need to quit and give up in order to get there. But when it comes down to it, quitting, even if it\u2019s something small, can be a real struggle. The solution, Dr. Neff said, is to take your ego out of the picture. When you focus on protecting your ego, you focus on the wrong questions, like \u201cAm I a failure?\u201d or \u201cAm I good enough?\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Saying #MeToo Changed Their Lives", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "Turns out it was just the beginning. People passed me notes on airplanes thanking me. Men and women. I actually just reread three notes that I kept on my bedside table. The themes are similar: thank you so much, I\u2019ve had my own experiences with harassment and sexual assault, you\u2019ve been so brave, you made it easier for me.One woman was on her way to her sister\u2019s college graduation. The sister was graduating with her rapist. On one flight, I had my Time\u2019s Up T-shirt on, and when I got off the airplane people had lined up to thank me.[On her lawsuit] Sexual harassment in the workplace damages economic opportunity. The power dynamics at play are revealed in a worker\u2019s trajectory and in her paycheck. Being able to have the legal basis for remedy is crucial. The promotion that doesn\u2019t materialize, the shift that\u2019s reassigned, the opportunities for advantageous overtime \u2026 those are all ways that women are punished. Bringing that to light and having economic and legal remedy is an integral part of the strategy of moving the American work force forward.A few months ago, I was driving in rural Tennessee, listening to a report on #MeToo in the Russian Parliament. I had such wonder, knowing that in some way it started with our conversation. I did what I did because it was the right thing to do and I trusted that things would fall into place.Now I want joyfully to shout from the rooftops, everyone come forward, everyone come forward. Everyone has to make their decisions, but I think we can safely say millions of others are here to offer support and hope. Nobody can do it for me, but I don\u2019t have to do it alone.I think my favorite responses have been from men who say hearing my story inspired them to make company changes. That has made it really worth it for me.My phone has been ringing off the hook. I had an invitation to close out the Women\u2019s March in Chicago, which was phenomenal. I take every opportunity that comes my way because I know right now, in this moment, there are women who are still working in the plant and across other industries that are fearful of speaking.The apology from Ford was important because it is a recognition, but now the work has to happen.Ms. Walsh, who had been a guest on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Reilly broke his promise to make her a contributor after she declined an invitation to his hotel suite in 2013. Mr. O\u2019Reilly has vehemently denied the allegations of sexual harassment against him. Ms. Walsh now works as an adjunct professor of psychology at California State University, Channel Islands, and as a radio host for KFI AM 640 with iHeartMedia.I was stunned by positive messages that came at me on social media. The best part is that I received an enormous amount of support from men. They told me awful stories of having to watch lecherous men manipulate women and because of the male code or their rank, they were powerless to complain.Although I worried that this would hurt my business (I work in radio and sponsors are everything), somehow this increased my credibility. Suddenly all kinds of ethical companies wanted me to represent their brands.I didn\u2019t want it to be just about me and my validation and my revenge. I wanted others to have a sense of resolution and relief from the trauma, the harassment, the fear and the blame and the self-shaming. These are vulnerable young women who depend on him for their paycheck.It was really about power and domination of women. There were women who really liked him and were flirty with him. A lot of women did love him back. I think he would call himself a feminist, if you asked him. It doesn\u2019t really shock me any more. It fills me with sadness.Ms. Dixon said she was later sexually harassed repeatedly while working under another record label boss, L.A. Reid, subsequently driving her from the music industry. Mr. Reid did not respond directly to Ms. Dixon\u2019s claims, but apologized generally in a statement for ever saying \u201canything capable of being misinterpreted.\u201dIt was like a bomb going off.These are incredibly powerful men. They\u2019re cultural icons, they\u2019re business icons. So just the idea that I was kicking the hornet\u2019s nest with these two really huge people, I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.It\u2019s very hard as a black woman to call out powerful black men because we have no heroes to spare. We are always, still, fighting this uphill battle, always trying to overcome this myth of the predatory black man. So the last thing you want to do is contribute to that in any way. It\u2019s complicated as a black woman \u2014 do you take it for the team? Which is what I did for 22 years. Or do you insist that you, too, deserve dignity, physical safety and respect? That was very hard for me and it\u2019s literally why I kept the secret for all these years. I didn\u2019t want to tear down a black man, let alone two. But what they did was wrong.On the other hand, I didn\u2019t want black women to be left out of the #MeToo moment. And I did not want to miss this opportunity to be heard and believed.I would say that it certainly has been an impetus for me to make music again. It\u2019s a huge source of joy and personal satisfaction for me. And I think I\u2019m good at it. So it\u2019s been a loss for me not to be able to make records. Because of the article I\u2019ve been contacted by aspiring artists, one of whom I\u2019m signing to a label I am setting up specifically to make her record. That would not have happened if I hadn\u2019t resurfaced and reminded myself \u2014 and have others reminded of \u2014 what I do.A selection of Pulitzer-winning investigationsWeinstein\u2019s Complicity MachineDEC. 5, 2017The producer Harvey Weinstein relied on powerful relationships across industries to provide him with cover as accusations of sexual misconduct piled up for decades.Women in Tech Speak Frankly on Culture of HarassmentJUN. 30, 2017More than two dozen women in the tech start-up industry spoke to The New York Times about being sexually harassed by investors and mentors.Bill O\u2019Reilly Settled New Harassment Claim, Then Fox Renewed His ContractOCT. 21, 2017In January, the Fox News host was said to have agreed to a $32 million settlement with a former network analyst, the largest of his known payouts.Louis C.K. Is Accused by 5 Women of Sexual MisconductNOV. 9, 2017As the powerful comedian found success by talking about his hang-ups, he was also asking female comics and co-workers to watch him masturbate.Although Vornado, the Armory Show\u2019s parent company, acknowledged at the time in a letter to Ms. Harris that Mr. Genocchio had \u201creferred to another female employee as arm candy and previously referred to others as sweetie,\u201d the company said that Mr. Genocchio had apologized and ceased his behavior; it also eliminated Ms. Harris\u2019s job. Mr. Genocchio, who denied acting inappropriately, was ultimately removed from his position and has since become a partner at Galerie Gmurzynska.I couldn\u2019t really say what had happened when I left; I just kind of slipped out. I did not want to say anything because I did not want to jeopardize any negotiation.You do what you have to do just to get out of a situation. I didn\u2019t have anything to lose at this point. I\u2019m really not looking for a big full-time job. But let\u2019s say you\u2019re in your 30s, you\u2019re still in the business and you don\u2019t want to be ostracized, there is that stigma. The worst thing for me was I didn\u2019t get the support from other women in the office, even though they had come and complained to me. They didn\u2019t want to lose their jobs. I get it.After the article, my daughter posted on Facebook: \u2018My mother, social justice warrior.\u2019 I really kind of got elevated in her eyes. I\u2019m proud of myself.This is a system that has existed for thousands of years, and now you cannot behave that way. The psychological implications for those of us who have been exploited by men in power are so much to process, because we\u2019ve built our identities and defense systems and strength out of protecting ourselves against this kind of system. For a mother of a 14-year-old girl, it\u2019s overwhelming to know we\u2019re living in a culture where ramifications exist for this kind of thing.There\u2019s a veil of shame that\u2019s been lifted off this whole thing. There\u2019s this amazing feeling of knit-togetherness in the female community. [Many] women don\u2019t have anything to leverage to protect themselves. That\u2019s why it felt so urgent and upsetting and I felt na\u00efve for not having gone through the mental exercise of postulating what the version was for a single woman trying to make ends meet.I was not prepared for what it would feel like to feel silenced, especially once I saw structurally how that\u2019s actually the problem.I can\u2019t talk about what happened, I can\u2019t tell you if it happened more than once, I can\u2019t tell you who else was there when it happened or if I was alone. I can\u2019t tell you how it made me feel, I can\u2019t tell you about the power dynamic between myself and the person or persons the incident happened with.I can\u2019t tell you who I reported it to at the company, nor what their response was. I can\u2019t even tell you if or how their response changed over time. I can\u2019t tell you who I asked for advice, or what they told me. I can\u2019t tell you what conditions I signed the agreement under, and I can\u2019t tell you what was said to me before or after I signed the agreement.I would love to share with other people out there, men, women, whoever, encourage everyone to view NDAs with care. Because when you sign one, you\u2019re signing away your constitutional right to free speech.The question is maybe less about, Should we expect humans to behave perfectly, and more about, What are those mechanisms in place when things don\u2019t go perfectly, and when someone has their rights infringed on?Some who wrote me said they had been abused at home or elsewhere, the article motivating them to want to share their own experiences. I have gained a lot of satisfaction from the grown men that have come up to me, resonating, because men need so badly to do just that \u2014 resonate together, to express their feelings.Though the article provided a deep sense of relief and brought more closure to the abuse I went through, it has in the meantime opened up other issues that were exacerbated by the abuse, though not directly related. Issues such as my own sense of confidence, and why I was one of the ones chosen.The aftermath has provided a new search, one where I am learning to forgive myself for all that I have not accomplished and instead be thankful for what I have done.It\u2019s been about 10 1/2 months now, and I\u2019m finally for the first time starting to come around and understand the role that I was able to play.Now I walk around being able to look people in the eye and acknowledge a sincere compliment. A few days, weeks, and even months after these stories were written I carried a lot of shamefulness around. I couldn\u2019t have predicted that it would take this long. My voice and my story helped to ignite what became this global cause and movement, and it took on such a life of its own that I really didn\u2019t have time to breathe, or think about it, or come up for air.In my case, there was really overwhelming evidence, and whether I knew it at the time, I would be able to eventually do something with all of the text messages, the emails, the voice messages.I was sure glad that I had that paper trail because it made me realize as I looked back to see that yeah, what I had gone through was not just in my head.One of the most satisfying things was to see my daughter\u2019s reaction, because she was just like, \u2018Wow, Mom, this is so cool, this is so badass, you did the right thing and more power to you.\u2019 She is 23 now and she just started to work. The young women today have a different attitude. They are much less willing to put up with things.Back then you said, \u2018I don\u2019t have anywhere to go with this and that\u2019s just the way guys are,\u2019 but now things are different. Now people will finally listen to these stories instead of dismissing them. Now we talk because now the culture is listening to us.When the article dropped, my anxiety skyrocketed. Strangers recognized me from the internet, and people I hadn\u2019t spoken to in years texted me. But I have fewer friends at Vice than ever. Only one man I worked with at Vice reached out to me in the days following, and it was expected \u2014 a good friend who knows me very well. The rest were women. And even then, far fewer than I\u2019d hoped. It was incredible because all of these people I\u2019d considered family at one point just \u2026 weren\u2019t there.A few other former co-workers reached out in time, but even so, it was like every straight man I\u2019d worked with at Vice was terrified that perhaps they, too, had harassed me at some point, so best to not say anything at all, best not to apologize lest it looks like an admission of guilt, I suppose. I think men are so used to the office-place power dynamic they don\u2019t realize what they\u2019re doing is permanently damaging to women.I choose not to have even moderately close relationships with co-workers now. I go to work, do my job and go home. The last time I made my work my home and my colleagues my family, I lost everything. And I lost myself. That\u2019s not happening again.I just finished directing this new play, called \u2018How to Defend Yourself,\u2019 at a new play festival here [in San Diego], about a college student who has been raped by a fraternity member and one of her sorority sisters starts a self-defense class. It\u2019s been amazing to work on it, and ultimately it\u2019s healing, but there were times when I\u2019d have to take a break and go outside and cry or be mad.It feels like this was a moment where a huge veil came off, and when we have been able to see what we could not see before. I\u2019m really grateful for that. It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s the way we evolve.It feels terrifying to speak on the record. Once you jump off the cliff and you say it, you realize that actually there is no cliff. It turns into a door that\u2019s open and there\u2019s all these people standing on the other side and they\u2019re literally saying, \u2018Me too.\u2019I was absolutely shocked by some of the stories I heard from ballerinas I thought were untouchable. That floored me. These were queens. You\u2019re conditioned to not complain. You\u2019re conditioned to accept a certain style of communication and a certain way of being treated. Now that company is going to turn into something we never thought it could be. We all want to change it; it needs to change.She said it was the final act in a long string of incidents with both men that that included attempts by Mr. Batali to touch her breasts and engage her in lewd conversation. Mr. Batali said at the time of publication in December that he didn\u2019t remember specific incidents, but \u201cthere is no question I have behaved terribly.\u201d In a statement, Mr. Friedman acknowledged behavior that was \u201cabrasive, rude, and frankly wrong\u201d but also said that \u201csome incidents were not as described,\u201d without responding specifically to any woman\u2019s account.Before this happened I\u2019d invested five years in seeing a therapist on a weekly basis and now it\u2019s become clear that what I really needed to do in order to heal myself was end the oppressive silence that I\u2019ve been shaming myself with and speak \u2014 more like, shout \u2014 my truth.I feel like I\u2019ve finally been given permission to hang up an extremely worn-out pair of tap dancing shoes, the shoes I used to dance around the bloated egos and salacious behavior of power-driven men for decades. I finally feel like myself again.Related coverageFord Apologizes for Sexual Harassment at Chicago FactoriesDEC. 12, 2017The company\u2019s chief executive released an apology two days after a New York Times article detailed decades of misconduct.Chuck Close Is Accused of Harassment.

{"Headline": "Doctors Don\u2019t Know Why This Teenager Can\u2019t Keep Down Food and Drink. Can You Help?", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "Help Dr. Lisa Sanders get to the bottom of unsolved medical mysteries.\u201cI don\u2019t know where to go from here,\u201d the doctor said to the 14-year-old girl, Lashay, and her anxious mother. The girl had been in the Intermountain Primary Children\u2019s Hospital in Salt Lake City for nearly a week. Her pediatrician had admitted her there because for the past 2 months the girl had been unable to keep anything she ate or drank in her system. Just about any food or drink, no matter what it was, seemed to come right back minutes or sometimes hours after being consumed. She\u2019d lost nearly 10 pounds. It was strange and terrifying. She had no nausea, no abdominal pain, no diarrhea. She did have a mild headache, and her eyes felt a little sensitive to light. Her mother was worried that her child wasn\u2019t getting enough into her system to keep her alive.Everything seemed to start just after a family vacation in Costa Rica over Thanksgiving. Lashay and her parents, along with her sister, spent the first day hiking in the beachside forest of Manuel Antonio National Park. They were an active family and spent all their vacations engaged in sports and other activities. Suddenly, a large raccoon ran up the path and threw itself on Lashay\u2019s foot. She screamed, and the raccoon bolted up and took off. The girl\u2019s foot wasn\u2019t bleeding, but her skin was broken by what looked like a scratch or a scrape. There was no puncture wound. They cleaned the area with alcohol and turned their attention to the frightened girl. But she was soon enjoying the rest of their vacation \u2014 swimming in the beautiful blue waters of the rivers and the Pacific, white-water rafting, ziplining down forested hills and, of course, more hiking.The raccoon attack seemed to fade into the background, but it didn\u2019t stay there. When Lashay and her family got home to their small suburban Utah town, both she and her mom came down with some kind of gastrointestinal problem. The mother had diarrhea and a headache. Lashay had a headache, too, along with repeated episodes of vomiting. Over the next several days, the mother got better, but Lashay did not. Suddenly, her mother remembered the raccoon scratch. Why would this nocturnal animal attack her daughter in broad daylight? A single word came to mind: rabies.She took Lashay to see her pediatrician, who shared her concerns. He instructed her to take the girl to the emergency department. The doctors there would know if Lashay needed the vaccine to prevent rabies.\u2193A week later, Lashay was back in the E.D., not because she was worse, but because she wasn\u2019t any better. She continued to vomit \u2014 often several times a day after eating or drinking just about anything. She had no nausea or diarrhea. Indeed she had been constipated for most of the past weeks. Other than the persistent vomiting, she had no symptoms of any illness. Her exam was likewise quite benign.\u2193Throughout all of these visits and tests, Lashay continued to vomit several times a day. The infectious-disease specialist was worried that the persistent vomiting was making the girl dehydrated, and she sent her back to Primary Children\u2019s Hospital to expedite the rest of the work-up.Lashay spent four days in the hospital and got a thorough and thoughtful evaluation. She was seen by a slew of doctors: the infectious-disease specialist who admitted her, a second neurologist, a gastroenterologist and a psychologist. In addition, because Lashay had started to feel dizzy when she stood up, she was seen by a physical therapist as well. The infectious-disease specialist again sent blood and stool to look for additional infections. Again, the results were all normal. A spinal tap was performed and fluid taken; it was normal. The gastroenterologist performed an endoscopy: There were a few white blood cells found at the base of the esophagus \u2014 not uncommon in the setting of chronic reflux \u2014 but otherwise normal.By the end of the fourth day, the doctors had found nothing. The pediatric gastroenterologist had made a practice of going each evening to check up on Lashay and review the results of the studies with her and her mom. On their fourth night in the hospital, he sat, as usual, on the bed next to Lashay. But his normally cheerful demeanor was gone. He seemed quieter. He went over Lashay\u2019s time in the hospital and the work-up that had been done so far. None of the tests done by any of the subspecialists had shown anything wrong. He just wasn\u2019t sure what else they could do for the young woman.\u2193Back at home, Lashay was vomiting 10 to 15 times a day. Her mother decided to take her to the other hospital system in Salt Lake City, the University of Utah Health Medical Center, for a second opinion. The care provider there sent Lashay back to Intermountain Primary Children\u2019s Hospital.A new team of doctors focused on disorders caused by abnormalities in the GI tract rather than any ongoing pathological process. Most reasonable pathology, they suggested, had been ruled out by the extensive testing done during her first hospital stay and before.Functional disorders can be triggered by infections or other types of pathology but continue long after the initial event has resolved. The team first thought she might have what is known as cyclic vomiting syndrome (C.V.S.). This is an unusual disorder seen primarily in children when episodes of nausea and vomiting alternate with periods of good health. The episodes of vomiting are often triggered by physical or emotional stressors and have a stereotyped presentation, so that while different children with the disorder might have different ways of being sick, each time an individual child gets sick, the episodes are very similar. The disorder is often associated with migraine headaches. Most children with C.V.S. have a family history of migraines, and up to 75 percent will develop migraines themselves by age 18. C.V.S. is often treated the way migraines are: with daily medications either to prevent the headaches, or those taken once the headache has started, to end it quickly.Diagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times, Netflix and Dr. Lisa Sanders that harnesses the power of you, our readers, to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions. Your ideas could potentially help save a life. Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.The pediatric gastroenterologist agreed that the girl had a functional illness, but he wasn\u2019t convinced it was C.V.S. He observed that the patient did not exhibit the violent retching of vomiting, but instead had a rather effortless and painless regurgitation of food and liquids from the stomach into her mouth. This suggested that Lashay may have something known as rumination syndrome. In this disorder, the muscles in the stomach and esophagus somehow run backward, and recently consumed food or drink travel out of the stomach, up the esophagus and into the mouth. It is either then spit out or swallowed. It is not clear what triggers this phenomenon, but it has been associated with both psychological stimuli, like mood disorders, or physical stimuli, like constipation.Treatment for rumination syndrome is primarily behavioral. Patients are taught how to identify the abnormal muscle contractions and use deep breathing exercises to inhibit the abnormal backflow. If that doesn\u2019t work, smooth muscle relaxant medications can be used to inhibit the reverse movements. (A test done a few months later, measuring the squeeze of the stomach muscles, seemed to confirm this diagnosis.)\u2193After a few days, Lashay was sent home with a medicine to make her food move a little more quickly though her stomach and GI tract and instructions on how to continue to work on the problem. Although Lashay worked with specialists to try to use relaxation techniques to help her keep her food down, she didn\u2019t notice much of a difference, and after a few weeks she stopped using the technique.Lashay\u2019s mother didn\u2019t fully accept the diagnosis of rumination and kept searching for doctors who could figure out why her daughter couldn\u2019t keep anything down. She took her daughter regularly to get intravenous fluids when she felt that her daughter was dehydrated. The IV fluids were particularly effective in treating the headaches, which were now almost constant. They also helped with her lightheadedness, which had been rare but was now something she had most of the time. A new gastroenterologist tried multiple courses of Flagyl, an antibiotic often used to treat intestinal infections, and that seemed to help. But the benefit disappeared when the antibiotic was stopped, which led that doctor to conclude that her symptoms were probably not caused by an infection.Finally, Lashay was referred to a doctor who specializes in a disorder known as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome or POTS. This is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system \u2014 the system in charge of maintaining body functions over which we have little conscious control, like heart rate, blood pressure and digestion.A common pathological feature of POTS is difficulty getting blood to the brain when going from lying down to standing up. Normally when you stand up, the nervous system immediately implements a series of changes to get blood from the lower body, where it is pulled by gravity, up to the head where it is needed. To do this, nerves tell blood vessels in the legs to squeeze, sending blood upward. At the same time, other nerves tell the heart to beat a little faster to distribute the arriving blood more quickly. These changes are immediate and usually work so quickly that they are not even noticed. But in those with POTS, this system doesn\u2019t work well; it takes blood a long time to get to the brain, and the patient feels lightheaded and often nauseated and can even faint.This doctor checked Lashay\u2019s blood pressure and heart rate when she was lying down and then after she stood up. In most people, the heart rate might increase and blood pressure might fall, initially but will quickly recover. If someone is dehydrated, her blood pressure will go down, and the heart can race for up to 15 minutes. But in someone with POTS, standing after lying down will cause the heart rate to go up, but the blood pressure will stay the same. In Lashay\u2019s case, the heart rate went up and the blood pressure dropped. The doctor thought she was probably dehydrated and gave her some intravenous fluids. He repeated the test. Again when she stood up, her heart raced and her blood pressure plummeted. Despite that, the doctor thought it was likely that the patient did in fact have POTS.Lashay is now 17. She\u2019s been going through this for nearly three years. At this point she takes no medicines except a painkiller when her headaches get too severe. She eats small meals and has learned to swallow the food that she regurgitates \u2014 a trick that has helped her stop losing weight. She still needs intravenous fluids three or four times a week. She\u2019s trying to get out of bed and exercise at least every couple of days. But she has pains in her neck and back that make any movement difficult. She\u2019s not sure what she has or what to do next.What do you think is going on here? Do you recognize this condition? Could this be cyclic vomiting or ruminations syndrome? Could it be some type of atypical POTS? Or is it something else altogether? What should Lashay and her doctors look at next?Enter your comments below, and briefly describe your thinking; how a diagnosis is made is often as revealing as the diagnosis itself. All answers will be reviewed, and the most promising diagnoses will be shared with the patient and her primary-care physician.I\u2019ll post an update in the coming days.First and last preferred, please.Thank you for your submission.Illustration by Andreas Samuelsson.

{"Headline": "How Natasha Lyonne and Lizzi Bougatsos Became Best Friends", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFifteen years after the wild child days that made them famous, the actress and the musician find themselves sharing something entirely new: maturity. (Sort of.)Meanwhile, the sixth season of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d is out next month, with a seventh already on order. Lyonne is juggling her longstanding role in that show with a brand new one in a coming Netflix series called \u201cRussian Doll.\u201d She stars in the show, and also cocreated, wrote and executive-produced it alongside Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland. (Lyonne was tight-lipped about the details, but did offer that it\u2019s a sort of \u201cexistential adventure show.\u201d)On a recent summer afternoon, Lyonne and Bougatsos spent about an hour and a half on the phone, reminiscing and reflecting \u2014 and, mostly, cracking each other up.But she was in a band, and when she passed away, her husband, Colin, asked me to cover her songs, and they were amazing. I asked three guys [to play with me]; they already had a band called Death and Dying. They were like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you be our singer?\u201d So that happened in 2002, and it was kind of natural after playing Pat Hearn\u2019s songs. That\u2019s how Gang Gang started. I think being a young person is kind of like fumbling in the dark, and if you\u2019re lucky there are some happy accidents. Finally, now, is when the good work can start happening. The artist\u2019s terror, or even the human being\u2019s dilemma, is this idea of being so concerned with what people think of us and waiting for outside approval on ideas we have or things we do. And I think there\u2019s something else that occurs later where we begin to have such a deeper sense of self and are able to go to the self for security. So for example, on \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d I feel like now I really can fully embody that character. As I\u2019ve become more comfortable there, I can actually just do the work, quite simply, and be in character and really feel supported by these other women, by Netflix, by Jenji [Kohan, the showrunner of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d]. There\u2019s a real sense of, \u201cI\u2019m in the right place.\u201d That\u2019s what friendship has done, too \u2014 all these friendships that really make you feel like you\u2019re on the right path. And \u201cRussian Doll,\u201d this new show, is very much like that. Everything is autobiography, and you don\u2019t even realize that you\u2019ve been making this greater thing the whole way through. The human condition is so prone to regret and self-cudgeling \u2014 and then you realize how it all starts tying together. Of course, the problematic nature of mortality is that it probably happens just in time for you to know you\u2019re going to die pretty soon. But the good news is there seem to be a few key years there where you can actually do something with that information.This interview has been edited and condensed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018GLOW\u2019 Is Back. Here\u2019s Where We Left Off.", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWho\u2019s ready to rumble? Last summer\u2019s Netflix hit \u201cGLOW\u201d will return for a second season on Friday, with 10 new episodes that follow the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling in the aftermath of their pilot shoot. The first season didn\u2019t have an especially complicated plot: A ragtag crew of actresses, athletes and dilettantes in 1980s Los Angeles coalesces into a passable all-women\u2019s professional wrestling league, just in time for their colorful personas to face off in the ring. But the show does feature a cast so enormous that you may have forgotten a few faces over the past year.Before you watch, jog your memory with this cheat sheet on who\u2019s who and where we left each character at the end of last season.Season 1 was an emotional whirlwind for the protagonist of \u201cGLOW,\u201d the broke aspiring actress Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie). After years of trying and failing to get work as a serious thespian, she ends up at an audition for GLOW \u2014 and she secures the gig only after her best friend, Debbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin), appears at the gym to pound her for sleeping with her husband, Mark (Rich Sommer). As the women\u2019s rivalry rages, Ruth gets an abortion, and the show teases a possible romance between her and the show\u2019s cranky director, Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron). In the finale, she completes her transformation into the cartoonish Soviet heel Zoya the Destroya and proves that she has the vision to bring her fellow wrestlers together. She is even on her way to patching things up with Debbie, although the healing process isn\u2019t quite over. \u201cYou want to grab a drink?\u201d Ruth asks when the pilot shoot wraps. \u201cNo,\u201d Debbie replies. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet.\u201dAt the beginning of the Season 1 finale, the future of the league looked uncertain, with Debbie driving off in her station wagon and Ruth reporting sadly that her ex-friend is quitting the show and going home to her husband and baby. A retired soap-opera actress, Debbie knows she\u2019s the star of GLOW, and she loves rubbing Ruth\u2019s face in it. But it turns out that the women have actually declared a truce for long enough to plot a killer surprise: Debbie shows up at the taping and rises from the audience to challenge Zoya. The scheme gives her patriotic heroine character, Liberty Belle, an origin story. It also further alienates Debbie from Mark, who dismisses GLOW as \u201csilly.\u201dSam is a mess. A B-movie director with artistic pretensions, he drowns his fears of mediocrity in drugs, alcohol and whichever woman happens to be closest to him. As his and Ruth\u2019s love-hate flirtation simmers, Sam briefly shacks up with the beautiful, flighty wrestler Rhonda Richardson (Kate Nash). Then, he tries to kiss his superfan \u2014 and GLOW\u2019s youngest cast member \u2014 Justine Biagi (Britt Baron) at a party, only to learn that the girl is actually his high-school-aged daughter. This disturbing news touches off a three-day drinking binge that almost causes Sam to miss the entire pilot shoot. In the end, though, he arrives in time to put his own spin on the match and start making amends with Justine.Poor Justine. A teenage punk, she traveled all the way from L.A. to Sacramento to meet her father, whom she\u2019d spent years idolizing from afar, only to have the creep make a move on her. After their close call with incest, she flees the shabby motel where the GLOW girls are staying and finds comfort in the arms of her pizza-boy paramour, Billy (Casey Johnson). Her time in the league is over \u2014 she was never in it for the wrestling, anyway. But her relationship with her dad may finally be beginning.No character had a more heartwarming arc in Season 1 than Carmen Wade (Britney Young). The daughter of a men\u2019s wrestling legend who considers lady wrestlers a joke, she secretly auditions for GLOW using the skills she has picked up at home over the years. Because she is a plus-size woman of color who knows how the sexist, racist wrestling industry works, Carmen assumes she\u2019ll play a villain. But GLOW\u2019s producer, Bash Howard (Chris Lowell), picks up on her sweetness and casts her as the \u201cgentle giant\u201d Machu Picchu. In the finale, she conquers her stage fright, wins her match and basks in the love of a crowd that includes her proud father.The money behind the GLOW empire, such as it is, comes from Bash. An obsessive wrestling fan and the heir to the Howard Foods fortune, he invests his wealth in an extremely \u201980s mansion, a butler and a robot that dispenses drugs. Unfortunately, his reckless spending nearly sinks the show. During the pilot shoot, with Sam nowhere to be found, Bash dons a tuxedo, lovingly smears glitter on his eyelids and steps into his dream role as GLOW\u2019s announcer.A hard-working mom with a son at Stanford, Tamm\u00e9 Dawson (played by the real-life professional wrestler Kia Stevens) struggles with the ethics of wrestling as Welfare Queen, a racist African-American stereotype who flaunts her laziness. When she takes her concerns to Sam, he works up a final twist to GLOW\u2019s first match: After Liberty Belle defeats Zoya, Welfare Queen hops onstage and steals her crown. \u201cAmerica, you have turned your back on me long enough!\u201d she shouts. \u201cYou\u2019ve ghettoized my people, trapped us in an endless cycle of poverty.\u201dWelfare Queen isn\u2019t the only noxious caricature pushed onto the Gorgeous Ladies. Sam and Bash force the quiet Indian-American student Arthie Premkumar (Sunita Mani) to play Beirut the Mad Bomber, a Lebanese terrorist who growls and ululates. Her discomfort with the role peaks in the finale, when she wrestles for the first time and the audience hurls slurs \u2014 and a beer can \u2014 at her.A veteran stuntwoman who has had trouble getting work since the \u201970s heyday of blaxploitation cinema, Cherry Bang (Sydelle Noel) is both a wrestler and the league\u2019s trainer. Her frustrating back story also includes a crushing miscarriage and a short-lived fling with Sam, but her kind, supportive marriage to another actor, Keith Bang (Bashir Salahuddin), keeps her from giving up. In the finale, she is offered a lead role on a detective show and must decide whether to leave GLOW.Sheila the She-Wolf (Gayle Rankin) is the same person inside and outside the ring \u2014 and that person happens to identify as a wolf. One illuminating episode from Season 1 begins by revealing Sheila\u2019s unorthodox morning routine: She paints her perfect teeth yellow and covers her neat, blonde hair with a long, ratty, black wig. Initially standoffish, she starts to bond with the other wrestlers when Ruth throws a roller-skating party for Sheila\u2019s birthday.GLOW\u2019s Britannica is \u201cthe smartest woman in the world.\u201d The woman behind her, however, is Rhonda Richardson, a British model who\u2019s a bit of a flake. But her heart is in the right place: Sam assumes that she was only sleeping with him to help her career, only to find out after breaking things off that she actually had feelings for him.Melanie Rosen (Jackie Tohn) is a Sunset Strip party girl, just like her GLOW alter ego, Melrose. She\u2019s a prankster, a hedonist and a spoiled brat \u2014 all of which puts her at odds with the hard-working, no-nonsense Cherry. In the finale, Melrose enters the ring on the shoulders of two shirtless bellboys.Jenny Chey (Ellen Wong) is Cambodian-American, and fortune cookies were invented in America, but that doesn\u2019t stop her from getting cast as a Chinese heel named Fortune Cookie. Although \u201cGLOW\u201d hasn\u2019t revealed much about her personal life, her and Ruth\u2019s Communist tag-team schtick was a highlight of the league\u2019s first live event.An actual Olympic medalist, Reggie Walsh (Marianna Palka) dreams up the role of Liberty Belle for herself. Unfortunately for her, Debbie is hotter, blonder and more feminine. Reggie ends up playing a half-baked viking villain. In a final indignity, her match with Junkchain is interrupted when Cherry pauses to tell Keith, who happens to be the referee, about her new job offer.Stacey Beswick (Kimmy Gatewood) and Dawn Rivecca (Rebekka Johnson) are hairdressers whose goofy banter inspires Sam to cast them as the elderly, walker-wielding Beatdown Biddies. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t remember much more about them; neither character has really stepped into the spotlight yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amy Hargreaves\u2019s Zen Moment", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat I Love10 PhotosA child and teen actor, Ms. Hargreaves appeared in a string of television commercials, including pitches for Cheerios, Windex, AT&T, Chevrolet and Murphy Oil Soap. And when her parents preached the gospel of frugality and prudence, young Amy listened.So it was that by the age of 24, she had the wherewithal to buy a charming little one-bedroom apartment with a fireplace and balcony in a self-managed co-op on East 78th Street.If Ms. Hargreaves had been able to figure out a way to affix a second bedroom to the apartment, she would likely be there still (and perhaps hanging on as treasurer). But what with marriage, in 1999, to Renaud Selm\u00e8s, the birth of a son in 2000 and the attendant acquisition of baby detritus, a move was unavoidable. This point was driven home to Ms. Hargreaves when she found herself using a dearly beloved orange Ligne Roset sideboard as a changing table.She sold, more than doubling her money (see what happens when you heed your parents?), and used the proceeds to buy a loft in Spanish Harlem. The space was ample, a good thing because the couple had their second child, a daughter, in 2003.Alas, size isn\u2019t everything. By 2007, Ms. Hargreaves\u2019s son was in school on the Upper East Side and the area around the family\u2019s apartment started to feel less safe.\u201cThere were shootings in the neighborhood and there was drug activity on our block,\u201d Ms. Hargreaves recalled. \u201cIt never really bothered me and honestly the drug dealers in the store front next door were very nice to me and would help me dig out my car, but I didn\u2019t want to be with my kids in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201dShe remembered a building she had admired in her old neighborhood, but learned after attending an open house or two that the apartments were relatively small. A pair of combinable side-by-side units was the answer to her prayers. \u201cWe jumped on it real quick,\u201d Ms. Hargreaves said.High ceilings and mahogany-framed triple-hung windows, it turned out, compensated for a lot.Settling in has been a process. The family lived in the two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment while renovations commenced on the one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment; these included the addition of a closet and the plumbing necessary for a washer and dryer.\u201cThe day they came and installed the machines and turned on the water and everything worked, I was so happy I actually cried,\u201d Ms. Hargreaves recalled, unashamedly hugging the stacked appliances. \u201cTo raise a child without a washer in the house, I don\u2019t know how people do it: school uniforms, gym clothes, the kid throwing up from a stomach virus.\u201dShe added: \u201cThat\u2019s my Zen moment: doing laundry.\u201d\u201cMy ex-husband comes over for Christmas Eve, and we have dinner on his mother\u2019s china,\u201d Ms. Hargreaves said. \u201cHe\u2019s got some stuff; I\u2019ve got some stuff. If he wants something, he can have it back. I don\u2019t care. We wing it.\u201dShe is similarly relaxed about the d\u00e9cor. It is a mix of pieces that have either practical or sentimental value.The armless sofa from Crate and Barrel, for instance, is the approximate color of dirt, perfect for young children. \u201cThough since my kids are now 15 and 17, I think we can graduate to something else soon,\u201d Ms. Hargreaves said.The upright piano, while not precisely a thing of beauty, was in her childhood home. \u201cMy parents were moving and they told my siblings and me, \u2018Whoever wants to pay for the shipping can have the piano.\u2019 I had the space in my first apartment, and I had the money, so I had it delivered for $500,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s followed us around to other apartments.\u201dThe two tripod stools covered in animal skin are souvenirs from South Africa, where Ms. Hargreaves went for a \u201cHomeland\u201d shoot a few years ago and was fortunate enough to bring her children along for the ride.The large rectangular dining table, bought years ago at a Maurice Villency warehouse sale, was admittedly better suited to the loft in Harlem than to the tight quarters on the Upper East Side. But the dimensions of the table make it suitable not just for large gatherings but also for Ping-Pong, a game that is taken very seriously by the family.\u201cI stand in there, and sometimes the sun shines right in,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if I close my eyes, it\u2019s like I\u2019m taking an outdoor shower at the house of a friend on Fire Island.\u201cBut the neighbors can\u2019t see me!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Wins Exclusive U.K. Rights to Broadcast Some Premier League Matches", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A generation ago, Sky, then an upstart satellite broadcaster, outbid rivals for the rights to televise the Premier League. The deal revolutionized the fortunes of the TV service, and helped turn the British soccer league into one of the world\u2019s most watched \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 in sports.Another transformation now appears to be underway. Amazon, which is increasingly pushing beyond its e-commerce origins, won rights on Thursday to broadcast Premier League games in Britain for the first time.Amazon\u2019s deal highlights the seismic shifts happening in sports and television entertainment, as deep-pocketed digital outlets compete with traditional broadcasters like NBC, Disney and, in Europe, Sky. The fierce battle between Silicon Valley companies and historically dominant studios and broadcasters has extended from developing new scripted shows to broadcasting live sports.The matches that Amazon will broadcast, available to its Prime members in Britain, are relatively minor. It will showcase 20, scheduled at times when there tends to be lower viewership than normal. But Amazon\u2019s victory was in how it can deliver the games: While digital companies have typically bought only the digital streaming rights to sporting events, Amazon\u2019s deal includes the exclusive rights for the matches it shows.\u201cPrime Video continues to drive Prime member adoption and retention,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote.The company has also sought to develop scripted entertainment, earning awards and acclaim with shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d though it still lags behind competitors like Netflix.In Britain, Amazon will share the broadcast rights to the Premier League with two British heavyweights \u2014 Sky Sports and BT Sport. Sky and BT will televise the vast majority of matches on offer, totaling 180 in all. Those matches will be at times that are more likely to garner high levels of viewership.The auction for Premier League broadcast rights was held in February, but only Sky Sports and BT won partial rights at the time.\u201cWe welcome Amazon as an exciting new partner, and we know Prime Video will provide an excellent service on which fans can consume the Premier League,\u201d Richard Scudamore, the Premier League\u2019s executive chairman, said in a statement on Thursday.Digital media companies have long proclaimed an interest in sports rights, but they have largely failed to enter competitive bids for marquee properties. And while sports leagues are eager to increase the number of bidders, they have shown a reluctance to turn over rights wholesale to digital partners, preferring instead to craft deals that include digital streaming on top of traditional TV broadcasting.But the format of the Premier League\u2019s auction makes it easier for digital media companies to compete. While most large rights packages in the United States are for seven seasons or more, the Premier League offers only three-season blocks, lowering the get-in cost. The 200 Premier League games on offer were also split into seven packages of 32 or 20 games each, making it easier for Amazon to dip a toe in the water, albeit in a smaller market than the United States.The revenue for the Premier League rights in Britain is supplemented by income from broadcast deals elsewhere, including in the United States, where NBC televises the matches, and in China, where the digital broadcaster PPTV holds the rights.An earlier version of this article misstated when Amazon took over streaming rights for some N.F.L. games. It was in April 2017, not this year.Prashant S. Rao reported from London, and Kevin Draper from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Comcast and 21st Century Fox in Focus After AT&T-Time Warner Approval", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe battle for the future of media has begun.How quickly are things changing? Netflix recently surpassed Disney to become the most valuable media company at $158 billion.That helps set the stakes for the pending clash between Comcast and The Walt Disney Company as each seeks to own the bulk of 21st Century Fox.The contest will pit Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, against Disney\u2019s Robert A. Iger in what could be a fierce bidding war for a significant chunk of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire.Comcast, which already owns NBCUniversal, has put together a bid of slightly more than $60 billion in cash and contractual assurances that Fox would be paid what is known as a reverse breakup fee \u2014 perhaps as much as $2.5 billion \u2014 in the event a transaction is blocked by the government, the people said. But any regulatory concerns may be allayed by the straightforward approval of the AT&T-Time Warner deal. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington said the agreement could go through without either company divesting any assets.It is hard to overstate how closely Comcast was monitoring the situation. Executives at NBCUniversal had dispatched people to wait in the courtroom to hear the verdict. Mr. Roberts waited at his executive offices at Comcast\u2019s headquarters in Philadelphia, tuned to CNBC and keeping an eye on Twitter. According to a person familiar with the matter, Comcast\u2019s board met Tuesday evening to discuss its revamped bid for Fox, which rebuffed an overture last year.In November, Mr. Roberts traveled to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s estate in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, according to two people familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because it has not been made public. There, over glasses of wine produced from vineyards on the estate, Mr. Roberts broached the possibility of Mr. Murdoch making a deal with Comcast. Mr. Murdoch explained that talks with Disney had already begun, but that the companies were still $4 billion apart on price.Mr. Murdoch said he had wanted $56 billion, which Mr. Roberts then offered, according to the two people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Murdoch said he would take it to the board.The businesses that Mr. Murdoch has agreed to sell include the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios, almost two dozen regional sports networks like the Yankees\u2019 YES channel, a lineup of cable networks that includes FX and a 30 percent ownership stake in the streaming service Hulu.A deal would also include Fox\u2019s 39 percent ownership stake in the European pay TV operator Sky. Comcast has already made an offer to buy the other 61 percent of Sky in a separate deal. (The Fox News cable network, the Fox broadcast stations, the Fox Business Network and the sports network FS1 would not be part of a transaction.)Mr. Murdoch sees Disney\u2019s stock as ultimately more valuable than Comcast\u2019s, according to two people familiar with his thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal was still in process. Since Disney\u2019s bid is in stock, Mr. Murdoch is banking on a rise in the company\u2019s value over time. Comcast\u2019s all-cash offer would also mean an immediate tax hit.Each man vying for a piece of Fox is an accomplished dealmaker.Mr. Roberts spends a great deal of time analyzing merger possibilities and is always on the hunt. One of Comcast\u2019s most successful transactions was for control of NBCUniversal in 2011. In 2014, he bid for Time Warner Cable but walked away after the Justice Department said it was leaning toward blocking the deal.As the head of Disney, Mr. Iger has completed several major acquisitions, including the purchases of Pixar Studios, Lucasfilm and Marvel Entertainment, though all were private transactions that did not require approval of public shareholders.The Fox board has scheduled a shareholder meeting for July 10 to vote on the Disney offer, but that meeting could be moved back if Comcast makes its bid, as it is expected to do as a result of Tuesday\u2019s ruling.AT&T\u2019s victory shows the way forward for the media industry, which has grappled with a sharp slowdown in the past few years. The decline in pay TV subscribers has blunted businesses once thought to be invincible. ESPN, owned by Disney, has seen a significant drop in viewership as younger viewers spend more time on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.Mergers will allow companies to compete for costlier rights to professional sports, seen as perhaps the only way to keep viewers from cutting the cable cord, and to build out their streaming services.The pay TV industry may not be dying, but it is \u201cslowly grinding down,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a founder of research firm MoffettNathanson.Mr. Nathanson said he thought Disney will ultimately succeed in its pursuit of Fox because it has less debt than Comcast.\u201cBut at some point, if the bid is too high from Comcast,\u201d he said, \u201cthen Disney will have to walk away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In recent years, MTV has unabashedly courted new generations of young viewers by revamping \u2014 or just repackaging \u2014 old shows, many of which began airing long before much of its core audience of 18-34-year-olds was even born.Mike Judge\u2019s vulgar animated hit aired on MTV beginning in 1993. It ended in 1997, so he could devote more time to \u201cKing of the Hill,\u201d which premiered that year. \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head\u201d returned in 2011, and was revamped to reflect MTV\u2019s programming evolution: While the eponymous teenage duo used to crack jokes about music videos, in the new version they also commented upon MTV reality shows like \u201cJersey Shore\u201d and \u201c16 and Pregnant.\u201dSince its premiere in 1992, the groundbreaking reality series has never really left, though it has gone through many updates. What began as a bare-bones series about several strangers \u201cpicked to live in a house\u201d in a major American city became more contrived as the show aged and reality TV became its own genre, with familiar tics and beats. The most recent seasons of \u201cReal World\u201d have channeled programs like the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d franchise and MTV\u2019s own \u201cJersey Shore\u201d \u2014 \u201cReal World: Ex-Plosion\u201d and \u201cReal World: Skeletons,\u201d for instance, centered on cast members being ambushed by their exes and others from the past.Essentially \u201cReal World\u201d with an Italian-American conceit, \u201cJersey Shore\u201d was a breakout hit when it premiered in 2009. Its core cast \u2014 including Snooki (Nicole Polizzi), \u201cThe Situation\u201d (Michael Sorrentino) and JWoww (Jennifer Farley) \u2014 parlayed their success into lucrative business deals and social media fame that outlived the show\u2019s conclusion in 2012 after six seasons. (It also spawned a few cast member spinoffs.)After it launched in 1998, \u201cTRL\u201d quickly became a crucial platform for the biggest pop stars of that era, including Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and \u2019N Sync. Viewers voted for their favorite music videos and tuned in each weekday afternoon to watch the host, Carson Daly, count down the top 10 choices and interview celebrity guests.The original incarnation ran for a decade, though the show\u2019s influence mostly petered out long before the end. (Mr. Daly departed in 2003.) The rise of YouTube and other instantly gratifying corners of the internet meant teenagers no longer had to wait for MTV to play the music videos they craved. Artists now promote and premiere new works across multiple streaming platforms, including Snapchat and Instagram, none of which stopped MTV from bringing back \u201cTRL\u201d in 2017.In April, initial reports that MTV had canceled \u201cTRL\u201d proved inaccurate, with the network clarifying that the show was on hiatus but would return in yet another revamped form. It currently airs weekday mornings, is no longer live, and Sway Calloway, an MTV mainstay, is a host.Advertisement"}

We can expect more political power for a behemoth that controls large portions of the American airwaves and has huge revenues to contribute to political ends. And we can expect this vertical monopoly to affect us in other ways that we can\u2019t even envision.You say we should celebrate this decision because President Trump opposed the merger out of a desire to spite CNN. But are you celebrating out of a desire to spite Mr. Trump?In 2017, several liberal senators \u2014 including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Al Franken \u2014 urged the Justice Department to oppose the merger.

{"Headline": "Firefox Is Back. It\u2019s Time to Give It a Try.", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixDo you ever feel that the web is breaking?When shopping online for a toaster oven, you can expect an ad for that oven to stalk you from site to site. If you have just a few web browser tabs open, your laptop battery drains rapidly. And don\u2019t get me started on those videos that automatically play when you\u2019re scrolling through a webpage.The web has reached a new low. It has become an annoying, often toxic and occasionally unsafe place to hang out. More important, it has become an unfair trade: You give up your privacy online, and what you get in return are somewhat convenient services and hyper-targeted ads.Mozilla recently hit the reset button on Firefox. About two years ago, six Mozilla employees were huddled around a bonfire one night in Santa Cruz, Calif., when they began discussing the state of web browsers. Eventually, they concluded there was a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d in the web.\u201cIf they don\u2019t trust the web, they won\u2019t use the web,\u201d Mark Mayo, Mozilla\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview. \u201cThat just felt to us like that actually might be the direction we\u2019re going. And so we started to think about tools and architectures and different approaches.\u201dMost notably, Firefox now offers privacy tools, like a built-in feature for blocking ad trackers and a \u201ccontainer\u201d that can be installed to prevent Facebook from monitoring your activities across the web. Most other browsers don\u2019t include those features.After testing Firefox for the last three months, I found it to be on a par with Chrome in most categories. In the end, Firefox\u2019s thoughtful privacy features persuaded me to make the switch and make it my primary browser.Here\u2019s why you should consider it, too.Firefox especially stood out for some privacy features that are baked into the browser. Inside the privacy settings, you can turn on tracking protection, which blocks online trackers from collecting your browser data across multiple websites. With Chrome, you can install a third-party extension to block trackers \u2014 but the fewer add-ons you have to tack onto your browser, the better.Security experts applauded Mozilla for stepping up its efforts on privacy.\u201cFirefox does seem to have positioned itself as the privacy-friendly browser, and they have been doing a fantastic job improving security as well,\u201d said Cooper Quintin, a security researcher for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital rights nonprofit. \u201cOn the other hand, Google is fundamentally an advertising company, so it\u2019s unlikely that they will ever have a business interest in making Chrome more privacy friendly.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t have privacy without security on the web,\u201d said Parisa Tabriz, a director of engineering for Google who specializes in security.In fact, both Chrome and Firefox have tough security. Both include sandboxing, which isolates processes of the browser so a harmful website doesn\u2019t infect other parts of your machine. So if you loaded a website with malicious code, it would be contained within the webpage so it couldn\u2019t infect your files, webcam and microphone.Google said there was one thing it could do better on: the inclusion of privacy settings to block tracking technology, similar to the tools that Firefox includes.\u201cI think that\u2019s something that we can improve on,\u201d Ms. Tabriz said. \u201cFirefox has some settings that we\u2019re also exploring.\u201dWhich browser is faster?Mozilla\u2019s promise that Firefox consumes less computer memory raises hopes that it should also use less battery life. Yet in my tests on a laptop running a script that automatically reloaded the top 10 news sites, Firefox lasted only a few minutes longer than Chrome before the battery was depleted. On another test, which involved streaming a Netflix video on a loop on each browser, the battery lasted about 20 minutes longer when the Chrome browser was used.Yet the path forward for Mozilla looks increasingly promising for consumers.In addition to the normal Firefox browser, Mozilla offers Firefox Focus, a privacy-centric mobile browser that blocks trackers by default and purges your web browsing history as soon as you close out of a page.These are privacy-conscious web products that Mozilla is in a position to expand on in the long term. The nonprofit has no direct relationship with advertisers; it gets a small sum from search providers like Google and Bing when a search is conducted through their sites using a Firefox product.For Mozilla, there\u2019s a plus side to being the underdog.\u201cThe advantage of when you get beaten down is you kind of drop some of your own ego around your decisions,\u201d Mr. Mayo said. \u201cWe had a lot less to lose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will AT&T Be Able to Handle HBO?", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMedia analysts and tech-industry prognosticators look at AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner and wonder about the future of an industry in flux. Hollywood looks at the deal and wonders what\u2019s going to happen to HBO.The cable network that gave the world \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is the glittering jewel of Time Warner. And now that a federal judge has emphatically rejected the Justice Department\u2019s attempt to block the merger, it is much closer to being the property of a conservatively run company based in Dallas.HBO\u2019s would-be minders are experts in distribution systems and profit margins who know little or nothing about the ego-fueled dramas that help put the show in show business. Will these telecommunications executives be able to put up with the producers, directors and stars whose work gave the network 29 Emmys last year?\u201cHBO\u2019s and AT&T\u2019s cultures also come from a very different financial perspective,\u201d said Gary Arlen, the head of Arlen Communications, a research firm that examines the media and telecommunications industries. \u201cAT&T comes from a legacy of rate regulations, and every expense has to be justified.\u201dAnd on the personal level, how will the relationship go between Richard Plepler, the smooth-talking, perpetually tanned chief executive of HBO, and the man who would be his new boss, Randall Stephenson, a former national chairman of the Boy Scouts of America? The two executives seem as different from each other as the companies they run.\u201cAT&T is very much oriented toward technology, but it still comes from the mentality of pole climbers and operations guy,\u201d Mr. Arlen said.HBO is facing a change in ownership as it finds itself competing for viewers and talent like never before.In 2013, when Mr. Plepler became chief executive of the premium cable network, it was almost alone in its field. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was proving to be an unlikely hit with audiences and critics, and Netflix, a company best known, at the time, for sending DVDs in red envelopes to subscribers nationwide, was not yet a threat. Its first real hit, \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d was just about to start its first season.In the 20 months since the AT&T deal was announced, the competition has grown more intense. Netflix now spends $8 billion on content annually, with Amazon kicking in more than $4 billion for its own programming efforts. Another streaming company, Hulu, has an annual budget of roughly $2.5 billion, a figure that is close to what HBO lays out each year.Once the deal is completed, Mr. Plepler will report to John Stankey. In his more than 30 years at AT&T, Mr. Stankey has held a long list of positions: chief executive of the AT&T entertainment group, group president of telecom operations, chief executive of business solutions.In the coming weeks, Mr. Stankey will go on a corporate good-will tour \u2014 he is expected to a host a forum for HBO employees in New York next week, and he will do the same for the channels in Time Warner\u2019s Turner family, including TBS and TNT.Whatever he says probably won\u2019t change Mr. Plepler\u2019s view that HBO needs to be left alone in order to thrive.\u201cYou have to have a Chinese wall between the creative process and everything else,\u201d Mr. Plepler told The New York Times shortly after the deal was announced in 2016. He added that he would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if AT&T did not embrace that.Since then, AT&T has said the right things \u2014 for the most part.\u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re acquiring a business that\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said at a recent tech conference in California. \u201cIt\u2019s been run very independently. HBO is run independently from Warner Bros., which is run independently from Turner, and it\u2019s been a very good model.\u201dAT&T executives have considered how the company might take advantage of HBO\u2019s creative engine to generate new forms of video for mobile devices. And Mr. Stephenson has stressed the need to amplify HBO\u2019s streaming service.\u201cI\u2019m anxious to kind of move the direct-to-consumer platforms as aggressively as possible,\u201d he said at the tech conference.Those statements suggest that AT&T wouldn\u2019t get in Mr. Plepler\u2019s way. But at another conference, Mr. Stephenson let slip one comment that hinted at a more aggressive brand of corporate oversight.\u201cIt will cause Plepler at HBO to panic when I say this,\u201d he said, \u201cbut can you begin to think about things like \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 as an example, where, in a mobile environment, a 60-minute episode may not be the best experience? Should you think about 20-minute episodes?\u201dAlthough HBO still generates big revenue ($6.3 billion last year), its status as the ultimate prestige network is under some threat. While it has led all TV networks in Emmy nominations for 17 consecutive years, that gap is narrowing. Netflix, which makes shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d had 20 fewer nominations than HBO last year; three years ago that gap was more than 90.And in an effort to be all things to all viewers, Netflix turns out programming in dramas, comedies, stand-up specials, documentary series and unscripted reality shows. To counter that approach, HBO executives have begun describing their network as the home of curated content, something like a high-end content boutique.But that strategy comes with some risk.With far fewer releases each year than Netflix, each of HBO\u2019s shows is under more pressure to succeed. \u201cHere and Now,\u201d a drama from Alan Ball that premiered this year, has already been canceled. \u201cSuccession,\u201d the network\u2019s new drama about a warring media family, has had so-so ratings and mixed reviews, but HBO has already renewed it for a second season.\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the most popular series in the network\u2019s history, has six episodes left before it bows out. The network has ordered a pilot for a potential spinoff series, with at least three others in development. \u201cWestworld\u201d has had steady ratings in its second season, drawing more than two million viewers an episode, according to Nielsen\u2019s delayed-viewing data. That\u2019s bigger than anything else on premium cable right now.The network\u2019s next big bet is on a limited series starring Amy Adams and directed by the \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d which premieres in July. If HBO executives knew that \u201cHere and Now\u201d was a miss \u2014 as its sedate marketing campaign suggested \u2014 they are telegraphing the opposite for \u201cSharp Objects.\u201d\u201cIt ranks up there with some of the finest things we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Mr. Plepler told Variety on Tuesday.Mr. Plepler has made clear that talent \u2014 whether Mr. Vall\u00e9e or Ms. Adams or Nicole Kidman \u2014 and his connection to it is what makes HBO work.\u201cIt\u2019s very much part of the DNA of HBO: Talent is sacred,\u201d Mr. Plepler said after the AT&T deal was announced. \u201cThey bring the magic into our company. Writers, producers, actors. It\u2019s their gifts that make HBO HBO. It\u2019s pretty clear to anybody who looks at our company from afar \u2014 and, in AT&T\u2019s case, more closely \u2014 we are a talent-centric place.\u201dIn what could be construed as a plea to his possible future boss, he added: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine, with everything that Randall made clear to us, why would you ever change a winning game? I don\u2019t think they have any intention of doing so.\u201dEdmund Lee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iceman Came Out. Now He\u2019s Coming Back in His Own Series.", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIceman, who was first introduced by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in issue No. 1 of X-Men in July 1963, made the leap to TV animation in 1966 (in \u201cThe Marvel Super Heroes\u201d) and film in 2000 (as part of the \u201cX-Men\u201d franchise).Mr. Grace answered some questions about his experience with Iceman, this surprising return, fan reaction (which wasn\u2019t all positive) and what the next chapter in the hero\u2019s life will bring. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.What is the difference in audience between comic and book stores?Iceman is speaking to both millennial and Gen Z consumers. And the way they are buying comics is not the way the typical Wednesday comic customer is buying comics. They will go into a shop once a month or once a quarter. They are not going to come in every week. Iceman is reaching a younger consumer and an emerging consumer.Why do you think there has been so much negative reaction to Iceman\u2019s being gay?People were talking about the character\u2019s sexuality change, but I didn\u2019t do that. It was done by folks who did not identify as gay men. When Marvel asked me if I was interested in the character, I tried to think of experiences that were true to Bobby Drake. There are true-life narratives about men who could not handle this truth until later in their lives. It worked so perfectly with this character who for decades has been told he was one of the most powerful mutants \u2014 if only he would recognize it himself.What was the reaction on social media to your writing Iceman?What is next for Iceman?I\u2019m really excited that we\u2019re coming back with a new No. 1. This is going to be a great way to invite readers to celebrate with us. Iceman is going to be thinking about how he can help other people and use his mutant power to be the best he can be. He\u2019s going to be up against some pretty big bad guys. In the first issue he\u2019s preventing the next \u201cMutant Massacre\u201d with Bishop, another X-Man.We\u2019re also going to see a lot of the previous cast but played out in different ways. Bobby\u2019s relationship with his parents will not be as fraught. He reached a level of peace that you can get to \u2014 even with parents like his. We\u2019re going to see his dating life. It\u2019s just going to be such a breath of fresh air to see him really stretch his arms out and have fun.You mentioned there would be some community outreach too.The reason I love X-Men books is that they speak so much to people who identify as other. We\u2019re going to be seeing Bobby trying to figure out how he can be a shining beacon to the gay community. That\u2019s where me and Bobby Drake are alike: How do you take this platform and try to do something meaningful? That\u2019s something I want all readers to think about: How can you make a difference in your world? I feel super proud of the story I\u2019ve crafted with all those things in mind.Which artists will you be working with?For this arc, we have Nathan Stockman. He has this ability to do action and humor and drama, and it all blends perfectly with his style. He really understands what this book is and how, even though it is a funny character, it is a not a funny book. It\u2019s an X-Men book: a lot of action and drama. I can let my imagination go wild and they\u2019re able to do it. I draw comics too and I could not do half the stuff I assign these guys!A previous version of this article misstated when Iceman first appeared in an animated series. It was in \u201cThe Marvel Super Heroes\u201d in 1966, not \u201cSpider-Man and His Amazing Friends\u201d in 1981.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Executive Taking Over HBO and CNN Promises a Hands-Off Approach", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Stankey, 55, who once led wireline operations at AT&T and more recently oversaw the start of its streaming service, DirecTV Now, is now in charge of a $31 billion conglomerate that comprises Warner Bros. film studios, Turner and HBO.In an internal note to employees on Friday, he announced that John Martin, the chief executive of Turner, would be leaving. The executives under Mr. Martin, including CNN\u2019s Jeff Zucker, will report directly to Mr. Stankey, as will the HBO chief Richard Plepler and the Warner Bros. head Kevin Tsujihara. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, will be a senior adviser during a transition period and then retire.The Time Warner name will also be retired and the company will be rechristened WarnerMedia. In addition, \u201cmany of the redundant corporate support functions\u201d will be eliminated, according to the note. AT&T estimates cost savings of about $2.5 billion over the next few years.In an interview, Mr. Stankey spoke about his early plans for the media conglomerate. The following has been edited for length and clarity.You are currently on a tour meeting Time Warner executives. Are you still in New York?I left early this morning. I\u2019m now in Atlanta.And now I\u2019ve had an opportunity to meet with a number of folks. Obviously, the team is large. I haven\u2019t gotten to everybody yet. That\u2019s one reason why I\u2019m in Atlanta. There are questions and concerns about the culture fit between the two companies. Everything from expense perks to pricey pay packages, an expectation in the entertainment industry. How do you plan to manage that? I\u2019m well aware there\u2019s some differences between the two businesses\u2019 cultures, and my boss is well aware that there\u2019s differences, and we\u2019re being deliberate in how we\u2019re choosing to set up the organization and manage it.My job is to ensure those cultural differences are a nonissue. And so it would be a silly thing for me to do to walk in and try to suggest that there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all approach to two businesses that are in two different industries that grew up differently that have different sets of expectations. And I think we\u2019re probably savvy enough individuals and experienced enough business professionals that we know how to strike the balance on that. And that\u2019s my job. And if I don\u2019t do that job well I won\u2019t be here very long.Owning a media business often comes with having to manage politically sensitive content. Samantha Bee and Bill Maher are examples of talent whose shows have irked some audiences. Will they be given the same freedom they\u2019re used to getting now?People who are running the creative process are professionals at running the creative process. I don\u2019t believe that AT&T \u2014 the historical AT&T \u2014 by its nature brings much capability or intellectual property to do that better.The question is, are we going to have a different attitude or approach to it? The answer is, probably not. I will give you an example. I know what went down a few weeks ago. I\u2019ve obviously taken particular note of it. We\u2019ve asked ourselves during those events, \u201cWhat would we be doing?\u201d And when I compare notes with my companions at Time Warner, it\u2019s surprising how close we are in our points of view and how we would choose to go about managing these things.It sounds like you were referring to the Samantha Bee incident last month where she used a vulgarity to describe Ivanka Trump on her TBS show. She eventually apologized, as did the network. Was that handled in the right way? I think they handled it very well.At the end of the day, we\u2019re going to be just fine. And rather than dwell on what might be, I think the important thing to do is watch how we handle those things when the eventual events occur. And they will occur, and we\u2019re well aware that we need to be savvy about how we do that.What about CNN? The president has called out the network on an almost daily basis as the enemy. Well, first of all the folks at CNN will continue to do what they do without my involvement or intervention. I think they do that incredibly very well, and they will continue to do that under my leadership just like they did the day before I showed up here. My job is to make sure I work with them on giving them the resources and the capabilities to not only do what they\u2019ve done well but find ways to distribute the information and the education they deliver to the population more broadly.Have you met with Jeff Zucker, the head of CNN? Yes, and I\u2019m very excited that Jeff has agreed he\u2019s going to spend time with me and teach me the things that I didn\u2019t grow up with and get me deeper in some of the knowledge of how media and the news cycles work. And I\u2019m really anxious to get involved with that. I think we\u2019re going to have a great working relationship.What about investment? HBO spends about $2.5 billion, for example, to Netflix\u2019s $8 billion. Hulu already spends about $2.5 billion annually. Does AT&T plan to invest more in HBO? I think HBO is a tremendous brand. I think they\u2019ve done a phenomenal job. What I\u2019ve learned about it during the pendency of this transaction, I think they\u2019ve got a funnel and an opportunity to do even more. And I\u2019m very excited personally about opening up those opportunities for them to pursue it and build more audience and more engagement. Because at the end of the day, we want our technology and we want our content to drive more customer engagement. If we have the opportunity to do that by investing we are going to invest to make that happen.Does that mean more streaming services from HBO?Whether it\u2019s HBO or Turner or CNN or any other assets, over time you have to have direct relationship with the consumer where you can gauge how many minutes, or how many hours, you\u2019re getting with that end user. And that is the North Star we\u2019re following here.I think the dynamic is: How do you get more engagement with the customer where you own a degree of that relationship, and you understand what the customer is doing, and you have the benefit of the data they bring to that equation? And you drive that engagement by putting more and engaging content in front of them.And it sounds like you plan to use data as a way to inform programming decisions at Turner and HBO?Nothing replaces the creative process, and having the best creative minds and the best ideas.But data can inform issues like, how do you bundle and aggregate content? Who and how do you choose to distribute it to? How do you find monetization models where maybe instead of charging the customer directly through subscriptions or increasing rates, you can do it through advertising monetization? How do you learn about what kind of content customers are more passionate about that they burn through faster and therefore you want to start the right kind of relationships with creative talent that can build that kind of content? Data can help you be better, but it doesn\u2019t replace a creative process and the value of creative assets.Advertisement"}

And they are up 45 percent from the depths of the housing crisis in 2012.The big rebound in home prices and the lure of making a quick buck drew more than 200 people on Tuesday to a MidtownManhattan hotel for a two-hour free class on flipping houses. The lunchtime program I dropped in on was part of a sophisticated come-on for a paid three-day workshop that Nathaniel \u201cThan\u201d Merrill and his FortuneBuilders company plan to hold in the New York metropolitan area. An instructor at the event said the workshop normally costs $1,197, but the company was offering it for $197.Mr. Merrill, a former professional football player, has built something of a national reputation for pitching home flipping as a way to make money for just about anyone with a little cash and a dream to become a big time real estate investor. His FortuneBuilders company bills itself as an educational firm with many satisfied customers and success stories. The company is closely tied to a private lender called Grand Coast Capital that provides short-term financing to real estate investors,many of whom are past attendees of the three-day programs.The free class on Tuesday was something of a cross between a how-to guide to buying and selling homes and an evangelical experience. The instructor at the afternoon session sought to inspire the crowd, saying that if they only had the courage, they could someday quit their day jobs and live the way they always wanted to. Judging by the enthusiastic reaction, many were buying the message.- Matthew GoldsteinThe Chinese market is valuable and distinctive from the rest of the world. Arm believes this joint venture, which will license Arm semiconductor technology to Chinese companies and locally develop Arm technology in China, will expand Arm\u2019s opportunities in the Chinese market.Arm estimates that 95 percent of all advanced chips designed in China last year were based on its technology. With China desperate to make its own chips in volume, and quickly (there\u2019s more on that theme below), the move could prove shrewd.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation is rushing to build semiconductor factories. But reports claiming that the Chinese government is probing chip makers over price-fixing demonstrate that it\u2019s not there yet.Reuters notes that, according to Trendforce, China accounts for 20 percent of all global DRAM memory sales. For now, those purchases must be made almost entirely from Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, at what the Chinese government appears to believe may be inflated prices.China\u2019s own production plants \u2014 and carefully controlled pricing \u2014 clearly can\u2019t come soon enough.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe hire shows Washington is becoming more intertwined with corporate America, as the state intervenes in M.&A. and other business dealings.

{"Headline": "U.K. Clears Way for Bidding War Between Comcast and Disney Over Sky", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Comcast wants to upend the Walt Disney Company\u2019s empire-building plans, and a jewel of Europe\u2019s media industry could give it an opening.As both companies pursue a bigger-is-better strategy, they are vying for control of the British satellite broadcaster Sky. A regulatory ruling on Tuesday could be a prelude to a bidding war over the company \u2014 and to a larger fight over 21st Century Fox.The deal-making machinations, which have unfolded in two countries for over a year, are complicated and interconnected. Disney has offered to buy Fox, which already owns part of Sky and has offered to buy the rest. Comcast has made plays for both Fox and Sky, all with the goal of causing trouble for Disney.Fox\u2019s bid for Sky had been held up in regulatory limbo in Britain for months over concerns that it would give Fox\u2019s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, too much control over the country\u2019s media. On Tuesday, Britain\u2019s culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, ruled that Fox could proceed with its bid, provided that it sold Sky News, the broadcaster\u2019s 24-hour news channel.In December 2016, Fox offered 18.5 billion pounds, or about $25 billion, for the piece of Sky it did not already own. Comcast countered in April with a $29 billion bid. Given the ruling on Tuesday, Comcast is expected to continue its quest to buy Sky, forcing Mr. Murdoch and Disney to pay up if they want to win.The complexity of the maneuvering underscores the shifting state of the media business. As consumers do more of their viewing online, Amazon, Netflix and other streaming services are shaking up the industry. And as the traditional players try to compete, they have decided on a collective response: making deals.Hovering over Comcast\u2019s deliberations is an antitrust ruling in another media-related deal: AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion offer for Time Warner. Fox cut off earlier talks with Comcast over antitrust concerns. A favorable ruling for AT&T could give Comcast a way back in.Sky would play an important role in the future of either Disney and Comcast. Based in London, the broadcaster and internet service provider has 23 million customers in five countries, and it owns valuable broadcasting rights to English Premier League games, Formula One races and other sporting events. It also produces its own entertainment programs and has a streaming service, Now TV.The combination makes Sky the kind of one-stop shop that Comcast and Disney want to be. Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, has called the satellite broadcaster a \u201ccrown jewel.\u201d Comcast views it as a steppingstone in its own plans to expand beyond the United States.(Mr. Hancock, the British regulator, said that a Comcast bid for Sky would be probably not raise regulatory issues, given the American cable giant\u2019s limited presence in Britain.)When Fox made its bid for Sky in 2016, regulators were again wary. Mr. Murdoch and his family are divisive figures in Britain, controlling not only Sky but also News Corp, which runs some of the country\u2019s most popular newspapers. Lawmakers and regulators have openly questioned whether the Murdochs should have so much sway over British news outlets.But Mr. Hancock said that if Fox could not reach a deal for Sky News that the government would approve, he would be forced to block its bid, adding, \u201cThis is not my preferred approach.\u201dFox, which has waited 16 months for government clearance for its bid, said it welcomed Mr. Hancock\u2019s decision. The company added, \u201cWe are confident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction.\u201dWhat is most likely to come next are internal deliberations within Fox and Disney about how much to raise their offer for Sky. Shares in the British broadcaster have jumped 22 percent since February, when Comcast announced its plans to challenge Fox\u2019s bid.Advertisement"}

(The original debuted in 1937; James Mason and Judy Garland starred in a 1954 remake.)The added guitar version of \u201cEvergreen\u201d was originally to appear in the movie as a soft precursor to what happens later, when the two characters sing the song together and the love story at the heart of the film comes full circle.\u201cEvergreen\u201d was a \u201chuge cornerstone\u201d in Ms. Streisand\u2019s recording career, Mr. Santopietro said. It won her two Grammys, including best song, and a Golden Globe for best original song for a motion picture. Ms. Streisand also earned her second Oscar, for co-writing the song (with Mr. Williams), making her the first woman to earn an Academy Award for composing. \u201cEvergreen\u201d also ranked No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks in March 1977.Mr. Williams said he had taken home a cassette tape of Ms. Streisand playing the chords, and wrote the lyrics in about a day. (He also worked on six more songs for the movie soundtrack.) As soon as he heard the finished version, he said, \u201cI thought we had a big record.\u201d\u201cWe filmed a lot of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll kind of footage,\u201d Ms. Streisand explained in a conversation with Jamie Foxx at a Netflix FYSee event on Sunday. But she didn\u2019t have time to properly edit it into the film before the movie\u2019s preview, she said.And at the preview, she said, the audience loved the seven-minute finale as it was, so she didn\u2019t add in the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll version. \u201cI thought \u2018Uh oh,\u2019 you know, \u2018If it ain\u2019t broken, don\u2019t fix it,\u2019\u201d she said.Mr. Santopietro said: \u201cEven though things aren\u2019t great for women in Hollywood now, they weren\u2019t great then. The fact that she had this sort of power spoke to who she was. It was a personal undertaking for her.

{"Headline": "The W. Kamau Bell Legacy: A Talk Show Five Years Ahead of Its Time", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedySo many talk shows come and go these days, it\u2019s hard for any to make a major impact. And yet, one of the most influential ones today was canceled five years ago. \u201cTotally Biased With W. Kamau Bell\u201d ran for only two seasons (first on FX, then FXX), but its legacy has only grown thanks to the success of its on-air talent, particularly its crew of progressive, diverse stand-up correspondents, many of whom got their first major national exposure on the show.Just this year, two of its rising stars (Hari Kondabolu, Aparna Nancherla) released Netflix specials and a third (Guy Branum, who was on \u201cChelsea Lately\u201d before \u201cTotally Biased\u201d) finished the second season of \u201cTalk Show the Game Show\u201d (on Tru TV) and wrote a new book, \u201cMy Life as a Goddess,\u201d due next month. Mr. Bell himself shot a Netflix special, \u201cPrivate School Negro,\u201d which becomes available Tuesday. While starkly different, these comics share a self-aware and politically passionate style of humor suited to Trump-era popular culture.Their stand-up turns jokes into cudgels to break down racism, homophobia and systemic discrimination, but they also tend to be more comfortable than many comics in delaying punch lines in service of an argument. When Ms. Nancherla sets up a joke about advice from women\u2019s magazines, she adds a sincere aside about Teen Vogue doing great political work. In his unusually introspective and entertaining memoir, Mr. Branum reveals himself as a trenchant, surprising critic, offering close readings of \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d makeover movies and the different ways \u201cEntourage\u201d and the Lisa Kudrow series \u201cThe Comeback\u201d present Los Angeles.Mr. Bell, who moved to the West Coast after his talk show was canceled and now hosts a documentary series on CNN \u201cUnited Shades of America,\u201d deserves credit for recruiting these comedians as well as making a political talk show distinct from \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d: Less wonky, more polemical and eager to engage in debate. Unlike many hosts, he was not afraid to cede center stage, putting the spotlight on an exchange about rape jokes between Lindy West and Jim Norton, for instance.Yet compared with these performers, his new special seems a little tepid. His stand-up was never dense with punch lines, but \u201cPrivate School Negro\u201d veers further from a tight club set, toward a mix of storytelling, jokes and arguments. It\u2019s a rambling, sometimes overly familiar hour. As the father of two biracial children, his material portrays domestic scenes navigating parenting in a racist world. (You won\u2019t find a more full-throated defense of the cartoon \u201cDoc McStuffins.\u201d)Some of his political points, such as when he pushes back against people who cite free speech as they defend offensive remarks, will not surprise anyone who follows the daily back and forth on social media. But in his voice, which mixes a Seth Rogen-style chuckle and a periodic bellow delivering punch lines, such points take on a laid-back West Coast charm.
