{"Headline": "Missed the Latest Supreme Drop? Head to Grailed", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe website, a favorite of men looking for cult items that have disappeared \u2014 or will soon \u2014 just closed a new investment round.Where does a fashion fanboy \u2014 a fanatic with time to spend and money (if not full retail price) to burn \u2014 go to find the cult items that have eluded him, his (holy) grails? Grailed, a platform for buying, selling and swapping clothing and accessories, was created in 2013 by Arun Gupta, Jake Metzger and Julian Connor to be that place, a specialized eBay of the hype-o-sphere. The promise of Grailed, which charges a 6 percent commission on sales between members (plus PayPal fees), has drawn not only customers and fans. It has, like its compatriots in the so-called re-commerce industry, attracted interest from venture capital as well. Investment in the company is still smaller than other online resellers, like the RealReal, Vestiaire Collective and Poshmark, but Grailed\u2019s focus on men distinguishes it.Last month, the site closed an investment round of $15 million, led by Index Ventures, the venture firm that has taken stakes in Net-a-Porter, Farfetch, ASOS and the sneaker site Goat. Thrive Capital and Simon Ventures, which participated in earlier funding rounds totaling $4.1 million, joined this round as well.Since its inception, Grailed has grown to be a bustling thoroughfare of designer goods, where vintage pieces from the Paris runways of Raf Simons and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons nudge up against drop-fresh Supreme and Off-White, the \u201cIt\u201d items of the moment and gone-but-not-forgotten status symbols long since vanished from shelves. Hundreds of thousands visit Grailed and its app every month, and Grailed had 11 million page views in May, according to comScore, which measures online traffic. (Grailed's own numbers suggest both users and page views are higher.) Last year the site was profitable for the first time, according to the company.He educated himself on forums like Styleforum, Superfuture and Reddit threads, where obsessives would debate the merits of collections and barter and sell pieces. A self-trained coder and a start-up veteran by 19, Mr. Gupta felt he could build a better interface for those sales. So he did. Mr. Metzger, 31, a friend, came on board to handle marketing and branding; Mr. Connor, 29, eventually, signed on as chief technology officer.Grailed is now a reliable place to find the object of old or recent obsession, where the long tail of vintage product meets a passionate and developing market.Because the majority of the site\u2019s listings are user generated, the community that is Grailed\u2019s strength is also its weakness. The site does almost none of its own fulfillment (the exception is for cases in which it has created editorial content around the items, like its annual Grailed 100, a roundup of influential pieces), and shopping on Grailed is not the frictionless experience many e-commerce retailers have taught customers to expect. Users describe and label their own products, so finding specific items can require a long trawl through the site. Photos may be professional or night-vision quality. Price negotiations can get heady; shipping rates, self-determined, can be high. The company does offer buyer and seller protection, but only after claims have been adjudicated by PayPal. Grailed\u2019s team of moderators combs the site for fakes, but even so, complaints of inauthentic products crop up.And, like any online community, Grailed\u2019s can be fractious. \u201cThey can be a little prickly,\u201d Mr. Metzger said. (Mr. Gupta declined to comment, with a laugh.) But if the virtue of Grailed is democratizing access to designer goods, this comes with the territory. Serving as a hub for the obsessives means weathering the occasional scorn of veterans as well as educating the neophytes. \u201cI wish sometimes the fashion community would be as knowledgeable as the Grailed community about clothing,\u201d said Mr. Williams of Alyx, who has used the platform himself.Because Grailed has a direct line to a young and engaged market, it reflects, more or less in real time, that market\u2019s whims. It does an especially strong business in street wear and skate wear, the influential style of the moment. (On Thursdays, when Supreme does new product \u201cdrops\u201d on its website and at stores, it goes up almost immediately on Grailed, which announces its presence. James Jebbia, the founder of Supreme, declined to comment on his feelings about the site.) With its new investment, Grailed will continue to grow. The company is now 37 employees and a fridge full of matcha, as befits a millennial start-up in 2018, about evenly split between tech workers and marketing and customer service. It plans to continue to refine its technology, hone personalization in order to better corral the sprawl of products it offers, expand internationally and explore events and real-world interactions with its community. It is not difficult to imagine a Grailed convention somewhere down the line. \u201cI think it was skewed a little bit too upmarket,\u201d Mr. Metzger said. The current Heroine ideal, Mr. Metzger said, is Kendall Jenner, a woman who mixes her high fashion with street wear. Grailed is a home and a hive for the kind of consumers he designs for. \u201cYou\u2019re actually speaking to the real customer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a future customer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ethics watchdogs are worried.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Since Bill Clinton occupied the White House, the commemorative medallions known as challenge coins have been stately symbols of the presidency coveted by the military, law enforcement personnel and a small circle of collectors.Then came Donald J. Trump.His presidency has yielded more \u2014 and more elaborate \u2014 coins that are shinier, flashier and even bigger, setting off a boom for coin manufacturers, counterfeiters and collectors, with one official Trump challenge coin recently fetching $1,000 on eBay.Among those produced in recent months by members of a White House military unit is a coin featuring Mr. Trump\u2019s private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, on the front, and the presidential seal, the White House and Air Force One on the back. Another has Pope Francis on one side and the president\u2019s face set against the White House on the other.And, though challenge coins seem relatively trivial, the shift has caused headaches for the Trump White House.The official Challenge coin for the first lady, Melania TrumpThe official challenge coin for Vice President Mike PenceOutside ethics watchdogs say the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d coins shouldn\u2019t be distributed to military personnel \u2014 a traditional use of presidential challenge coins \u2014 since the military is supposed to be walled off from politics. And those watchdogs warn that coins featuring Mr. Trump\u2019s properties, such as Mar-a-Lago, should not be produced using government resources \u2014 including funds, work hours or even phone calls and emails \u2014 since federal ethics laws prohibit the use of public resources to promote private businesses.The Mar-a-Lago coins are akin to \u201ca metallic tourist brochure,\u201d said Norman L. Eisen, a former ethics lawyer in President Barack Obama\u2019s White House and the chairman of a watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.The Mar-a-Lago trip coin produced for White House Communications Agency membersLindsay Walters, a White House deputy press secretary, said those laws didn\u2019t apply to the Mar-a-Lago coins, because \u201cno public funds were used\u201d in their design or creation. Instead, Ms. Walters said, individual personnel assigned to the White House Communications Agency, a military unit that provides technological support for the president and his staff, used their own private funds to pay for the coins.But Karen Brazell, the chief of staff for the White House Military Office, which oversees the communications agency, declined to comment on whether other agency resources were used for the coins.After The New York Times inquired about the coins, agency personnel abruptly canceled plans for a coin featuring the president\u2019s signature Trump Tower in Manhattan and his golf course in Bedminster, N.J.The coins, which are usually slightly larger than a silver dollar, are intended to represent trips taken by the president and vice president, and are collected or traded by the staff members involved in facilitating those trips. Only \u201ca limited number\u201d are purchased for each trip, Ms. Brazell said, and sold to her office\u2019s employees to benefit what she described as a \u201cprivate morale organization.\u201dThe Vatican trip coin produced for White House Communications Agency membersThe World Economic Forum trip coin produced for White House Communications Agency MembersAny profit beyond the design and production costs goes to that fund for team-building activities like ceremonies and retirement gifts, Ms. Walters said, stressing that neither Mr. Trump nor his staff \u201chad any involvement in the creation, design, distribution or funding\u201d of the agency\u2019s coins.She acknowledged, though, that the president \u201cis involved in the selection and design of his official presidential challenge coins,\u201d which have been funded partly by the Republican National Committee.After Mr. Trump was sworn in, he had a sampling of his challenge coin collection displayed on a credenza behind his desk in the Oval Office, where it is visible in photographs alongside a Frederic Remington sculpture of a cowboy riding a rearing bronco.The challenge coin for the Trump Campaign\u2019s private security detailBut the coin incited a surge of interest in challenge coins like nothing that collectors could recall, spawning a host of knockoffs and creating an opportunity for a private company based in central Pennsylvania, the White House Gift Shop. Consumers seeking to buy the coins crashed the White House Gift Shop\u2019s website and jammed its phone lines. The coin, which differs substantially from the original, is listed for $49 on the company\u2019s website.The North Korea coin produced for White House Communications Agency membersThe North Korea summit MEETING coin produced for the white house gift shopThe White House Gift Shop plans to sell two additional North Korea coins in what it bills as a \u201chistoric art coin series.\u201d The second coin will have a side showing Mr. Trump flanked by Mr. Kim and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea in front of their nations\u2019 flags with a dove holding an olive branch in its beak. The reverse side is essentially a paean to the Singapore summit meeting, depicting the resort at which it was held and a banner that lists the date and the words \u201cDiplomatic History.\u201dThe third coin will seek to capture the outcome of the talks, possibly including the Nobel Prize, should Mr. Trump or Mr. Kim win it, said Mary H. Harms, the owner and creative director of Challenge Design.\u201cWhat we try to do with our coins is tell stories,\u201d said Ms. Harms, whose company also makes coins for an array of military units, as well as private sector clients like musicians. Those worlds sometimes collide, as with a coin she produced for the band 3 Doors Down, which commemorated its performance during Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities. It featured the band\u2019s logo and the American flag on one side, and the seals of the president and vice president against the Lincoln Memorial on the other.the inauguration performance coin produced for 3 doors downIn some ways, the proliferation of splashy presidential coins under Mr. Trump is emblematic of his convention-defying presidency, said John Wertman, a former Clinton White House aide who is a leading expert on challenge coins. Mr. Wertman was one of the few to receive a copy of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d Republican National Committee coin, which was largely removed from circulation after the round of mocking by the media. He said he was surprised by its thickness and lack of the presidential seal, but not necessarily its hue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Understand What Ails the Modern Internet? Look at eBay", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThere was a time when eBay was practically synonymous with buying and selling things online. Now it\u2019s surprisingly easy to forget that it exists, until you need to buy something you can\u2019t find anywhere else or clear some space in the attic. Or until someone like Elon Musk, made fabulously wealthy when PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002, muscles his way back into your consciousness by, for example, launching rockets into space or burrowing tunnels under major American cities. Where did he come from, exactly? As with a surprising number of tech heavyweights, the answer is complicated, but it runs through eBay.None of this is to say that eBay has gone away \u2014 in 2017, more merchandise changed hands over the platform than in any earlier year. It\u2019s just ancient in tech terms. It went public in 1998. But perhaps more than any other tech giant of its era \u2014 excluding Amazon \u2014 eBay has shaped the tech industry of 2018. Depending on how you look at it, this is an assignation of credit or blame. EBay\u2019s influence can be felt in both trivial and fundamental ways in companies like Facebook, Google and Uber.EBay is a platform that connects buyers and sellers. It does not itself sell goods; it lists and sorts and processes, providing shelves for its users\u2019 inventory and aisles for their prospective customers. It mediates as little as possible, and it takes a cut. Its problems, in the early days, felt new, at least at eBay\u2019s scale: managing disputes among significant numbers of users, dealing with bad actors of various sorts, addressing scams and fakes, establishing not just a framework for mass human interaction but systems through which to codify trust and resolve conflict.To its credit, eBay has ameliorated many of its problems, through public trial and error, over the course of nearly two decades. \u201cAll the linchpins on which modern platforms rely, at least at a very high level, eBay pioneered,\u201d says Andrei Hagiu, a visiting associate professor at M.I.T. and a longtime researcher of online platforms. \u201cWe use it in almost every paper we do.\u201d EBay, in obvious and subtle ways, has served as a model well beyond the world of commerce, inspiring the systems that play host to discourse, media, culture and communication online. It was among the first true megaplatforms \u2014 the sort that establishes itself as something like online infrastructure. And it may be, to date, the last one we truly understand.This basic approach to seller vetting has been adopted, and adapted, for much wider use, often with far less remove. In 2001, an eBay user might have given an eBay seller a low rating for an unsatisfactory packaging job; in 2018, an Uber driver might be dinged if a rider doesn\u2019t like his personality or choice of music. Facebook recently began ranking publishers by trustworthiness, based on feedback from users. Upon discovering a problem, a platform company\u2019s first instinct is to find a way to expose it to the wisdom of a market, or at least the will of a crowd.EBay users\u2019 participation in the site\u2019s governance is best understood as large-scale offloading of labor, and is basically limited to snitching on one another; users have some recourse against one another and somewhat less against the site itself. That imbalance doesn\u2019t bother us because eBay is eBay. \u201cIt\u2019s a transactional platform; the transaction is very clear to both sides,\u201d Hagiu says. \u201cBy and large, buyers and sellers are aligned on eBay.\u201d A seller banned for counterfeit sunglasses hasn\u2019t lost any rights, just his ability to use eBay. Crucially, to most ears, a scammer\u2019s claims to the contrary would sound ridiculous.But quite often it\u2019s managed like one, because in many ways, that\u2019s exactly what it is: a giant, multisided marketplace for buying and selling, in which the largest party \u2014 the users \u2014 doesn\u2019t do the buying or the selling. A social network\u2019s profitable transactions involve everyone but the users. Ad rates are even determined, in many cases, by auction. If eBay is a machine for finding the right price for a pair of shoes, Facebook \u2014 behind the veneer of enabling human connection \u2014 is a machine for discovering the right price for a pair of eyeballs. Your eyeballs.When the biggest platforms seem to be flailing or punting on problems, it\u2019s often because they\u2019re trying to address broad social issues with market solutions. They\u2019re rediscovering, at scale and at great expense to their users, the ways in which a society is more than a bazaar, and the pitfalls of allowing human attention to be sold and resold as a commodity. If a platform is addressing a collective problem in a maddeningly strange way, consider that it might see itself, or only know to govern itself, like an eBay. If it can\u2019t keep bad actors from using the service to exploit other users, that\u2019s because it\u2019s modeled after a system in which finding the highest bidder \u2014 or the biggest sucker \u2014 is gamely understood to be the point.There are more lessons for the new internet to learn from the old, and eBay\u2019s more recent trajectory might likewise give us clues about where its successors will go next. EBay was once a world-beating company, destined to totally remake commerce. While its legacy is powerful, it has, over the years, discovered its limits. Amazon, not eBay, is now most synonymous with online shopping. The site has also undergone some more fundamental changes. Auctions, for example, have become less popular over time, as sellers and buyers have favored the site\u2019s other buying styles, with fixed or suggested prices. And in many categories, large sellers have become entrenched, functioning more like stores themselves than desperate participants in a giant open-air market. EBay\u2019s final lesson to the next generation of platforms is that nothing is inevitable. Or lasts forever.Even still, eBay and PayPal\u2019s alumni are now immensely wealthy and unusually influential, and are using that power to reshape the world around them: Musk, with his electric cars and rockets and flamethrowers; Pierre Omidyar, with his investments and media ventures; Peter Thiel \u2014 an early Facebook investor and board member \u2014 with his funding of lawsuits against media companies and his eclectic and severe right-wing politics. It is worth considering what sort of initiatives might be spawned by the beneficiaries of today\u2019s much larger platform companies. EBay invited us onto an auction floor and dared us to compete with one another; millions did. Social-media companies found a more lucrative approach, with an even bigger payoff, by building the auction floor right under our feet.John Herrman is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "All That a Mother-of-Bride Dress Reveals, Inside and Out", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMother of the brideThis is the fourth of five articles, written from the perspective of one mother of the bride.If the first set of wedding dresses was beyond our budget, the second set is beyond belief, and we take refuge in ridicule to keep from getting depressed. In a single store in a single hour, Sarah tries on the Downton Abbey dress, the Roaring Twenties dress, and a cupcake number I dub the Operation Petticoat dress.Doubt has sneaked into the fitting room even if I cannot, so I smile the confident smile that parents paste on when we assure our kids about things we can\u2019t possibly yet know. Of course you\u2019ll like the new school, the math teacher, Latin, your college roommate, college in general, sushi.I hide behind a comforting logical fallacy: Sarah has to have the right dress, so the right dress has to exist. In the meantime, we are having a perverse kind of fun, aren\u2019t we?The next morning we trudge up a flight of stairs to a small, second-floor shop Sarah found in her online search. Same maternal exile from the fitting room as at the other places we\u2019ve been to, same muffled sounds of clothes coming off and going on, same offer of couch and beverage, all of it tinged by a worry hangover from the day before.And then the curtain parts and I understand what I\u2019ve been missing. The right wedding dress is not a dress at all, not in the normal sense, not a set of options in terms of fabric, neckline, sleeves, waist, skirt, train. The right dress is the bride reimagined in another medium. It\u2019s Sarah in ivory silk. Graceful and strong. Frank but with a mischievous edge. Lissome, which is not a word I toss around because its popularity peaked around the time Elizabeth Bennet said \u201cI do.\u201dNeither of us loves the way the zipper peeks through the lace at the back, but within the bounds of physics, Sarah can swap this bodice for a laceless one, or replace this skirt with a slightly fuller version, because the designer likes to give her clients some flexibility.Yesterday we had no choice. Today we have more choice than we can process, with the now-familiar discount if we buy within 48 hours.We don\u2019t, but this time it feels different. We stand at the calm shore of bridal-gown certainty: If Sarah had to buy a dress today, she could, so she can relax and enjoy the process of making absolutely sure. She considers a few other dresses that suffer by comparison. She drinks Champagne with her two best friends while I congratulate myself for not crashing their shopping expedition, because every bride ought to try on dresses with her friends without a parent present. We even have a vivid, blocks-long debate about a strong last-minute contender, the Audrey Hepburn dress.And then she circles back to purchase the front-runner (no lace, the fuller of two skirts) with the discount because I take the blame for the delay and make generational allies of Sarah and the store manager. I have never had such fun reciting my credit card number. Say it proud, any of you who belong to my temporary club: I bought my daughter her wedding dress.Now picture this: I am so sick that I crave antibiotics the way healthy people crave avocado toast. I slog the three blocks to the drugstore in a toxic haze of germs, and halfway there my rheumy eyes focus on a dress in a shop window.\u201cI\u2019m sicker than a dog,\u201d I tell the soign\u00e9e woman in charge, in case she thought this was my normal look, \u201cbut if that dress comes in anything but pink with flowers I want to try it on.\u201dIt does, and she has a white one I can try on to see if it fits. Ten sniffling, coughing minutes later I consider my reflection in the mirror, in an almost off-the-shoulder, almost sleeveless sheath, and I have to wonder: Where have I been all my life?Buried, that\u2019s where. Working women of my generation compensated for our gender by embracing what I\u2019ll call serious clothes, dressing to disappear behind our impressive qualifications. Think tailored, think monochrome, and think, quite often, just a bit too large. The uniform may have changed from one decade to the next, yet the dynamic lingers to this day.Sarah endorses the dress right off, which matters to me \u2014 but I lack courage, lost, for the moment, at the intersection of propriety and fun. I want to escape my sartorial past and yet not make a fool of myself, an elusive destination for someone who was bred to distrust color and pattern and considers anything that clings anywhere, even slightly, the province of people in a more fan-driven profession. I send photos to two friends whose sense of style has nothing to do with fashion, and they agree: I must buy the dress immediately.Buoyed by their enthusiasm, I make a tactical error and expand to a second circle of advisers. Forget polls and demographics. If you want a barometer of gender identity among older women in 21st century America, ask a bunch of them for their opinions on a mother of the bride dress.I get:Wear black. Wear anything but black.Spend big because your great-grandchildren will only know you from these photos.Cheap out because honestly, you won\u2019t get another chance to dress up like this, and it\u2019s crazy to spend a lot for something that\u2019ll hang in the closet.But my favorite, by a long shot, is, \u201cYou might want to keep looking.\u201d Fool that I am, I bite and ask why.\u201cYou don\u2019t have 30-year-old arms, you know.\u201dFor weeks I visit the dress as though it were an old friend, even as I search for a more practical alternative. And I wonder: What is the bandwidth for a woman who\u2019s old enough to have a bride for a daughter and yet feels oddly young at heart. The answer comes after I try on a dress that recalls both of my grandmothers, not on their best days, and I finally tire of my self-imposed constraints.There is no limit on what to wear except the one inside our heads. O.K., I don\u2019t want to know who bought the \u201cbondage jersey\u201d mother of the bride dress that popped up in one of my online searches, but beyond that kind of excess, anything goes.The point, simply, is to avoid the straitjacket of should.A bride buys prospectively, anticipating the adult life she will lead. A mother of the bride buys retrospectively, with an eye toward who she\u2019s been all these years, and whether some part of her got stifled in the telling. The best thing to wear, I come to think, is a celebratory air.I buy the dress. I buy shoes with heels and flowers and bows and tell myself they can go up on eBay the day after the wedding. I loan Sarah a pair of platforms she\u2019s always coveted and I never should have bought, not so secretly pleased that she prefers them to anything that looks like a wedding shoe.Relief washes over me, though I must remember not to chat with students when my laptop is open because of all the shapewear ads that have clustered like gnats since I searched \u201cfull slip.\u201dI am ready to party.Don\u2019t get me wrong; I like my capable self. I just want to give my identity a little breathing room.I relish the jobs I get as the wedding gets closer. I visit hotels that offer blocks of wedding rooms at a discount and come home with swag that ranges from self-care products to chocolates for when the products don\u2019t suffice. I visit both the places where we\u2019re ordering food for the morning after, having convinced Sarah and Jesse that I will be more effective face to face than they would be online. None of us can say what more effective means when ordering lox and bagels or babka, but they let me do it, probably because they can hear the steam building up between my ears.When it comes to alterations I am unrelenting and only borderline impolite. I see what I call the burbles just below the waist on Sarah\u2019s dress, and I see through the explanation that the fabric is too delicate and light to sit just so. For that matter, I\u2019d like a half-inch adjustment on the waist of my dress.Yes, I know that no one will notice either detail, but internal standards have nothing to do with an audience.To my happy surprise, though, I know when to abandon practicality. Sarah and Jesse plan to stay at a hotel in Brooklyn, where Sarah and I will get ready together on the morning of the wedding, and it sounds so much nicer to get in an elevator rather than a cab to do so. The besuited me sees no reason to spend money and time packing when I have a perfectly good apartment. The gal in the lilting dress and the crazy shoes prevails, and books a room.Advertisement"}

I started in the upper-left corner with QUEEQUEG, and after a decent number of attempts to place it at 1-Across, I realized that as my favorite literary harpooner\u2019s name is 5/8 vowels, it might fit better in the second row. When I noticed that 1-Across would most likely have to start with A, E, I or S, my proclivity toward unusual letter combinations (and contrarianism) led me to wonder if I could get it to begin with something else. Seeing the possibility of 1-Down being GQ MODEL or GQ TYPE, I looked for a solid potential 1-Across answer starting with G, and once I found GODZILLA, the rest of the corner soon fell into place. Though the corner is a bit more partitioned off than I would prefer (and AGTS isn\u2019t the world\u2019s best entry), it still stands out to me as one of my favorites from my themeless constructions for both its Scrabbliness and sheer unexpectedness. That said, the thing I like most about the upper-left is perhaps the intersection of the consonant-free entries OUI OUI and EIEIO \u2014 how often does that happen?UNSUNG HERO came next, as it was by far my preferred choice for 19-Across. As I worked my way through the rest of the grid, I was pleased to incorporate, among other entries, XENON GAS, TRAVEL SIZE, TZATZIKI, and YES AND NO, as well as the complementary pair of COWGIRL and ALTAR BOY.I was pleasantly surprised to see how many of my clues survived this time around. Of my originals, I was particularly glad that 1-Across, 12-Down, 19-Across, 33-Down, 46-Down, and 51-Across made the cut.

Cotton gloves protect from only so much and photographs fade every time they\u2019re exposed to light. So, how do you leaf through the 50 hand-printed issues of Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s Camera Work without distraction or fear of causing a disaster?The idea came to him in the spring of 2016 when he met Mr. Vreyen at the Photography Hall of Fame in St. Louis and the two discussed how nice it would be to hold a complete set of Camera Work \u2014 without worrying about destroying it. Camera Work, where Gertrude Stein published her first essay, marked a turning point for modern art. First created in 1902 and distributed in 1903 as a product of the Photo-Secession movement, the publication featured photogravures with text layouts based on the designs of William Morris, advertisements designed by Stieglitz and issues dedicated to prominent artists, including eventually, those outside the medium, like Picasso. Stieglitz also opened a gallery, \u201c291,\u201d to go with his periodical, until a decline in subscriptions brought on by World War I eventually did it in.It was not easy for Mr. Katzman to find his complete set. Individual issues are not often bound to their original covers. And because 75 percent of the images were created as photogravures, some of the plates have been detached from their original bindings. His quest took him through eBay, auction houses, online bookstores, brick and mortar bookstores and anyplace else he thought might be a decent bet. So far, Mr. Vreyen has sold four copies out of the 15 he printed, including one to the Museum of Modern Art. His asking price is $1,200 with a 10 percent discount for institutions. Mr. Katzman, meanwhile, is on to other things after experiencing a brief letdown as he completed his collection. Advertisement"}

It\u2019s one of the joys of working here. There is a strong contingent of classical musicians in the building, many of whom play in outside groups for the sheer pleasure of it. It seemed convenient to band together on the premises during off hours. I knew, from an orchestra we happened to be in together, that Laura Chang, deputy editor for The Upshot, played the violin. The grapevine sent us other musicians: William Davis, an assistant editor for News Platforms (another violinist); Aaron Krolik, a developer for Interactive News (a violist); and Margalit Fox, a senior Obituaries writer (a cellist). We bonded in an empty conference room over Mozart and Brahms two years ago, gathering after work on a regular basis. We call ourselves the Qwerty Ensemble. We chose the name Qwerty as a nod to keyboards, of the writing kind, which have long served journalists. (Look at your left hand if you are reading this on a computer.)For the past few months we\u2019ve been focusing on the Brahms Clarinet Quintet (which I especially am happy about).

But it\u2019s that bag, stowed in the archive at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York, and commanding high prices on eBay, that remains etched in many people\u2019s consciousness, a vibrant expression of its creator, who died on Thursday at 70 at his home in Safety Harbor, Fla.Roberta Greene, his former publicist and a longtime friend, said the cause was esophageal cancer.In designing for, and capturing on canvas, the images of clients and admirers like Elizabeth Taylor, Paloma Picasso and Diana Vreeland, Mr. Vollbracht came to symbolize the unfettered giddiness, extravagance and glamour of the late 1970s and early \u203280s.\u201cHe was our very own John Galliano,\u201d the designer Jeffrey Banks said, referring to the flamboyant British couturier.\u201cHe was above all a true creative,\u201d Ms. Greene said. \u201cHe looked at a fabric, a space, an idea, and he built it into something greater and more beautiful.\u201dMr. Vollbracht\u2019s designs, and particularly his evening wear, were not conceived for his most retiring clients. A fall collection shown in 1982 at the crest of his runway career was replete with fluid jumpsuits, caftans and billowing gowns executed in rainbow patterns and screen prints interspersed with high-visibility graphics and the occasional bird of paradise.\u201cThey have a lot of power and are different from anything anybody is doing anywhere else,\u201d the New York Times fashion writer Bernadine Morris wrote at the time.Those screen-printed images were Mr. Vollbracht\u2019s signal contribution to the world of style, said Freddie Leiba, a prominent fashion editor and stylist and Mr. Vollbracht\u2019s frequent collaborator.In his artworks and catwalk creations, Mr. Vollbracht had many different styles, some realistic and some fantastical.\u201cHe loved to mix mediums,\u201d said Mr. Banks, who worked with Mr. Vollbracht, \u201cand his work, it was almost like a collage. Ink, pastels, pencil \u2014 all combined in the same drawing, and a mix of textures, shiny and dull.\u201cVirtually every print that he designed and had printed was engineered for that specific dress or coat,\u201d Mr. Banks continued. \u201cIt was like seeing an art show and a whole fashion collection combined.\u201dMr. Vollbracht\u2019s shows were theatrical events. Some of his more over-the-top productions featured Eskimos, American Indian chiefs and, in one scandalizing instance, a troupe of G-string-clad dancers from the Chippendales all-male revue.As he himself once said, he looked at the world in cinematic frames, his aesthetic shaped by the long afternoons he had spent in the movie houses of his hometown, the Mississippi River city of Quincy, Ill., where he sat transfixed by the likes of Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford and Claudette Colbert.Later in life he befriended a handful of Hollywood stars, Ms. Taylor chief among them. Mr. Vollbracht once told of joining Ms. Taylor in her hotel room and luxuriating with her on her bed surrounded by millions of dollars worth of jewels.\u201cThey were laughing, she regaling him with stories, as they both tried on the jewels,\u201d said Ivan Bart, the president of IMG Models and Fashion Properties, who had heard the story from Mr. Vollbracht. \u201cI was charmed.\u201dMichael Vollbracht was born into a military family in Kansas City, Mo., on Nov. 17, 1947, the middle child of three siblings. He spent his early years in Quincy.Mr. Leiba said Mr. Vollbracht had been unhappy growing up, feeling stigmatized for being gay. \u201cThere was some sadness he had as a child,\u201d he said, though Mr. Vollbracht referred to it only obliquely. \u201cHe would say, \u2018My father was in the Army \u2014 and here I was his son, a fashion designer.\u2019 He would always bring that up.\u201dHe moved with his family back to Kansas City when he was in junior high school and, after finishing high school, left for New York in 1965, dreaming of a fashion career. He studied illustration at the Parsons School of Design, and his drawings caught the eye of Seventh Avenue potentates.In 1969, Geoffrey Beene made him a member of his design team, and he became an integral part of the house. By 1971 he was designing for Donald Brooks Boutique. Two years later he joined Henri Bendel, becoming the house illustrator for that Manhattan citadel of chic.Around that time, in 1978, he introduced the Michaele Vollbracht Collection (thinking the final e in Michaele was more distinctive, though he later dropped it). The line was a smash, landing in Bergdorf Goodman and eventually other high-end stores, including Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus.The next year he received the prestigious Coty American Fashion Critics Award: Designer of the Year. (Coty was then the equivalent of the Council of Fashion Designers of America.)Mr. Vollbracht went on to write and illustrate \u201cNothing Sacred\u201d (1985), a visual diary of his 25 years in New York rubbing shoulders with a bevy of personalities from the fashion, theater and movie worlds.By the mid-1980s, his name and screen-idol looks were well enough known in American households that he could play a version of himself on an episode of the detective series \u201cHart to Hart,\u201d about a fashion designer who is suspected of killing off his models.But it wasn\u2019t long before his business began to suffer, afflicted by declining sales and his reluctance to license his name, and he closed it to focus on art. He went on to produce collages and drawings for The New Yorker.He is survived by two sisters, Michele Polivka and Carol Lynne Clinkscales, as well as a niece.With considerable fanfare, Mr. Vollbracht returned to the runway in 2002, taking over from Lars Nilsson as the creative director of Bill Blass Ltd. That relationship endured for five years, during which Mr. Vollbracht sought to meld his own flamboyant vision with the more conventional ideals of an old guard clientele.Receptive at first, the fashion world became disenchanted, Mr. Leiba recalled. \u201cHe brought back his favorite models \u2014 Pat Cleveland, Karen Bjornson, Sara Kapp and other runway stars of the day \u2014 but Vogue didn\u2019t understand this too well,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone did. It was a whole different time. He wasn\u2019t the darling of what was going on.\u201dMr. Vollbracht kept painting, and his fashions were resurrected or updated from time to time in collaboration with Mr. Leiba and others and worn by stars like Ren\u00e9e Fleming, Angelina Jolie, Janet Jackson and Beyonc\u00e9.\u201cThe fashion industry misses him,\u201d the designer Carolina Herrera once said. \u201cHe did collections that didn\u2019t look like anyone else.\u201dMr. Vollbracht himself had little use for nostalgia, preferring to cast himself as a survivor, his wry worldview intact. As Ms. Greene recalled, \u201c \u2018When the end of the world comes,\u2019 he used to say, \u2018all that will be left is you, me, Cher \u2014 and some cockroaches.\u2019 \u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated Mr. Vollbracht\u2019s age. He was 70, not 71. (As the obituary correctly states, he was born on Nov. 17, 1947.) The error was repeated in the headline.Advertisement"}

On Thursday, the semiconductor maker blindsided Silicon Valley with the abrupt resignation of its chief executive over a relationship with a subordinate.Mr. Krzanich\u2019s relationship with the subordinate was not recent, said one person briefed on the situation, who declined to be identified because the company discussions over the matter were confidential. Intel found out about the relationship only a few days ago, this person added.Robert Swan, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer, was appointed interim chief executive while the company conducts a search for a permanent new leader. Mr. Krzanich could not be reached for comment.\u201cWe appreciate Brian\u2019s many contributions to Intel,\u201d Andy Bryant, Intel\u2019s chairman, said in a prepared statement. He added that he knew the company would continue to perform.Intel, which recently yielded the title of the world\u2019s largest chip maker to Samsung, is approaching its 50th birthday. The company, known for microprocessor chips that carry out calculations in most personal computers and server systems, has prided itself as a standard-setter in corporate governance.An Intel spokesman said the company\u2019s most recent version of its strict non-fraternization policy, which prohibits managers from sexual or romantic relationships with employees who report directly or indirectly to them, has been in place since 2011.Mr. Krzanich argued that Intel needed an infusion of fresh thinking to achieve his goal of reducing the company\u2019s dependence on the sluggish P.C. market. He also publicly committed the company to increasing the number of employees from groups underrepresented in some technical specialties, including minorities and women.\u201cIntel is a different place, and we\u2019ve done this while growing the business,\u201d Mr. Krzanich said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in May.But five former Intel employees, who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, said Mr. Krzanich at times exhibited an arrogant personal style and handled staff changes in ways that created enemies. Some of these people said the #MeToo movement most likely influenced how Intel\u2019s board handled the matter.During Mr. Krzanich\u2019s tenure, Intel\u2019s market capitalization rose to above $240 billion, with a share price that is up 50 percent since the beginning of 2017. On Thursday, while the company\u2019s shares declined 2 percent on the announcement of the leadership change, Intel said it expected to report second-quarter results that exceed Wall Street estimates.Pierre Ferragu, an analyst with New Street Research, said the projection points to a \u201cmonster\u201d quarter for the company. \u201cThe resignation itself is in our view a completely idiosyncratic event, with no impact to the company,\u201d he wrote in a research note.Mr. Swan is a relative newcomer to Intel, joining the company as chief financial officer from General Atlantic in 2016. His past experience includes a stint at private equity firm General Atlantic and nine years as chief financial officer at eBay.Mr. Krzanich\u2019s total compensation last year was $21.5 million, according to the executive compensation firm Equilar. That put him at 60th place in an annual ranking of highest-paid chief executives in the United States that Equilar conducted for The New York Times.An earlier version of this article misstated Intel\u2019s position in the semiconductor market.

{"Headline": "Supreme Court\u2019s Wayfair Decision Will Hurt Online Shopping", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Melugin researches technology issues for\u00a0the Competitive Enterprise Institute.This ruling subjects small internet-based businesses to \u201ctaxation without representation.\u201d The seller must now calculate, collect and remit sales taxes to whichever state a buyer lives in, including those in which the seller has no stores or employees and no voting power or political voice. Online businesses will now be responsible for adhering to this compliance burden and could be audited as a result.Think of it like this: When you pull into a gas station to fill up, the attendant does not check your license plate or driver\u2019s license in order to charge you the tax rate of your home address and send off payment to your state\u2019s tax authorities. The owner of the gas station calculates the tax based on the station\u2019s location, collects it from you and sends the taxes to his local authority.This approach preserves healthy tax competition among the states. New York can only hike gas taxes so high before everyone starts to drive across the border to New Jersey. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision does away with this competitive system for people who buy and sell online.Now that states can export their tax policies and reach outside their borders to tax businesses in other states, that beneficial rivalry among states is diminished. That puts both the online buyer and the entrepreneur at a disadvantage. It is the online equivalent of the gas station attendant calculating your tax based on where you live, not where you are pumping gas. This means consumers can no longer vote with their wallets by taking their online purchases elsewhere.With fewer political consequences, there is less incentive to keep tax rates reasonable.States have spent years trying to reverse the Quill ruling and persuade Congress to pass supportive legislation. The problem is that online taxes are unpopular among voters. Bills like the Marketplace Fairness Act and the Remote Transactions Parity Act, both introduced last year, were doomed by high compliance costs for small businesses and by general opposition to more sales taxes online, but they may find a second wind after the new ruling.With this decision, the Supreme Court underestimates the importance of preventing states from regulating and taxing the business owners of other states. Congress must now step in to consider plans for reforming online sales taxes to reduce the damage of the ruling. Legislators should act to clarify and reinforce the principles of physical presence and state tax competition.The internet has presented enormous opportunities to people who dreamed of starting their own business, and American consumers have reaped the reward. There is no doubt that online shopping has made it much easier and more convenient for busy parents and rural Americans to get items they need for their families more quickly. Congress should get to work protecting this progress for the sake of all consumers and online entrepreneurs.Jessica Melugin is the associate director of the Center for Technology and Innovation at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which filed an amicus brief in support of Wayfair in the Supreme Court case South Dakota v.

{"Headline": "The People Leading the Blockchain Revolution", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe blockchain is a technology that is supposed to be all about distributing power and information away from central authorities. But many individuals have been crucial in pushing the technology forward. Here is a look at some of the most influential people in the industry today.While the JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon was bashing Bitcoin as a fraud, his employee Amber Baldet put the bank at the front of Wall Street\u2019s efforts to harness the blockchain. Ms. Baldet, 35 and until recently the head of the bank\u2019s blockchain lab, led a project to create a bank-friendly version of the Ethereum software, known as Quorum.Quorum has since become one of the most popular places for corporations and governments to start building blockchain projects. But Ms. Baldet, who never stopped being an outspoken advocate for hackers and privacy on Twitter, always seemed too big a personality for an old-fashioned bank.Earlier this year, she broke away and created her own start-up, Clovyr, which she is building with a partner from her days at JPMorgan. She has compared Clovyr to an app store for blockchains, open to the many competing approaches to blockchains today. It illustrates her unusual ability to bring together the corporate and hacker camps working on the technology.Brian Behlendorf was a prominent name in the tech world long before his rather late arrival on the blockchain scene. In the early 1990s, he started one of the first companies that built websites, which led him to create the Apache software that is still used by many web servers.While the project was initially led by IBM, Mr. Behlendorf, 45, has helped bring in other big names who are helping to make Hyperledger the focus of much of the corporate and governmental interest in blockchains today. Hyperledger now oversees several different blockchain projects, but its biggest product is Fabric, which is being used by everyone from Walmart to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Mr. Behlendorf, meanwhile, has tried to make sure the technology has kept its open-source soul even as it has begun to go mainstream.Aside from the blockchain inventor known as Satoshi Nakamoto, no name in the cryptocurrency world is more recognizable than that of Vitalik Buterin, the 24-year-old inventor of Ethereum. Mr. Buterin came up with the idea for Ethereum after dropping out of college, when he was only 19, and few imagined the awkward teenager could make it work.His creation, though, is now home to the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Beyond that, Ethereum has pioneered a future direction for the blockchain \u2014 serving as a new kind of shared global computing network. That has drawn in thousands of developers who are building on top of Ethereum.The system has been buggy, and provided an opening for lots of bad actors. But Mr. Buterin\u2019s ideas have also been popular among many corporations and government agencies, who are now experimenting on their own versions of Ethereum. Many competitors have also raised money to build systems aimed at improving on the basic concepts laid out by Ethereum, but Mr. Buterin\u2019s soft-spoken leadership has so far kept Ethereum ahead.There are few greater marks of prestige in the blockchain world than an investment from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. While it is the firm\u2019s co-founder Marc Andreessen who has gotten the most attention for his backing of the industry, it is Chris Dixon who is leading the firm\u2019s work in the area.Mr. Dixon, who created start-ups that were acquired by eBay and McAfee before becoming a venture capitalist, was responsible for Andreessen\u2019s first big Bitcoin bet in 2013, when the firm became a lead investor in the Bitcoin brokerage Coinbase. That has ended up looking smart as Coinbase has risen to become the multibillion-dollar giant of the industry, with more customers than Charles Schwab and eTrade.Since then, Mr. Dixon has spread the firm\u2019s money to a wide array of smaller projects in the industry, and recently created a $300 million fund that will focus exclusively on digital tokens. Mr. Dixon has also taken to Medium to pen essays explaining and advocating for the bigger ideas behind blockchain-based technologies \u2014 most notably, the ability to create new decentralized computer protocols that can be governed by communities instead of companies.Daniel Larimer\u2019s libertarian politics drew him to Bitcoin in the early years. But the Virginia Tech graduate has made his name, and his fortune, by building new kinds of cryptocurrencies with more wide-ranging functions than Bitcoin.This began with an exchange that was supposed to make it easier to trade Bitcoin, and that relied on its own internal currency, known as BitShares. He left that project before it took off to create Steemit, a new kind of social network, powered by its own, eponymous token.Steemit is still working today, but Mr. Larimer\u2019s biggest success has come with his latest creation, Block.one, and its digital token, EOS, which is set to compete with Ethereum. Block.one, where Mr. Larimer, 35, is the chief technology officer, raised more than $4 billion from investors to build EOS, making it the most successful cryptocurrency fund-raising project by a good margin.The start of the EOS currency was recently plagued by delays and technical snags. That, and Mr. Larimer\u2019s history of leaving projects unfinished, have drawn many skeptics. But if nothing else, Mr. Larimer and Block.one should have enough money to turn EOS into a contender in the crowded world of cryptocurrencies.Each one of the three things that Jed McCaleb has created in the last decade would be, on its own, enough to make him one of the most well-known and controversial figures in the cryptocurrency universe.While many on Wall Street have focused on the blockchain technology and dismissed cryptocurrencies, Michael Novogratz has led the camp \u2014 and made a fortune \u2014 betting that the real innovation is in Bitcoin and the other digital tokens it has spawned. In 2013, when he was at the private equity firm Fortress Capital, Mr. Novogratz \u2014 a former military pilot and Goldman Sachs partner \u2014 made the firm one of the first in the financial industry to actually purchase Bitcoins.He had to reverse course on plans to open an enormous crypto hedge fund when the markets suddenly turned sour in December. But he is still putting his money where his mouth is, setting up what is likely to be the biggest institution selling Wall Street on the virtues of cryptocurrencies.There is currently a hard limit on the number of transactions the Bitcoin blockchain can handle, which has led to significant battles between companies and developers over the best way to expand the network. Ms. Stark, who was already an advocate for a more open and egalitarian internet, became a leader of the camp that wanted to keep Bitcoin relatively small, true to its ideological roots as a decentralized network, with no one in control.At the same time, she proposed and began building a method of adding layers on top of Bitcoin that can handle lots of new customers and transaction types. These \u201clayer two solutions,\u201d as she has called them, appear to be Bitcoin\u2019s best chance of expanding to take on the world, and are already being rolled out. The work has turned Ms. Stark into a leading public face of a far-flung Bitcoin community that often defies organization.As the cryptocurrency industry has looked for clarity on what the regulators will allow, no agency has been more important than the Securities and Exchange Commission, and no person at the S.E.C. has been more central than Valerie A. Szczepanik. A former patent lawyer who joined the S.E.C. in 1997, she was recently appointed to be the agency\u2019s senior adviser on digital assets and innovation.But Szczepanik has been involved in the S.E.C.\u2019s work in the area since early on. She worked on several enforcement actions against fraudulent cryptocurrency projects and has served as the co-head of the agency\u2019s Dark Web Working group. In addition to punishing bad actors, Ms. Szczepanik has led the agency\u2019s effort to define the boundaries that will determine what form legal cryptocurrency and blockchain projects can take.The speeches she has given have been cheered by some in the industry because they have shown that she understands the technological nuances of the projects out there.When her group decided that the second most valuable digital token, Ether, would not fall under the agency\u2019s purview, it set off a big rally in the markets. But that decision only cleared up a bit of the regulatory uncertainty in the sector. Industry players are still following Ms. Szczepanik\u2019s every word for an indication of where the industry will be allowed to go.Bitmain used its proximity and connections to the computer manufacturing hubs in China to build machines that were more efficient and profitable than any competitor. Today, most estimates indicate that over 75 percent of the computers mining Bitcoins \u2014 and a similarly large number of the machines mining other cryptocurrencies \u2014 come from Bitmain. That has turned out to be an important position to occupy because it is the computers mining Bitcoins that get to vote on updates to the Bitcoin software.Mr. Wu has been at the center of the battles over how to expand Bitcoin\u2019s capacity. The fights, and a cryptocurrency crackdown by the Chinese government, have not stopped Mr. Wu from growing Bitmain into one of the most valuable companies in the industry, and a crucial player in any conversation about the shape of the computer networks that stand behind most of the cryptocurrencies in existence.Advertisement"}
