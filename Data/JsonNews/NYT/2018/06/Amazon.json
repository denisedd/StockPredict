{"Headline": "Facebook Back on the Defensive, Now Over Data Deals With Device Makers", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook endured a new wave of criticism from lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe on Monday after disclosures that the social media giant had allowed dozens of hardware manufacturers access to its trove of personal user data.The European authorities who last month enacted the world\u2019s strictest data privacy law said Facebook\u2019s sharing of personal information with cellphone makers and other manufacturers deserved further investigation. Germany\u2019s top privacy regulator, Johannes Caspar, called Facebook\u2019s partnerships \u201can unprecedented violation of privacy laws and user trust.\u201dAnd New York\u2019s attorney general, Barbara Underwood, said her office would expand its investigation of Facebook\u2019s data practices to include Facebook\u2019s sharing with hardware manufacturers.Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives have repeatedly cited the 2015 restrictions to assure policymakers that no outside company could again harvest swaths of personal information without the explicit consent of users, as a contractor for Cambridge Analytica did in 2014. But Facebook officials said this week that they did not consider hardware partners to be outside companies, under the terms of Facebook\u2019s privacy policies and a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cFriends\u2019 information, like photos, was only accessible on devices when people made a decision to share their information with those friends,\u201d said the executive, Ime Archibong. \u201cWe are not aware of any abuse by these companies.\u201dBut some American lawmakers criticized Facebook\u2019s rationale and urged the F.T.C. to review whether the partnerships violated Facebook\u2019s promises to the regulator.\u201cI think this explanation is completely inadequate and potentially disingenuous,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the Senate subcommittee charged with consumer protection. \u201cI think Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony raises very serious and severe questions about Facebook\u2019s credibility.\u201dDavid Cicilline of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the House antitrust subcommittee, responded even more harshly.Senior Republicans also said the partnerships merited further review.Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said in a statement that The Times\u2019s reporting \u201craises important questions about transparency and potential privacy risks for Facebook users.\u201d Mr. Thune said the Senate Commerce Committee, of which he is chairman, would seek more information from Facebook.The F.T.C. is already investigating whether the access to friends\u2019 data that Facebook allowed until 2015 violated the terms of its earlier consent decree with the regulator. Rohit Chopra, a current F.T.C. commissioner, declined to comment on any specific company or investigation, but said he believed that the commission would act to enforce any agreements it had with companies.\u201cToo often, sensitive consumer data gets shared and copied over and over again to a point of no return,\u201d Mr. Chopra said. \u201cF.T.C. orders are not suggestions. When companies violate them, there can be serious consequences.\u201dDuring the event\u2019s keynote address, Craig Federighi, an Apple senior vice president, unveiled a new feature that will let Apple users more easily control what sort of information is shared with Facebook and other social media companies.Mr. Federighi chose to demonstrate the new feature onstage by showing Apple\u2019s Safari browser open to a webpage.

However, the two companies\u2019 main businesses do not compete with each other and so a merger would not reduce the number of competitors in any particular market.Those Comcast-style provisions have appeared reasonably effective. Neither Comcast nor AT&T nor any other old-school media or telecommunications company has been able to hold back the relentless march of internet video behemoths like Amazon, Netflix and YouTube. In fact, the tech giants\u2019 media operations are already vertically integrated; Amazon and Netflix spend billions of dollars a year developing video content and then distributing it themselves through different systems and services.Mr. Delrahim could have pursued such conditions with AT&T and Time Warner. Unwisely, he didn\u2019t. The big risk in the government\u2019s litigation strategy was that if it lost, AT&T could acquire Time Warner without any such pro-consumer provisions at all.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018A Very English Scandal\u2019 Is Very Good. And Scandalous.", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s 1965, and two well-heeled British men share a fussy lunch where they surprisingly each confess a history of gay sexual encounters. \u201cMy wife insists that \u2018gay\u2019 means happy,\u201d one groans. \u201cI think she\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d the other says. \u201cAnd I intend to be very happy \u2014 very many times in my life.\u201dMission only partly accomplished. Because while there are plenty of lusty experiences in \u201cA Very English Scandal,\u201d actual happiness is either fake or fleeting in this three-part mini-series, based on an astounding true story of a politician who was charged with putting out a hit on his former lover.It\u2019s, well, very English, depicting and critiquing midcentury Britain\u2019s haughty propriety, deep homophobia and posh insularity.Repression, denial and gentility are the pillars of this high-end show, written by Russell T. Davies (\u201cQueer as Folk,\u201d \u201cDoctor Who\u201d) and directed by Stephen Frears (\u201cThe Queen\u201d), based on the book by John Preston. And when those pillars topple, what results is a juicy, wild lesson in British queer history, a story that\u2019s able to hold a sense of moral fury toward the hatred that gay and bisexual men (and women) faced while still finding the tabloid outrageousness at hand titillating. \u201cA Very English Scandal\u201d is a dazzling three hours and in pace and potency puts \u201cThe Crown\u201d to shame.Everything is in tension, if not outright conflict. The tone is sometimes serious but sometimes drifts to being a darkly humorous caper, with jaunty text sliding onto the screen announcing years and locations. Mr. Grant is known for his romcom stammers, but here is restrained and commanding. The courtroom scenes in Part 3 are decorous but then out of control. People who know the plain truth won\u2019t acknowledge it. Admitting to a lie somehow becomes more shameful than continuing one.The path to scandal begins when Jeremy Thorpe meets a scrappy stable boy, Norman Scott (Ben Whishaw). A year later, the two begin a relationship that is loving but never steady, thanks to Jeremy\u2019s double life and Norman\u2019s vague instability \u2014 he doesn\u2019t want to be a kept man, let alone a kept secret. Jeremy is rich and powerful and a public figure, and Norman\u2019s na\u00efve, maybe overly medicated and somehow unable to get his National Insurance card. Bureaucracy will come for us all, and bureaucracy isn\u2019t the only thing that comes for Norman: Years after their relationship, Jeremy is arrested on charges of conspiring to murder him to keep him from exposing their past.Mr. Whishaw often plays vulnerable, wounded people, and his performance here is tremendously compelling and challenging. His Norman is fidgety but bold and defiant \u2014 charismatic, but sometimes a dirtbag, the kind of guy your dad would hate, which would only make you like him more until he let you down and offered another facile excuse. Norman is almost all posturing, and you can see momentary gaps in his knowledge, where Mr. Whishaw lets a sliver of panic through.One can easily imagine both a shorter movie version of this saga and a longer, 10-hour version, and both options hold some appeal. Side characters, including dogs, get a lot of screen time \u2014 which is charming, if not always illuminating \u2014 while some plot moments rush by, particularly in Part 3. In an era of TV bloat, seeing \u201cA Very English Scandal\u201d choose zippiness over ponderousness is a blessing, but one that occasionally feels more like a compromise than a plan.Length aside, the rest of \u201cEnglish\u201d is precise bordering on surgical. There are over 1,000 distinct kinds of frowns on display, from rakish to tragic, ironic to crushed. The rich frown differently than the poor do, just one among many subtle differences that create the parallel narrative of class conflict that runs alongside the story of gay liberation. Well, not parallel exactly: As with Jeremy and Norman, these ideas crash into each other over and over.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Macy\u2019s Goes From Mall Mainstay to Homeless Shelter", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "As traditional retailers fade in the era of Amazon, a vacant department store near Washington becomes a refuge for people struggling to find affordable places to live.Supported byALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 Karleen Smith used to work at the Macy\u2019s in Landmark Mall, putting price tags on summer dresses, housewares and the latest styles of shoes. On Saturday, Ms. Smith, 57, returned to her former store, not as an employer or a customer, but as a resident. The former Macy\u2019s in this vacant shopping mall outside Washington has been transformed into a homeless shelter. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to be moving into this building. I used to work here,\u201d she said inside the shelter\u2019s common room, which was once the men\u2019s department. \u201cIt\u2019s called survival.\u201d At the vacant Macy\u2019s in Alexandria, the Carpenter\u2019s Shelter, a nonprofit group, moved into its temporary home last weekend, 15 months after the last shopper rang out. The former store now provides 60 beds, hot meals and showers for families and for single men and women who are having trouble finding a place to live in a city with a scarcity of affordable housing.The Macy\u2019s logo and signature star are visible above the shelter\u2019s entrance, while some of the floors are covered in the store\u2019s faded carpet and white tiles. Toilets and sinks were pulled from a former Lord & Taylor and relocated to the shelter. The Landmark Mall was once at the vanguard of shopping. Opened in 1965, the mall housed the region\u2019s most fashionable department stores, Hecht\u2019s, Woodward & Lothrop and Sears & Roebuck. Boys came to buy their first suit at the haberdasher, and teenage girls could get their shoes dyed to match the color of their prom dress.Alexandria\u2019s former mayor William D. Euille remembered playing the clarinet in the high school band at the mall\u2019s opening ceremony. \u201cIt was the economic engine of the city,\u201d he said.The department stores would change, reflecting the evolving retail landscape. Regional players were replaced by national chains like Lord & Taylor and Macy\u2019s.Eventually, the mall succumbed to retail\u2019s propensity to chase after newer, flashier spaces. Developers built larger malls with more upscale brands nearby in Pentagon City and Tysons Corner, siphoning customers away from Landmark. \u201cIt\u2019s a great piece of real estate,\u201d said Mark Bulmash, a senior vice president of development at Howard Hughes.The delay has created an opportunity for the Carpenter\u2019s Shelter, which began housing the homeless in the basement of a local Catholic church in 1982. The group needed a temporary space while it constructs a permanent facility in a different part of Alexandria that will include 97 affordable rental housing units and a shelter.\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to stick their neck out for this, but they did, and we are grateful,\u201d said Shannon Steene, the shelter\u2019s executive director.Saturday was move-in day for the residents. On a humid, hazy morning, residents loaded onto a chartered city bus at the old shelter and headed for the mall. Keith Ham, 43, who has been living the shelter for about three months, said his family did not believe where he was moving.\u201cThey say, \u2018Macy\u2019s at the mall?\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd I say, \u2018For real, Macy\u2019s at the mall.\u2019\u201dJahlil Commander, 16, dribbled a basketball outside the shelter\u2019s front entrance and watched a movie crew set off a smoke machine in the parking lot. Some of the mall property is also being leased out to a production company filming a \u201cWonder Woman\u201d sequel. Jahlil and his two brothers are sharing a windowless room at the shelter after their mother fell behind on rent. \u201cWe have a predicament,\u201d their mother, Shannon Commander, said. \u201cThis is where we come to reset and figure things out.\u201d Ms. Smith, the former Macy\u2019s worker, rested on the floor of the common room under a frayed green blanket. Before coming to the shelter, Ms. Smith had been living in a car and showering in a recreation center. \u201cI was tired,\u201d she said. Ms. Smith, who worked at Macy\u2019s as a seasonal hire during the holidays 10 years ago, remembers the store fondly. On a slow day, she would try on makeup at the cosmetics counter and spray herself with samples of perfume. She said she could never afford to buy anything of her own. \u201cAll I could do was admire it.\u201dThe accommodations are sparse and some residents could not hide their disappointment that the bedrooms do not have windows.But 4-year-old Mikias Aiychew was so excited to see his new room at the shelter that he could hardly sit through their weekend Jehovah\u2019s Witness gathering, his mother said.A hand-painted sign on the wall quoted Theodore Roosevelt: \u201cDo what you can with what you have, where you are.\u201d Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of Shakala Ford's baby. He is Jace, not Jaca.Advertisement"}

They could also load spoof versions of an email site you use to steal your password and gain access to your communications.\u201cMost consumers don\u2019t know to patch these things,\u201d said Matt Watchinski, a senior director of Cisco Talos, who helped research the VPNFilter malware. \u201cThey don\u2019t treat it like they do their air-conditioner or refrigerator, where we all know we should change the filters.\u201dHere\u2019s a guide to some of the best practices you can embrace to ensure that your router \u2014 and, by extension, all your internet gadgets \u2014 is safe.Even though a router lacks moving parts, it needs to be maintained with the latest security updates. Easier said than done, right? Here is a basic step-by-step for how to do that:\u25a0 Consult the instruction manual for your router to get its IP address, a string of numbers that you will punch into a web browser for access to the router\u2019s web dashboard. Jot down the number and store it somewhere safe like your filing cabinet.\u25a0 After entering the router\u2019s IP address into a web browser, log in to the base station with your username and password. In the router\u2019s web dashboard, click on the firmware settings. Look for a button that lets you check for the latest firmware version.\u25a0 If an update is available, choose to install it and let the router restart. Repeat this process every three to six months.\u25a0 If you use a router provided by a broadband provider like Comcast or Verizon, call the customer service department and ask whether your equipment has been updated with the latest firmware.When you log in to your router, if your username and password are something like \u201cadmin\u201d and \u201cpassword,\u201d you have a problem. Many Wi-Fi stations come with weak, generic passwords by default that manufacturers intend for you to change.The problem with having a weak username and password is that anybody within range of your router could log in to it and change its settings, potentially opening it up to the outside world, said Dave Fraser, chief executive of Devicescape, a company that helps make public Wi-Fi networks more reliable for mobile phone service.So while you are checking for firmware updates in your router\u2019s web dashboard, make sure to also check your security settings and change the username and password to something strong and unique. Security experts recommend creating long, complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases and added numbers and special characters. (Examples: My fav0rite numb3r is Gr33n4782# or The cat ate the C0TT0n candy 224%.) Write down these credentials on the same piece of paper where you recorded your IP address.Even if your router still appears to work properly, the device has reached the end of its life when manufacturers stop supporting it with firmware updates, leaving it vulnerable to future cyberthreats. You can expect this to happen every three to five years. At that point, it is crucial to upgrade to a new piece of hardware.The best way to check is to look up your router on the manufacturer\u2019s website and read notes about its firmware releases. If there hasn\u2019t been a firmware update in the last year, the router has probably been discontinued.Among the routers affected by the VPNFilter malware, a significant portion of them were more than five years old, said Cisco\u2019s Mr. Watchinski.How did we get here in the first place? Historically, manufacturers have designed routers by cobbling together open-source software platforms with commodity components to produce base stations as cheaply as possible \u2014 with little care for long-term security, Mr. Fraser said.\u201cIt is a miserable situation, and it has been from day one,\u201d he said. But Mr. Fraser added that there were now \u201cnew world\u201d routers with operating systems, tougher security and thoughtful features to make network management easy.The caveat is that smarter Wi-Fi systems tend to cost more than cheap routers that people are accustomed to. Eero\u2019s base stations start at $199, and a Google Wifi station costs $119, compared with $50 for a cheap router. For both of these systems, you can also add base stations throughout the home to extend their wireless connections, creating a so-called mesh network.Another bonus? Mr. Fraser noted that more modern Wi-Fi systems should have longer life spans because the companies sometimes relied on different revenue streams, like selling subscriptions to network security services.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Maybe the Gig Economy Isn\u2019t Reshaping Work After All", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou can see the gig economy everywhere but in the statistics.For years, economists, pundits and policymakers have grappled with the rise of Uber, the growth of temporary work and the fissuring of the relationship between companies and their workers. Optimists cheered the flexibility offered by the freelance life. Pessimists fretted about the disappearance of traditional jobs, with the benefits and legal protections they provided.Roughly 10 percent of American workers in 2017 were employed in some form of what the government calls \u201calternative work arrangements,\u201d a broad category including Uber drivers, freelance writers and people employed through temporary-help agencies \u2014 essentially anyone whose main source of work comes outside a traditional employment relationship. Far from a boom in gig work, that represents a slight decline from 2005, when about 11 percent of workers fell into those categories.\u201cI think everybody\u2019s narrative got blown up,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.Mr. Strain and other experts cautioned that the data released on Thursday did not signal the American workplace had remained static over the past decade. The government\u2019s numbers, by design, do not include people who do gig or freelance work in addition to traditional jobs, and they may not fully capture income-generating activities that people might not consider \u201cwork,\u201d like renting out a home on Airbnb.\u201cIn my view, it\u2019s this domestic outsourcing that is the big change in why wages don\u2019t rise and why workers feel so insecure,\u201d said Eileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal think tank. \u201cAnd we have only the most indirect data to show it.\u201dRafael Sanchez is one of those who may fall into a gray area in the statistics. He moved to the United States from Mexico 16 years ago, eventually settling in New Brunswick, N.J., and was initially able to find steady work, including a five-year stint as a full-time employee of a window factory.But Mr. Sanchez was laid off in 2007, and he has since worked for a series of temporary-help and staffing agencies, moving from factory to factory and warehouse to warehouse, earning $9 an hour to pack boxes and do other manual labor. The positions can last months or even years without turning into permanent jobs working directly for the factories, which offer better pay and room for advancement.\u201cThey\u2019re not jobs where you can get ahead,\u201d Mr. Sanchez said through an interpreter.Economists have long argued that the most visible kinds of gig work are a relatively small part of the overall labor market, and that nonstandard work arrangements long predated the emergence of app-based platforms like Uber and TaskRabbit. (Uber\u2019s impact was somewhat visible in the data: The number of independent contractors in the transportation and utilities industry increased by about 200,000 from 2005 to 2017.)The report on Thursday did not break out online workers; a follow-up report scheduled for September will do so. But it portrayed an alternative work force far broader than the one typically conjured by the term \u201cgig economy.\u201dThe largest category of alternative workers, independent contractors, are disproportionately in their mid-40s or older and common in sectors like construction that have not been disrupted by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. They earn about as much, on average, as standard employees, and are relatively happy with their arrangements: Nearly eight in 10 say they prefer being an independent contractor to being an employee.The picture looks different for on-call and temporary workers, who tend to be younger, earn less and rarely have access to employer-provided health or retirement benefits. They are also far more likely to say they would prefer traditional work.Neither category, however, has grown as a share of the work force since 2005. Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a staffing firm in Chicago, said the narrative of the gig economy had long been overblown. \u201cBecause of social media and stories out there, I think the perception of the contingent work force has been inflated,\u201d he said.Lawrence Mishel, an economist for the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute and a long-time skeptic of the significance of the gig economy, said it wasn\u2019t surprising that the report showed relatively little impact from online marketplaces.\u201cA lot of this hype has been driven by the tech world believing that they are the center of the universe,\u201d Mr. Mishel said.But Mr. Mishel said he was surprised by the slower growth in other areas. And he wasn\u2019t the only one perplexed by the report.Economists offered various explanations for the discrepancy. One possibility is that the boom in gig-type jobs was real but that as the economy has improved, more people have been able to find traditional work. Part-time work, which surged in the recession, has fallen in the recovery, and employment by temporary-help services has leveled off. If true of alternative work more broadly, that would suggest that what many commenters interpreted as a structural shift in the economy was instead a temporary result of a weak labor market.It is also possible that the new data understates real changes in the nature of work. The government\u2019s standard tools for measuring employment have struggled to capture the shifting employment landscape. For example, the Current Population Survey, the monthly survey used to calculate the unemployment rate and other key measures, shows that self-employment is falling, even as tax data from the Internal Revenue Service has shown the opposite.\u201cThe questions on our standard surveys don\u2019t probe into the nature of these arrangements,\u201d said Katharine G. Abraham, a University of Maryland economist who served as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics under President Bill Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking the right questions, and they\u2019re hard to answer anyway.\u201dThe bureau\u2019s data comes from an add-on to the Current Population Survey intended to fill in some of those gaps. But it has shortcomings. The extra questions, for example, were asked only of people considered \u201cemployed\u201d in the standard survey. That might leave out people who earn income through activities that they do not see as a job, such as selling products online or working erratically as a freelancer.Professor Abraham said there was evidence that workers struggled to accurately report and classify work that did not fall neatly into traditional buckets. Some Uber drivers, for example, might consider themselves employees of the ride-sharing company, even though legally classified as independent contractors. Some Amazon warehouse workers might report being employees of the e-commerce giant, even if employed by an outside staffing firm.Professor Abraham and other experts said, however, that if there had been a big rise in alternative work, it should have shown up in the latest survey. The fact that it did not, they said, suggested that any shift had been relatively modest.\u201cDefinitely, the vast majority of individuals are still W-2 employees working in traditional jobs,\u201d Professor Katz said. He said it was too early to account for the divergence between the government findings and his study with Professor Krueger.Teasing out exactly what has and has not changed will require more data, which may not be coming. The Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2016 received funding to revive its survey on alternative work, but the Trump administration has not requested funding to run the survey on a regular basis.\u201cThe fact that our last data point on this was in 2005 makes it so hard to figure out what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, director of economic research for the job-search site Indeed. \u201cMeasurement is important, and this is why it\u2019s important to fund data analysis.\u201dNelson D.

Now that AT&T has won, the cable company is expected to move quickly with a Fox offer.Vertical mergers have rarely run into opposition. But the Justice Department built its lawsuit against the Time Warner deal on the argument that AT&T, with its ability to both create content and distribute it, would wield too much power over the media and telecom industries.There is a difference between AT&T and Comcast: national presence. AT&T is a truly nationwide pay-television provider through its DirecTV satellite service. While cable companies tend to have huge presences in the markets where they operate, Comcast covers only about a third of the country.Regulators tend to think about the pay-television and broadband markets on a national basis. (The reasoning: National providers have much more negotiating leverage than regional ones.)But it\u2019s also worth remembering that when Comcast initially bought NBCUniversal, regulators were worried enough about combining a pay-television and broadband provider with a content creator that they demanded restrictions on Comcast\u2019s behavior.The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has said publicly that he doesn\u2019t like imposing conditions on companies in exchange for merger approval. He prefers requiring asset sales or blocking deals altogether. Comcast is willing to sell some businesses to win approval.Then there are Fox\u2019s 22 regional sports networks. Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal already owns nine similar networks and would argue that the two sets of properties mostly don\u2019t overlap. But if pressed, the company would be willing to sell enough networks to satisfy regulators, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter but not authorized to speak publicly about it.A Fox sale, no matter the buyer, would inevitably create significant consolidation within the movie industry. Comcast owns Universal, which has the \u201cJurassic World\u201d franchise. Fox owns its eponymous movie studio, which has the \u201cAvatar,\u201d \u201cX-Men\u201d and \u201cDeadpool\u201d franchises. Disney owns the top-performing Hollywood studio, home of the Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchises.But both Comcast and Disney would argue that there are enough content producers \u2014 Amazon, Apple and other digital players \u2014 that there\u2019s little danger they would corner the market.Mr. Delrahim discussed the possible battle for Fox at an industry conference last week. Here\u2019s what he said of the potential state of play:\u25a0 Harry First, the co-director of the competition, innovation and information law program at the New York University School of Law, said that he thought the Disney deal would pose fewer antitrust risks. \u201cIn a horizontal deal, there\u2019s probably less risk to having the deal opposed outright,\u201d he said in an interview.It ultimately will be up to Fox\u2019s board and shareholders to decide whether it\u2019s worth trading in a Disney deal with a good chance of passing antitrust review for a higher-priced Comcast deal that poses more potential risks. With AT&T having won its fight with the Justice Department, their concerns about Comcast may be assuaged.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Is a Win for Consumers", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Moore is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation.The Justice Department must now decide whether to appeal the judge\u2019s ruling, a move that would be sheer folly and a waste of taxpayer money, given the firm rejection of every argument the government\u2019s lawyers made. Hopefully, this decision will also clear the path for other planned cost-cutting mergers in the media and telecommunications industries.The government\u2019s antitrust challenge to this $85 billion deal was one of the flimsiest assaults against a corporate merger in recent memory. These two companies don\u2019t even directly compete with each other. Normally, antitrust cases are brought to block so-called \u201chorizontal\u201d mergers, in which companies in the same line of business \u2014 two airlines, for example \u2014 want to combine forces. Even in such instances, the antitrust laws are antiquated, given that globalized competition and the speed of technological change continually knock down industry leaders.The core argument brought by the Justice Department, in an antitrust action championed by President Trump, was that AT&T could use its new market power to raise prices exorbitantly on cable and satellite operators that want to run Time Warner TV programs \u2014 such as CNN broadcasts or HBO shows. The government\u2019s lawyers argued that consumers\u2019 cable bills would go up if the merger went through.The absurdity of this argument is that the Justice lawyers seemed to be stuck in the 1980s. In 2018, the number of American households getting their television or video entertainment from traditional cable providers is declining. The very notion of \u201cwatching TV\u201d is becoming as obsolete as listening to music on a turntable. My teenage kids and their friends don\u2019t even own TVs. They watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on their computers or smartphones, and one of their favorite \u201cchannels\u201d is YouTube. They can choose from thousands of programs at a very low cost. Today, any hotshot with a camera and a Facebook page can be a media company. Is that enough competition for the Justice Department?In short, there is probably no area in today\u2019s economy where there is less threat of monopolistic power than in media and entertainment. The proliferation of video content and ways to get it means that these companies must stay innovative and affordable, or they are gone as fast as you can say Blockbuster Video.In this cutthroat environment, the AT&T and Time Warner merger is better described as a survival strategy, not a market domination plot. The companies hope to lower costs by merging AT&T\u2019s transmission of video content with the entertainment products that Time Warner offers.This merger could bring welcome competition to Google and Facebook, which have captured about two-thirds of the online advertising market, a point that the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers ignored. Combining AT&T\u2019s mobile, broadband, and DirecTV platforms with Time Warner\u2019s movies, TV shows, music and sporting events could turn them into a serious rival to the tech behemoths.Businesses and families may also benefit from the merger if it accelerates the development of 5G wireless networks. The merged company could use its vast spectrum of resources to jump-start the delivery of Time Warner content through AT&T\u2019s wireless network. This will mean new competition for residential broadband from cable companies such as Comcast.The days when companies like U.S. Steel or General Motors or Microsoft could accumulate the market power to dominate an industry and gouge consumers with higher prices are long gone. Some of the most powerful companies in the world \u2014 Amazon and Walmart, for example \u2014 do just the opposite: they are constantly lowering, not raising their prices.It is too early to know whether this mega-deal will turn out well for shareholders and consumers. But the Justice Department should not be standing in the way. Its goal, instead, should be to allow made-in-America companies like AT&T and Time Warner to do what it takes to become global competitors, not global dinosaurs.The Trump administration should be thankful that, in this merger, it isn\u2019t China buying up America\u2019s strategic companies or assets. These are two American companies merging to gain profitability and global market share. In this way, the merger helps put America first. Someone, please tell the lawyers.Stephen Moore is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project for Economic Growth.Advertisement"}

The vehicles could leave downtown and O\u2019Hare as frequently as every 30 seconds, the city says. They would exceed 100 miles per hour and make the entire trip from downtown to O\u2019Hare in 12 minutes.But there are roadblocks ahead. Chicago\u2019s City Council would need to agree to the plan. The city must negotiate a deal with the Boring Company. It will be expensive \u2014 up to $1 billion, on current estimates.

{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Case Was So Closely Watched", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision was no less momentous for President Trump\u2019s Justice Department which, in suing to block the deal, was advocating a new approach to antitrust regulation.Here\u2019s a primer on what happened:The Justice Department said it would consider its options.CVS and Aetna also rose, while Express Scripts, which is being acquired by insurer Cigna, added about 5 percent. Cigna also rose.In the past, regulators have instead focused on keeping one company, or a small group of companies, from owning too much of any one specific industry. It comes up when companies buy their competitors \u2014 what\u2019s known as horizontal integration.What makes the AT&T decision noteworthy is that the deal was challenged even though it doesn\u2019t share all the characteristics of horizontal integration.\u201cVertical mergers do not fit the traditional horizontal-merger analytical framework used by the U.S. regulatory authorities,\u201d R. Mark McCareins, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, wrote in an online discussion about vertical mergers. It means the trade commission and the Department of Justice \u201care faced with pounding a square peg into a round hole.\u201dDoing so might have encouraged the Justice Department to act more aggressively when looking at deals in the future, and also could have prompted a rethink by companies with similar deals in the works.He could have approved it but attached conditions. The aim of the conditions could broadly have been to keep AT&T from using its control of providers like HBO or CNN as a weapon to increase costs for its rivals. The Justice Department argued that AT&T could charge rivals a high price for, say, HBO to make AT&T\u2019s own product more competitive.One way to address this could have been to appoint a third party to oversee disagreements between AT&T and the cable companies that want to license Time Warner content. The government didn\u2019t like that approach.Another option was to demand that AT&T and Time Warner sell off some plum assets. AT&T and Time Warner didn\u2019t like this approach, so was expected to appeal any such decision.Yup.

{"Headline": "How Amazon Steers Shoppers to Its Own Products", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt started with a simple battery.Around 2009, Amazon quietly entered the private label business by offering a handful of items under a new brand called AmazonBasics. Early offerings were the kinds of unglamorous products that consumers typically bought at their local hardware store: power cords and cables for electronics and, in particular, batteries \u2014 with prices roughly 30 percent lower than that of national brands like Energizer and Duracell.The results were stunning. In just a few years, AmazonBasics had grabbed nearly a third of the online market for batteries, outselling both Energizer and Duracell on its site.Inside Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters, that success raised a tantalizing possibility. If, with very little effort, Amazon could become a huge player in the battery market, what else might be possible for the company?Anyone who spends much time on the Amazon site can see the answer to that question. The company now has roughly 100 private label brands for sale on its huge online marketplace, of which more than five dozen have been introduced in the past year alone. But few of those are sold under the Amazon brand. Instead, they have been given a variety of anodyne, disposable names like Spotted Zebra (kids clothes), Good Brief (men\u2019s underwear), Wag (dog food) and Rivet (home furnishings). Want to buy a stylish but affordable cap-sleeve dress? A flared version from Lark & Ro ($39), maybe in millennial pink, might be just what you\u2019re looking for.On the surface, the move into the private label business (in which goods are sold under the retailer\u2019s name rather than that of an outside vendor) appears to be a deft move by Amazon. Analysts predict that nearly half of all online shopping in the United States will be conducted on Amazon\u2019s platform in the next couple of years. That creates a massive opportunity for Amazon to more than double revenue from its in-house brands to $25 billion in the next four years, according to analysts at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. That\u2019s the equivalent of all of Macy\u2019s revenue last year.Furthermore, in an effort to incentivize shoppers to sign up for the Amazon Prime program (which now costs $119 a year, up from $99 a year ago), certain of Amazon\u2019s private-label products, such as its Goodthreads men\u2019s khakis or Wag\u2019s salmon-and-lentil dog food, can be purchased only by Prime customers.\u201cAmazon started very slowly in private label,\u201d said Youssef Squali, a managing director of internet and digital media research at SunTrust. \u201cQuite frankly, we think our estimate for the size of the private-label business is conservative,\u201d he added.Amazon declined to make any of its executives available for this article, but in a response to a list of questions, the company said its overarching goal is to provide customers a wide range of products and brands.\u201cWe take the same approach to private label as we do with anything here at Amazon: We start with the customer and work backwards,\u201d the company said in its statement.Amazon is hardly alone in its charge into private label. Big-box retailers like Walmart and Target have been offering store brands for years and are also racing to start more private labels, particularly in apparel.But Amazon holds a unique position in the global marketplace. From its beginnings in 1994, Amazon\u2019s platform was designed to democratize retail. Small vendors or manufacturers could sell outdoor grills, computer bags, and children\u2019s toys alongside established brands. Now, with its expansion into private label, Amazon has shifted away from being an impartial, may-the-best-product-win distribution partner to being a direct competitor to those other vendors.It\u2019s not just lower prices that are driving Amazon\u2019s customers to its private-label goods.Amazon is utilizing its knowledge of its powerful marketplace machine \u2014 from optimizing word-search algorithms to analyzing competitors\u2019 sales data to using its customer-review networks \u2014 to steer shoppers toward its in-house brands and away from its competitors, say analysts.And as consumers increasingly shop using voice technology, the playing field becomes even more tilted. For instance, consumers asking Amazon\u2019s Alexa to \u201cbuy batteries\u201d get only one option: AmazonBasics.The emerging private label threat from Amazon presents a quandary for small vendors and big, national brands alike. Even as Amazon takes away market share and eats into their profit margins, they have little choice but to continue to sell on Amazon\u2019s platform in order to get themselves in front of millions of potential customers.\u201cI think, effectively, you have a company that has conspired with about a billion consumers and technology to destroy brands,\u201d argued Scott Galloway, a founder of business research firm now called Gartner L2 and a professor of marketing at New York University Stern School of Business, in a presentation last year. \u201cTheir attitude is that brands have, for a long time, earned an unearned price premium that screws consumers.\u201d\u201cI think there is a potential monopolization case against Amazon,\u201d said Chris Sagers, an antitrust professor at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law in Ohio. \u201cThe Amazon marketing people are geniuses. They\u2019re brilliant,\u201d Mr. Sagers said. \u201cBut if they are getting massive penetration in the market and preventing customers from buying products from their competitors? Well, it\u2019s like they\u2019re writing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for them.\u201dIn an emailed response, a spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is \u201ca small fraction of a very large and vibrant global retail industry, and the competition and invention happening across retail is great for customers.\u201dType the word \u201cbatteries\u201d into Amazon\u2019s search bar and the first thing that will catch your eye is a large sponsor ad running across the top of the screen for Energizer, featuring its ubiquitous drum-playing pink bunny.But after that, the screen is filled with offerings for AmazonBasics batteries, many flagged with badges that denote them as a \u201cbest seller\u201d or \u201cAmazon\u2019s Choice,\u201d a designation for items that are highly rated and have low customer returns.Energizer would not say how much it pays Amazon for the banner advertising, but several people with knowledge of Amazon\u2019s pricing say some large brands are spending six figures each month advertising their products on Amazon\u2019s platform even as Amazon\u2019s private-label products are crowding them out.Are the big brands fighting a battle that may be impossible for them to win?For more than two decades, shoppers perusing the aisles of Walmart have run into cans of Sam\u2019s cola or coffee alongside national brands on the shelves. In Costco, shoppers can pickup store-brand Kirkland paper towels and bacon. (Store brands are typically priced well below their big-brand peers because they do not spend money on expensive national marketing campaigns like Procter & Gamble or Kimberly-Clark.)But now, Amazon and many of these big-box retailers are increasing their private-label efforts. In the past year, sales of in-house labels of food and nonfood goods at brick-and-mortar stores grew more than 4 percent, while sales of name brands were flat, according to data from Nielsen\u2019s Total Food View research.For Amazon, the starting line for deciding what goods or products to replicate for an in-house brand is not that different than what happens at retailers like Target or Walmart. They look at what is selling online and figure out if they can manufacture it cheaper.Commodity goods like paper towels, exercise mats, and power strips can be easily cloned at a fraction of the cost. In other cases, particularly apparel, Amazon may use private-label goods to fill a gap if clothing manufacturers or high-end designers are unwilling to sell on their platform.Shoppers looking for Ralph Lauren polos or button-down oxford shirts won\u2019t find them sold directly on Amazon, for example. But they will find Amazon Essentials polos in a rainbow of 16 shades, priced at $12, or oxfords by its Goodthreads label for $25.Amazon\u2019s advantage over traditional retailers is its knowledge and access to data from its platform.Take word searches. About 70 percent of the word searches done on Amazon\u2019s search browser are for generic goods. That means consumers are typing in \u201cmen\u2019s underwear\u201d or \u201crunning shoes\u201d rather than asking, specifically, for Hanes or Nike.For Amazon, those word searches by consumers allow it to put its private-label products in front of the consumer and make sure they appear quickly. In addition, Amazon has the emails of the consumers who performed searches on its site and can email them directly or use pop-up ads on other websites to direct those consumers back to Amazon\u2019s marketplace.Some of this data is also available to big brands or vendors selling on Amazon\u2019s platform through a program called Amazon Retail Analytics Premium. But it is expensive, with vendors paying 1 percent of their wholesale cost of goods sold to Amazon or a minimum of $100,000 to get access to a database that lets them see some, but not all, of the data Amazon has compiled.\u201cAmazon has access to data that nobody else has,\u201d said James Thomson, a former Amazon executive who now works at Buy Box Experts, a consulting firm that advises companies on how to build their brands and sell products on Amazon. \u201cI can\u2019t just walk into a store and say, \u2018Excuse me, did you look at this brand of cereal this morning and decide not to buy it?\u2019 Amazon has that data. They know you looked at a brand and didn\u2019t buy it and they\u2019re not going to share that data with any other brands.\u201dWith that data, Amazon is able to conduct regional or one-day price tests, dropping the cost of its goods in certain markets to discover at what price more customers purchase the item.And while traditional retailers can readily scan their sales data and understand what size shirts and colors sell and which ones don\u2019t, Amazon has hundreds of reviews of competitors\u2019 products on its website, providing customer feedback on how the shirt looked after five washes or how it fit different body types.\u201cAmazon can analyze those reviews and figure out why customers were dissatisfied with a certain product,\u201d said Cooper Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner L2. \u201cAmazon can then turn around and create a private label for a similar product but improve upon it based on what customers say.\u201dWhen Amazon introduces a new private-label product, it doesn\u2019t go all in. It often uses a technique analysts call \u201ctest-and-repeat,\u201d ordering a small batch of product from its manufacturers, testing demand and then, if the product is successful, reordering a bigger batch of product as well as expanding its assortment.Again, here, Amazon has a big leg up on traditional retailers. Most retailers appeal to one segment of consumer \u2014 the budget, midmarket, or higher-end shopper. Amazon can offer a variety of private-label goods, positioned toward shoppers in different categories, says Deborah Weinswig, the founder and chief executive of Coresight Research.For instance, through Amazon\u2019s Pinzon brand, it offers a queen-size hypoallergenic mattress topper for $40.37. But it also sells a mattress topper through its AmazonBasics private label for $22.99.Similarly, Amazon sells men\u2019s button-down shirts under both the Amazon Essentials and Goodthreads labels. Analysts at research firm Gartner L2 found, on best-selling products, the Goodthreads apparel cost 60 percent more.But, perhaps more important, Amazon has utilized a reviewing program called Amazon Vine for many of its private-label goods.Amazon Vine, or Vine Voices, are very active reviewers on the Amazon marketplace who are then invited by the company to participate in its Vine program, which identifies them as influential reviewers. In exchange for free products, which they disclose receiving, the reviewers agree to write evaluations on Amazon\u2019s site.Amazon has actively used Vine Voices to help introduce its private label brands. An analysis of more than 1,600 products across ten of Amazon\u2019s private-label brands, including AmazonBasics, Amazon Essentials, Mama Bear, Pinzon, Goodthreads, and others, showed that about half had Vine reviews. Of those 835 products, more than half of the first 30 reviews were from the Vine program, according to ReviewMeta.com, an online tool that helps customers identify inauthentic reviews.While, for the most part, the Vine and non-Vine reviews were similarly rated, in a handful of cases, the Vine reviews were significantly better. For instance, Vine reviews for Amazon\u2019s Mama Bear diapers and baby products averaged 4.36 stars; non-Vine reviews averaged 3.82 stars.Amazon Vine is also available to non-Amazon brands, but, specifics around how the program works are difficult to determine because Amazon doesn\u2019t make it public. But many analysts say it is fairly expensive to participate, saying it can cost manufacturers as much as $5,000 to obtain reviews for one product, along with the cost of giving the product away. (The money to participate goes to Amazon; the Vine reviewers receive no compensation beyond the free product.)A spokeswoman for the company said Amazon does not incentivize positive star ratings or attempt to influence the content of reviews. She also said that the company limits the total number of Vine reviews that it displays for each product.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening on Amazon is different than you see in brick-and-mortar stores,\u201d said Kevin Grundy, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies. \u201cThere, private label brands might take slightly more than 10 percent market share. Amazon\u2019s private label brands are taking more than 25 percent of the online market.\u201dMr. Grundy said when the contract for the AmazonBasics batteries, which are currently made by a manufacturer in the Far East, next comes up for bid, likely bidders could include Energizer and Duracell.The next frontier? Alexa. Competitors and industry analysts are closely watching Amazon\u2019s voice-operated platform, wondering whether Amazon will use that rapidly growing arena to further steer consumers to its own brands.The essay, written by a law student named Lina Khan, argued, essentially, that the current framing of the nation\u2019s antitrust laws have not evolved to deal with the market power of technology giants like Amazon.The articles fed into a growing debate among economists and lawyers around whether Amazon is displaying monopolistic or anticompetitive behavior in its marketplace.Amazon has two strong defenses when these issues are raised.At least since the 1970s, courts have been very skeptical of antitrust plaintiffs who can\u2019t show that the challenged conduct would cause prices to go up or quality to go down. In this case, Amazon can argue, quite vehemently that, through its platform, consumers are paying lower prices, say legal experts.And while Amazon\u2019s brands have quickly gained market share on its platform in some areas, in other segments, such as apparel, they account for less than 1 percent of the inventory sold. And when broadened out to include brick-and-mortar stores, its online share of the battery market equals less than 5 percent. Until Amazon\u2019s share of the total market starts to reach closer to 40 percent or more, it is difficult to argue there is an attempted-monopolization case, say legal experts.But if its private-label business grows as analysts expect it to do, could it face a legal challenge of whether it is a \u201cmonopsony\u201d? In a monopsony, a large buyer controls a large proportion of the market and drives prices down.\u201cIf Amazon is not making its competitors available on voice and Alexa, well, that sounds like possible exclusionary conduct to me,\u201d said Mr. Sagers. \u201cIf a federal court could be convinced that there is a market for in-home, voice retail distribution and that Amazon controls it, then I think Amazon could be looking at a monopsony case.\u201dStill, others argue a dominant question in any sort of antitrust action has been whether the company\u2019s actions or a planned merger would harm consumers.\u201cYou have to show that the end game is some sort of consumer harm, either through higher prices or lower quality,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. \u201cAnd so far, Amazon doesn\u2019t even show up on the radar screen when it comes to consumer harm.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Newspaper Shooting Shows Widening Use of Facial Recognition by Authorities", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe revelation shone a spotlight on just how easily and how quickly officials can pinpoint suspects using a technology that is increasingly pervasive in law enforcement. Over the past few years, facial recognition has been quietly adopted by the authorities across the United States \u2014 including at the local policing level \u2014 and become part of the standard law enforcement toolkit.Sixteen states let the Federal Bureau of Investigation use the technology to compare the faces of suspected criminals to driver\u2019s license and ID photos, according to a report from the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology. And thanks to recent improvements to facial recognition by some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, its influence in policing is likely to grow.The use of the technology in the Capital Gazette shooting comes amid a broader debate about facial recognition\u2019s role in policing. Proponents see it as a powerful tool for catching criminals, but civil liberties experts have warned that it can be an instrument of mass surveillance that threatens people\u2019s ability to anonymously go about their business.The civil rights groups argued that Rekognition was overly powerful \u2014 according to Amazon\u2019s web site, it can not only track individuals, it can also detect \u201cup to 100 faces in challenging crowded photos,\u201d as well as license plates captured by traffic cameras. That means the system could potentially ensnare many ordinary citizens, rather than being limited only to people committing crimes.In the case of the Capital Gazette shooting, police did not use facial recognition in a way that violated people\u2019s privacy, according to experts in the technology. They noted that the police were merely confirming the identity of a suspect whom they already had in custody, as opposed to trying to find a criminal in an enormous database of people.Timothy Altomare, chief of the Anne Arundel County Police Department in Maryland, said on Friday that the police used the Maryland Image Repository System to identify Mr. Ramos when he did not cooperate with investigators. They initially tried to learn Mr. Ramos\u2019s identity through his fingerprints, he said. But with the fingerprint identification moving slowly, they quickly switched to facial recognition.Specifically, a photo of Mr. Ramos was sent to the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center, which searched the repository of driver\u2019s license photos and mug shots to find a match, said Mr. Altomare.\u201cWe would have been much longer in identifying him and being able to push forward,\u201d Mr. Altomare said about why the image system was used.Police departments and individuals can even build similar technology on their own with relative ease.\u201cIf a police department hired me for a summer internship, I could cook them up a decent face recognition algorithm \u2014 not that I am offering my services,\u201d said Jonathan Frankle, an artificial intelligence researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who helped write a study of face recognition technology at the Georgetown Law Center for Privacy and Technology.Many local law enforcement agencies may run criminal searches against state databases of driver\u2019s license photos, involving millions of citizens in a kind of government surveillance they didn\u2019t sign up for, said Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization.\u201cPeople who are in a driver\u2019s license database did not agree to be part of a criminal search every time the police are looking for a suspect,\u201d Ms. Lynch said. \u201cA civil photograph should not be subject to search for criminal purposes.\u201dOne added concern is that face recognition systems sometimes make mistakes, matching an image to the wrong person. \u201cDepending on how good your image is, the accuracy can vary wildly,\u201d Mr. Frankle said.That\u2019s especially so when photos are taken by overhead security cameras, which do not always provide a clear and straightforward image. Even in good conditions, face recognition technology fails at least part of the time. And those failures may increase as databases of potential suspects grow and there are more chances of mistaken outcomes, said Mr. Frankle.\u201cThe accuracy of these systems depends on so many things, including the size of your database,\u201d said Mr. Frankle. \u201cThe technology may get worse as the database gets bigger.\u201dCade Metz reported from San Francisco and Natasha Singer from New York.

In each episode, we profile a maker who embodies the modern spirit of craft. Just as Dorchester Collection hotels dedicate themselves to creating perfect moments for guests, these creatives are devoted to crafting moments of beauty that resonate across times, places and cultures.\nEven the greatest creative projects are often marked as much by what goes off-script as what goes to plan (not for nothing do project managers talk about \u201cherding cats\u201d). But for the architecture and design group Partisans, the surprises they encounter during projects aren\u2019t just welcome \u2014 they\u2019re the whole point. \u201cThe objective is not to have a solution before the process is actually complete,\u201d says Jonathan Friedman, a partner at the firm.\nThis willingness to embrace the unexpected lies at the heart of the company, which counts the phrase \u201cbeauty emerges when design misbehaves\u201d as its mantra. As founding partner Alex Josephson explains, for Partisans, \u201cmisbehavior\u201d leads to true innovation \u2014 the kind that marries technology and craftsmanship to invent new processes and produce works of artistry.\n\u201cWe love the big vision, but then there are people in our studio who use craft to develop human-scale design,\u201d Josephson says. \u201cThey get down to the detail of a finger interacting with an object, or designing a garbage bin that is safe for security.\u201d\nAs the firm\u2019s mantra has led them from work on bars and private residences to train stations and master plans for entire neighborhoods, the world has begun to take notice: In 2017, their audacious design concept for a ferry terminal in Seoul was awarded the American Architecture Prize Design of the Year for Transportation.\nTheir work, on the surface, may seem to be about wondrous moments and rule-bending forms, but it\u2019s what leads to those moments that drives the firm \u2014 discovering new tools, working with engineers and fabricators, and using technical limitations to generate unconventional works of intricate beauty.\nThe curves, however, are not just for awe. With nine kilometers of grooves precisely milled by computer-numerical controlled machinery, they also become functional, as small indentations become bowls and waves become armrests. For this, Partisans worked with engineers to write software that would allow the fabricators to use the CNC as a sculpting tool.\nThough the milling process is not unusual, achieving this level and scale of craftsmanship was entirely new. When the American Institute of Architects gave the project an R+D award in 2015, the juror Marc Fornes called it \u201can exquisite application of the technology.\u201d\nOver at the newly built restaurant Quetzal, a 65-seat space with a high-end regional Mexican concept, all cooking will be done with wood fire on a huge indoor grill \u2014 an idea van Gameren had without fully thinking through the monstrous ventilation system all that smoke would require.\nPartisans\u2019 solution? Hide the system\u2019s guts behind a low, undulating ceiling. This simple detail turned what could have been a disastrous limitation into an intimate \u201cmoment,\u201d\u00a0achieving what Josephson describes as the feeling of being \u201cinside a soft market tent.\u201d\nA \u201cconstant relay race\u201d is how Josephson describes the team dynamic. \u201cYou need to be able to hand the baton off at certain points and let responsibilities ebb and flow,\u201d he says. The union that has evolved is one largely of equals, though it\u2019s not without its tensions.

{"Headline": "The Trump Trade Slump May Yet Happen: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump broke with protocol by tweeting about jobs report\u2022 Investors have compared Facebook\u2019s actions to human rights violations\u2022 Deutsche Bank can\u2019t catch a break\u2022 Goldman\u2019s consumer finance plans are bigger than you thoughtBefore Donald Trump became president, many feared that the combative trade policies he was proposing would sock the U.S. economy and send unemployment higher.Is this unexpected state of affairs sustainable?If anything, the strength of the economy might persuade Mr. Trump that he can pursue his trade agenda without causing too much collateral damage at home. That could mean following through on his threats to impose tariffs on Chinese products totaling as much as $150 billion.Whether Mr. Trump does so should become clear soon. On June 15, the administration is scheduled to release a final list of $50 billion of Chinese goods subject to tariffs, which would then be imposed shortly thereafter.Some in the administration have warned that a protectionist trade policy could drag the economy and the stock market. But the longer the economy keeps churning out jobs, and the longer the stock market remains resilient, the harder it will be for those advisers to make their case. Indeed, the U.S. may be less sensitive to trade frictions than economists and investors previously believed.But that is a very optimistic scenario, and much could still go wrong.The metals tariffs, alone, are unlikely to crater the markets or hammer the economy. But a full-blown trade war with China, involving $150 billion of tariffs and everything China has promised in retaliation, would almost certainly shake the confidence of investors and businesses. Tomasz Wieladek, an economist at Barclays, in a report on Friday said the metals tariffs and those against China, along with retaliatory actions, could knock nearly a full percentage point off global growth.The fact that the stock market hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since mid-February,when the trade rhetoric heated up, suggests investors never really shrugged off the prospect of trade wars. Now, as a confrontation with China approaches, markets may become volatile as investors prepare for the fallout.It\u2019s also important to remember that the strength of the economy is not an unalloyed positive. If the buoyant conditions, and the impact of new tariffs, produce higher inflation, the Federal Reserve will have less leeway to relax monetary policy in response to a big trade shock or a stock market plunge. In other words, investors would have no protection from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.One way to view the current situation is that Mr. Trump is an opportunist who has astutely ridden an economic expansion that had long been underway \u2013 and is now hoping it will carry him through a drawn-out trade battle.It\u2019s a bold, far from certain, bet.\u2014Peter EavisThe Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely releases its monthly employment report on the first Friday of the month. The night before, under longstanding tradition, the president and several senior administration officials \u2014 including the Treasury secretary and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 are briefed on the numbers, which they are not supposed to disclose until the report is made public at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time the next morning.But Mr. Trump, who was briefed on the numbers Thursday evening, appeared to foreshadow the strength of the latest report on Friday morning on Twitter.Market watchers saw evidence that the tweet was moving markets.Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, pushed back on whether Mr. Trump broke with protocol.President Trump tweeted earlier this morning that he was looking forward to the jobs report. We now know why.Drew Armstrong, a reporter at Bloomberg, tweeted the strong reaction of the dollar after the report\u2019s release:SoftBank\u2019s investment in G.M.\u2019s driverless car division and Waymo\u2019s move to create a huge fleet of robot-taxis suggest maybe not.G.M. CruiseWaymoThose numbers don\u2019t bode well for Uber\u2019s autonomous car technology.

Analysts have raised second-quarter earnings estimates for S.&P. 500 companies 0.2 percent during April and May, according to FactSet.That might not seem like much, but over the past 10 years, quarterly earnings estimates have declined, on average, 3.7 percent during the first two months of that quarter.The gain so far this quarter falls well short of the record set during the first two months of the first quarter of this year. As analysts factored in tax cuts signed into law in late 2017, they raised profit expectations 5.7 percent in January and February.Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the centrist Democrat from North Dakota who is fighting a pitched battle to save her seat, has gotten a lift from an unlikely source: the conservative billionaire Koch brothers.The ad is the latest evidence that the brothers, often at odds with President Trump, may be moving away from strictly partisan work on behalf of Republicans in favor of initiatives that will advance their libertarian-leaning legislative priorities, including free trade, immigration legislation and access to medicines, regardless of party affiliation.Ms. Heitkamp is one of 10 Democratic senators up for re-election in states won by Mr. Trump in 2016, but unlike other Democrats, she has drawn a top-flight challenger in Kevin Cramer, North Dakota\u2019s lone House member and a close ally of the president\u2019s. Her seat is one of the keys to Republican efforts to hold on to or expand the party\u2019s one-seat Senate majority.The former Treasury secretary has joined the board of the Financial Services Volunteer Corps, an organization that helps build up the banking systems in developing countries, the group announced on Friday.Founded in 1990 at the behest of President George H. W. Bush to help Eastern European countries following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Corps now provides technical assistance to emerging economies worldwide. Its board includes Paul Volcker, Henry Kissinger, the former Goldman Sachs co-president John Thornton and the former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.Mr. Lew, who served a number of advisory roles in the Obama administration before becoming Treasury secretary in 2013, is taking the board seat that had been held by Randy Quarles, who is now the Fed\u2019s vice chair for supervision.From Mr. Lew\u2019s statement:And from a statement by Bill Donaldson, the former banker and S.E.C. chairman, who serves as the Corps\u2019s chairman:\u201cJack is an outstanding addition to our Board.

{"Headline": "Disney Ups Its Bid for 21st Century Fox to $71.3 Billion", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Walt Disney Company sharply increased its offer for 21st Century Fox on Wednesday, as it looks to win a bidding war with Comcast for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s entertainment conglomerate.The Comcast chief executive, Brian L. Roberts, is equally motivated to reach an agreement with Mr. Murdoch, who has spent a lifetime forging a media empire that spans three continents, including Hollywood studios, cable networks and streaming businesses.But Disney has the pole position for now. \u201cWe remain convinced that the combination of 21CF\u2019s iconic assets, brands and franchises with Disney\u2019s will create one of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world,\u201d Mr. Murdoch said in the statement.Comcast declined to comment.At stake in this bidding war is the 20th Century Fox film studio, the FX and National Geographic cable channels, almost two dozen regional sports networks, and a large stake in a pair of sought-after international media businesses: the European pay-TV operator Sky and Star India. Not included in the sale are Fox News, the Fox broadcast network, a chain of local television stations and the FS1 sports network.Separately, Comcast is bidding against Fox for the 61 percent of Sky not already owned by Fox.Fox\u2019s robust foreign assets are a central reason Comcast and Disney are pursuing a deal as they, like other media companies, grapple with a challenge to their cornerstone business: the loss of cable and satellite customers.Gaining Fox\u2019s assets would also give the winner control over the streaming service Hulu, which added three million subscribers in the first four months of this year, for a total of 20 million. Selling TV shows directly to viewers is the latest strategy for media businesses under threat from Silicon Valley, where cash-rich behemoths like Netflix, Google and Amazon are competing for ad dollars and audiences.\u201cAt a time of dynamic change in the entertainment industry, the combination of Disney\u2019s and Fox\u2019s unparalleled collection of businesses and franchises will allow us to create more appealing high-quality content,\u201d Mr. Iger said in a statement.Disney\u2019s increased offer comprises an equal mix of cash and stock: $35.7 billion in cash and 343 million shares in Disney. Fox shareholders can elect to receive either $38 in cash for every Fox share or Disney stock at an equivalent value. Disney plans to offer a ratio of its shares for every Fox share to make sure investors receive a value of $38 per share, what is known as a collar.Fox has postponed its scheduled July 10 shareholder vote so that investors will have time to consider the new bid. A new date has not been set.Mr. Iger disagreed with the notion that the AT&T ruling had paved the way for other big mergers. \u201cIt\u2019s just simply an apples-to-oranges comparison,\u201d he said on a call with analysts Wednesday, citing Judge Richard J. Leon\u2019s warning that any attempt to apply his decision to future deals should be avoided.And Comcast apparently does not have the fondest feelings for Disney: The Jurassic Park rides at the company\u2019s Universal theme parks include Disney\u2019s famous mouse-ears hat floating in the water next to a raft that a dinosaur has destroyed.\u201cHe essentially didn\u2019t want to be known as the guy who destroyed Disney,\u201d Mr. Wieser added. \u201cThere\u2019s something to the idea that you don\u2019t leave it in a bad place.\u201dMr. Iger\u2019s latest maneuver puts Mr. Roberts on his back foot. The leader of Comcast has big ambitions to seal his family's legacy. His father started the company in 1963 and transformed it from a small cable service in Tupelo, Miss., into the nation\u2019s largest cable provider, with nearly 30 million subscribers.Mr. Roberts has handed operational duties to his executives \u2014 Stephen B. Burke leads NBCUniversal group and David N. Watson runs the cable business \u2014 as he spends most of his time analyzing acquisitions, several people familiar with him have said. In other words, mergers are his specialty.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised by another potentially compelling response from Comcast,\u201d said Tuna Amobi, a research analyst with CFRA, raising concerns of a \u201cprotracted bidding war.\u201dA revised bid would mean more borrowing for Comcast. Both the Fox and separate Sky deals would mean assuming the debt of each company in addition to the extra borrowing, a sum that would total $170 billion, according to credit ratings firm Moody\u2019s.Disney also counts a steep debt load at about $25 billion, which does not include its latest offer of $35.7 billion in cash and an assumption of nearly $14 billion of Fox\u2019s debt.Analysts have bruited about the notion that Comcast and Disney might team up and divide Fox\u2019s assets to prevent a drawn-out bidding war \u2014 a turn of events that Mr. Iger has dismissed. \u201cWe have an agreement in place with 21st Century Fox that precludes that from occurring,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Way to Pay Songwriters and Musicians in the Streaming Age Advances", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a decade, the music industry has promoted a motley series of copyright bills to Congress, only to watch them fail.In an effort to update music copyright law for the digital age, the various players involved \u2014 tech companies, music publishers, songwriters, musicians and radio broadcasters \u2014 assembled an ambitious bill that addressed their concerns.\u201cThis is going to revolutionize the way songwriters get paid in America,\u201d said Dina LaPolt, a lawyer who has been one of the music industry\u2019s most aggressive supporters of the bill.For years, songwriters and music publishers have argued that streaming services have routinely failed to properly acquire mechanical licenses \u2014 the permission to reproduce a piece of music for sale or consumption, a term that goes back to the days of player pianos. At the same time, Spotify and other companies said that there was no authoritative database identifying who owned what.David Israelite, the president of the National Music Publishers\u2019 Association and one of the main drivers behind the bill, said that the prospect of continuing litigation brought the tech companies to the table.\u201cI have no doubt that we could have sued them out of existence,\u201d Mr. Israelite said of streaming services. \u201cBut we took a different approach. We decided that we wanted to settle this and try to fix the problem, because we want them to be our business partners.\u201dLobbyists said they were confident the bill would be passed by the full Senate, and eventually become law, despite concerns raised by a few senators at the hearing. A version of the bill passed the House unanimously in April.The legislation would establish a licensing collective, to be overseen by songwriters and publishers, and paid for by the digital services, with rights information maintained by the copyright owners. Digital services, which now must track down rights holders or file notices in bulk with the Copyright Office, will be able to receive blanket licenses from the collective. In exchange, the services will gain protections against lawsuits.Some Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, including the Texas senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, expressed reservations on Thursday about a collective established by the government rather than the free market, but still voted in favor of the bill.Christopher Harrison, the chief executive of the Digital Media Association, a group that includes Google, Apple and Amazon, said that the new process would remove the bad faith that has existed between music publishers and streaming services.\u201cI describe those conversations as like the end of a Tarantino movie, where everybody is pointing guns at each other and claiming it\u2019s the other person\u2019s fault,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cWe had a number of really frank conversations with publishers, saying, \u2018Let\u2019s get past who is to blame and figure out how to solve the problem.\u2019\u201dA critical element of the bill would allow musicians to be paid for digital plays of recordings made before 1972, which are not covered by federal copyright. At a Senate hearing last month, Smokey Robinson called that rule unfair. \u201cAn arbitrary date on the calendar,\u201d he said, \u201cshould not be the arbiter of value.\u201dThe bill also includes two provisions favored by Ascap and BMI, the industry\u2019s two biggest royalty clearinghouses, over the complex procedures used to set royalty rates in federal courts.Both groups, which are governed by federal regulations, would be able to introduce new kinds of evidence in court. Those trials are now overseen by a pair of federal judges whose decisions are endlessly scrutinized for clues about future cases; under the Music Modernization Act, the cases would be randomly assigned to a pool of judges in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which the bill\u2019s backers argue would make the process more fair.The Music Modernization Act combines parts of several proposals made over the last year. But some parts of the legislation have been proposed before in separate bills, most of which collapsed from disputes among warring factions of the music industry.\u201cCongress was getting tired of us coming to them with narrow fixes,\u201d said Daryl Friedman, the chief advocacy officer of the Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammy Awards.Although lobbyists agreed on a compromise bill that has broad support, one long-sought change to copyright law \u2014 the ability for performers and record companies to be paid when songs are played on terrestrial radio, in addition to songwriters \u2014 was sacrificed to gain support from broadcasters, who for decades have bitterly opposed such a change.The bill does have its detractors, including publishers that did not want to relinquish the right to sue digital services. Christian Castle, a lawyer and blogger who is often critical of Silicon Valley, said the bill also does not adequately provide for the costs of setting up a comprehensive rights database.\u201cIt is a phenomenally huge undertaking which has befuddled everybody,\u201d Mr. Castle said, \u201cand there is no process for it.\u201dIf it goes through, the bill is likely to bring about the most sweeping changes to music copyright law since the passage of the Copyright Act of 1976.Advertisement"}

A younger man, fragile and unstable. A same-sex affair that could destroy careers and bring down a political party. A bungling assassin. A dead dog. Conspiracies and cover-ups. A trial that riveted Britain.\u201cEvery actor in the world prefers playing darker characters,\u201d Mr. Grant said in an interview in a members club in west London. \u201cIn Shakespeare\u2019s time, I\u2019m sure everyone wanted to play Tybalt, not Romeo. I\u2019m not complaining about my romantic comedies. I\u2019m proud of them, almost all, but it\u2019s actually a tougher gig to play the likable hero than the rogue. You\u2019re struggling against being boring and nauseating.\u201dThe series, and Mr. Grant in particular, won rave reviews when it debuted here in May, on BBC One.As Thorpe, his face lupine and jowly, his cheeks hollowed, Mr. Grant undergoes a remarkable transformation, incarnating a man addicted to danger and entirely certain that others will help him evade the consequences. \u201cTell him not to talk. And not to write to my mother describing acts of anal sex under any circumstances whatsoever,\u201d Thorpe instructs Bessell, who spends much of the next decade trying to keep Scott from exposing his friend to disgrace and political ruin.\u201cMy last encounter with British TV was when I was rejected for an adaptation of Jilly Cooper\u2019s \u2018Riders,\u2019 so things have improved,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen these scripts turned up, my first thought was: \u2018Television? I don\u2019t think so, darling.\u2019\u201dSlightly graying with trademark blue eyes, Mr. Grant, 57, is relaxed and witty in conversation. Of course, he clarified, he was aware that brilliant work was being done in long-form television.\u201cBut I have an old-fashioned attraction to the big screen, which has almost gone anyway, so it\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d he said.\u201cPeople have tried to make films about this, and you couldn\u2019t do it as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot to explain.\u201dMr. Davies, 55, said that the reports of the trial made a huge impression on him when the case came to court in 1979.\u201cI was 16 and in the closet, although it wasn\u2019t even called the closet then,\u201d he said, with characteristic ebullience, in a telephone interview. \u201cIt was the first gay story I ever heard, and I was always fascinated by it.\u201dIn writing the series, he said, \u201cwe were very much aware that these were real people and as well as Norman, there were children alive.\u201dBoth Mr. Whishaw and Mr. Grant said that they felt aware of the pitfalls of playing a real person. \u201cIt\u2019s so treacherous and difficult to tell the story of someone who is still alive,\u201d Mr. Whishaw said. \u201cBut at the same time you have the strange situation where to an extent what you are working on is a fiction. I met Norman and it was helpful, but I worked quite instinctively.\u201dMr. Grant said that he had watched a lot of footage of Thorpe and found he could do a good imitation. \u201cA big clue to him was his enormous enjoyment of oratory, how he used his lips and tongue.\u201d He slipped into a deep-toned, plummy Thorpe voice: \u201cI could feel my jaw getting longer, heavy lips, heavy tongue; a lot of tongue work when he is lying or aroused.\u201dHe reverted to being Hugh Grant. \u201cThen I thought, argh, I can\u2019t just do an imitation!\u201d he said. \u201cSo I mined for information, had lunches and dinners with lots of his friends, made hundreds of pages of notes. My script is covered in hieroglyphics. You look at every line of dialogue, and ask yourself, why would you say that? And if you really can\u2019t understand why he says the line that is written, you call the writer.\u201d (It didn\u2019t happen much here, he said.)Asked whether his intensive preparation had relieved his anxiety about playing a historical figure, he frowned. \u201cNo, I live with anxiety and was working with brilliant actors,\u201d he said. \u201cI permanently have an inferiority complex: Maybe I\u2019m just the guy from romantic comedies, and they are doing brilliant character work?\u201dThe series offers a barely veiled commentary on immigration and Brexit \u2014 Thorpe was passionately pro-Europe and pro-migrant \u2014 as well as a lesson in social history for a younger generation.\u201cYoung gay men and women barely know that our existence was illegal,\u201d Mr. Davies said. \u201cI felt I had a duty to explain the political side of it. Now there are a million Normans, but at the time he was exotic and dangerous and remarkable in his honesty.\u201dThe story doesn\u2019t \u201chit you round the head with a message,\u201d Mr. Whishaw said. \u201cFor me the joy of it is the strangeness of the way life can tip into farce and horror at the same moment. These are characters in conflict with themselves and the world.\u201dWill the role of Thorpe tip Mr. Grant toward similarly complex parts in the future?\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do next,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m flirting with a few scripts.\u201d Do the characters belong to the dark side? He thought for a moment.\u201cNone of them are very nice,\u201d he said, and then thought further. \u201cAnd two of the scripts are for telly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon to Buy Online Pharmacy PillPack, Jumping Into the Drug Business", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the world of health care, PillPack, an online pharmacy, is a pretty small player. Its work force of 1,000 or so people pales in comparison with the 235,000 who work for Walgreens.But when Amazon announced on Thursday that it was buying PillPack, the deal immediately shook the industry. Shares of Walgreens and Rite Aid tumbled more than 9 percent, while CVS Health dropped 6.6 percent.That\u2019s because with one move, Amazon answered the question about when \u2014 and how \u2014 it would grab a piece of the $560 billion prescription drug industry.It was precisely the sort of deal that the health care industry had feared.Amazon has been hinting at its interest in selling drugs, but it faced the problem of securing pharmacy licenses in each state. PillPack will help overcome that hurdle, since the start-up is licensed to ship drugs in 50 states \u2014 clearing the way for the e-commerce giant to quickly become a major player in the business.And it will be doing so without much financial stress. Amazon, which has a market value of over $840 billion, is paying about $1 billion for the start-up, according to one person briefed on the deal, who was not authorized to speak about it publicly. Amazon beat out Walmart for the company, the person said.\u201cPillPack\u2019s visionary team has a combination of deep pharmacy experience and a focus on technology,\u201d Jeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s chief executive of its consumer business, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to see what we can do together on behalf of customers over time.\u201dPillPack, which started in 2013, distributes pills in easy-to-use packages designed for consumers with chronic conditions and multiple prescriptions. The company sorts prescriptions by the dose and includes a label with a picture of each pill and directions on how it should be taken.TJ Parker, a pharmacist, and Elliot Cohen, an engineer, founded the start-up after meeting through a health care innovation program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company\u2019s primary pharmacy is in Manchester, N.H., but it also has numerous other pharmacies, including in Miami, Brooklyn and Austin, Tex. While it has licenses to deliver drugs in all 50 states, it does not now ship to Hawaii.It has raised $118 million in funding, with investors including Accel Partners, Atlas Venture, CRV, Founder Collective, Menlo Ventures, Sherpa Ventures and Techstars.Its national reach made it an attractive prospect for Amazon, said Adam J. Fein, chief executive of the Drug Channels Institute, who studies the industry.\u201cIt\u2019s a turnkey mail pharmacy operation,\u201d Mr. Fein said.Even as Americans have shifted their buying habits online, prescription drugs have remained a stubbornly brick-and-mortar purchase. About 90 percent of all prescriptions are filled at a pharmacy counter, according to Iqvia, a research firm.If Amazon can break that habit, it could upend the industry. \u201cIt helps people to eliminate that trip and buy everything they need from Amazon,\u201d said Stephen Buck, a pharmaceutical supply-chain expert who co-founded the drug-price website GoodRx.In a call with investors on Thursday, Stefano Pessina, chief executive officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, said he was not concerned about Amazon\u2019s acquisition. He said the physical pharmacy would remain important to customers in the future.\u201cWe are not complacent, we know we have to change the level of our services to the customers, and we are working in that direction, but we are not worried,\u201d he said.Carolyn Castel, a spokeswoman at CVS Health, said her company had the same abilities as PillPack, with many more existing customers.\u201cKeep in mind that we have not seen a large shift of patients that are looking for their medications to be delivered versus coming to a retail pharmacy,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cAnd for those patients that do desire to transition, we offer the option.\u201dIndependent online pharmacies have had a tough time because consumers who do buy their prescriptions through mail order are often required to do so by their insurance plans. Pharmacy benefit managers have traditionally offered employers and insurers incentives requiring that long-term prescriptions be filled through the managers\u2019 own mail-order pharmacies.And for short-term prescriptions, like antibiotics, many consumers prefer their corner drugstore, since they often need to fill those drugs right away. About 85 percent of prescriptions in the United States are for refills, according to Iqvia.But Mr. Buck and others said Amazon might have a new opportunity. A growing number of Americans are without health insurance or have such high deductibles that they may be better off bargain shopping on their own. He estimated that 25 million Americans fell into that category.Until now, he said, PillPack has not aggressively competed on price. With Amazon in charge, \u201chow about they start posting prices that are really, really aggressive?\u201d Mr. Buck said.The deal for PillPack could be just one piece in Amazon\u2019s broader health ambitions.Amazon has also pushed to expand its medical supplies business, seeking to become a major supplier for hospitals and outpatient clinics. It received wholesale pharmacy licenses from several states this year that permit it to start selling medical equipment to businesses. Its products could be used to supply operating and emergency rooms, along with outpatient locations.The company previously tried to enter the pharmaceutical world in 1999 by purchasing 40 percent of Drugstore.com. However, it ran into logistical and regulatory challenges that ultimately derailed the effort.John Sculley, a former chief executive of Apple and the chief marketing officer of RxAdvance, a pharmacy benefit manager, said PillPack was a natural choice for Amazon.\u201cThis one plays right into everything they know how to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s in their wheelhouse.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Passes Sweeping Law to Protect Online Privacy", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 California has passed a digital privacy law granting consumers more control over and insight into the spread of their personal information online, creating one of the most significant regulations overseeing the data-collection practices of technology companies in the United States.The bill raced through the State Legislature without opposition on Thursday and was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown, just hours before a deadline to pull from the November ballot an initiative seeking even tougher oversight over technology companies.The new law grants consumers the right to know what information companies are collecting about them, why they are collecting that data and with whom they are sharing it. It gives consumers the right to tell companies to delete their information as well as to not sell or share their data. Businesses must still give consumers who opt out the same quality of service.It also makes it more difficult to share or sell data on children younger than 16.The legislation, which goes into effect in January 2020, makes it easier for consumers to sue companies after a data breach. And it gives the state\u2019s attorney general more authority to fine companies that don\u2019t adhere to the new regulations.But Aleecia M. McDonald, an incoming assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in privacy policy, said California\u2019s privacy measure was one of the most comprehensive in the United States, since most existing laws \u2014 and there are not many \u2014 do little to limit what companies can do with consumer information.\u201cIt\u2019s a step forward, and it should be appreciated as a step forward when it\u2019s been a long time since there were any steps,\u201d Ms. McDonald said.If the bill had failed to pass before the deadline, the proponents of the ballot initiative would have taken their case straight to voters in November, they said.The state\u2019s technology and business lobbies were opposed to the measure that was passed on Thursday, but they didn\u2019t try to derail it because they thought the ballot initiative was worse.Even legislators who voted for the bill complained that they had little choice because a ballot measure would provide less flexibility to make changes in the future. And some privacy advocates said the bill did not go as far as the ballot initiative in allowing individuals to sue for not complying.Mr. Mactaggart said he wanted a sensible privacy law, whether through a ballot measure or the legislative process. He said that the Legislature was the right place to debate such a policy, but that it had been hard to get legislators to address privacy.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the initiative process in California, we wouldn\u2019t be here today,\u201d Mr. Mactaggart said in an interview.One of the authors of the new law, Assemblyman Ed Chau, a Democrat, tried last year to pass a bill that would have required internet service providers to seek permission from customers before accessing, selling or sharing their browser activity. The bill never made it out of committee \u2014 an example of the influence of telecommunications and technology companies in California.\u201cThis is a huge step forward to people all across the country dealing with this very challenging issue,\u201d State Senator Bob Hertzberg, a Democrat and a co-author of the bill, said at a news conference after it was signed.The ballot initiative, which would have made it easier for private individuals to sue companies for not adhering to its privacy requirements, had drawn vocal opposition from industry groups that worried about the potential liability risk.The measure included a provision that would have required a 70 percent majority in both houses of the Legislature to approve any changes after it became law.Google, Facebook, Verizon, Comcast and AT&T each contributed $200,000 to a committee opposing the proposed ballot measure, and lobbyists had estimated that businesses would spend $100 million to campaign against it before the November election.Robert Callahan, a vice president of state government affairs for the Internet Association, an industry group that includes Google, Facebook and Amazon, said in a statement that the new law contained many \u201cproblematic provisions.\u201d But the group did not try to obstruct it, he added, because \u201cit prevents the even worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.\u201dMr. Callahan said the group would \u201cwork to correct the inevitable, negative policy and compliance ramifications this last-minute deal will create.\u201dLegislators said they expected to pass \u201ccleanup bills\u201d to make any fixes to the law in the 18 months before it takes effect. Some privacy advocates are worried that lobbyists for business and technology groups will use that time to water it down.Mr. Mactaggart said those concerns are \u201coverblown.\u201d\u201cHaving gotten this right, it\u2019ll be very hard to take it away,\u201d he said, noting that the ballot measure had been polling at around 80 percent approval. \u201cThey can\u2019t rewrite the law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Tries to Thread the Needle With New Fox Bid", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s no change to what Disney would acquire. It would take control of the 20th Century Fox movie and television studios, cable channels like National Geographic and FX, 22 regional sports networks, a 30 percent stake in the online video platform Hulu, 39 percent of the European satellite broadcaster Sky and control of the Indian broadcaster Star.(The Murdochs would keep Fox News, the Fox broadcast networks and the national sports networks FS1 and FS2.)\u201cThis reflects our continued belief in the strategic rationale of this transaction,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday.The higher overall bid is notable. But the way it\u2019s structured might be even more important.Adding a cash component to the bid is a response to Comcast\u2019s all-cash offer. It is meant to appeal to Fox shareholders, who simply want to be paid out now, rather than betting on the performance of Disney shares in the future.But the Murdoch family is in a different position.Receiving cash would expose it to a big tax bill, since Rupert Murdoch created the company and has enjoyed an enormous rise in the value of his holdings. And Mr. Murdoch does want in on the future: He has said that he thinks combining the Fox businesses with Disney would yield a media colossus that could take on streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.The option of still being paid in Disney stock appears to have been crucial in keeping the support of the Murdochs, as shown by Fox\u2019s board signing onto the new offer. But the family represents only 17 percent of the shares that can be voted in this deal, so other investors will have to feel comfortable with it as well.\u25a0 Shares in Fox were up 6.4 percent in early morning trading, at $47.57. Shareholders could be betting that the battle between Disney and Comcast is far from over.\u25a0 Disney\u2019s stock was up 1 percent in early morning trading, at $107.26, as investors may believe that the sweetened bid is financially sustainable.\u25a0 And Comcast\u2019s shares were up 0.7 percent, at $33.04. That\u2019s perhaps because of a hope that the company would walk away from an increasingly expensive bidding war.Disney executives could raise their bid even higher if necessary. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Christine McCarthy, told analysts that the company was financing the entire cash portion of the new offer through borrowed money and asserted that its balance sheet remained healthy despite the extra debt.Fox and Disney will reschedule votes on Disney\u2019s takeover bid, which was originally set for July 10. That still gives Comcast time to consider its options \u2014 and Disney time to prepare another counterpunch.Advertisement"}

It is all virtual.Follow? Me neither.Welcome to the world of blockchain, the latest technological revolution to those in-the-know \u2014 and what seems like the latest get-rich-quick gibberish to the average person.When the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments.If you\u2019re like most people, that\u2019s when you stopped understanding \u2014 or even trying to understand \u2014 what this whole blockchain thing is all about. (Stick with me for a moment and I promise you\u2019ll understand it very soon.)It all feels a bit like 1999, circa the dot-com bubble. In Cannes, France, just last week, at an annual gathering of advertisers, there was a \u201cblockchain yacht\u201d and a \u201cblockchain villa.\u201d In Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year, there was a \u201cblockchain lounge.\u201dMeanwhile, Fortune 500 companies are investing billions in the blockchain. IBM has a whole division focused on blockchain, as do the consultancies Accenture and PwC. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, has dismissed Bitcoin, but says \u201cthe blockchain is real.\u201dSilicon Valley venture capitalists have already sunk more than $1.3 billion into blockchain technology just this year. And just this week, Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most prominent technology firms founded, in part, by Marc Andreessen \u2014 who is credited with inventing the modern Web browser \u2014 announced a $300 million \u201ccrypto\u201d fund to exclusively invest in blockchain technologies.And what was arguably considered wild overspending in the late 1990s on internet infrastructure and an assortment of experimental companies, ultimately set the foundation for the modern era we live in today.\u201cNew models of computing have tended to emerge every 10 to 15 years: mainframes in the 60s, PCs in the late 70s, the internet in the early 90s, and smartphones in the late 2000s,\u201d Mr. Andreessen said. And now blockchain.The easiest and most basic way to think about the underlying technology is to think about a technology that keeps a master list of everyone who has ever interacted with it. It\u2019s a bit of an oversimplification, but if you\u2019ve ever used Google Docs and allowed others to share the document so they can make changes, the programs keep a list of all the changes that are made to the document and by whom. Blockchain does that but in an even more secure way so that every person who ever touches the document is trusted and everyone gets a copy of all the changes made so there is never a question about what happened along the way. There aren\u2019t multiple copies of a document and different versions \u2014 there is only one trusted document and you can keep track of everything that\u2019s ever happened to it.The blockchain is, of course, being used to create all sorts of cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin and Ethereum.But more important, it is touching all different industries.The advertising industry plans to use it to track its ads all over the internet; the music industry is planning to use it to track songs; banks and mortgage companies want to use it to track the deeds of homes and the complicated process of tracking all the documentation; shipping companies are investing in blockchain technology to track bills of lading, the pharmaceutical industry wants to use the technology to verify the drug supply chain.If it is successful, blockchain technology will bring a new level of enhanced trust to business and will also cut out the middlemen that have historically tracked \u2014 and profited \u2014 from the complexity of so many different systems trying to communicate with each other. That could lower prices for goods and services.At the same time, for all the promise of blockchain, there are real questions about whether it may be applied to solve problems that don\u2019t exist. Databases already exist and, in certain cases, a centralized database might actually be preferable to the blockchain.The blockchain is ultimately about solving society\u2019s ultimate challenge: trust. Or rather, lack of trust. Blockchain is about using technology to create a shared sense of trust by a group of disparate participants.The biggest question is whether the hundreds of projects like Decentraland, where individuals are using real money to buy virtual property, will end well or badly \u2014 and whether that experience will ultimately instill or undermine trust in this emerging technology.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Buys GitHub for $7.5 Billion, Moving to Grow in Coding\u2019s New Era", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMicrosoft, fully embracing a model it once saw as a threat, said on Monday that it was buying GitHub, an open software platform used by 28 million programmers, for $7.5 billion.The deal is a bid by Microsoft to gain ground in the internet era of software development, where applications increasingly run on remote data centers \u2014 on so-called cloud computing.Amazon is the leader in the cloud market so far, but Microsoft has transformed itself in recent years to become a strong No. 2 as a supplier of cloud computing services. Its vital Office productivity applications and database software are available in cloud versions.Microsoft also competes with Google, IBM, Salesforce and others in the cloud marketplace. All of them are trying to lure software engineers to use their cloud tools and services. The more programmers on a company\u2019s platform, the more software applications are created, attracting customers and still more developers \u2014 a flywheel of growth and profit.\u201cThe strategic battle in the tech world is for developers,\u201d said Frank Gens, chief analyst for IDC, a research firm. \u201cFor Microsoft, the GitHub deal is about strengthening and widening its relationships with developers.\u201dSatya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said the deal would advance Microsoft\u2019s ambitions in cloud computing and bring smarter software to every industry, on any digital device.GitHub, founded in 2008 and based in San Francisco, was created largely as a community for software developers to share programming tools and code. It has been a champion of the open-source software movement, with its ethos of freely sharing code in public.Today, GitHub is used by a wide range in the tech community, from lone programmers to the nation\u2019s largest companies. Developers can share code, make comments and buy software tools. They work in digital storage spaces, called repositories. Some are open to all users; others are closed to members of a team. GitHub now has more than 85 million code repositories.Individuals can use GitHub for free. But there are monthly subscription charges for extra storage, development tools and private repositories. The company does not disclose its revenue, but analysts estimate it is running at $200 million a year.The open-source model was once anathema to Microsoft, the largest commercial software company, which had favored keeping its code proprietary. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft\u2019s former chief executive, once called Linux, the popular open-source operating system, a \u201ccancer\u201d in the body of the technology business.But Microsoft has come to embrace open-source tools. Today, Microsoft is the most active corporation on GitHub, with more than two million contributions of code to GitHub projects.GitHub, seeking to establish a profitable business, has increasingly hosted corporate projects on its platform for a fee. Those ventures have typically used open-source software development techniques while keeping some code proprietary.Executives from both companies insisted that GitHub would remain technologically neutral, welcoming developers using any code or any cloud service, rather than a Microsoft walled garden. The proof, analysts say, will be in how GitHub operates under Microsoft ownership.\u201cDevelopers by their nature are often suspicious of corporate ambitions,\u201d said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cMicrosoft will have to demonstrate its willingness to put the interests of developers ahead of any Microsoft-specific agenda.\u201dThe $7.5 billion purchase, an all-stock deal, is the second-largest acquisition Microsoft has made since Mr. Nadella became chief executive in early 2014. The bigger deal came in 2016, when Microsoft bought LinkedIn, the social network for professional workers, for $26.2 billion. (GitHub ranks third in Microsoft\u2019s history, also behind the $8.5 billion purchase of Skype in 2011.)If GitHub will remain a neutral home for developers, as Microsoft insists, why did the company pay so handsomely to own it?In an interview, Nat Friedman, corporate vice president for developer services at Microsoft, explained that ownership would give the company the confidence to make a greater commitment to GitHub \u2014 \u201cto confidently go all-in on GitHub.\u201dMicrosoft, Mr. Friedman said, will make nearly all its software-building tools available on GitHub. Over time, as Microsoft shows itself to be a reliable corporate steward of GitHub and is willing to invest in its growth, he said, Microsoft should benefit as more developers adopt its software.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of building trust with developers,\u201d said Mr. Friedman, who will become chief executive of GitHub when the deal closes, which is expected to be this year. \u201cYou earn the right to be considered for other things.\u201dWith GitHub, Microsoft is making a move similar to its LinkedIn acquisition \u2014 buying the leading marketplace in its field. \u201cMicrosoft is rolling up another platform,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management.GitHub has become far more than a platform for software development. It is where developers demonstrate their skills. Software engineers routinely include links to their GitHub projects on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and companies scout for job candidates on GitHub.\u201cIt\u2019s the de facto tool for recruiting technical talent,\u201d Julio Avalos, GitHub\u2019s chief strategy officer, said in an interview this year.The $7.5 billion transaction promises a lucrative payday for GitHub\u2019s venture backers. The start-up had raised a total of $350 million \u2014 a $100 million round in 2012, led by Andreessen Horowitz, and a $250 million round in 2015, led by Sequoia Capital.\u201cGit was a powerful but niche tool, clouds were just things in the sky,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand Microsoft was a very different company.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I don\u2019t try to make people cry any more.\u201dRead \u201cA Night Out With Anthony Bourdain\u201dFor one of T Magazine\u2019s famous illustrated interviews, Bourdain sketched a quick, funny caricature of himself \u2014 and said that the one food he would never touch was a cheeseburger from Johnny Rockets.Read The Illustrated Interview: Anthony BourdainIn a 2017 \u201cBy the Book\u201d column, Bourdain confessed that the best book about food that he has ever read was A.J. Liebling\u2019s \u201cBetween Meals,\u201d a \u201cmemoir of meals in Paris before and after the war. He described Liebling as \u201can enthusiastic lover of food and wine, very knowledgeable but never a snob.\u201d And he called the book \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cthe benchmark for great food writing.\u201dRead \u201cAnthony Bourdain: By the Book\u201dIn a lengthy 2017 profile of Bourdain in The New Yorker, fellow chef Eric Ripert told the magazine that he thought Bourdain was driven, at least in part, \u201c\u2018by a fear of what he might get up to if he ever stopped working.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a guy who needs a lot of projects,\u2019 Bourdain acknowledged. \u2018I would probably have been happy as an air-traffic controller.\u2019\u201dRead \u201cAnthony Bourdain\u2019s Moveable Feast\u201dIn her review of \u201cBone in the Throat,\u201d Bourdain\u2019s first novel, The Times crime columnist Marilyn Stasio, wrote, \u201cThe author\u2019s comic vision goes beyond original. It is deliciously depraved.\u201dRead the review.Of the book that put Bourdain on the map \u2014 a no-holds-barred look at how a restaurant kitchen really works \u2014 The Times wrote, \u201cIn a style partaking of Hunter S. Thompson, Iggy Pop and a little Jonathan Swift, Bourdain gleefully rips through the scenery to reveal private backstage horrors little dreamed of by the trusting public.\u201dBourdain sat down with Fresh Air\u2019s Dave Davies in 2016 for a wide-ranging interview in which he admitted, \u201cWhen I cook at home it\u2019s with a 9-year-old girl in mind. I mean, she\u2019s who I need to please, and if she\u2019s not happy, I\u2019m not happy.\u201dListen to the interview.Bourdain, fellow chef Danny Bowien and The Times\u2019s Kim Severson spent a lively hour discussing global food waste in a Times Talk.Watch the interview.Bourdain\u2019s travel and food show, currently in its 11th season on CNN, has been a cultural force since its inception, winning five Emmys and a Peabody Award so far. (Eight seasons are available right now on Netflix.) The series uses food as an entryway to nuanced conversations with people across the world about their politics, their daily lives, their hopes and fears, and there is seemingly nowhere \u201cParts\u201d hasn\u2019t explored \u2014 including Myanmar in the early 2010s, as well as countries and regions like Gaza and the West Bank and Iran, offering local perspectives rarely seen on Western TV. The show\u2019s punk stylings, the obvious delight Bourdain takes in eating with Michelin star chefs and roadside food vendors alike, and the show\u2019s diverse array of special guests (President Barack Obama, Iggy Pop and the director Darren Aronofsky are just a few) combine to make \u201cParts\u201d a thoughtful and exciting world tour.\u201cNo Reservations\u201d is where Bourdain\u2019s TV career really took off. The show debuted on the Travel Channel in 2005, showcasing Bourdain\u2019s signature curiosity, swagger and lyricism. As food- and travel-blogging exploded, \u201cNo Reservations\u201d became the gold standard for thoughtful adventure \u2014 and because the Travel Channel felt awfully obscure, the show sometimes felt like a hip secret. That secret got out in 2006, when Bourdain and his crew got stuck in Beirut during an armed conflict; that episode is among the show\u2019s most interesting because it\u2019s the exact opposite of other lifestyle shows. \u201cNo Reservations\u201d went on to 12 Emmy nominations (and two wins). The show is available for purchase on Amazon.Bourdain produced and narrated this brainier, more personal approach to the shameless pleasures of food porn. Still, he kept himself mostly out of the spotlight, training it instead on a rotating cast of Michelin-approved chefs and restaurateurs as they explained their relationships to specific foods or regions. In one installment, the Momofuku mastermind David Chang effuses about his lifelong passion for ramen; in another, the British virtuoso April Bloomfield gives a survey of bangers and mash. It\u2019s a light and positive celebration of food and culture \u2014 a departure from the quick-cut chaos of such crowd-pleasers as \u201cIron Chef\u201d or \u201cChopped\u201d \u2014 with fresh insights from authoritative and camera-friendly personalities. The show ran for five seasons on BBC and PBS, which are all available on Netflix. (A sixth aired last year on Facebook Watch.)Bourdain was someone everyone wanted to eat with \u2014 knowing his enthusiasm could get them into restaurants, and to experience food, they otherwise never would. This was best shown in 2016, when the White House asked if President Barack Obama could eat with him during an official visit to Vietnam.Bourdain was candid about past drug use, which included cocaine and heroin. He was also unafraid to discuss drugs in his TV show. In this clip from an episode of \u201cParts Unknown\u201d in Morocco he learned Moroccans make hashish-containing sweets.\u201cOf course network standards and practices prohibit me from even tasting this delicious and reportedly mind-altering treat,\u201d he said.\u201cAn irony free zone where everything is beautiful and nothing hurts,\u201d is how Mr. Bourdain describes the Waffle House. \u201cWhere everybody regardless of race, creed, color or degree of inebriation is welcome.\u201dBourdain was so associated with globe-trotting it is easy to forget his love of the United States\u2019 own cuisine, and it comes across fully in this ode to a waffle house. It is \u201ca beacon of hope and salvation inviting the hungry, the lost, the seriously hammered, all across the South to come inside,\u201d he added.\u201cParts Unknown\u201d often felt like a commentary on foreign policy. In this episode in Iran, for instance, Bourdain experiences the country\u2019s hospitality in full force by eating in a family home.It is \u201ca very hopeful place, filled with yearning, where people every day, particularly women I think, are in very small ways testing the limits of what is permissible, trying to define in fits and starts who they want to be as a country,\u201d he said.Charles Bramesco, Margaret Lyons, Alex Marshall and Eleanor Stanford contributed reporting.An earlier version incorrectly referred to Charleston, S.C. as what Mr. Bourdain called \"an irony free zone.\" He was referring to the Waffle House.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Pity the Tech B-List", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsI spent most of the week at the Code Conference, where the tech world\u2019s elite gathered to discuss the current state of the tech industry. It was a fascinating event, less in the sense of newsy product announcements (which there weren\u2019t many of) and more in the general finger-in-the-wind sense of how the tech industry is thinking about itself.Notable at this year\u2019s Code was that there seems to be a growing rift between the largest tech companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 and the rest of the industry.The shadow of the big tech companies loomed large over the conference, even if their presence was minimal. No executives from Apple, Amazon or Google spoke at Code, and when executives from Microsoft and Facebook did take the stage, they mostly talked about the past. (Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, offered some historical perspective on the company\u2019s antitrust woes from the late 1990s; Sheryl Sandberg and Mike Schroepfer from Facebook did yet another rote recitation of the company\u2019s post-Cambridge Analytica \u201cwe\u2019ll do better\u201d script.)Instead, much of the stage time went to leaders of companies just outside the tech A-list \u2014 large, popular companies that in any other era would be considered enormous success stories, but that have spent years locked in a fight for survival against their bigger, more entrenched rivals.From the perspective of the tech B-list, there are two huge fights to be won. First, you need to establish a foothold in a market, either by out-innovating old-line incumbents \u2014 taxis, hotels, music labels \u2014 or by creating a new market altogether. Then, once you\u2019re established and growing, a bigger worry emerges: What if one of the Big Five squashes you?A good example of a tech B-lister is Spotify, which appears to be winning its battle with its biggest suppliers \u2014 the three labels that provide the vast majority of Spotify\u2019s music \u2014 but lives in perpetual danger of being steamrollered by a tech giant. Onstage at Code, Spotify\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Ek, fielded several questions about whether he worried about competitors like Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which have their own music streaming services and, more important, control the hardware platforms (iOS, Android, Alexa) on which people consume music.Mr. Ek mostly deflected, saying that there are \u201cvery, very few opportunities that a billion-plus people around the world care about,\u201d and that the giants\u2019 interest in music streaming showed the attractiveness of the category.Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, sounded a similar note at the conference when asked about Facebook\u2019s habit of blatantly copying Snapchat\u2019s most distinctive product features. (Mr. Spiegel\u2019s sassy comeback \u2014 \u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also\u201d \u2014 was the best line there.)\u201cWell, I believe if you don\u2019t create a pure, vertical, integrated capability, vertically integrated capability \u2014 from distribution all the way through content creation and advertising models \u2014 you\u2019re going to have a hard time competing with these guys. And the statistic we throw out, and since we announced this deal in November of 2016, the FANG market caps have gone up over $1 trillion. You better figure out how to vertically integrate here if you want to compete with those players.\u201dIt\u2019s not unusual to see small firms complaining about the difficulty of breaking into established markets. It\u2019s more unusual to see those complaints coming from the leader of a $200 billion telecom giant. And it shows just how dominant the tech A-list has become, and how difficult overcoming its concentration of market power is proving to be.Here are a few other tech stories of note this past week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: China\u2019s Ready for a Trade War. Your Move, Mr. Trump.", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWang Yi, China\u2019s top diplomat, on Thursday warned Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, not to take a choice that would involve \u201cconfrontation and mutual loss.\u201dSkeptics worry that a telecom company focused on justifying every penny will impede the creativity of a media darling where producers, writers and actors are sacred. They could be right. But the stakes are high for AT&T, as Netflix continues to close in on HBO\u2019s position as the king of the content hill. It must tread carefully if it wants to make the most of the TV company.Elsewhere in media newsA trade war with the United States looms. Populists have taken power in Italy, posing a new threat to the euro. Growth is sluggish, and there is even talk of another banking crisis. It would not seem the ideal time to put the brakes on Europe\u2019s economy.The fate of that deal has been hanging in the balance for at least 18 months. Eight other nations have waved it through. But China has held out, using it as a bargaining chip in its trade standoff with the U.S., and particularly to help ensure that the White House relaxes penalties on the Chinese telecom company ZTE.But Mr. Hinman added that securities regulations are \u201cimportant safeguards, and they are appropriate for most I.C.O.s.\u201d What\u2019s the difference? He elaborated:Central to determining whether a security is being sold is how it is being sold and the reasonable expectations of purchasers \u2026 Under certain circumstances, the same asset can be offered and sold in a way that causes investors to have a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others.That is the lowest number since 2011 and half the level of three years ago ... With such a dramatic decline, the chances of challengers graduating to the next stage and eventually taking on the incumbents is inevitably reduced.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Potent Acquisition Currency: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Microsoft\u2019s surging shares keep it in the deal game.\u2022 Microsoft is acquiring the popular computer code repository GitHub.\u2022 A trade war could put millions of jobs on the line.\u2022 Facebook gave hardware firms deep access to your information\u2022 What to expect from today\u2019s Apple developer conference.Mr. Schultz\u2019s decision to retire will most likely stoke speculation that he is considering a run for president in 2020.

For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country \u2014 the growing division at home and our standing in the world.\u201dUnder Mr. Schultz\u2019s three decades managing the company, Starbucks grew from a tiny local chain into a global coffee giant, operating 28,000 stores in 75 countries. Shares of Starbucks have risen 21,000 percent since the company\u2019s initial public offering in 1992; an investor who had put in $10,000 then would have more than $2 million today.Microsoft\u2019s planned acquisition of GitHub, a software development company, is not close to the company\u2019s largest, and it will not have a big, immediate impact on profits.But the deal is a milestone because it reveals the degree to which the rise in Microsoft\u2019s stock has bolstered its heft as an acquirer.Microsoft\u2019s stock has gone up more than 200 percent since Microsoft agreed in 2013 to pay $7.2 billion in cash for Nokia\u2019s handset and services operations. That price tag amounted to 2.6 percent of Microsoft\u2019s total market value back then. The $7.5 billion Microsoft is paying for GitHub is just under 1 percent of Microsoft\u2019s current market capitalization. This lessens the financial hit if the acquisition falls short of expectations, but increases the upside if it outperforms.In recent years, Microsoft\u2019s valuation has also increased, making its stock even more potent as an acquisition currency. Microsoft\u2019s shares currently trade at around 24 times the earnings that analysts expect over the next 12 months, according to data from CapitalIQ. That\u2019s far higher than the 15 times it traded at in mid-2013.But it would be a mistake to conclude that Microsoft has not advanced in the market for acquisitions. Its soaring stock has made sure the company has remained a player in the deals game. The jump in its price-to-earnings ratio makes it more likely that a large deal would bolster earnings per share (after factoring in the extra shares issued to do the deal.) With its operations notching up strong organic growth, Microsoft probably does not need to do a big deal anytime soon. But if one were to crop up, shareholders may not balk.- Peter Eavis Satya Nadella happened, for one. (He succeeded Steve Ballmer as C.E.O. of Microsoft in 2014.) And the cloud, for another.Mr. Ballmer tried to target the flashier end of the consumer hardware market, with things like Windows Phone and the Zune music player. It didn\u2019t work. In contrast, Mr. Nadella has focused on enterprise applications \u2014 and in particular, found huge success in cloud computing.Since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, the cloud portion of Microsoft\u2019s revenue has soared from 3 percent to more than 21 percent this year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse. Microsoft finished 2017 with 13 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group, a gain of three percentage points during the year.The company lags only Amazon Web Services as a cloud provider.Preparing for the futureMr. Nadella is also gearing up for the next big thing to be put into the cloud: artificial intelligence.Because such software is computationally demanding, it makes sense to pay for someone else to run programs on huge servers rather than buying one\u2019s own hardware. But it\u2019s also complex, which means that there is going to be a huge market for user-friendly software that can be taken up by regular developers and not just people with A.I. Ph.D.s.That\u2019s why there\u2019s a big race right now \u2014 between the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others \u2014 to offer up tools in the cloud that can process huge data sets and provide useful insights about them.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeWhat Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O., said of the transaction:\u201cMicrosoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, a senior Microsoft executive, Nat Friedman, will become GitHub\u2019s C.E.O., while the coding hub\u2019s current chief, Chris Wanstrath, will become a Microsoft technical fellow. The acquisition is expected to close by year end.\u2022 GitHub: $7.5 billion\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore from Gabriel J.X. Dance, Nicholas Confessore and Michael LaForgia:Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing.Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, has been adamant that his company stringently protects its customers\u2019 data privacy. Two news stories raise some questions about that categorical claim.The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product. We\u2019ve elected not to do that.An Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Not too incriminating. But it\u2019s a reminder that Apple has made use of the data that passes across Facebook\u2019s platform.Over the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.Under the concept discussed internally and raised with potential partners, users searching in Pinterest\u2019s app for \u201cdrapes\u201d might turn up an ad distributed by Apple for an interior-design app, or Snap users searching for \u201cNFL\u201d might see an ad for a ticket-reseller app, one of the people said.None of this is to say that Apple doesn\u2019t act by its word. But it is an important reminder to continue asking whether it really does.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe latest installment in the movie franchise, \u201cSolo,\u201d had its second disappointing weekend, pulling in just $29.3 million in the U.S. (We use \u201cjust\u201d advisedly.) But perhaps more important, it raises questions about the future of what is supposed to be one of Walt Disney\u2019s biggest moneymakers.The trend hasn\u2019t been reassuring, though. Disney likely took about $1 billion from \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d after accounting for production and marketing costs. But \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d the next movie in the main series, showed a marked drop.

{"Headline": "Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Name C.E.O. for Health Initiative", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a marquee name for a marquee venture.Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard surgeon and staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, will become chief executive of the new company, which will be based in Boston, on July 9. He said he was not stepping down from his current medical and other duties to take the job.The choice of Dr. Gawande, a highly respected doctor and writer on health care, was met with surprise because he has little hands-on experience running a large health care organization, unlike some of the boldface names that have been floated as possible candidates.\u201cHe\u2019s such a well-known health care luminary and keen observer, but this is a big leap,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Bielamowicz, a co-founder of Gist Healthcare, a consultancy in Washington. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t led a huge team or company.\u201dThe three companies represent roughly 1.2 million employees scattered across different markets, giving them little immediate leverage with health plans and hospitals.\u201cWe said at the outset that the degree of difficulty is high and success is going to require an expert\u2019s knowledge, a beginner\u2019s mind, and a long-term orientation,\u201d Mr. Bezos said on Wednesday. \u201cAtul embodies all three, and we\u2019re starting strong as we move forward in this challenging and worthwhile endeavor.\u201dThere is little doubt that Dr. Gawande will be able to outline what he has said he believes are the system\u2019s failings. \u201cTapping Atul Gawande to head the new venture is a very positive sign,\u201d said Brian Marcotte, the chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. \u201cHe is a thought leader, thinks outside the box, and is passionate about fixing what ails our health care system.\u201dDr. Gawande is a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School and a practicing surgeon at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\u201cThis work will take time but must be done,\u201d Dr. Gawande said in a statement. \u201cThe system is broken, and better is possible.\u201d He declined to be interviewed.He is also the executive director for Ariadne Labs, a joint project by Brigham and Women\u2019s and Harvard to further the adoption of measures that aim to improve patient safety, like surgical checklists.In a letter to friends and colleagues, Dr. Gawande said his role as chief executive \u201cwill not require me to leave Ariadne Labs, Brigham Health, or Harvard. My plan is to transition from executive director of Ariadne to chairman, while remaining a surgeon on staff at the Brigham and professor at Harvard. I will also continue to write, including for The New Yorker magazine.\u201dWhile Dr. Gawande does not have business experience, he has spent his career focusing on how to improve care for the sickest patients, said Dr. Bob Kocher, a venture capitalist who advised President Obama on health care policy. He pointed to Dr. Gawande\u2019s ability to attract other individuals to the venture.\u201cHe understands the health care system as an insider,\u201d Dr. Kocher said. \u201cHe has been a truth-teller.\u201dBut Dr. Kocher said that Dr. Gawande\u2019s public health experience in emphasizing preventive care is unlikely to yield the immediate savings companies like these three want. \u201cHe is going to have to come up with a whole new tool kit,\u201d he said.The challenge he and the rest of the country face is how to overcome the pricing power of big hospital groups that dominate certain markets, and drug companies, Dr. Kocher said. Employers have also been resistant to limiting the choice of hospitals and doctors for their workers.Instead of finding someone who has experience running a health care business, \u201cthey picked a very splashy name,\u201d said Craig Garthwaite, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.The fact that Dr. Gawande is not devoting all of his energies to the venture makes Mr. Garthwaite more skeptical. \u201cIt starts to feel fundamentally unserious if you\u2019re not hiring a full-time C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Garthwaite said.\u201cIf you\u2019re transforming health care, you\u2019re reshaping the economy of Germany, effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a part-time gig.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Decision Shows Need to Rethink Antitrust Laws", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThere had not been a federal court ruling on a vertical merger \u2014 a combination of a buyer and a supplier \u2014 since 1979. As a result, Judge Leon\u2019s opinion, which cleared the way for the merger of AT&T and Time Warner, \u201cwill be enormously significant,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an influential antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cTo a significant extent, this court was writing on a clean slate.\u201dJudge Leon himself cited a \u201cdearth\u201d of modern judicial precedent.For many antitrust experts, it was high time \u2014 no matter the outcome.When it comes to vertical mergers like AT&T and Time Warner, \u201cantitrust law is stuck in the 1980s,\u201d said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School who has called for more vigorous antitrust enforcement against vertical mergers.The last time the government brought such a case was in 1979. The Federal Trade Commission challenged the merger of Fruehauf, then the country\u2019s largest manufacturer of truck trailers, and Kelsey-Hayes, which made truck components like heavy-duty wheels and antiskid brakes. The government lost.Credit for the lack of such cases goes largely to Robert H. Bork.Mr. Bork is best known as the solicitor general who fired the Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox and as a doomed Supreme Court nominee, not as an antitrust trailblazer.The Clayton Antitrust Act, which dates to 1914, bans mergers that may \u201csubstantially lessen\u201d competition or \u201ctend to create a monopoly.\u201d It makes no distinction between vertical mergers and horizontal ones, in which a company buys a rival, thereby reducing the number of competitors in an industry. But in large part thanks to Mr. Bork\u2019s analysis, horizontal mergers continue to receive intense scrutiny from the federal government, while most vertical mergers go forward, albeit often with conditions.From the publication of \u201cThe Antitrust Paradox\u201d through 2016, the government has challenged only 52 of the thousands of vertical mergers, and many of those challenges were focused on horizontal aspects of the deals. None of those cases went to trial. Most were resolved through consent decrees, including Comcast\u2019s 2009 bid for NBCUniversal, which went forward after Comcast and the government agreed to a long list of restrictions on the combined company\u2019s behavior.The Justice Department last rewrote its vertical merger guidelines in 1984. (The horizontal guidelines have been revised three times since then.) The department largely embraced Mr. Bork\u2019s logic.But over the ensuing decades, more antitrust experts have questioned Mr. Bork\u2019s laissez-faire approach to vertical merger enforcement, especially in cases involving media and intellectual property.The most immediate impacts of the ruling on Tuesday are the removal of an obstacle to a megamerger and the likely bursting of a dam of mergers that were waiting the decision.But the most important aspect of Judge Leon\u2019s opinion is that it essentially embraces the Bork approach, which rested on a few premises: that markets are inherently competitive; that a firm\u2019s dominance in one market cannot be leveraged into another; and that market success is a result of maximizing consumer welfare, not anti-competitive behavior. The theory is that vertical mergers produce efficiencies that can be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, higher quality or both.Not surprisingly, AT&T argued in court that it had no incentive to withhold Time Warner\u2019s programming from other distributors, that consumers would derive many benefits from the merger and that the combined companies would be in a better position to compete with upstarts like Amazon and Netflix, which already are vertically integrated.This analysis may still hold true for mergers of essentially fungible components, like the truck beds and brakes at issue in the Fruehauf case.But it\u2019s not clear that logic holds in a case like AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner. Not only does AT&T occupy a dominant position in a highly concentrated telecommunications market, but Time Warner product\u2019s \u2014 like HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN \u2014 aren\u2019t at all fungible. If AT&T wants to withhold \u201cmust have\u201d programming from a rival telecom company, or charge more for it, that company cannot readily replace it. That was the crux of the government\u2019s case \u2014 that vertical mergers, at least in this context, can reduce competition and harm consumers.\u201cThe big question was whether Judge Leon would accept where academics and economists have gone with this, or whether he\u2019d stick with the old approach,\u201d said Mr. Wu, the Columbia law professor, who is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.Although Mr. Bork\u2019s fingerprints are all over the opinion, Judge Leon departed from Mr. Bork\u2019s doctrine by acknowledging that vertical mergers \u201care not invariably innocuous.\u201dBut the emergence of competitors like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu loomed large in his analysis. \u201cI simply cannot evaluate the government\u2019s theories,\u201d he wrote in his opinion, without considering \u201cthe dramatic changes that are transforming how consumers are viewing video content.\u201dNo matter the outcome if the decision is appealed, the Justice Department \u201cis going to have to update the vertical merger guidelines,\u201d said Steven C. Salop, professor of law and economics at Georgetown University Law Center.Using that approach, the AT&T-Time Warner merger should have been blocked, he contends. Judge Leon\u2019s opinion in many ways embraced Professor Salop\u2019s approach \u2014 and cited him in the opinion \u2014 while reaching the opposite result.Mr. Hovenkamp, of the University of Pennsylvania, argues that it\u2019s not wise or appropriate to view antitrust cases through the prism of a pre-internet, pre-broadband age. That\u2019s especially true when the stakes include principles like consumers\u2019 ability to engage in (or at least watch on TV) a free exchange of ideas.\u201cAntitrust is only a piece of this,\u201d Mr. Hovenkamp said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never roll back the clock,\u201d he added, to an era when \u201cthe phone companies and most cable companies had nothing to do with media.\u201d\u201cNow everyone thinks they have to be fully integrated to keep up,\u201d he continued. \u201cI feel uncomfortable with that both for antitrust and First Amendment reasons.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Is It Any Good?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 President Trump is meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.

He said an announcement will come within two weeks.There\u2019s still opportunity for banks to find new customers and encourage existing ones to be more active.But that\u2019s not quite the whole picture. The percentage of active accounts around the world has risen from 52 percent to just 53 percent over the same period. That means that even if people are opening accounts, they\u2019re still not using them. And in some countries, the use of bank accounts is actually falling.But the World Bank offers some approaches that could be used to encourage further adoption, and use of, accounts:Some historyThe problemValuations of sports teams have skyrocketed in recent years. Probably the biggest culprit is the ever-increasing price for media rights, particularly as digital players like Facebook and Twitter bid against traditional TV networks.As that money flows down to sports teams, their own valuations are going up. And that means, as the sports investment banker John Moag told Institutional Investor, having even $1 billion won\u2019t be enough to afford a franchise:\u201cOne person may be willing to put in $300 million to $500 million, but where will the remainder of the money come from? He will dial for dollars, but that\u2019s still a huge amount of money.\u201dWhat remains to be seenWe can think of two issues that need to be addressed:Whether sports leagues \u2014 which are governed by their individual owners \u2014 will drop their longstanding aversion to having Wall Street investment firms joining their ranks. Whether private equity firms would be willing to hold onto sports teams long enough to recoup their investments and make big profits, while avoiding the kinds of financial meddling that could destroy even championship franchises.\u2014 Michael de la MercedHow do you raise a fund that\u2019s as large as your two previous biggest combined? Reputation certainly counts for a lot.Mr. Trott certainly has a long list of accomplishments to cite in pitches to investors. He has become one of the premiere bankers for wealthy families like the Pritzkers, the scions of the Hyatt hotel fortune, and the Reimanns, the secretive German clan behind the consumer conglomerate JAB Holding.More from Eric Platt and Mark Vandevelde of the FT:The so-called family offices where Mr. Trott wields clout and raises much of his capital are garnering increasing power on Wall Street, as they hire investment teams to buy midsized companies outright instead of ploughing money into funds run by outside fund managers.\u2014 Michael de la MercedAchleitner has discussed a combination of the two lenders with investors and key German government officials in recent months, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations. While there are currently no formal discussions between the two banks and any such move is not imminent, the chairman is talking now with stakeholders about a possible deal down the road, they said. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment.A key obstacle is Deutsche Bank\u2019s depressed share price, with investors telling Achleitner that they don\u2019t want a merger with Commerzbank at the moment because it would be highly dilutive and potentially trigger a capital increase and hefty write-downs, the people said. In other Deutsch bank news:The bigger pictureReports about potential new features for the image-sharing social platform highlight how its service appears to be increasingly pulled in multiple directions.The feature, which could allow videos of up to an hour in length, will focus on vertical video, or video that is taller than it is wide, one of the people said. The feature, if it launches, will do so within the Instagram app, another person said.Instagram will offer a dedicated space featuring scripted shows, music videos and more in vertically oriented, full-screen, high-def 4K resolution. Instagram has been meeting with popular social media stars and content publishers to find out how their video channels elsewhere would work within its app.Benedict Evans, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, points out that in layering on new features, the photo-sharing service could turn itself into two distinct products:It\u2019s plausible that Instagram could break itself up into two apps. One could be focused more on messaging and peer-to-peer image and video sharing. The other might emphasize discovery and a greater tie-in to e-commerce, with judicious use of artificial intelligence to provide users with focused product recommendations.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeWith Jonathan Bush, a co-founder, out at the health technology company, its board looks likely to move toward a sale.The president asked Mr. Corker not to file the bill, which would be the most drastic move yet by Congress to check the White House\u2019s protectionist policies. Whether Mr. Corker can get it passed with a veto-proof majority is up in the air.Elsewhere in tradeCompanies frequently hold back on technology spending, hiring, and research and development to meet quarterly earnings forecasts that may be affected by factors outside the company\u2019s control, such as commodity-price fluctuations, stock-market volatility and even the weather. The pressure to meet short-term earnings estimates has contributed to the decline in the number of public companies in America over the past two decades.Roger Entner, a founder of Recon Analytics and co-author of the CTIA report, concedes that it might not matter much if the US introduces 5G a few months later than China. Europe was quicker to roll out 2G, and Japan was the first with 3G, but that hardly deterred Apple and Google from dominating the smartphone market. But Entner argues that if China beats the US by a year or two, it could damage the US\u2019s ability to compete in the global technology market.It\u2019s become clear that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us didn\u2019t only have an improvident amount of debt \u2014 it also had a debt structure as complex and precarious as a Jenga tower, which obscured the company\u2019s tenuous finances.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The C.E.O. of Starbucks Isn\u2019t Leaving. Only Howard Schultz Is.", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKevin Johnson has been chief executive of Starbucks for more than a year now, though you wouldn\u2019t always know it. For much of Mr. Johnson\u2019s tenure, he has been overshadowed by Howard Schultz, the company\u2019s former chief executive and departing executive chairman.\u201cIn these transitions, the prior C.E.O. has to step back a bit to allow the new leader to step forward,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in an interview last week, his first since Mr. Schultz announced his departure. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in that period over the last year and a half.\u201dAlready, Mr. Johnson\u2019s ability to take over from Mr. Schultz \u2014 an emotional leader committed to publicly addressing thorny social issues \u2014 has been put to the test, most notably when the arrest of those two men in Philadelphia set off a national debate about race.\u201cRace relations has been a challenging topic in America for centuries,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, 57. \u201cThe realization that it happened in Starbucks was a wake-up call.\u201dMr. Johnson said he had learned of the incident when he woke up in his home in Seattle on a Saturday morning, his inbox flooded with angry emails. He flew to Philadelphia the next day, and over the following days he made a series of public apologies, met with the two men who had been arrested and fired the store manager who had called the police.As Mr. Johnson and other executives considered what more substantial steps they could take, Mr. Schultz chimed in with an idea to shut down all stores in the United States for half a day to talk about bias.\u201cHe suggested, \u2018Hey, one thing we\u2019ve done in the past, 10 years ago, was close all the stores for the training around pulling espresso shots,\u2019\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cWe immediately said, \u2018That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019\u201dOver the years, Mr. Schultz turned the coffee company into a progressive force, giving workers above-average benefits, and weighing in on issues like gun violence, gay marriage and race relations. Mr. Johnson said that wouldn\u2019t change with Mr. Schultz gone.\u201cThe mission and the core values of the company are very, very important,\u201d he said. \u201cThose things are so important, and I intend to continue and enhance those.\u201dSatya Nadella, a Starbucks board member and Microsoft\u2019s third chief executive, after Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates, said he had talked to Mr. Johnson \u201cabout what it means to succeed a legendary founder.\u201d\u201cI shared the best advice I got from Steve and Bill,\u201d Mr. Nadella said. \u201cIt was: \u2018Don\u2019t try to be us. Don\u2019t try to fill our shoes.\u2019 He\u2019s not Howard. But at the same time, he\u2019s learned a lot from Howard.\u201dMr. Johnson also has a business to run. That job will be made easier by the fact that Starbucks is a relatively healthy company. Same-store sales grew 2 percent last quarter in the United States, and 4 percent in China. Total revenue for the quarter was $6 billion, and the company is worth some $78 billion.Yet Mr. Johnson faces several operational challenges as he looks to move Starbucks beyond Mr. Schultz. The stock has not budged since Mr. Johnson took over as chief executive in April last year. Tastes are fickle, and Starbucks is scrambling to meet the demands of health-conscious consumers.And while Starbucks continues to open new stores \u2014 it has some 28,000 around the world \u2014 there are concerns that it may be growing too fast for its own good.\u201cThey are opening units in the U.S. at a fairly rapid clip, especially for a company as mature as they are,\u201d said Sara Senatore, an analyst at Bernstein.Though Mr. Johnson\u2019s boosters, including Mr. Schultz, say he is the right man for the job, joining Starbucks was not an easy decision, he said. A longtime technology executive who held senior roles at Microsoft before becoming chief executive of Juniper Networks in 2008, Mr. Johnson joined the Starbucks board in 2009. But a few years later, he learned he had skin cancer.At first, he continued to work at Juniper. Then one day, he was at the airport about to travel to Europe for client meetings, having just rescheduled a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201cI sat there and I thought to myself, \u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Why am I prioritizing traveling to Europe to sell networking technology over my health, my life, my family, people I love?\u2019\u201dHe soon retired from Juniper to spend more time with his family, but continued serving on the Starbucks board. Then, in 2015, after regaining his health, Mr. Johnson was persuaded by Mr. Schultz to join Starbucks as chief operating officer.Those who work with Mr. Johnson say he has brought a new level of analytical rigor to Starbucks. They credit him with a series of business decisions that have simplified the company and improved profitability.\u201cKevin and Howard will usually get to the same place,\u201d said Rosalind Brewer, Starbucks\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cFor Kevin it has to be a mental, cognitive transition. Whereas Howard has the gut. This is his baby.\u201dPerhaps most important, Mr. Johnson has led efforts to make Starbucks a more technologically adept company. He has overseen the rollout of mobile ordering and pickup, integrated a loyalty program into the Starbucks app and shut down the company\u2019s e-commerce store, a counterintuitive move he said was a recognition that other retailers, like Amazon, could do it better.\u201cThe most difficult transition any company will ever go through is from founder-led to founder-inspired,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m excited about this opportunity. But I also recognize it\u2019s a significant responsibility. That\u2019s not lost on me.\u201dAs for Mr. Schultz, should he run for president, at least one former employee \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 is ready to offer a vote of confidence.\u201cNo matter what Howard decides to do in this next chapter of his life,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, \u201che is a great leader and a great person.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Times on Sunday published a blaring banner headline on its front page, the sort usually reserved for the start of wars or devastating natural disaster: \u201cA new era of Times ownership.\u201dThe coverage, which included an exhaustive history of the paper \u2014 its rise under a Civil War colonel named Harrison Gray Otis in the late 1800s to national and international prominence in the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 reflected the anticipation across the newsroom and the city as it awaits what changes are in store under Dr. Soon-Shiong.While he has promised to make new investments, much of Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s plans to reshape the paper for the digital age are vague. But he has announced the paper will vacate its Art Deco headquarters in downtown Los Angeles and move to new offices in El Segundo, near the airport \u2014 a move that was greeted with a groan among staff because for many it will mean longer commutes in the city\u2019s notorious traffic.Dr. Soon-Shiong takes ownership at a time of deep peril for the news industry and when its national competitors have moved far ahead in adapting to the digital age, advancing new story formats and gaining digital subscribers.\u201cI believe that fake news is the cancer of our times and social media the vehicles for metastasis,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInstitutions like The Times and The Union-Tribune are more vital than ever. They must be bastions of editorial integrity and independence if they are to protect our democracy and provide an antidote to disinformation.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\u201cWhen I start a company, I will integrate culture with service.\u201dThat\u2019s what Marc Benioff told himself after a trip to India. Then, in March 1999, he started Salesforce, the cloud computing service that is now the biggest tech company in San Francisco.\u201cA company like ours can\u2019t be successful in an unsuccessful economy or in an unsuccessful environment or where the school system doesn\u2019t work.

{"Headline": "Trump Threatens Harley-Davidson, Saying It \u2018Surrendered\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump lashed out at one of his favorite American manufacturers on Tuesday, criticizing Harley-Davidson over its plans to move some of its motorcycle production abroad and threatening it with punitive taxes in return.In a series of tweets on Tuesday, the president accused the Wisconsin-based company of having \u201csurrendered\u201d in Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with Europe. He told Republican lawmakers at a White House meeting that the move amounted to a betrayal, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been very good to Harley-Davidson.\u201dMr. Trump has made clashes with American corporations a staple of his presidency, previously assailing businesses like Amazon and Carrier. In many cases, business associations and brand experts have counseled companies to maintain a low profile when going up against Mr. Trump and wait for his attention to be diverted to another topic.It is unclear whether that will be the case with Harley-Davidson, an iconic American brand that Mr. Trump has frequently celebrated. Last year, the president invited Harley-Davidson executives to the White House, where he thanked the company for \u201cbuilding things in America.\u201d His affinity for the firm was not lost on the European Union when it looked for retaliatory targets.On Tuesday, the administration fired back at the European Union and other countries that have imposed retaliatory tariffs, calling them \u201cgroundless\u201d and a violation of World Trade Organization rules.Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement that the reciprocal tariffs imposed by Europe, Canada, Mexico and China \u201cdo great damage to the multilateral trading system,\u201d and he vowed to \u201ctake all necessary actions under both U.S. law and international rules to protect its interests.\u201dEarlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump accused Harley of using the trade dispute as an excuse to send more jobs offshore, after the recent construction of a plant in Thailand. The suggestion echoed the sentiment expressed by one of the unions that represent Harley workers.Harley developed its Thai plant to mitigate tariffs that are in place in Asia, but it decided to move more production abroad in direct response to the new European tariffs. Harley has not said where it will build the bikes for the European market or how many jobs it might cut in the United States as a result.Mr. Trump also revived a threat that he used to lob at companies when he was a presidential candidate, warning Harley that it would pay a financial price for moving manufacturing abroad.While running for office in 2016, he said on several occasions that if elected he would make Ford pay a 35 percent tax on cars that it made in Mexico and sold into the United States. He did not say what presidential authority would give him that power, and the warning on Tuesday appeared to misunderstand \u2014 or misconstrue \u2014 the fact that Harley would be using its overseas production facilities to sell motorcycles in Europe, not back into the United States.Overseas markets have become critical to Harley-Davidson, as sales slow in the United States. The company recently announced plans to consolidate some of its American plants, including closing its factory in Kansas City, Mo., and merging its operations with one in York, Pa.On Tuesday, employees at the York facility said they were sympathetic to Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns but also understood the company\u2019s need to protect its bottom line. Many of the workers voted for Mr. Trump and still support him, but said the president, in his former life as a businessman, would do the same thing Harley-Davidson was doing to survive.\u201cHarley-Davidson is as American as apple pie, and the president understands that,\u201d said Sue Thomas, who does a variety of jobs at the York plant. \u201cI believe he\u2019s a bit hurt, and those who fly the flag high are understandably disappointed because Harley-Davidson is an American treasure.\u201dBut Ms. Thomas added: \u201cI know the president believes Harley-Davidson should work with him, but he\u2019s a businessman, too, and I don\u2019t believe for a moment he wouldn\u2019t do this with his business.\u201dDavid Paige, an 11-year staff engineer at Harley-Davidson, said that what was best for the long-term interests of the business was ultimately best for him, too.\u201cHarley is doing what Harley needs to do to survive, and that\u2019s important to my feeding my family,\u201d Mr. Paige said.The president\u2019s public attack on Harley is likely to further frustrate Republicans, who have been increasingly worried about the fallout from his trade war.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said Tuesday that the company\u2019s move was a sign that unilateral tariffs did not work.\u201cI don\u2019t think tariffs are the right way to go,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cI think tariffs are basically taxes, and what ends up happening is you get escalating tariffs, or escalating taxes.\u201dRepresentative Jim Sensenbrenner, another Wisconsin Republican, urged Mr. Trump to take a more targeted approach in his trade negotiations that would protect American workers and businesses.\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that such a strong Wisconsin company like Harley-Davidson should have to bear the brunt of this trade dispute,\u201d he said.And Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who is a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, defended Harley\u2019s patriotism and condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies as bad economics.\u201cThis will go over like a Vespa at Sturgis,\u201d Mr. Sasse said, invoking the scooter brand and the South Dakota site of a large annual motorcycle rally. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t that Harley is unpatriotic \u2014 it\u2019s that tariffs are stupid.\u201dThe company has remained publicly quiet since announcing its manufacturing decision in a public filing on Monday. The Harley-Davidson Twitter feed has not addressed Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns, and the company declined to make its chief executive available for an interview.At the York plant on Tuesday, a man who identified himself only as \u201cthe boss\u201d handed out a statement reiterating the Monday filing, which said the shift in operations \u201crepresents the only sustainable option\u201d for the company to make its bikes affordable and accessible to European customers.\u201cEurope is a critical market for Harley-Davidson,\u201d the statement said.Alan Rappeport reported from Washington, and Stacy M. Brown from York, Pa.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Strange Case of the Missing Joyce Scholar", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "FeatureTwo decades ago, a renowned professor promised to produce a flawless version of one of the 20th century\u2019s most celebrated novels: \u201cUlysses.\u201d Then he disappeared.Supported byKidd had been the director of the James Joyce Research Center, a suite of offices on the campus of Boston University dedicated to the study of \u201cUlysses,\u201d arguably the greatest and definitely the most-obsessed-over novel of the 20th century. Armed with generous endowments and cutting-edge technology, he led a team dedicated to a single goal: producing a perfect edition of the text. I saved the Boston Globe story on my computer and would occasionally open it and just stare. Long ago, I contacted Kidd about working on an article together, because I was fascinated by one of his other projects \u2014 he had produced a digital edition, one that used embedded hyperlinks to make the novel\u2019s vast thicket of references and allusions, patterns and connections all available to the reader at a click.This is why \u201cUlysses,\u201d through most of the 20th century and into this one, still catches up all kinds of nonacademic readers who form clubs or stage readings on June 16. I remember wandering into an all-night read-a-thon on the Upper West Side, at Shakespeare & Co. on 81st Street, when I moved to New York in the 1980s. I arrived at the beginning, in the late afternoon, with good intentions, but staggered home and then returned the next day for the final chapter and suddenly realized that, read aloud, the 24 hours of the book\u2019s action take 24 hours to read. The running time in your head is the same as the running time in the book. For a few minutes, I thought I was onto something brilliant, until another yawning fan in the bookstore mentioned a set of connections she had found and I realized, Oh, right, we\u2019re all doing this.So was Kidd one of Joyce\u2019s prophesied professors, made so busy by the puzzles and enigmas that he was driven to literal madness? It seemed impossible to say, because not long after that newspaper article was published, Kidd simply vanished. Over the last 10 years, I would occasionally pick up the telephone, trying to scratch out some other ending to the story. I harbored this idea, a fantasy really, that John Kidd had abandoned the perfect \u201cUlysses\u201d to become the perfect Joycean \u2014 so consumed by the infinite interpretations of the book that he departed this grid of understanding.I started by contacting all the homeless shelters in Brookline. Then I wrote all of Kidd\u2019s old colleagues on the faculty at Boston University, working my way through the directory. \u201cI\u2019d heard that he died,\u201d wrote John Matthews, a Faulkner scholar, \u201cand I suspect that actually is true. ... Kidd was a public eccentric in town \u2014 the whole \u2018talking to the squirrels\u2019 deal. A sad ending.\u201d James Winn, a Dryden man, now retired, wrote that he had \u201cheard rumor of his death, but nothing substantive.\u201d And, if you scour the very bottom of the internet, the last tiny mentions in stray comment sections all speak of a miserable death.Not long ago, I came upon a Romanian scholar, Mircea Mihaies, who confirmed it. In fact, Mihaies wrote about the calamity in his history of \u201cUlysses.\u201d In an interview for the release of the book, Mihaies explained: John Kidd \u201cdied under sordid circumstances in 2010, buried in debt, detested, insulted, alone, abandoned by everyone, communicating only with pigeons on a Boston campus.\u201dThat sounded like a complete story, except for one thing. I couldn\u2019t find an obituary.As a young scholar, Kidd gained notice from professors, won prizes and quickly ascended the graduate-studies ladder. His love, though, was the big book, the grand epic \u2014 thinking through the theories and details of wide-ranging and all-encompassing narratives. He was drawn to Jungian theory, the one school of 20th-century psychoanalysis that theorized about the spiritual quest for completedness. The self, Jung wrote, \u201cexpresses the unity of the personality as a whole.\u201d Then, in graduate school, Kidd proposed a project on Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses,\u201d which he had read in three days as a teenager.But Kidd didn\u2019t just study the novel; he went to Joyce\u2019s tomb in Zurich and started to buy and collect every possible known, and many not-so-known, editions of the book. He compared every draft and every page. He became, in short, a kind of uber-Joycean. But he didn\u2019t take the normal graduate route, luring someone famous to be his mentor (like the critic Hugh Kenner or the biographer Richard Ellmann). Instead, he became a self-directed scholar, holed up in his garret with scores of different versions of \u201cUlysses.\u201dKidd had his work cut out for him. Joyce wrote \u201cUlysses\u201d over a period of seven years, amid world war and personal chaos. Not long after it appeared, poverty and disease quickly wasted Joyce. The walking stick \u201cthat he used for swagger as a young bachelor,\u201d Kevin Birmingham writes in \u201cThe Most Dangerous Book,\u201d \u201cbecame a blind man\u2019s cane in Paris.\u201d If you harbor in your mind, somewhere, the stereotype of a writer as a perfectionist in exile (usually in Paris), working in cold-water poverty on his masterpiece, that clich\u00e9 owes much to the lived reality of James Joyce as a young man.By nature, he was a scattershot writer, scribbling on scraps of paper, composing in notebooks and revising excerpts after they appeared in magazines \u2014 and in 1922, when \u201cUlysses\u201d first appeared, all that chaos was botched into print by French typesetters, most of whom spoke no English. That flawed version was banned in America, so a notorious pornographer, Sam Roth, rushed into print a pirated and even more corrupt edition. What had riled the censors (and attracted the vanguard readers) were a few scenes in \u201cUlysses\u201d where women indulge sexual fantasies. What we nowadays like to call \u201cfemale agency\u201d was \u2014 back then \u2014 elevated to a matter of national security. Customs agents scoured incoming ships to ensure that no American ever saw these pages. It\u2019s not a coincidence that so many women of that time championed the book, including the two famously gay editors of Little Review in Greenwich Village, Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap. In England, Harriet Weaver, and in Paris, Sylvia Beach. Finally, in 1933, a federal judge in the United States ruled in favor of publishing the novel, and Random House accidentally relied on the wildly corrupt Roth text to produce the official \u201cUlysses,\u201d which would go on to occupy American bookshelves for much of the 20th century.Among scholars and Joyce freaks, everyone knew \u201cUlysses\u201d was an odyssey of errors. Over the decades, there were rumors that some great textual fanatic was about to take on the brute task of cleaning it up. In the 1960s, excitement centered on Jack Dalton\u2019s work, but the task seemed to overwhelm him, and he died in 1981 without producing his edition. By the mid-1980s, European scholars took up the charge, culminating in the announcement of a coming version \u2014 \u201cUlysses: The Corrected Text\u201d \u2014 that would set straight 5,000 mistakes and give the world \u201c\u2009\u2018Ulysses\u2019 as Joyce wrote it.\u201dHarry Thrift, it turns out, was a real person who did enter a race back then. But now, Gabler had mistakenly corrected him to \u201cH. Shrift.\u201d For any devotee of the novel, this was mildly concerning. Of all the sets of references and allusions in a book built out of them, Joyce seemed particularly obsessed with his detailed invocation of 1904 Dublin. Or, as Joyce himself said (and every Joyce freak can quote), if Dublin \u201cone day disappeared from the earth, it could be reconstructed out of my book.\u201dKidd wrote: \u201cHarry Thrift\u2019s good works, sturdy frame, and jolly demeanor may fade to a misremembered blur, because he is deposed in Ulysses: The Corrected Text.\u201d And he added: \u201cDid it occur to anyone to check whether Thrift was a real person before changing him to Shrift? Apparently not.\u201dI remember getting up from my desk where I worked, pouring a fresh cup of coffee and then closing my office door so I wouldn\u2019t be disturbed. This was going to be good.Not a few paragraphs later, Kidd called out a slew of new mistakes and then guffawed, \u201cIs no one awake at the wheel?\u201d The piece carried on like this, as the tone gathered more of this vernacular force. After another volley of attacks about a misspelling here, a single dropped letter there, it read: \u201cThe Corrected Text is marbled with the fat of such pseudo-restorations from shoulder to shank.\u201dWho wrote like this in the literary world? Seducing us into textual minutiae with the prim tone of the academic before pieing us with vulgar prose? A vicious snap of proto-snark seemed to end every paragraph as Kidd resumed his formal stance, all textual scholar, only to be preparing for the next parry.Responding in a subsequent issue, Gabler maintained a stiff, dismissive stance. \u201cThe scanty array of examples,\u201d he wrote, \u201cprovides not even the flimsiest of foundations for a critique, let alone a condemnation.\u201d Kidd was permitted to reply in the same issue, and his rebuttal preened with unforgiving attitude. After challenging Gabler on substance, he slipped into mischievous singsong: \u201cIrony abounds. What redounds to Dr. Kidd rebounds. On several grounds, it sounds, he\u2019s out of bounds.\u201dEven though all the contested changes Kidd and others found might appear inconsequential, a few fundamentally affected the novel. In the book, Stephen Dedalus muses several times about the \u201cword known to all men.\u201d Was it death? Love? Some obscure Greek term (a Joyce specialty)? It\u2019s another tiny enigma that readers and professors have argued over for almost a century. Gabler found a passage in a manuscript where Joyce did reveal it, but it disappeared in the next version. Gabler deduced that to be a typist\u2019s error. And so, in a novel most famous for its elliptical style, the reader now comes across a passage containing this thunder of nuance: \u201cLove, yes. Word known to all men.\u201dTo get a sense of just how huffy Joyce readers might react to this, imagine an editor saying he found new parts of \u201cHamlet,\u201d and you picked up the new edition to read the words \u201cTo be or not to be, that is the question\u201d now followed by \u201cand the answer is definitely \u2018be.\u2019\u2009\u201dJust as egregious to many was the sacrilege concerning a single dot of ink. At the end of the last chapter featuring the protagonist Leopold Bloom, you find literature\u2019s largest period \u2014 a giant black dot on the page \u2014 the size of which Joyce worried over, instructing his French printers to make the first edition\u2019s big dot even \u201cmore visible.\u201dThe big dot ends a long, hilarious chapter that parodies the kind of crisp, cold tone associated with scientific discourse. The Q. and A. format is precise to the point of exasperation. By the end of the chapter and hundreds of questions \u2014 \u201cIn what directions did listener and narrator lie?\u201d \u201cIn what posture?\u201d \u2014 the pesky interrogator finally asks, \u201cWhere?\u201d To which Joyce drops his big fat dot, as if to say: Just shut up.But of course, that\u2019s just one interpretation. Some see the big dot as Earth, viewed from the heavenly throne of God, who is often understood to be the annoyingly precise narrator of this chapter. Some think it\u2019s a black hole or maybe Bloom\u2019s open mouth, finally collapsing into sleep at the interrogator\u2019s moronic questions. (Anthony Burgess thought that when reading the chapter aloud, the dot should be pronounced as a big snore.) Others think it\u2019s a portal, or an egg, or Molly Bloom\u2019s anus. There are lots of lively interpretations. In the most common Random House edition, it\u2019s there, it\u2019s final and it\u2019s huge \u2014 an inky one-eighth of an inch in diameter, the head of a twopenny nail stabbed into the book. But for some reason, Gabler\u2019s dot is barely larger than the period at the end of this sentence. When I reached him in his office in Germany, Gabler assured me that even though \u201cit is not a large one, it is a very black one.\u201dAs Kidd\u2019s challenge gained a wider audience, another academic named Charles Rossman wrote in with some big news. He had discovered that the Joyce Estate, run by Stephen Joyce, the author\u2019s notoriously prickly grandson, had authorized the Gabler edition for the reason of creating enough \u201cnew\u201d content to extend the copyright, which in Europe was expiring in 1992. This was not an inconsequential claim. At the time, \u201cUlysses\u201d sold an estimated 100,000 copies a year. A renewal of the copyright would protect revenues for decades to come, for both the publisher and Stephen Joyce, who had to legally authorize this new edition.Once Rossman\u2019s piece went public, the entire Gabler enterprise was cast into the sordid shadow of greed. Outrage mounted, and in the end, Random House announced it would bring back its old edition, however corrupt it might be. The smoke cleared to reveal that a vagabond scholar had waged a transoceanic battle and won.In those days, a superstar ethos was emerging among elite universities, and Boston University jumped at the chance to snatch up Kidd, giving him an entire institute. Its mission was epic \u2014 not merely a perfect text, \u201cas Joyce wrote it,\u201d but also a marriage of modern technology and literary genius. The manifold connections and allusions would now be instantly visible via hyperlinks, and the common reader would be able to appreciate the infinite recesses of Joyce\u2019s brilliance. W.W. Norton promised the kind of advance for the book that, back then, went only to best-selling writers \u2014 $350,000.The world waited for it. And then forgot.It was not easy to make contact with Botsford. I tried to get a hold of some of his relatives, but while I was doing that, a strange clue turned up. Sifting through some obscure Joyce-related hits on Google, I came upon an internet figure in Central America named Miguel, who burned off a lot of blog space expressing his love of naturism. Miguel liked to spend a lot of time naked. One of those posts noted that during a brief sojourn, back among the attired, Miguel attended a fiesta with a famous Joyce scholar.Miguel was based in Rio de Janeiro, a fact that suddenly reminded me of a brief exchange I had with a scholar in Bucharest named Lidia Vianu. When she herself tried to find Kidd a few years ago \u2014 she and a colleague were dedicating a book to him, a 31,802-page tome called \u201cThe Manual for the Advanced Study of James Joyce\u2019s \u2018Finnegans Wake\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 someone had given her an email address in Brazil. But, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t get very far.\u201d The email address was dead.Still, on a Sunday afternoon, I typed out a simple note to the address she passed on to me. I wrote about when we first corresponded, back in the days of textual triumphalism, and I casually mentioned a possible trip to Rio. I hit send.First thing, Monday morning: \u201cI remember you very well. ... When do you plan to be in Rio?\u201d Carnival was coming soon, so I jumped on a plane.John Kidd, who is 65, is well above 6 feet tall and comfortably carries the emerging evidence of many a fine dinner. He no longer has the tidy short blond hair of 30 years ago. It\u2019s now grown out snowy white and halfway down his back, deep into Gandalf territory. He\u2019s a devoted fan of loosefitting Hawaiian shirts, flip-flops and shorts. He has a high-water booty and takes rapid tiny steps, making every excursion feel as if we\u2019re running late.Right off, he wants to talk about that Boston Globe article with the pigeons. His outrage is still raw. He\u2019s particularly miffed that he was called \u201cbroke.\u201d He wants me to know he\u2019s flush and always has been. He has, at the ready, a notarized letter from Fleet Bank in Brookline dated 14 years ago, stating: \u201csix months avg balance in this checking account has been $15,618.00.\u201dI want to talk about how he left Boston University, but when the bitter memories of departmental fights at B.U. or old quarrels with students over grades come up, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s bitten a lemon and his entire face focuses darkly on a point just beyond his nose. Kidd told me he quit. And he did, but only after there were stories in The Boston Globe noting his temper, his treatment of students and his clashes with campus security over birds. He lingered on campus for a while, haunting Marsh Plaza, and then he disappeared.He told me he set off to Beijing. He had read \u201cDream of the Red Chamber,\u201d China\u2019s great epic novel, and become a \u201credologist,\u201d an actual term for those who submerge themselves in the study of this one book. He later moved to Brazil and became fluent in Portuguese before plunging, as seemed inevitable, into that language\u2019s own works of heroic fiction. He is obsessed now with a 19th-century book about a helpless young girl, \u201cThe Slave Isaura,\u201d a popular work that in its early days helped end slavery (essentially, Brazil\u2019s \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u201d). Kidd\u2019s compulsion to understand any culture\u2019s big book is still what gets him out of bed in the morning.As we settle down to breakfast at a swanky hotel, it\u2019s clear that the controversies of 1988 are all still very much alive for him. Of the 5,000 or so corrections Gabler claimed to have made to \u201cUlysses,\u201d there is not one of them Kidd cannot discuss, in rich detail, 30 years later. In particular, he is still steamed up about the Penelope chapter. He flipped open the book and stabbed his finger at the dead center of the famous 42-page interior monologue of Molly Bloom. Joyce originally punctuated the chapter with two periods, one at the end and one at the center, appropriately after Molly muses over the word \u201cashpit.\u201dGabler\u2019s edition eliminated the ashpit period \u2014 then replaced it not long after Kidd made a ruckus. But when asked by a journalist once about how he came to correct this mistake, Gabler said he heard about it from a stranger who showed him a newspaper article. (More recently, Gabler assured me that he\u2019d heard it from a \u201cnumber\u201d of sources.)\u201cOf course, the article was Remnick\u2019s Washington Post piece,\u201d Kidd said, highly agitated. \u201cThere were three different portraits of me in that one article,\u201d he went on, \u201chuge pictures of John Kidd, one of which is like seven inches tall or something, a picture of me!\u201d Kidd didn\u2019t merely remember every textual change in the Gabler edition, but every minor grudge match attending each change. The old fight, it seemed, had moldered into a snit about credit.And indeed, it\u2019s possible to dismiss Kidd as a man who found a handful of serious errors and then used his fussy mastery of minutiae to inflate a few hundred other flecks into a raging scandal. But it\u2019s also true \u201cUlysses\u201d is a book whose every detail matters. Joyce himself was consumed by his own compulsion for details, his love of coincidence and his obsession for superstition \u2014 he built the novel out of them. He once wrote to Harriet Weaver worrying about the year 1921, whose digits total 13. One outlying theory connects this arithmetic fear to Joyce\u2019s decision to publish Ulysses on his birthday the following year, which had a sublime smoothness when written down on paper: 2/2/22.\u201cYou really have to read Fernando Pessoa,\u201d he said, handing me a collection of poems, in Portuguese, by this early-20th-century Lisbon writer, titled \u201cA Little Larger Than the Entire Universe.\u201d I cracked open Kidd\u2019s copy to find a swarm of marginal notes on nearly every page, cataloging textual alternatives in the many other Portuguese editions he owns. This is how John Kidd reads everything \u2014 as a search for the perfected text.It\u2019s not just an aesthetic choice for Kidd but a kind of compulsion toward completedness, suffusing not just how he reads literature but also how he talks about it. We discussed \u201cGargantua and Pantagruel\u201d and \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and \u201cTristram Shandy.\u201d He considers them all to be \u201cantic\u201d works, his coinage for books that are marked by a \u201ccomic take on the encyclopedic narrative just as the \u2018Iliad\u2019 is a tragic take on an encyclopedic narrative.\u201d Those novels are playful, like \u201cUlysses,\u201d but they mean to embrace and comprehend a sense of everything, and it\u2019s this sense of totality and the longing for it that drives Kidd, too.When critics talk about Joyce\u2019s mind, they typically resort to comparable terms, referring to Joyce\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge of history, myth and language. \u201cUlysses,\u201d as every beginning reader quickly picks up, contains a schematic view of downtown Dublin, and \u201cFinnegans Wake\u201d can be understood as all of history and literature written in a mash-up of every language.Joyce was well aware of his compendious cast of mind and proud to find it manifest among his children. When it became clear that his daughter Lucia was suffering a profound kind of schizophrenia, he came to see her difference as an improvement on himself. He cared for her, sometimes shelving his own ambitions to convince the world that the true genius in the family was his incoherent, troubled daughter. \u201cFoolish fond like Lear\u201d is how his biographer would later describe Joyce\u2019s paternal affection.Inside the refuge of the academy, Kidd keeps a permanent cubicle occupied by a big old PC and a few books. For years he has been working on the first English edition of the novel \u201cThe Slave Isaura.\u201d Kidd is translating the 19th-century book with a few rules he felt compelled to devise. The work will be in two parts, and every word in Part 1 will have its lexicographic partner in Part 2. If \u201ccat feet\u201d appears in Part 1, expect \u201ccattail\u201d in Part 2. His sense of what pairs up can get quite intricate, but that\u2019s part of the fun, he told me. So he maintains lists of all the possible pairings and where and whether he has used one: six foot, six foot under, footing, foothills, footloose, footprint. There is a logic to the work, and the part I read resounded with the baroque tone you might expect of a translation that will obey his other rule: It will use every word exactly once.Already, the work is nearly twice as plump as Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d Kidd was particularly excited to show me his key apparatus \u2014 the homemade thesaurus where he keeps a running crosscheck on the entirety of the English language. So far, it runs to some 3,000 pages.\u201cAs much as humanly possible, the 19th-century dictionary of English is in here,\u201d he told me. His translation is titled \u201cIsaura Unbound,\u201d and he wanted me to understand its ambition: When the book is finished, it will be a complete reordering of one entire English dictionary into a single work of art. Take that, void.I asked him that afternoon, one more time, about the perfect \u201cUlysses.\u201d It always seems so close. Back in the 1960s, again in 1980s. What happened to his work in Boston? Why can\u2019t we just publish the thing? A few errors \u2014 how hard can it be?When I pressed him on real-world specifics, the manuscripts, the work that must have been on disks somewhere, he recalled that, yes, he had assembled a draft of an edition with a complete introduction. One of Kidd\u2019s editors at Norton, Julia Reidhead, confirmed that both existed but said that one delay after another \u2014 \u201can infinite loop of revision\u201d \u2014 ran into the legal wall of new copyright extensions, and so Norton \u201cstopped the project.\u201d One Joyce scholar remembers reading the introduction but no longer has a copy, and Kidd doesn\u2019t have one either. Instead, we are left with bizarre relics of what could have been. Early on in the Joyce wars, in fact, Arion Press issued a new edition of \u201cUlysses\u201d that included some of the preliminary Kidd edits. The book was luxurious, with prints by Robert Motherwell, and only 175 of them were printed. I found one for sale on Amazon. The seller wanted $25,678.75.In the years after Kidd\u2019s disappearance, an uncanny thing happened. The very book Kidd had tried to shame into disrepute was embraced by the world of scholarship. In 1993, the \u201cGabler Edition\u201d of \u201cUlysses,\u201d a bright red tome, appeared on the bookshelves. There are various printings of this book now, and many have no dot at all at the end of the Bloom chapter. No period of any size, which Gabler has said is a printing error \u2014 making this nondot an error miscorrected so many times that it is now perfectly invisible.Gabler\u2019s book thrives because it now has its own captive audience: academics. \u201cScholars have quietly gone back to Gabler,\u201d said Robert Spoo, a former editor of The James Joyce Quarterly. \u201cBy not publishing his own edition, Kidd never completed the argument against Gabler,\u201d he said, adding that the Gabler edition \u201chas one great advantage, you can cite it by line numbers; that is very handy for scholars.\u201d That whole \u201c\u2009\u201980s and \u201990s thing,\u201d as Spoo called it, receded long ago. \u201cScholars have made peace with the Gabler.\u201dIn that stretch when the original edition fell out of copyright in the mid-1990s, a lot of editors rushed to publish their own editions. Some have dots, some don\u2019t. Some with \u201clove,\u201d some not. Some editors reversed a selection of Gabler\u2019s changes, some didn\u2019t. Other editions have gone off the rails, as the Joyce scholar Sam Slote told me: One \u201cUlysses,\u201d currently available online, has a long, weird riff inserted on Page 160, announcing that you will now be reading \u201cThe Secret Confessions of a Conservative,\u201d where the anonymous writer explains that his pro-life, pro-death-penalty positions are so consistent that \u201cif an embryo or fetus commits murder, then he should be aborted.\u201dOut in the distant pampas, meanwhile, the perfect edition remains always close at hand and just out of reach. \u201cI am almosting it,\u201d Stephen Dedalus muttered early on in the novel. The thing is, on Amazon alone, there are nearly a dozen slightly different versions of the novel \u201cas James Joyce wrote it.\u201d None of them are absolutely perfect, but each of them, nevertheless, is \u201cUlysses.\u201d It\u2019s almost too pat an ending for an author who was asked about all those errors nearly a century ago. \u201cThese are not misprints,\u201d he said, \u201cbut beauties of my style hitherto undreamt of.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Gaining a content producer with a track record of developing hits would allow Disney or Comcast to better compete with the tech giants.Whoever prevails would also get hold of FX, the home of highly regarded TV shows like \u201cThe Americans\u201d and \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d as well as National Geographic. Neither channel is a huge moneymaker, but extra content to push onto streaming platforms could still be valuable.Fox owns 22 regional sports networks, which focus on sports in markets like Florida, the Carolinas and Ohio. Both Disney and Comcast have sports operations that would mesh well with those properties.\u25a0 Disney owns ESPN. Combining it with Fox\u2019s regional sports networks would create a colossus. It could also prove attractive enough to viewers to help stem the subscriber losses that ESPN has suffered in recent years as a result of cord cutting.\u25a0Comcast controls both NBC Sports, which owns the United States rights to the Olympics and \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d as well as nine regional sports networks. Fox\u2019s regional networks would round out its coverage.This is actually one of the areas that could pose antitrust issues for either suitor. That\u2019s why both Disney and Comcast have offered to sell as many of Fox\u2019s regional sports networks as required to assuage the concerns of antitrust regulators.Though both suitors are working on their own online streaming platforms, having control of another popular service couldn\u2019t hurt. As Steve Burke, the head of NBCUniversal, said on Comcast\u2019s analyst call on Wednesday, \u201cWe think Hulu is a wonderful asset.\u201dBoth Disney and Comcast make most of their money in the United States, so the promise of finding sales growth in overseas markets is alluring.

{"Headline": "Amazon Has a Business Proposition for You: Deliver Its Packages", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon has more than 100 warehouses. It has a fleet of trucks, and even its own airplanes. Now, in another effort to help get its millions of packages to shoppers faster, it wants to build an army of delivery people, too.The company announced Thursday a new program aimed at helping people start their own businesses delivering packages for Amazon.For a minimum investment of $10,000, people in the United States will be able to open and manage their own delivery service handling Amazon packages. Although the couriers will not be employees of the company, they\u2019ll get access to Amazon-branded vehicles, uniforms and more.By the company\u2019s calculations, an owner could earn as much as $300,000 a year in profit by operating a fleet of up to 40 vehicles.The program is a potential solution to a growing problem Amazon faces as it handles an ever-increasing number of packages for customers all across the country: How to quickly get packages from its various package-sorting centers to people\u2019s doorsteps.But the start-up service is certain to raise questions about whether it could challenge \u2014 or even replace \u2014 some of the work currently done by Amazon\u2019s partners, including United Parcel Service and the United States Postal Service.Amazon\u2019s business ties with the Postal Service have come under considerable scrutiny in recent months. President Trump has argued on Twitter that Amazon\u2019s agreement with the Postal Service, which sets the amount Amazon pays the agency, was costing taxpayers billions of dollars.\u201cI am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet in April.While the details behind the agreement are not public, available evidence suggests the opposite: that Amazon\u2019s business has been a boon to the post office. Some current and former White House officials have said that Mr. Trump sometimes blends Amazon with The Washington Post, which has covered his administration aggressively. The Post is owned by Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos.In mid-April, President Trump abruptly issued an executive order demanding an evaluation of the Postal Service\u2019s finances. The order did not mention Amazon, but it was clear that he would like for the panel to substantiate his claims that the financial arrangement between the Postal Service and Amazon, its biggest shipper of packages, is a money loser.Executives at Amazon dismissed any link between the new delivery program and Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter attacks about its agreement with the post office.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t play into that debate at all,\u201d Dave Clark, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in an interview Wednesday afternoon at the Admiral\u2019s House, a historic landmark property overlooking Elliott Bay in Seattle.Mr. Clark said his job was to think five to 15 years down the road about Amazon\u2019s needs and that the new delivery program was designed to meet future growth and capacity demands. He added that Amazon would continue to use all of its partners, including the Postal Service, to get packages to its customers.Amazon has been testing a number of programs that could replace or reduce its reliance on its delivery partners. This year, for instance, it plans to test a new service in which company couriers would pick up products from businesses that sell goods through Amazon and deliver that merchandise to its warehouses. Currently, that work is done by UPS, FedEx and other companies.The new program is also separate from Amazon Flex, which pays individuals $18 to $25 an hour to deliver packages from their own vehicle.Under the program, individuals will not be employees or even independent contractors of Amazon, but rather, be owners of their businesses, contracted with Amazon to deliver packages. Amazon said its vehicles could be used to deliver packages only from the company, not its competitors.The program will start in more than two dozen states, many of them along the coasts. But company executives encouraged interested individuals to sign up even if their city or region wasn\u2019t currently listed, because Amazon expects the program to grow.Amazon hoped in the next 12 to 18 months to have hundreds of people sign up, calling them delivery service partners. If the service is successful, it would most likely be extended to other countries, Mr. Clark said.And in a bid to attract the nation\u2019s military veterans to the program, Amazon is offering $10,000 reimbursements for qualified candidates to start their own businesses.All of those who are accepted into the start-up program will get access to a variety of discounts Amazon has negotiated on their behalf, including the Amazon-branded vehicles, as well as fuel, insurance coverage and more, executives said.One of Amazon\u2019s test participants in its new offering, Olaoluwa Abimbola, said that after arriving from Nigeria, he spent years working at a desk job and, more recently, driving for Amazon Flex. Now, he said, he was excited to be running his own company, which has 40 full- and part-time employees.\u201cThis means the world to me,\u201d Mr. Abimbola said in front of a gray Amazon Prime truck behind the Admiral\u2019s House. \u201cThis opportunity provides a future for my family, for my daughters.

{"Headline": "How Net Neutrality Actually Ended Long Before This Week", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIt seemed obvious that the internet\u2019s great promise was that it operated outside the purview of existing communications monopolies. Because phone and cable companies couldn\u2019t easily dictate what happened online, the internet was exploding in dozens of genuinely new ideas. Among those back then were blogs, Skype, file-sharing, YouTube, Friendster, Netflix \u2014 ideas that scrambled our sense of what was possible in media and communication, and, in the process, posed existential threats to the established giants.Other than the phone and cable companies themselves, I couldn\u2019t see why anyone might oppose the simple premise of protecting the environment that had made all these things possible. Did they hate clean water, too?Net neutrality was too good for us. And even if rules are restored, the notion that the internet should afford at least a minimally competitive landscape for new entrants now seems as antiquated as Friendster.Today, the internet is run by giants. A handful of American tech behemoths \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 control the most important digital infrastructure, while a handful of broadband companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon \u2014 control most of the internet connections in the United States.So, what now?It\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201cHistory shows us that companies that have the technical capacity to do things, the business incentive to do them and the legal right \u2014 they will take advantage of what is made available to them,\u201d said Jessica Rosenworcel, an F.C.C. commissioner and a Democrat, who voted against the repeal of net neutrality last year.By repealing neutrality rules, the government has just given our online overlords that legal right, she cautioned.\u201cNow they can block websites and censor online content,\u201d Ms. Rosenworcel said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me feel good \u2014 and if you rely on the internet to consume or create, it shouldn\u2019t make you feel good, either.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The truck, which he calls the Space Shuttle Cafe, is made from parts of an old Douglas DC-3 airplane.\u201cI thought this would be my next act,\u201d Mr. Elbroody said, as he inspected the shiny, unused kitchen inside. \u201cNow I\u2019m not too sure.\u201dMr. Elbroody said he entered the food truck business three years ago after he learned that he and his partner, Jonathan Skwiersky, might lose the lease for their business, Manhattan Collision on West 19th Street in Chelsea. That didn\u2019t happen. But Mr. Elbroody, who has run the auto repair shop for 29 years, had already decided to take a risk with the truck.\u201cI didn\u2019t have any doubts buying it, even though everyone else thought I was crazy,\u201d said Mr. Elbroody, who paid around $87,000 for the vehicle in 2015.Mr. Skwiersky said he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes when a hauling company from California dropped off the shuttle truck at their garage.\u201cI was dumbfounded,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no words.\u201dBut landing a deal where Mr. Elbroody would be in charge of the kitchen was more difficult than he anticipated. His vision for the cafe involves a set menu that he carefully curated, which includes a Jupiter burger with fried onion, mushrooms, carrots and celery for $7.99.Even though he has spent about $140,000 to completely update the interior, which now has a new stove, oven, grill, deep fryer, freezer and refrigeration units, Mr. Elbroody still hasn\u2019t grilled one burger in his food truck.\u201cEveryone who wanted a partnership wasn\u2019t interested in me running the kitchen, but I wanted to do the food myself,\u201d he said.After three years of fine-tuning the vehicle, which also included adding a smoke machine to the propulsion engine replicas in the rear, Mr. Elbroody was eager to start getting some return on his investment. He decided to list the shuttle cafe for purchase on several websites in April. He received about 100 calls and emails, one as far away as Dubai, but many inquirers were put off by the $230,0000 price tag.Mr. Petersen said he thinks that Mr. Roland, who often had articles about him in the local papers, made up the biggest myth tied to the DC-3 on wheels: that the plane was once hijacked to Cuba. How the plane would have made it back to the United States is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cool history associated with this truck, but I would say the Cuba hijacking part is unconfirmed rumor,\u201d Mr. Petersen said.Jay Ohrberg, a car collector who made specialized cars for Hollywood film and TV studios, bought the shuttle truck in the \u201990s. By the time Mr. Petersen had discovered the vehicle in 2001, it was languishing next to the freeway in Beaumont, Calif. Mr. Petersen took about four years to fix it; he was the first owner to install a commercial kitchen. He would drive it to auto and air shows, where he sold burgers and burritos.\u201cThe biggest wow factor is when you drive the thing down the highway,\u201d Mr. Petersen recalled. \u201cYou get lots of honks, thumbs up, and photos.\u201dMr. Elbroody, who once drove the shuttle truck into Times Square to gauge onlookers\u2019 reactions, said he got a similar response.

{"Headline": "Want to Understand What Ails the Modern Internet? Look at eBay", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThere was a time when eBay was practically synonymous with buying and selling things online. Now it\u2019s surprisingly easy to forget that it exists, until you need to buy something you can\u2019t find anywhere else or clear some space in the attic. Or until someone like Elon Musk, made fabulously wealthy when PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002, muscles his way back into your consciousness by, for example, launching rockets into space or burrowing tunnels under major American cities. Where did he come from, exactly? As with a surprising number of tech heavyweights, the answer is complicated, but it runs through eBay.None of this is to say that eBay has gone away \u2014 in 2017, more merchandise changed hands over the platform than in any earlier year. It\u2019s just ancient in tech terms. It went public in 1998. But perhaps more than any other tech giant of its era \u2014 excluding Amazon \u2014 eBay has shaped the tech industry of 2018. Depending on how you look at it, this is an assignation of credit or blame. EBay\u2019s influence can be felt in both trivial and fundamental ways in companies like Facebook, Google and Uber.EBay is a platform that connects buyers and sellers. It does not itself sell goods; it lists and sorts and processes, providing shelves for its users\u2019 inventory and aisles for their prospective customers. It mediates as little as possible, and it takes a cut. Its problems, in the early days, felt new, at least at eBay\u2019s scale: managing disputes among significant numbers of users, dealing with bad actors of various sorts, addressing scams and fakes, establishing not just a framework for mass human interaction but systems through which to codify trust and resolve conflict.To its credit, eBay has ameliorated many of its problems, through public trial and error, over the course of nearly two decades. \u201cAll the linchpins on which modern platforms rely, at least at a very high level, eBay pioneered,\u201d says Andrei Hagiu, a visiting associate professor at M.I.T. and a longtime researcher of online platforms. \u201cWe use it in almost every paper we do.\u201d EBay, in obvious and subtle ways, has served as a model well beyond the world of commerce, inspiring the systems that play host to discourse, media, culture and communication online. It was among the first true megaplatforms \u2014 the sort that establishes itself as something like online infrastructure. And it may be, to date, the last one we truly understand.This basic approach to seller vetting has been adopted, and adapted, for much wider use, often with far less remove. In 2001, an eBay user might have given an eBay seller a low rating for an unsatisfactory packaging job; in 2018, an Uber driver might be dinged if a rider doesn\u2019t like his personality or choice of music. Facebook recently began ranking publishers by trustworthiness, based on feedback from users. Upon discovering a problem, a platform company\u2019s first instinct is to find a way to expose it to the wisdom of a market, or at least the will of a crowd.EBay users\u2019 participation in the site\u2019s governance is best understood as large-scale offloading of labor, and is basically limited to snitching on one another; users have some recourse against one another and somewhat less against the site itself. That imbalance doesn\u2019t bother us because eBay is eBay. \u201cIt\u2019s a transactional platform; the transaction is very clear to both sides,\u201d Hagiu says. \u201cBy and large, buyers and sellers are aligned on eBay.\u201d A seller banned for counterfeit sunglasses hasn\u2019t lost any rights, just his ability to use eBay. Crucially, to most ears, a scammer\u2019s claims to the contrary would sound ridiculous.But quite often it\u2019s managed like one, because in many ways, that\u2019s exactly what it is: a giant, multisided marketplace for buying and selling, in which the largest party \u2014 the users \u2014 doesn\u2019t do the buying or the selling. A social network\u2019s profitable transactions involve everyone but the users. Ad rates are even determined, in many cases, by auction. If eBay is a machine for finding the right price for a pair of shoes, Facebook \u2014 behind the veneer of enabling human connection \u2014 is a machine for discovering the right price for a pair of eyeballs. Your eyeballs.When the biggest platforms seem to be flailing or punting on problems, it\u2019s often because they\u2019re trying to address broad social issues with market solutions. They\u2019re rediscovering, at scale and at great expense to their users, the ways in which a society is more than a bazaar, and the pitfalls of allowing human attention to be sold and resold as a commodity. If a platform is addressing a collective problem in a maddeningly strange way, consider that it might see itself, or only know to govern itself, like an eBay. If it can\u2019t keep bad actors from using the service to exploit other users, that\u2019s because it\u2019s modeled after a system in which finding the highest bidder \u2014 or the biggest sucker \u2014 is gamely understood to be the point.There are more lessons for the new internet to learn from the old, and eBay\u2019s more recent trajectory might likewise give us clues about where its successors will go next. EBay was once a world-beating company, destined to totally remake commerce. While its legacy is powerful, it has, over the years, discovered its limits. Amazon, not eBay, is now most synonymous with online shopping. The site has also undergone some more fundamental changes. Auctions, for example, have become less popular over time, as sellers and buyers have favored the site\u2019s other buying styles, with fixed or suggested prices. And in many categories, large sellers have become entrenched, functioning more like stores themselves than desperate participants in a giant open-air market. EBay\u2019s final lesson to the next generation of platforms is that nothing is inevitable. Or lasts forever.Even still, eBay and PayPal\u2019s alumni are now immensely wealthy and unusually influential, and are using that power to reshape the world around them: Musk, with his electric cars and rockets and flamethrowers; Pierre Omidyar, with his investments and media ventures; Peter Thiel \u2014 an early Facebook investor and board member \u2014 with his funding of lawsuits against media companies and his eclectic and severe right-wing politics. It is worth considering what sort of initiatives might be spawned by the beneficiaries of today\u2019s much larger platform companies. EBay invited us onto an auction floor and dared us to compete with one another; millions did. Social-media companies found a more lucrative approach, with an even bigger payoff, by building the auction floor right under our feet.John Herrman is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Data Has Done to Capitalism", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I\u2019m regularly frustrated by the process of searching for hotel accommodations for my family of five. We know what we want: a basic suite, like at a Residence Inn, with four beds, two bedrooms and a bathroom off the common area. But we struggle to find it, because hotel search engines make it surprisingly difficult to figure out the specifications of rooms.Lacking that information, I sometimes end up calling a hotel reservations agent, who typically can\u2019t tell me much more than I can read online. Then I go back to the search engine, make a decision based on price and hope for the best. If someone \u2014 either a hotel chain or an aggregator \u2014 built a better search engine, I would happily use it. I would also be willing to pay a bit more for the kind of room my family wants, rather than shopping almost exclusively by price.After reading this new book by Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Thomas Ramge, \u201cReinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data,\u201d I now have a name for what I\u2019m looking for: a data-rich market. And I\u2019m optimistic that it will one day come to the hotel business. Data-rich markets are sweeping across the global economy. \u201cUntil recently, communicating such rich information in markets was difficult and costly. So we used a workaround and condensed all of this information into a single metric: price,\u201d they write. \u201cIn data-rich markets, we no longer have to condense our preferences into price and can abandon the oversimplification that was necessary because of communicative and cognitive limits.\u201dAmazon, with its many product specifications and customer reviews, is often a data-rich market. So are Spotify, Netflix, Lyft, StubHub, Rent the Runway, Tinder and Airbnb (which provides a much better search for lodging than hotels do). These markets aren\u2019t just about first-world convenience, either. In the Indian state of Kerala, among other places, a data-rich market has transformed the fishing business. Fishermen no longer have to guess which seaside market needs their catch. They can use their mobile phones to tell them which markets have a gap between supply and demand.All in all, the move to data-rich markets is for the good. It is of a piece with the ideals of Francis Bacon, Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Immanuel Kant. Knowledge spreads, and people are able to act on it. Fishermen sell more fish. Fish eaters have more choice. In one realm after another, people are able to find products and services they want, rather than having to settle for something less useful.Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the University of Oxford, and Ramge, a writer for The Economist, explain all of these advantages. To their credit, though, they spend more time in their book on the downsides of data-rich markets. These include the potential to put people out of work and to concentrate corporate power among a small number of firms that control the most valuable data. The book echoes some of the themes of Tim Wu\u2019s 2010 history, \u201cThe Master Switch,\u201d which documented the tendency of information technology to produce cartels and monopolies. The only way to avoid this fate, all of these authors agree, is a smart, activist government dedicated to protecting its citizens\u2019 interests.This new book starts its story with the ancient idea of human coordination. \u201cIf there is a single crucial thread that has persisted through human history,\u201d the authors write, \u201cit is the importance of coordination.\u201d Coordination allows communities to accomplish tasks that individuals working alone cannot. People can build on one another\u2019s strengths and make up for one another\u2019s weaknesses. Coordination made possible the library of Alexandria, the Great Wall of China, the Suez Canal and the moon landing. Coordination, in turn, depends on communication \u2014 the exchange of information that allows people to work together.In modern times, the most effective way to coordinate behavior, other than through government, has been through a company, also known as a firm. Firms tend to follow a top-down approach to coordination. A canonical example is Henry Ford\u2019s automobile firm. There, workers were divided into specialized groups. Information flowed up from these groups through a tightly controlled management structure that culminated with an imperial chief executive. Decisions came down from the top.But the firm is not the only way for the private sector to coordinate. The market offers a different model for doing so, one that both complements and competes with the firm\u2019s hierarchical approach. The market is decentralized. It has no top-down authority. Participants come and go with ease.In the market, the dominant mechanism for coordination and communication has long been price. It\u2019s simple to understand, often too simple. It is one-dimensional. That\u2019s why firms have long provided a more efficient way for people to coordinate, because they could better synthesize a rich stream of information and then act on it. Today, however, the explosion of computing power has enabled many more people to gather information and analyze it quickly, which has allowed the lingua franca of the market to become more sophisticated. In response, many firms are reorganizing themselves to mimic markets. They have become less strictly hierarchical and spread decision-making power to a larger number of people.For all their differences, the firm and the market do share a central flaw. They often are not self-correcting. Early winners can use their strength to beat back competition, amassing yet more strength \u2014 and ultimately hurting the public interest. It happened with the railroad trusts, Standard Oil and AT&T, and it is beginning to happen with the big winners in today\u2019s data-rich, market-oriented economy. Superstar companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google earn enormous profits, while employing a surprisingly small work force relative to their scale. They are adept at avoiding taxes. And they continue to amass data about human behavior that will help them grow even stronger.Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Ramge offer several intriguing ideas for limiting the excesses of data-rich capitalism. One idea is a \u201crobo tax\u201d as a partial replacement for the payroll tax \u2014 machines would be taxed more and human employment less. Another idea is mandated data sharing \u2014 an echo of the patent system, which also depends on disclosure, the authors note \u2014 to allow new entrants a fair chance to compete.These ideas won\u2019t get much of a hearing in today\u2019s Washington. But the shift toward an information-based economy will outlast the current administration. Eventually, this country will have a government interested in encouraging the best parts of modern capitalism while restraining the worst.David Leonhardt is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.Advertisement"}

But to Mr. Bushard and his buddy, both of whom grew up in San Diego, they were an invitation to wallow in Day-Glo nostalgia for a series that is their cohort\u2019s beloved counterpart to the Gen X favorite \u201cThe Brady Bunch.\u201dThe brainchild of three Chicago entrepreneurs \u2014 Derek Berry, Zack Eastman and Steve Harris, who all have experience as club promoters \u2014 Saved by the Max meticulously recreates the neon-lit cafe where the kids from Bayside High School in the fictional Los Angeles suburb of Palisades liked to hang after class.Mr. Haskins had this reaction when he visited a Chicago incarnation of Saved by the Max in 2016 when it opened in the city\u2019s Wicker Park neighborhood.

Reviving classic entertainment properties, said Carol Nygren, senior vice president of Worldwide Live Entertainment, Universal Brand Development, \u201cis always a popular trend, and being able to recreate scenes that play into fans\u2019 memories of popular shows is so much fun.\u201dEnthusiasm for \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d-related experiences, however, may outplay all of those properties. \u201cIt\u2019s the right time for \u201cSaved by the Bell,\u201d Mr. Eastman said. \u201cPeople\u2019s interest in the show hasn\u2019t died.

{"Headline": "We Have Reached Peak Screen. Now Revolution Is in the Air.", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut now that smartphones have achieved dominance, revolution is again in the air.There\u2019s a reason tech companies are feeling this tension between making phones better and worrying they are already too addictive. We\u2019ve hit what I call Peak Screen.For much of the last decade, a technology industry ruled by smartphones has pursued a singular goal of completely conquering our eyes. It has given us phones with ever-bigger screens and phones with unbelievable cameras, not to mention virtual reality goggles and several attempts at camera-glasses.So tech giants are building the beginning of something new: a less insistently visual tech world, a digital landscape that relies on voice assistants, headphones, watches and other wearables to take some pressure off our eyes.This could be a nightmare; we may simply add these new devices to our screen-addled lives. But depending on how these technologies develop, a digital ecosystem that demands less of our eyes could be better for everyone \u2014 less immersive, less addictive, more conducive to multitasking, less socially awkward, and perhaps even a salve for our politics and social relations.Who will bring us this future? Amazon and Google are clearly big players, but don\u2019t discount the company that got us to Peak Screen in the first place. With advances to the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, Apple is slowly and almost quietly creating an alternative to its phones.If it works, it could change everything again. As I argue below, there are many ways that screens have become too dominant in our lives. The sooner we find something else, the better.When you do give in, you lose your mind.\u201cWhat you get sucked into is not the one thing that caught your attention \u2014 your text message or tweet or whatever,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at the technology research firm Creative Strategies. Instead, you unlock your phone and instantly, almost unconsciously, descend into the irresistible splendors of the digital world \u2014 emerging 30 minutes later, stupefied and dazed.\u201cYou open this irresistible box, and you can\u2019t fight it,\u201d she said.Tech companies understand this power, of course; our inability to resist screens explains why phone screens keep getting bigger.He was wrong. Rivals, led by Samsung, found that big-screen phones sold very well. The eyes won out over the hands. Eventually Apple joined the party, making iPhones with bigger and then still bigger displays. The largest-screen iPhones now account for half of Apple\u2019s sales and the majority of its profits.But screens have now become a crutch for technologists, a lazy, catchall way to add digital experiences to every product.Or look at augmented reality, the technology that allows you to see digital imagery superimposed on the real world. In a few specific uses \u2014 turning your face into a dog\u2019s on Snapchat \u2014 this can be fun. But too often, A.R. feels gimmicky. Rather than commingling the digital and the real, it simply uses a screen to usurp the world around you.At Apple\u2019s developer conference this month, Martin Sanders, a Lego executive, showed off a new A.R. Lego set. When he pointed his iPad at a Lego structure, his screen filled with digital fireworks, superheros, sports cars \u2014 a whole bustling Lego town that he didn\u2019t have to build with his hands or imagine with his head.\u201cThere\u2019s so much to do here!\u201d Mr. Sanders exclaimed as he and an assistant stood completely still, staring at animated Legos through a piece of digital glass. It was bizarre. The whole point of Lego is physical interaction, but thanks to A.R., he had turned Lego into just another video game.There are two ways we may break our fevered addiction to screens.First, we will need to try to use our phones more mindfully, which requires a combination of willpower and technology.Help is on the way. For the last week, I\u2019ve been using Screen Time, one of the new features in Apple\u2019s next version of its mobile operating system. The software gives you valuable information about how much you are using your phone, and it can even block you from using apps that you deem unhealthy. I found Screen Time very well designed, and I suspect it will profoundly change how we use our phones.But in addition to helping us resist phones, the tech industry will need to come up with other, less immersive ways to interact with digital world. Three technologies may help with this: voice assistants, of which Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google Assistant are the best, and Apple\u2019s two innovations, AirPods and the Apple Watch.All of these technologies share a common idea. Without big screens, they are far less immersive than a phone, allowing for quick digital hits: You can buy a movie ticket, add a task to a to-do list, glance at a text message or ask about the weather without going anywhere near your Irresistible Screen of Splendors.These are all works in progress. Voice assistants still cannot do everything for you, though Google and Amazon have thousands of engineers working to improve them. AirPods are fantastic \u2014 they have fewer connection issues than any other wireless headphones \u2014 and after years of refinement, the Apple Watch shows you just enough stuff from your phone to make it useful without becoming overbearing.If Apple could only improve Siri, its own voice assistant, the Watch and AirPods could combine to make something new: a mobile computer that is not tied to a huge screen, that lets you get stuff done on the go without the danger of being sucked in. Imagine if, instead of tapping endlessly on apps, you could just tell your AirPods, \u201cMake me dinner reservations at 7\u201d or \u201cCheck with my wife\u2019s calendar to see when we can have a date night this week.\u201dApple has never been scared of disrupting its own best inventions. By rethinking screens, it may have a chance to do that once more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Class Struggle According to Donald Trump", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.If only.As Adam Cobb, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, put it in an email conversation:Life doesn\u2019t operate so cleanly and the fact that a worker\u2019s wealth and well-being is much more dependent upon her employer than the employer is on a given worker tilts things in the employer\u2019s favor.The trend in recent years has been an inexorable shift of bargaining power to employers at the expense of employees.Worker power has already suffered death by a thousand cuts, some political, others judicial and regulatory; some at the hands of a changing domestic workplace, others stemming from relentless global forces.Corporate America recognized these trends early on and capitalized on them ruthlessly. Labor organizations were ill equipped to do so and have been on the defensive for the past four decades.In response to my query, Martha McCluskey, a professor of law at the University at Buffalo, emailed:The decline in worker bargaining power in the United States is the cumulative effect of numerous small and large changes over recent decades reaching into almost every area of law and policy. This combines with a decline in the enforcement of existing laws that could protect workers\u2019 bargaining power \u2014 laws protecting unions, laws against wage theft, nondiscrimination laws, and more.The \u201csmall and large changes over recent decades\u201d to which McCluskey refers increase the clout of corporate management and reduce the power of workers over wages, benefits and job security.Among these changes is the requirement that employees sign what are known as \u201cnoncompete\u201d and \u201cno-raid\u201d agreements, both of which restrict workers\u2019 ability to extract pay hikes by threatening to take similar jobs at competing companies.When entry-level workers at fast food restaurants are asked to sign two-year non-competes, it becomes less plausible that trade secrets are always the primary motivation for such agreements.The treasury report estimated that 30 million American workers have signed noncompete agreements.New practices have emerged to facilitate employer collusion, such as noncompete clauses and no-raid pacts, but the basic insights are the same \u2014 employers often implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, act to prevent the forces of competition from enabling workers to earn what a competitive market would dictate.Nearly 1 in 5 labor force participants were bound by noncompetes in 2014, and nearly 40 percent had signed at least one noncompete in the past.These included what the authors decried asJust as companies have weakened employee power through agreements like these, they have capitalized on the increased use of mandatory arbitration of employment disputes to limit their obligations to workers.fueled employer use of mandatory arbitration clauses to cover individual employment disputes, including allegations of workplace discrimination and sexual harassment.If these untoward consequences stemmed from legislative choices, I would be obliged to accede to them. But the edict that employees with wage and hours claims may seek relief only one-by-one does not come from Congress. It is the result of take-it-or-leave-it labor contracts harking back to the type called \u201cyellow dog,\u201d and of the readiness of this Court to enforce those unbargained-for agreements. The Federal Arbitration Act demands no such suppression of the right of workers to take concerted action for their \u201cmutual aid or protection.\u201dThese developments may be masked for a while when unemployment declines, but not forever.By exchanging direct employment for contract work or outsourcing, David Weil, dean of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis, writes in his book \u201cThe Fissured Workplace: Why Work Became So Bad for So Many and What Can Be Done to Improve It,\u201d major corporations succeed insubstantially reducing costs and dispatching the many responsibilities connected to being the employer of record.This shift, in turn,creates downward pressures on wages and benefits, murkiness about who bears responsibility for work conditions, increased likelihood that basic labor standards will be violated.The percentage of workers engaged in alternative work arrangements \u2014 defined as temporary help agency workers, on-call workers, contract workers, and independent contractors or freelancers \u2014 rose from 10.7 percent in February 2005 to 15.8 percent in late 2015.That\u2019s roughly 24 million workers.In addition, Katz and Krueger found that \u201cworkers in alternative work arrangements earn considerably less per week than do regular employees with similar characteristics and in similar occupations,\u201d that \u201cworkers in alternative work arrangements work fewer hours per week\u201d and that alarger share of alternative workers are involuntary part-time workers compared with employees in traditional jobs.Perhaps more significant, Katz and Krueger found:A striking implication of these estimates is that 94 percent of the net employment growth in the U.S. economy from 2005 to 2015 appears to have occurred in alternative work arrangements.The growing emphasis on \u201cshareholder value\u201d has provided additional justification for all of these anti-worker developments.Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at Wharton, wrote me that \u201cthe shareholder value movement starting in the late 1980s and now institutionalized through industry analysts\u201d was crucially important in the devaluation of employees:Accounting in business is mainly about costs. Finance people hate fixed costs because of the challenges they raise to share price valuation when there is uncertainty, and the biggest fixed costs are labor. Simply moving the same labor costs from employees to outside staffing companies moves it from one part of the accounting ledger to another and makes analysts happier.This mentality, in turn, encourages \u201cthe use of temps and contractors\u201d to fill high-wage jobs because \u201cthat way the employer doesn\u2019t have to raise wages for all their employees.\u201dHirsch, of the University of North Carolina, explained that the automobile industry provides the classic example of these trends:When that industry was dominated by the Big Three in Detroit, union organizing was relatively easy. The U.A.W. could organize all of the competitors by controlling most of the relatively generally homogeneous, geographically tight work force.Once \u201cautomakers in other countries, and now the South, made more inroads, the UAW\u2019s task became far more difficult,\u201d Hirsch argued, becauseCompanies could outsource work to areas with cheaper labor and less of a union presence. This both weakened the union and ramped up competitive pressure on the companies that were unionized. The result was fewer unions. This has obviously played out in many other industries.In addition, Hirsch pointed out,many union jobs are simply no longer in the U.S. Entire industries (e.g., textiles) were essentially moved offshore.The result is a \u201cdeath spiral effect,\u201d according to Hirsch:As membership declines unions are able to exert less influence. Moreover, as fewer employees have experience with unions or know others who have, it becomes harder to organize.The end of labor-management d\u00e9tente \u2014 and the emergence of a merciless assault by business and the Republican Party on workers\u2019 pay, security and bargaining strength \u2014 have been especially cruel to workers without college degrees.In their book, \u201cThe Second Machine Age,\u201d Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, both economists at M.I.T., don\u2019t hold out much hope for this broad class of workers:Rapid and accelerating digitization is likely to bring economic rather than environmental disruption, stemming from the fact that as computers get more powerful, companies have less need for some kinds of workers. Technological progress is going to leave behind some people, perhaps even a lot of people, as it races ahead.For those with special skills or the right education, they write, \u201cthere\u2019s never been a better time.\u201d For those \u201cwith only \u2018ordinary\u2019 skills and abilities to offer,\u201d however, \u201cthere\u2019s never been a worse time to be a worker.\u201dIn many cases, machines both substitute for and complement human labor. Focusing only on what is lost misses a central economic mechanism by which automation affects the demand for labor: raising the value of the tasks that workers uniquely supply.At a more concrete level, Krueger and Posner, in their Brookings paper, offer a series of well-thought out legal and regulatory reforms aimed at improving the bargaining power of workers.First, they would alter antitrust enforcement to require consideration of the likely effect of mergers on concentration in the labor market, in order to prevent \u201ctoo high a risk of wage suppression.\u201dIn the case of \u201cno-raid\u201d agreements between companies that bar participating businesses from making job offers to employees of competitors, Krueger and Posner would ban no-poaching arrangements altogether:We propose a per se rule against no-poaching agreements regardless of whether they are used outside or within franchises. In other words, no-poaching agreements would be considered illegal regardless of the circumstances of their use.The reality, of course, is that the Krueger-Posner proposals have no chance with President Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of both houses of Congress.For the time being, at least, the problems of the least skilled workers in the labor market will fester.In the 2016 election, Trump profited from the conviction of rural and working-class voters that they were on a downward trajectory. If anything, Trump appears to be gambling that letting those voters\u2019 lives continue to languish will work to his advantage in 2020.Trump campaigned as the ally of the white working class, but any notion that he would take its side as it faces off against employers is a gross misjudgment.His administration has turned the executive branch, the federal courts and the regulatory agencies into the sworn enemy of workers, organized and unorganized. Trump is indisputably indifferent to the plight of anyone in the bottom half of the income distribution: look at his appointments, look at his record in office, look back at his business career and look at the man himself.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Twitch, Amazon Tightens Grip on Live Streams of Video Games", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLate on a recent night, more than 600,000 people watched one of the most popular video game players, Tyler Blevins, engage in Fortnite Battle Royale with a celebrity guest: Drake.Drake was deferential to Mr. Blevins as they teamed up before an audience that peaked at roughly 667,000 viewers, a ratings record (since broken) for a nontournament live stream. As the game progressed, the world-famous rapper played a supporting role, collecting supplies for Ninja, seemingly content to lend a hand to a master at work.Like others who make significant money on Twitch, Mr. Blevins is a born talker, and he bantered with the fans as he and Drake played. Drake joined the conversation, too. He told the commenters that he liked pineapple on his pizza and explained that he was a Ninja fan before Twitch, back when Mr. Blevins, 27, first found fame among gamers on YouTube and Instagram.Streamlabs \u2014 a San Francisco tech company whose software allows viewers to tip streamers, giving the company insight into an opaque ecosystem \u2014 suggests that Amazon\u2019s lead may be all but insurmountable. Its data shows that, in the last quarter, the average number of people watching Twitch\u2019s streams at any given moment increased to 953,000, up from 788,000. Twitch\u2019s archrival, YouTube Gaming, averaged 272,000 concurrent viewers, down from 308,000 in the previous quarter, Streamlabs reported.YouTube pushed back against the data, but declined to provide numbers of its own. \u201cWe have truly gotten bigger every single month in live gaming, and live gaming viewership is up over two times, year over year,\u201d said Ryan Wyatt, a YouTube vice president in charge of gaming content. (Ali Moiz, the Streamlabs chief executive, stood by his company\u2019s report. \u201cThey should publish their data, if they think this is wrong,\u201d he said of YouTube.)Twitch began in 2011 as an offshoot of Justin.tv, a lifecasting site founded by two Yale graduates, Emmett Shear and Justin Kan. They started the platform after they found that viewers were more interested in watching their lifecasters play video games than eat or sleep. Big tech companies came courting, and Amazon beat out Google.In the four years since the sale, video gaming as a spectator sport has gone mainstream, and Twitch has captured the majority of those who want to watch it live.For the dedicated fans, the live, freewheeling sessions on Twitch have the appeal of a major sporting event crossed with a talk show. The interaction between the host and viewers is one key to the site\u2019s success, making for an involved viewing experience that is markedly different from the prerecorded and edited videos of game sessions that have long been popular on YouTube.On Twitch, the player\u2019s face, when visible, typically inhabits a small part of the screen, and the world of the video game takes center position. On the right side of the screen, endless comments from the viewers \u2014 mostly male, mostly young \u2014 appear in a continuous scroll.Craig Riches, who plays under the name PythonGB, has posted his Minecraft videos on YouTube proper since 2010. Despite his affiliation, he said the Amazon-owned site remained well ahead of Google\u2019s foray into live game-streaming.\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that YouTube Gaming is still playing catch-up to Twitch\u2019s platform,\u201d said Mr. Riches, 23.The hosts on Twitch, some of whom sign up exclusively with the platform in order to gain access to its moneymaking tools, are rewarded for their ability to make a connection with viewers as much as they are for their gaming prowess. Viewers who pay $4.99 a month for a basic subscription \u2014 the money is split evenly between the streamers and Twitch \u2014 are looking for immediacy and intimacy. While some hosts at YouTube Gaming offer a similar experience, they have struggled to build audiences as large, and as dedicated, as those on Twitch.\u201cYou have this really unique live interaction you don\u2019t get with YouTube videos,\u201d said Meg Kaylee, a streamer and host on GameStop TV who built her career playing various games on Twitch after starting on YouTube. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different experience.\u201dCiting Twitch\u2019s fervent audiences and the \u201cbetter job\u201d it does in communicating with talent, Ms. Kaylee, 20, added that she had never really considered signing up with YouTube Gaming.Facebook Live, Periscope and Mixer all grew quickly in the last quarter, according to Streamlabs, but none have approached the scale of Twitch. The number of those watching game streams on Facebook\u2019s platform, for instance, increased to 56,000 from 27,500, according to the firm\u2019s estimates.Even with the rise of live streaming, gamers have continued to do big business posting recorded videos on YouTube\u2019s main site, which reports 1.8 billion \u201clogged in\u201d users a month, across all types of content. That makes it much larger than Twitch, which claims around 100 million monthly viewers. Mr. Wyatt, the YouTube executive, noted the full scope of YouTube\u2019s gaming content, which includes the videos posted on the main site and the live streams on YouTube Gaming, in comparing it with the Amazon-owned platform.\u201cThe size and scale and businesses is not comparable from YouTube to Twitch,\u201d Mr. Wyatt said. \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve seen indicates that video-on-demand will be the biggest part of gaming content consumption.\u201dHe also pointed out that YouTube Gaming offered a different kind of programming: its live sessions last \u201ca couple hours at a time\u201d \u2014 a sharp contrast with the typical Twitch marathons.Still, YouTube created YouTube Gaming in direct response to Twitch. During its first few months, in 2015, the platform\u2019s hosts complained about the lack of ways to make money and asked for better tools for managing chat streams, which can easily descend into toxicity.\u201cIt took them a really long time to bring out basic features you would have on Twitch,\u201d said Cole Riness, a professional YouTuber who specializes in family-friendly gaming videos.YouTube has taken steps to address complaints. Most notably, as of April, its subscription systems \u2014 for live and recorded content \u2014 have been unified. As for support, Mr. Wyatt said, \u201cI would argue that we certainly have equivalent moderation tools to any other service on the market.\u201dOther challenges have proved more difficult for YouTube Gaming to solve. The site\u2019s copyright policing has frustrated some hosts, who have found themselves penalized, or even barred, because music was playing in the background of their sessions. Twitch has a reputation for being less punitive \u2014 or perhaps just less aware \u2014 where copyright issues are concerned.While YouTube has made millionaires out of the creators of popular videos through its advertising program, Twitch\u2019s hosts make money primarily from subscribers and one-off donations or tips. YouTube Gaming has made it possible for viewers to support hosts this way, but paying audiences haven\u2019t materialized at the scale they have on Twitch.Now that it seems well on its way to becoming synonymous with long-form live video gaming, Twitch\u2019s competitors may be running out of time to take their shot.Brandon Freytag, a former Twitch employee who is chief executive of Loaded, a talent agency that represents Mr. Blevins, said the most credible challenge to Twitch may come not from another tech company but from within. The most popular hosts, he noted, could be enticed to leave it for another platform, or create their own. They could also make demands of Twitch itself.The popularity of its stars is a force Twitch has yet to reckon with. For now, Mr. Freytag said, the calculus for hosts like Mr. Blevins is pretty simple: \u201cEveryone is on Twitch.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the screen name of Craig Riches. Mr. Riches goes by PythonGB, not PythonDB.A photo with an earlier version of this article was published in error.

{"Headline": "Want to Read Michael Lewis\u2019s Next Work? You\u2019ll Be Able to Listen to It First", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsWhen Michael Lewis had an idea for his next book, a contemporary political narrative, he decided he would test it out first as a 10,000-word magazine article, as he often does before committing to a yearslong project.But this time he made a surprising pivot. Instead of publishing the story in Vanity Fair, where he has been a contributing writer for nearly a decade, he sold it to Audible, the audiobook publisher and retailer.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to read it, you\u2019re only going to be able to listen to it,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cI\u2019ve become Audible\u2019s first magazine writer.\u201dMr. Lewis \u2014 arguably one of the most successful nonfiction writers working today, with book sales topping 10 million copies \u2014 is betting Audible will expand his audience and draw even more people to his work. Last month, he signed a multiyear contract with Audible for four audio original stories, with the first scheduled to come out in July. Mr. Lewis, who wouldn\u2019t reveal further details about the story, plans to narrate it himself.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to read\u201d his next book, Michael Lewis said. \u201cYou\u2019re only going to be able to listen to it.\u201dMr. Lewis is part of a growing group of A-list authors bypassing print and releasing audiobook originals, hoping to take advantage of the exploding audiobook market. It\u2019s the latest sign that audiobooks are no longer an appendage of print, but a creative medium in their own right. But the rise of stand-alone audio has also made some traditional publishers nervous, as Audible strikes deals directly with writers, including best-selling authors like the historian Robert Caro and the novelist Jeffery Deaver.After years of stagnation in the industry, audiobooks have become a rare bright spot for publishers. While e-book sales have fallen and print has remained anemic, publishers\u2019 revenue for downloaded audio has nearly tripled in the last five years, industry data from the Association of American Publishers shows. This has set off a new turf war over audio rights, pitting Audible, owned by Amazon, against traditional publishers, who are increasingly insisting on producing their own audiobooks, wary of ceding more territory and revenue to the online retailer. The battle over who will dominate the industry\u2019s fastest growing format is reshaping the publishing landscape, much as e-books did a decade ago, driving up advances for audio rights and leading some authors to sign straight-to-audio deals.\u201cNobody cares about the empty land until they discover oil on it,\u201d said the literary agent Russell Galen, who represents best-selling authors like Cassandra Clare and Diana Gabaldon. \u201cAll of the sudden, print publishers are fighting over audio.\u201dAudible, the biggest player with more than 425,000 titles in its online store, has an enormous advantage in this increasingly crowded arena. Amazon has been pushing audiobooks on its platform, listing them as \u201cfree\u201d with a trial Audible membership, which costs $15 a month, and includes a book each month. (The typical price of la carte audiobooks ranges from around $15 to $40 depending on the length.) The company is increasingly looking for new ways not just to sell audiobooks, but to create them independently from publishers, driving their profit margins even higher.\u201cAmazon\u2019s position in the digital audio market is even more dominant and unshakable than its position was in the e-book market,\u201d said Michael Cader, a book industry analyst and the founder of Publishers Marketplace. \u201cThey\u2019re virtually unchallenged.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re scripting to this new aesthetic,\u201d said Donald Katz, Audible\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a full fledged media category before, it was a tiny little Siberia stuck in book publishing, and it shouldn\u2019t have been.\u201dAudible has been aggressively courting authors to create exclusive works for them, dangling six-figure advances that rival what major publishing houses pay. Forthcoming originals include a memoir by the comedian and actor David Spade; an original children\u2019s book by Jack Gantos, author of the popular Joey Pigza series; five new science fiction novels by Dennis E. Taylor; and a new science fiction novella by the best-selling novelist John Scalzi, a follow-up to his audio original \u201cThe Dispatcher.\u201dMr. Scalzi said he decided to write an audio original in part because he\u2019s seen audiobook sales of his books mushroom, overtaking his digital and hardcover sales. He pointed to his 2014 novel, \u201cLock In,\u201d which he said sold 22,500 hardcovers, 24,000 e-books and 41,000 audiobooks.\u201cYou have to go where the market is, and you can\u2019t just give them the same old thing,\u201d he said.Mel Robbins made a similar calculation after her self-help book, \u201cThe 5 Second Rule,\u201d sold hundreds of thousands of copies in audio, four times what it sold in print. In May, she released her latest book as an audio original.For decades, the audiobook market was limited by physical constraints: Listeners had to lug around cassette tapes or CDs, and bookstores devoted fewer and fewer shelves to the format. Digital technology upended that. Cellphones now function as audiobook players. People who felt they had little time to read are now listening while they commute, exercise or do chores. Consumers bought nearly 90 million audiobooks in 2016, up from 42 million in 2012, driving audiobook sales up to $2.1 billion, according to the Audio Publishers Association.Publishers have jump-started production of titles in what was once a sleepy and overlooked format, investing in elaborate, multi-cast productions and building new recording studios.In the last five years, Hachette has doubled the number of audiobooks it produces; it will release around 700 titles this year. Penguin Random House will put out roughly 1,200 audio titles, up from 652 in 2014, and now has 15 recording studios. Macmillan Audio will release 470 audiobooks this year, a 46 percent increase over 2017. Two of the company\u2019s biggest recent hits are the audiobooks for James Comey\u2019s \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d which has sold more than 167,000 copies, and Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d which sold about 320,000.With publishers holding on to more of their audiobook rights, Audible has started approaching agents and authors directly to buy audio rights before book proposals even get submitted to publishers.The company has also teamed up with smaller publishing houses to go after big books in competitive auctions, paying a substantial amount for audio rights. Last year, Audible partnered with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which doesn\u2019t have an audio division, to buy \u201cWild Game,\u201d a memoir by Adrienne Brodeur, which reportedly sold for seven figures after a competitive auction involving 14 publishers. Audible and Houghton Mifflin also jointly acquired a forthcoming memoir by the Olympic snowboarder Shaun White, which will be released in audio a month before the print edition is published this November.Ellen Archer, president of HMH Trade Publishing, said she expects the audio release will boost print sales, rather than cannibalizing them. \u201cThe marketing muscle they\u2019re going to put behind this book is going to drive interest in the print version,\u201d she said.Last fall, in a highly unusual deal, Audible prevailed in an auction against several major publishing houses for rights to a new nonfiction book by Ada Calhoun, author of \u201cSt. Marks Is Dead.\u201d The book, about how Generation X women are struggling with middle age, grew out of an Oprah online article Ms. Calhoun wrote that went viral and prompted offers from multiple publishers. Audible outbid them all, with a high six-figure advance for audio, print and digital rights, according to two publishing executives with knowledge of the deal.Ms. Calhoun was surprised to find herself swayed by Audible\u2019s pitch. \u201cI come out of print publishing, so I thought, you do the print book and then you do the audiobook, but then I got excited about the possibility of doing it as a different form,\u201d she said.Ms. Calhoun isn\u2019t worried about whether or not the book ever appears in print. \u201cI\u2019m in it for the original audio,\u201d she said.David Blum, who joined Audible from Amazon in 2016 to oversee its originals, said it can be challenging to convince authors who have made their careers in print to take a risk by working in a medium that\u2019s still evolving.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to break down the boundaries of what people think content ought to look like,\u201d Mr. Blum said.More writers are coming around to the concept. Audible\u2019s recent deal with Mr. Lewis represents the company\u2019s biggest victory to date in its effort to recruit prominent writers.Mr. Lewis, author of the best-sellers \u201cMoneyball,\u201d \u201cThe Big Short\u201d and \u201cThe Blind Side,\u201d will continue to release his print books with W. W. Norton, but he will publish his long form journalism with Audible rather than Vanity Fair, he said. His audio originals may be adapted and expanded into print, but Audible will have exclusive rights for several months.He\u2019s also eager to experiment with a new literary medium.\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the test of having to tell a story,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m doing it is I think it\u2019s going to make me a better writer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "IBM Unveils System That \u2018Debates\u2019 With Humans", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A match between an Israeli college debate champion and a loquacious IBM computer program demonstrated on Monday new gains in the quest for computers that can hold conversations with humans. It also led to an unlikely question for the tech industry\u2019s deep thinkers: Can a machine talk too much?At an IBM office in downtown San Francisco, Noa Ovadia, a college senior who won an Israeli championship in 2016, squared off with IBM\u2019s program, called the IBM Debater.She argued against government subsidies for space exploration. The machine argued in favor, delivering three brief speeches in a digitally created monotone and \u2014 at least in small ways \u2014 responding to Ms. Ovadia\u2019s human opinions.\u201cAnother point that I believe my opponent made is that there are more important things than space exploration to spend money on,\u201d the machine said during its lengthy rebuttal. \u201cIt is very easy to say there are more important things to spend money on, and I do not dispute this. No one is claiming that this is the only item on our expense list.\u201dUnder development for six years, this artificial intelligence system is part of a broader effort to build technology that can interact with people the way we interact with one another.Companies like Google, Amazon and Apple have for several years offered coffee table gadgets and smartphone apps that answer simple questions or perform simple tasks. (\u201cHey, Siri. Set my alarm for 7 a.m. tomorrow.\u201d)Projects like IBM Debater and Google Duplex show that this kind of system is starting to stretch beyond simple commands. But they also demonstrate the limitations of current technology.IBM\u2019s system was designed to debate about 100 topics, but these interactions are tightly constrained: a four-minute opening statement followed by a rebuttal to its opponent\u2019s argument \u2014 and then a statement summing up its own viewpoint. It was not exactly Lincoln v. Douglas.Subsidized space exploration, the machine said during its opening statement, \u201cinspires our children to pursue education and careers in science and technology and mathematics.\u201d\u201cIt is more important than good roads or improved schools or better health care,\u201d it added.Noam Slonim, an IBM researcher who helped oversee the project, estimated that the technology could have a \u201cmeaningful\u201d debate on those 100 topics 40 percent of the time. IBM chose the topic for the live debate before it began. In some cases, the machine\u2019s lengthy speeches hinted at how it was stitching together its arguments \u2014 identifying relevant sentences and clauses and then combining them into a reasonably coherent, computerized thought.In 2011, IBM demonstrated a system that could beat the leading players at the trivia game show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d The company used this system, called Watson, as a way of promoting a wide range of products and consulting services for hospitals and other businesses.After Watson won, Mr. Slonim, a researcher at an IBM lab in Haifa, Israel, pitched the Debater project as IBM\u2019s next \u201cgrand challenge.\u201dBut the project reflects the recent acceleration of research related to \u201cnatural language understanding,\u201d the effort to build machines that can understand the natural way we humans talk and respond in kind. As this research progresses, it can provide new ways for computers to digest and process information or even lead to machines that can hold a completely convincing conversation.This sort of technology would have a wide range of uses. It could help businesses filter hot-button issues on social media. Or it could provide governments with a more effective way of censoring information.Understanding natural language is such a complex and difficult task, systems like IBM Debater lean on a wide range of systems, each handling a different part of the problem. One system will identify information that helps fuel an argument on one side of the debate. Another will generate the text of the argument. And so on.In recent years, researchers have significantly improved systems that recognize people and objects, identify spoken words and translate between languages.But understanding language is far more complex. That means systems that perform fairly simple language tasks \u2014 like writing a Wikipedia article, let alone engaging in a serious debate on a random topic \u2014 may still be years away.\u201cIt is now very obvious this change is happening,\u201d said Jeremy Howard, an independent researcher working in this area. \u201cBut these things take time.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted the IBM Debater, a computer program that participated in a debate with an Israeli college senior on June 18. During an exchange, the program said, \u201cIt is very easy to say there are more important things to spend money on, and I do not dispute this,\u201d not \u201cI dispute this.\u201dCade Metz reported from San Francisco, and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Are Hitting Highs as Economic Uncertainty Rises", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors have returned to the safety and growth of the biggest technology stocks.Five big tech companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Nvidia \u2014 closed at historic highs on Tuesday. Alibaba and Facebook have done the same in recent days. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has returned to record territory, up 8 percent since the end of April. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26.The rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain. Fears of a trade war have made investors anxious; emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies have all sold off; and economic data in some regions has softened in recent weeks.\u201cIn an uncertain world with significant downside economic tail risks, technology has been seen to be, correctly, relatively stable,\u201d Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson, strategists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.Such economic uneasiness in the years since the financial crisis had caused investors to pour money into the sector. The likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have come to be viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver growth in most economic conditions. With interest rates at historic lows and economic growth lackluster, investors have found that appealing.In March, some of the best-performing tech stocks began to struggle. Facebook\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech companies and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms.The pullback was a rare dip for a sector that had risen consistently for the past several years. Since stock markets in the United States bottomed out in March 2009, shares of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet have all gained more than 500 percent; Netflix is up 6,500 percent. The S.&P. 500 has risen about 300 percent over that period.How long can the biggest tech stocks dominate the market? For a while, Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson said. They pointed out that earnings and sales growth, not a speculative increase in valuations, have driven the post-financial crisis run-up.\u201cUnlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson wrote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tech Companies Conquered America\u2019s Cities", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtI\u2019m not saying America\u2019s cities are turning into dystopian technocapitalist hellscapes in which corporations operate every essential service and pull every civic string.But let\u2019s take a tour of recent news from the metropolises.O.K., so maybe I am saying that America\u2019s cities are turning into dystopian technocapitalist hellscapes.Into this void march the techies, who come bearing money, jobs and promises of out-of-this-world innovation. But there\u2019s a catch. Corporations are getting wide latitude in determining the future of cities. They are controlling more key services and winning important battles with once-indomitable city governments. Local officials find themselves at the mercy of tech: They can\u2019t live without tech money, even if tech interests have a way of eclipsing every other civic priority.How did tech companies become America\u2019s most-powerful local power brokers?Here are some reasons.One reason tech companies can command greater say in local issues is that many other local institutions, from small businesses to local newspapers, have lost much of their influence \u2014 thanks, in large part, to the internet.\u201cWhen the framers of the Constitution designed the American political system, they assumed that people would care a lot more about local issues that were tangible and concrete than they would care about the distant ways of Washington,\u201c Mr. Hopkins said. \u201cContemporary American politics is exactly the opposite \u2014 we are focused on the spectacle far away.\u201dThe \u201ckey question for voters is always their national loyalties,\u201d Mr. Hopkins said. There\u2019s much less room for voting based on what\u2019s happening nearby.What does this have to do with tech companies? While the fall of local media undermined interest in local issues, tech companies began to notice that their platforms gave them direct access to new levers of local influence. And they began to deploy those levers to withering effect.Uber wrote the script. Travis Kalanick, the ride-hailing company\u2019s founder and now-ousted chief executive, pushed into dozens of cities without asking permission. In many cities, the pushback was intense \u2014 Uber was disrupting local taxi cartels that had spent decades building their own political power base.But what Uber lacked in political support it made up for in local popularity. Through its app, the company had a direct connection to thousands of riders and drivers who were making a living from its service.The plan worked beautifully. In New York in 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio floated a proposal to cap Uber\u2019s growth. The mayor had the support of most of the City Council; Uber\u2019s fight looked impossible.You might argue that this is all to the good: Cities are drowning in red tape, local leaders are naturally averse to change, and tech companies are doing exactly what innovative companies should do. Shouldn\u2019t we be celebrating these innovators?Which was all by design. The scooter companies were just following Travis\u2019s Law. In Santa Monica, Bird\u2019s scooters appeared on city streets in September. Lawmakers balked; in December, the city filed a nine-count criminal complaint against Bird.If you love the scooters, you see nothing wrong with this. But there was a time, in America, when the government paid for infrastructure and the public had a say in important local services. With Ubers ruling the roads, Birds ruling the sidewalks, Elon Musk running our subways and Domino\u2019s paving our roads, that age is gone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Gave Data Access to Chinese Firm Flagged by U.S. Intelligence", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has data-sharing partnerships with at least four Chinese electronics companies, including a manufacturing giant that has a close relationship with China\u2019s government, the social media company said on Tuesday.The agreements, which date to at least 2010, gave private access to some user data to Huawei, a telecommunications equipment company that has been flagged by American intelligence officials as a national security threat, as well as to Lenovo, Oppo and TCL.The four partnerships remain in effect, but Facebook officials said in an interview that the company would wind down the Huawei deal by the end of the week.The deals were part of an effort to push more mobile users onto the social network starting in 2007, before stand-alone Facebook apps worked well on phones. The agreements allowed device makers to offer some Facebook features, such as address books, \u201clike\u201d buttons and status updates.Facebook officials said the agreements with the Chinese companies allowed them access similar to what was offered to BlackBerry, which could retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends \u2014 including religious and political leanings, work and education history and relationship status.Huawei used its private access to feed a \u201csocial phone\u201d app that let users view messages and social media accounts in one place, according to the officials.Facebook representatives said the data shared with Huawei stayed on its phones, not the company\u2019s servers.Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican who leads the Commerce Committee, has demanded that Facebook provide Congress with details about its data partnerships. \u201cFacebook is learning hard lessons that meaningful transparency is a high standard to meet,\u201d Mr. Thune said.His committee also oversees the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating Facebook to determine whether the company\u2019s data policies violate a 2011 consent decree with the commission.\u201cI look forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that information about their users was not sent to Chinese servers,\u201d said Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.\u201cAll Facebook\u2019s integrations with Huawei, Lenovo, Oppo and TCL were controlled from the get-go \u2014 and Facebook approved everything that was built,\u201d said Francisco Varela, a Facebook vice president. \u201cGiven the interest from Congress, we wanted to make clear that all the information from these integrations with Huawei was stored on the device, not on Huawei\u2019s servers.\u201dBanned in China since 2009, Facebook in recent years has quietly sought to re-establish itself there. The company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has tried to cultivate a relationship with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and put in an appearance at one of the country\u2019s top universities.Still, Facebook has struggled to gain momentum, and in January an executive in charge of courting China\u2019s government left after spending three years on a charm campaign to get the social media service back in the country.None of the Chinese device makers who have partnerships with Facebook responded to requests for comment on Tuesday.Huawei, one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world, is a point of national pride for China and is at the vanguard of the country\u2019s efforts to expand its influence abroad. The company was the recipient of billions of dollars in lines of credit from China\u2019s state-owned policy banks, helping to fuel its overseas expansion in Africa, Europe and Latin America. Its founder, Ren Zhengfei, is a former engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army.United States officials are investigating whether Huawei broke American trade controls by dealing with Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. The Trump administration has taken aim at Huawei and its rival ZTE in recent weeks, and in April the Federal Communications Commission advanced a plan to bar federally subsidized telecom companies from using suppliers that are considered national security threats.Facebook has not entered into a data-sharing agreement with ZTE, officials at the social network said.TCL, a consumer electronics firm, has accused the Trump administration of bias against Chinese companies and last June dropped a bid to buy a San Diego-based company that makes routers and other hardware.Lenovo, a maker of computers and other devices, recently shelved ambitions to acquire BlackBerry after the Canadian government signaled that such a deal could compromise national security.Nicholas Confessore, Michael Forsythe and Paul Mozur contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "They\u2019re Not \u2018Mad Men\u2019 Anymore. But the Ad Business Is Still High Stakes.", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Once upon a time, everyday America was fascinated by the advertising business, in somewhat the way that the turkey is fascinated by the ax. It began in the 1930s and \u201940s, when sellers of consumer products and their ad agencies controlled the contents of the radio programming to which the nation listened. Comedians turned advertisers \u2014 and the denizens of Madison Avenue who worked for those brands \u2014 into grist for their mills. In \u201cA Word From Our Sponsor: Admen, Advertising, and the Golden Age of Radio,\u201d Cynthia B. Meyers recalls a joke from a Jack Benny show in 1948, a show sponsored by Lucky Strike: When Benny told his wife, Mary Livingstone, that he was calling the cigarette\u2019s ad agency, Batten Barton Durstine & Osborn, she replied, \u201cSounds like a trunk falling down stairs.\u201dElsewhere in popular culture, there were novels and movies \u2014 and novels made into movies \u2014 about the ad game and those who played it, among them \u201cTake a Letter, Darling,\u201d \u201cLaura,\u201d \u201cThe Hucksters,\u201d \u201cMr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,\u201d \u201cWill Success Spoil Rock Hunter?,\u201d \u201cLover Come Back,\u201d \u201cThe Thrill of It All,\u201d \u201cGood Neighbor Sam\u201d and \u201cThe Arrangement.\u201d On television, there was \u201cBewitched\u201d and, whenever characters in \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d were especially anxious to flee the rat race, Rod Serling made sure, in episodes like \u201cA Stop in Willoughby\u201d and \u201cWalking Distance,\u201d that they worked in advertising.The nonfiction best-seller lists were filled with ad books, from \u201cThe Hidden Persuaders\u201d and \u201cMadison Avenue, U.S.A.\u201d to \u201cConfessions of an Advertising Man\u201d and \u201cFrom Those Wonderful Folks Who Gave You Pearl Harbor: Front Line Dispatches From the Advertising War.\u201d And versions of TV commercial jingles \u2014 for products like Alka-Seltzer, Diet Pepsi and Coca-Cola \u2014 made the pop-music hit parade. (Fun fact: The original \u201cHit Parade\u201d was created by an ad agency, Lord & Thomas, for Lucky Strike.)This widespread infatuation with advertising appears, in retrospect, to have peaked around 1971 with the spot that inspired one of those hits, the \u201cHilltop\u201d commercial for Coke, a.k.a. \u201cI\u2019d Like to Teach the World to Sing.\u201d It\u2019s been downhill from there. For one thing, the process by which the professionals sell us soft drinks, soap and soup ceased to be a novelty. And the switch in the \u201970s from the \u201cbrought to you by\u201d sponsorship model of radio to the magazine-style, multiple-ad format of TV transformed advertisers from benign patrons into interruptive annoyances. Besides, other industries became shinier objects in the public\u2019s eye, particularly Wall Street and Silicon Valley.One could make the case that technology has assumed the place in the zeitgeist that advertising once occupied \u2014 and then some. The most recent TV series set in an ad agency, \u201cThe Crazy Ones,\u201d lasted a season; \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d has been renewed for a sixth season. (Yes, there was \u201cMad Men,\u201d from 2007 to 2015, but one of its main accomplishments was to remind us that Madison Avenue meant more then than now.) There have been other efforts to rekindle the American appetite for all things advertising, but none has truly broken through.Now comes another attempt, from Ken Auletta, the prolific media reporter, critic and best-selling author, with \u201cFrenemies: The Epic Disruption of the Ad Business (and Everything Else).\u201d The title comes from a word popularized by Martin Sorrell, formerly the chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s largest advertising and marketing holding company; he started referring to Google as a \u201cfrenemy\u201d of WPP\u2019s in that they do business together (friend) at the same time they compete against each other (enemy). For those who wince at the characterization of the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon as \u201cfrenemies\u201d of the ad industry, be thankful; according to hbr.org, Sorrell also used the word \u201cfroes\u201d to describe that love-hate relationship.Sorrell is a principal figure in \u201cFrenemies,\u201d which seeks to rebuild interest in Madison Avenue by borrowing interest from Silicon Valley. It\u2019s not unlike how advertisers themselves borrow interest, hiring celebrities to endorse products or devoting ads to buzzed-about subjects like a royal wedding. Auletta posits that few industries have been \u201cconvulsed by change\u201d as much as advertising, which, as a result, is \u201cfacing fundamental challenges to its existence.\u201dIt may be a mug\u2019s game to figure out which industry has suffered the deepest damage at the hands of Silicon Valley; if you\u2019re reading this in print, you\u2019re holding another example of a business under siege. But Auletta works hard to get us to care about the fate of ad folks, despite our diminished interest in them or our distaste for what they do, because of their essential role as suppliers of the dollars that fuel the media ecosystem. If you \u201cfollow the money,\u201d he writes, you\u2019ll understand the importance of advertising and the significance of the threats against it, and maybe value it more, or at least disdain it less.Auletta surveys the tumultuous, treacherous ad landscape through the framework of frenemies. Not only are Madison Avenue and Silicon Valley frenemies, but so, too, he declares, are ad agencies and their marketer clients; agencies and media companies; traditional and digital media companies; agencies and consultancies like Accenture and McKinsey; agencies and software firms like Adobe and Salesforce.com; and, perhaps most telling, advertising and consumers. The easier it becomes for the public to zip, zap through and avoid interruptive ads \u2014 through innovative technology like ad blockers and streaming video \u2014 the madder, and more anxious, the mad men (and women) grow.Yet as dire as their fate looks, some flowers bloom amid the gloom, taking the edge off the book\u2019s pessimism. A respected industry strategist, Rishad Tobaccowala, tells Auletta: \u201cPeople say we are dinosaurs. We are not dinosaurs. We are cockroaches. Everybody hates us. Nobody likes to see us. But cockroaches have outlived everyone. We scurry out of corners. We soldier on and hire people with different skill sets.\u201dAuletta details the adaptive behavior \u2014 new types of agencies; reviving the sponsorship model; embracing data-driven, two-way marketing based on individualized relationships \u2014 while suggesting that, at the biggest ad conglomerates like WPP, the money for such substantive changes exists thanks to still-respectable margins (\u201ca relatively robust 15 or so percent\u201d). And he weaves into his narrative evidence of the wealth the business can still produce.For instance, one conglomerate\u2019s chief executive \u201cspends much of the year at his home in Palm Beach.\u201d The leader of a large agency has a \u201cglassed weekend home perched on 200 acres overlooking the Hudson River\u201d along with an \u201c8,000-square-foot Chelsea loft.\u201d And a well-known industry consultant sells his company for potentially as much as $207 million, hosts a $400,000 dinner at Cannes, buys a Tesla, gets rock-star treatment at his favorite restaurants and arrives at a meeting \u201csporting his Christmas tan from Turks and Caicos.\u201d There are martinis aplenty scattered among the pages of \u201cFrenemies,\u201d lending a nostalgic touch to the forward-facing proceedings.Alas, \u201cFrenemies\u201d can\u2019t avoid a pitfall common to such topical books, in that some of what\u2019s chronicled has been overtaken by events between writing and publication. The most notable example: In the book, Sorrell is \u201csecure\u201d in his top role at WPP and \u201cunlikely to step down anytime soon\u201d \u2014 but he did, suddenly, in mid-April, after an internal investigation into alleged misconduct. It\u2019s disconcerting, given how much Sorrell figures in \u201cFrenemies,\u201d to read of him telling Auletta, \u201cI will stay here until they shoot me!\u201d It\u2019s ameliorated, though, by a newsy tidbit: Several years ago he negotiated \u201cto sell WPP to Warren Buffett, but they did not see eye to eye and the discussions amicably collapsed.\u201dThat\u2019s a shame, if only because it\u2019s fun to imagine how Buffett \u2014 whose holdings at Berkshire Hathaway include Geico \u2014 might have approached the ad business: \u201cMarketers, save 15 percent on your campaigns with Geico WPP.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.\u201dAt Silicon Valley companies including Google, Apple and Facebook, employees have in recent days circulated internal emails asking for donations to nonprofit groups that support immigrants. Many have shared information about protests in San Francisco and Washington.

I\u2019ll have a whole life to live with this wealth.\u201dSome are obvious, including the No. 1 reason: \u201cThey pay themselves first.\u201d Many are humorous, like No. 26: \u201cThey buy the right watch, not the bright watch.\u201dBut others are meant to make you think about the wealth you have, however it was accumulated. The No. 5 reason: \u201cThey know the difference between someone that makes a lot of money and someone that is wealthy.\u201d No. 40: \u201cThey know the next generation is watching.\u201d No. 49: \u201cTheir money is patient.\u201dEven though most athletes make the bulk of their fortune in their 20s, Mr. McLean said, the list applies to all of his clients who had great success taking risks but whose rewards came inconsistently. This is a group that has already excelled beyond expectations, so it doesn\u2019t think it will make the bad financial decisions others make.\u201cWhat I realized is, you cannot scare the one-in-a-million guy who already beat the odds,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t give them the stats about athletes going broke, because they say, \u2018That\u2019s not going to be me.\u2019 Everyone already told them they weren\u2019t going to make it.\u201dInstead, Mr. McLean talks to them about money basics to shore up their finances: paying off debt, paying attention to their credit score, knowing whom they should help and trust and whom they shouldn\u2019t.Ms. Levinson, who is married to a novelist and has two children, is a client of Mr. McLean\u2019s. She said the impetus for her to think more deeply about her finances was the death of her mother two years ago. Her father, Richard Levinson, a television writer who became a co-creator of shows like \u201cColumbo\u201d and \u201cMurder, She Wrote,\u201d died when she was a teenager.\u201cThe security that is parents went away,\u201d she said. And it left her asking: \u201cHow do I protect what my parents left me, and how do I plan responsibly?\u201dMs. Levinson said she wanted to know how to plan for the money she would be earning.\u201cI work in an industry that fluctuates month to month,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked steadily for 20 years, but things change. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m not passionate about something for a while. Do we have enough in the coffer so I never have to take a job out of necessity?\u201dShe has a financial cushion, but she said she did not want to whittle it down and be stuck later on \u2014 or not be able to provide for her children the way her parents provided for her.\u201cI want to make sure I\u2019m not foolishly spending in one direction at the expense of another,\u201d Ms. Levinson said. \u201cI also worry that the first thing to go is joy, which is travel. That\u2019s the stuff that is so easy to cut, but it\u2019s essential\u201d for work.Her strategy is to take certain tempting but risky investments off the table. \u201cIf you can drink it, drive it, eat it or wear it, you probably shouldn\u2019t invest in it,\u201d she said Mr. McLean had told her.At the same time, Ms. Levinson has started to think of her financial decisions as pros and cons, not yes-or-no decisions. For instance, she almost invested in a restaurant but decided against it because she had other financial commitments that outweighed the investment.For people starting their career, the choices are more pressing.Carlos Ortiz, a professional golfer who has bounced between the developmental Web.com Tour and the PGA Tour, said that after a stellar first year in 2014, when he won $600,000, he did not want to squander his winnings.\u201cFor me, it was a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do with it. I still had it in my student account. I didn\u2019t even have a credit card.\u201dMr. Ortiz said he had learned to prioritize what he needed over what he wanted. One priority was a house in Dallas to be his home base, and he made sure he bought one that he could afford. Another was being modest with flashy expenses, like cars and watches.\u201cIn some years, you make a lot of money and can\u2019t spend it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other years, you\u2019re losing money.\u201dGolfers are more like freelance workers than star basketball players: If they don\u2019t have lucrative endorsements, their income is solely what they earn on the course, minus all of their expenses.Mr. Ortiz\u2019s first three years were great, and he made it onto the PGA Tour. But when he did not win enough money, he lost his playing privileges and went back to the less-lucrative developmental tour, which he said offered winnings that were about a tenth what they were on the PGA Tour.Now, he said, he is concentrating on saving, having enough insurance and being prepared for the financial demands of being a new father. \u201cIf you\u2019re short of money, it puts a lot of extra pressure on your game,\u201d he said.Yet extra money can exert a different pressure. Mr. Thompson\u2019s salary information is available on the internet, which he said had elicited a slew of financial pitches. So he learned to use his adviser as a shield, funneling all the solicitations to him for vetting.It comes from a sense of understanding his strengths and weaknesses. \u201cI know basketball,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to learn more about the business world.\u201dMr. McLean shares a saying to get his clients to the point of managing their money better: \u201cWith great abundance comes less discipline.\u201dIt sounds like a mangled proverb, but Mr. McLean said it was meant to show his most successful clients that they needed to pay attention to their money the way they focused on the skills that had made them rich.\u201cThe wealthy were disciplined enough to make the money,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t always have a plan to maintain it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Chen, your personal tech columnist, and I\u2019m here to guide you through the week\u2019s tech news.Let me get this off my chest: Does anyone else feel that Amazon is slowly taking over the world?Amazon seems well aware that people are so unaccustomed to getting discounts at Whole Foods that they will exchange data about their grocery shopping habits for a few cents. The other day, I scanned the bar code at Whole Foods and shaved a dollar off my $56 grocery bill. Maybe in a few months, I\u2019ll save up enough to get a free bottle of kale juice.The purchase is expected to close in the second half of 2018. So pretty soon, when you\u2019re restocking your home with diapers, dog food and trash bags on Amazon, you may also be able to refill your drug prescriptions.It\u2019s another effort by Amazon to build out its own delivery logistics. The company already runs Amazon Flex, a program that pays people $18 to $25 an hour to deliver packages from their own cars.So can Amazon do a better job at delivering packages than services like FedEx, United Parcel Service or the United States Postal Service? I guess we\u2019ll find out.Other stuff:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Race for Governor, How Far Left Is Colorado Willing to Go?", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 Jared Polis, a leading Democratic candidate for Colorado governor, walked into the home of a prominent marijuana entrepreneur for a campaign event recently, wearing a suit and bright blue sneakers. He circled a room of voters, wound his way past the margarita machine and then fired off his vision for Colorado.Single-payer health care. An all-renewable electric grid. State-funded full-day preschool.The crowd showered him with applause. \u201cSupport the man,\u201d said a host, Scott Durrah, 53, \u201cbecause we really need him.\u201dThese changes have helped foster a parallel political shift, and in the last five years Colorado has legalized marijuana, passed major gun restrictions and put a single-payer health care system on the ballot. Just this month, Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, ordered the state to pursue California-style emissions standards, making Colorado the first interior state to do so.By many measures, Colorado is shifting blue. Now, with Mr. Hickenlooper term-limited and eight candidates from two parties angling to replace him, the question is just how far left this frontier state wants to go.Mr. Polis, a wealthy congressman from Boulder who made his millions in e-commerce, is one of four Democrats seeking to replace Mr. Hickenlooper, whose trademark has been political moderation. (Mr. Hickenlooper is weighing a bid for president.)If Mr. Polis is successful, he would be the country\u2019s first openly gay man to serve as governor, and he could bring his husband and their two children to this city\u2019s hilltop Executive Mansion \u2014 an idea that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.But Mr. Polis, 43, is attempting a win in a state whose east and west flanks run deep red, home to influential conservative organizations like Focus on the Family; a powerful fossil fuel industry; and a faction so fervently pro-Trump that in the last election it splintered from the Republican establishment to form a group called the Mesa County Deplorables.Portions of the state are famously tax averse, and in 2016, even as the majority of voters favored Hillary Clinton, the proposal for single-payer health care failed miserably at the ballot. Four of the last five governors have been Democrats, but moderates have long charted the state\u2019s course.As it stands, Colorado has one million registered Democrats, one million registered Republicans and 1.2 million unaffiliated voters, making for a nail-biter of an election year. For the first time in state history, those undeclared voters can participate in the June 26 primary, and the number of votes returned this month will be an early sign of the state\u2019s political direction.\u201cHickenlooper would never have campaigned on that kind of overt: \u2018Let\u2019s raid the revenue box,\u2019\u201d said Alan Salazar, a former chief strategy officer to the governor, noting that Mr. Polis could be a tough sell. \u201cJared is perceived, I think, as a lot more liberal.\u201dBut Mr. Hickenlooper was elected in 2010. That was before the state\u2019s galloping economic growth, before Donald J. Trump awoke a liberal resistance.When the governor took office, the state was in recession, with unemployment near double digits, jitters about exiting businesses and thousands of families tossed out of their homes by foreclosure.These days, the question is not how to grow, but how to pay for all these new people. Roads are crumbling, schools are starved for funds, and rural communities say all this metro-area expansion is sucking them of water and money.\u201cYou rest on your laurels at your own peril,\u201d said Mr. Hickenlooper in an interview at the state\u2019s gold-domed Capitol. His fear, he added, is that \u201cwe will strangle on our success.\u201dOf course, not everyone is interested in solutions put forth by Democrats like Mr. Polis, which include a change to a longstanding state law that limits the amount of tax revenue the state can collect. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than moving blue,\u201d said Jon Caldara, who leads the Independence Institute, a Denver-based libertarian think tank. \u201cWe\u2019re turning into California.\u201dThe best-known Republican candidate, Walker Stapleton, 44, the state treasurer, is promoting himself as a supporter of the president\u2019s tax plan while promising to yank funds from sanctuary cities. Apparently hoping to avoid scrutiny ahead of the primary \u2014 he has three lesser-known challengers \u2014 he has skipped some debates and repeatedly dodged reporters.When he does appear, he often saves his fire for Mr. Polis: \u201cThe issues that matter are: What is Jared Polis going to do to the economic future of Colorado?\u201d he said.But a Polis primary victory is far from certain, despite the $11 million the congressman has poured into his own campaign.His Democratic challengers include Cary Kennedy, 50, a former state treasurer who would be the state\u2019s first female governor if elected; and Mike Johnston, 43, a Spanish-speaking former state senator and principal who once ran a school in a juvenile prison.Ms. Kennedy has made education the center of her campaign, promoting her role in writing a constitutional amendment that sought to raise funds for Colorado schools. She has the backing of the state\u2019s energized teachers\u2019 unions, and educators have come out in droves to stump for her. \u201cWe\u2019re crazy for Cary!\u201d yelled one at a recent event at her campaign headquarters.A handwritten sign on the wall warned her male challengers. \u201cSpoiler alert: Women don\u2019t give up.\u201dBoth Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Johnston are pushing progressive plans for renewable energy and school funding, while supporting bans on assault weapons. But they have stopped short of measures put forth by Mr. Polis, like the creation of a state single-payer health care system.Mr. Johnston in particular has tried to pitch himself as the only Democrat who can win statewide, traveling rural roads in cowboy boots and delivering Obamaesque speeches about the nation\u2019s imperiled \u201cpromise of equality.\u201dOn a recent afternoon at his campaign office, he leapt over a fence like a rodeo star before delivering a speech to a sea of voters.\u201cIn the moment when people are lost, we are going to light a lantern out here on the Continental Divide,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the rest of the country can\u2019t lead us there right now, Colorado can lead first.\u201dAcross the street, Barry Castile, 56, was playing in the yard with his granddaughters Heaven and Harmony. \u201cThat\u2019s my No. 1 man,\u201d he said, motioning toward the campaign office.Mr. Castile, who owned a car detail business before a back injury, said the region\u2019s sharply rising rent had just about convinced him to leave.But before doing that, he was going to vote for Mr. Johnston. \u201cThis city has changed a lot. A whole lot. And it\u2019s just gotten outrageous for us.\u201dAll of the candidates are trying to address this central anxiety: How does Colorado, long fertile ground for the everyman\u2019s Western dreams, remain a place for the average American?\u201cI love the mountains. It feels safe \u2014 it was a good place to raise a family,\u201d said Jami Fries, 30, an undecided voter. \u201cThat appeal has started to fade.\u201dMr. Polis, sitting on the front porch after his campaign event, said he believes he is the one to take on that challenge.Blue Mountain sold for $780 million. Another online business, ProFlowers, went for $470 million.Mr. Polis has since bankrolled his way from the state board of education to Congress, and during five terms in Washington he has been an advocate for undocumented immigrants, has supported the Affordable Care Act, and has waged a battle against Colorado\u2019s $32 billion oil and gas industry.Mr. Polis said he would prefer not to be boxed in.\u201cI never view it as \u2018liberal versus conservative,\u2019\u201d he said, as voters wound their way up to a smoking room that had become the campaign event\u2019s unofficial after-party. \u201cI view it as a forward versus backward.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a host of a Jared Polis campaign event. He is Scott Durrah, not Duran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lydia Millet: By the Book", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy the BookThe novelist Lydia Millet, whose new story collection is \u201cFight No More,\u201d was impressed as a teenager by the Marquis de Sade. \u201cNow he\u2019s more boring, but we all fall prey to nostalgia.\u201dWhat\u2019s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?Someone made me try to read my car\u2019s manual after five years of ownership. I won\u2019t name names except to say: It was my boyfriend, Aaron. I shy away from the mechanical and don\u2019t read any manuals. Or contracts. Or fine print. When I\u2019m going to read at length I want it to be for work or pleasure, not for practicality. But he thought I should know the basics. He sees it as an ethical flaw that I don\u2019t change tires. Probably others agree. I learned I\u2019m intractable and have the attention span of a 6-year-old faced with a differential equation. I was reminded that in a disaster scenario, an every-person-for-herself kind of challenge or even one involving minor electronic failure, I would be lost. That much like pediatric periodontists and professional closet organizers, writers like me, however uneconomic we may seem, can exist with a degree of tranquillity or efficiency only in economies like this one, of extreme specialization. Hothouse flowers.What moves you most in a work of literature?Grief and longing. From an austere place, not one that \u2019s squishy with emotion. I like a backdrop of coldness, or at least neutrality. And I like fiction that doesn\u2019t affirm, reinforce a reader\u2019s fixed ideas or comfort him but casts the familiar in a strange light. Humor should always be present or ambient, even if sly or slight. I want to sense the presence of an author who can laugh at herself, who\u2019s aware of her own design and also her fallibility. One who doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s above self-mockery. Also I love ecstatic moments, but they have to be delicate, with the right balance of restraint and indulgence. Hard to earn as a writer and to find as a reader.Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night?Paper at home but electronic if traveling, because I am too lazy to carry heavy things. Night, because the rest of the day is for work and the children. Of course then there\u2019s the hazard of falling asleep, which happens too often. Recently I\u2019ve started a lot of books I don\u2019t keep reading. Not proud of it. Some of those books are very good. There are piles. Unfinished business that stretches for years.How do you organize your books?Opportunistically. I only keep them if I love them. And there are few enough of those that I can generally find them again pretty easily. I love libraries, so I borrow a lot.What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?\u201c120 Days of Sodom\u201d? Maybe they wouldn\u2019t be surprised. It features in my new collection. As a teenager I was very impressed by the Marquis de Sade. Horrified but compelled. Now he\u2019s more boring, but we all fall prey to nostalgia.What\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?\u201cThe Giant All-Color Book of Fairy Tales,\u201d retold by Jane Carruth, Golden Press, 1971, from my parents. Stories with pictures by different artists. It was my staple as a child. I still have it, spine torn and taped up, pages soft and filthy with childish finger smears. Fifty retellings of Grimm and Andersen and Perrault, piercingly sad tales like \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d and \u201cThe Little Match Girl,\u201d as well as lighter tales about the foolishness of those darn peasants, like \u201cThe Golden Goose.\u201d But I remember even the odd and mediocre tales, like \u201cRicky of the Tuft,\u201d where a prince suffers from having bad hair until he finds a beautiful stupid princess he has the power to make smart. Luckily she has the power to fix his hair in return. Young royals should have to settle for nothing less than the total package.Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?Those that are hero and villain at once. Different ones dominated different times. Before I was 10 it was the Lorax and Aslan, then briefly Scarlett O\u2019Hara, until I switched my loyalty to saintly Melanie. I too will suffer nobly in silence, I decided for a while. But then it turned out silence did not come easily to me. Ignatius J. Reilly and Beckett\u2019s fictional proxies in my 20s, and Nabokov\u2019s Charles Kinbote and the terrible guy in Elias Canetti\u2019s \u201cAuto-da-F\u00e9.\u201d Deeply flawed men with vast blind spots. Eventually I stopped remembering or noticing characters\u2019 names and cared only about voices. In my 30s maybe the narrator of J. M. Coetzee\u2019s \u201cDisgrace,\u201d the voices in Virginia Woolf\u2019s books and Joy Williams\u2019s and Lydia Davis\u2019s, in funny books by Mary Ruefle and Julie Hecht. In my 40s, not sure. The heroes are in hiding.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?Avid, obsessive and a binge reader, where the binges were constant. Prone to dramatic weeping and hysterical laughter. Extreme identification with characters both tragic and comic. We didn\u2019t have a television until I was 12 or 13, so books were all. Stories with talking animals were my favorites, typically. I loved the genius Dr. Seuss. \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d and Edward Eager and Beverley Nichols, who wrote \u201cThe Tree That Sat Down\u201d and \u201cThe Stream That Stood Still.\u201d They\u2019re tragically neglected. The \u201cSwallows and Amazons\u201d series, by Arthur Ransome; P. G. Wodehouse; Diana Wynne Jones, though I came to her late; and Nancy Farmer. I love Philip Pullman and Garth Nix, but they weren\u2019t around when I was young. I read their books now instead.Whom would you want to write your life story? How do you decide what to read next? Is it reviews, word of mouth, books by friends, books for research? Does it depend on mood or do you plot in advance?A bit of everything. I admit I use the \u201cLook Inside\u201d feature on Amazon as a smell test. I don\u2019t often browse at real bookstores, though I buy from them, because I don\u2019t enjoy the standing-and-perusing model. I never did, even before the internet. I like to write socially at times, surrounded by people in public spaces, but not to read that way. As Amazon knows very well, \u201cLook Inside\u201d has a voyeuristic quality all its own. It\u2019s like speed-dating, where the date is a book.If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?This president? Yes. One book.An expanded version of this interview is available at nytimes.com/books.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Ruling Has Dealmakers Bracing", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisney\u2019s offer to buy 21st Century Fox. CVS\u2019s bid for Aetna. T-Mobile\u2019s proposed merger with Sprint.The path for these blockbuster deals and others could be transformed in an instant on Tuesday, when a federal judge is expected to issue his opinion on the government\u2019s effort to block AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner. It is one of the most influential antitrust cases in decades, enthralling Hollywood, Silicon Valley and Madison Avenue.If the merger is blocked, some executives are likely to slim down their deal aspirations. If the deal ends up going through, expect a cascade of mergers and acquisitions.\u201cIt could have a collateral effect on every other transaction,\u201d said Blair Levin, an adviser to New Street Research and a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications Commission.The case will be decided by Richard J. Leon, a plain-spoken judge appointed by President George W. Bush. He is expected to give a shortened version of his opinion in remarks around 4 p.m. on Tuesday. The full opinion, released around the same time, could be more than 200 pages and will be closely read.Although Judge Leon has given few clues about his thinking, many analysts expect the companies to prevail because of the history of similar cases that were approved. Some have also said the government struggled in the trial to show that the deal would cause substantial harm.But the decision may not be clear cut. The judge may allow the merger with several conditions, such as restrictions on how AT&T negotiates with rival cable companies that want to run Time Warner content.\u201cAnything is possible, and the reality is that any side that loses will be appealing,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research.The appeal process could change the final outcome. But since the companies are faced with a tight deadline later this month to close their merger, shareholders may push Time Warner to bring AT&T back to the negotiating table for more money if they have to wait out a prolonged legal battle, some analysts say.About $816 billion worth of transactions in the United States were announced this year through May, according to Thomson Reuters, up 71 percent from a year earlier.The reason: Companies need growth, and buying other companies remains one of the fastest and most effective ways to achieve it. Despite recent interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, borrowing the vast sums of money needed for deal making remains cheap by historical standards.But there is little doubt that Judge Leon\u2019s decision will reverberate widely. The vertical deals already reached could be at greater risk, for example.Here are potential implications of the three general outcomes.If Judge Leon clears the way for the merger without any restrictions, expect other companies to see it as a green light for more consolidation.\u201cWe expect a Comcast bid for Fox under almost any circumstance, unless there is problematic language in the AT&T-Time Warner court decision that makes the prospect of vertical media mergers untenable going forward,\u201d Mr. Greenfield of BTIG Research wrote on Wednesday.The outcome of the AT&T case could also prompt a range of smaller entertainment companies to join forces as a competitive maneuver. Speculation surrounds Lionsgate, which owns Starz; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which controls the rights to the James Bond franchise; Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has rebounded at the box office; and Discovery Communications, the TV powerhouse.Media and telecom companies will also look for any signs that the judge agrees with AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s assertion that Silicon Valley is a competitive threat and should also be defined as part of the media ecosystem \u2014 adding new competitors for regulators to consider.If so, companies like Verizon and Dish could view the court decision as a sign that they could buy media companies. T-Mobile and Sprint could also point to the court decision to support their pending wireless merger, which they say would bring better mobile service as companies like Comcast enter the wireless market.\u201cYou will see a rush to consolidate major media and transmission assets,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, an antitrust official during the Barack Obama administration.A victory for the Justice Department could encourage the department to act more aggressively on similar deals.Makan Delrahim, the antitrust chief at the Justice Department, has been adamant that competitive concerns in mergers cannot be resolved through promises to hold back on certain anticompetitive practices. Those requirements, called behavioral remedies, are common in vertical mergers. Comcast\u2019s merger with NBCUniversal in 2011, for example, was granted with more than 100 conditions, such as a requirement that the combined company give competitors access to its programming.Instead, Mr. Delrahim has said the best way to resolve antitrust problems is to sell off assets. The department offered AT&T and Time Warner a settlement that would allow them to merge as long as they sold Turner Broadcasting or DirecTV. The companies rejected the proposal, leading to the suit to block the deal.Establishing his standard as the new norm would send a chill through markets, which had become accustomed to government approval of mergers with restrictions. The investment bankers, public relations operatives and media executives working on deals could go back to their corners.It would mean the Justice Department could be tougher on mergers and demand companies sell off assets to resolve antitrust concerns.\u201cMakan Delrahim strongly believes that behavioral remedies are regulations of sorts, and he doesn\u2019t want to turn the D.O.J. into a regulatory agency,\u201d said Paul Glenchur, a senior policy analyst at Hedgeye Potomac Research.Judge Leon could also allow the deal but insist that the parties agree to certain conditions, a middle ground that could go in multiple directions.For example, during the trial, Judge Leon asked about promises by AT&T and Time Warner to appoint a third party to oversee disagreements between AT&T and rival cable companies over the fees to license Time Warner content. The companies have argued that arbitration would resolve concerns that AT&T could use Time Warner content like CNN, TNT and TBS as a weapon to increase costs for rivals.The Justice Department has argued that the promises of arbitration aren\u2019t strong enough. Analysts viewed the judge\u2019s questions on arbitration as an area where he could find compromise and may use them to resolve competitive problems with the deal.He may also demand divestitures like those proposed by the Justice Department. But AT&T and Time Warner would almost certainly fight such a decision in an appeal. They have been adamant that they would not sell parts in order to get the deal approved.Such a decision on divestitures would be a rare move by a judge in a vertical merger and, like a decision to block the deal entirely, could have a chilling effect on other vertical mergers.Judge Leon, experts say, is keenly aware of the ramifications of his opinion. And he will most likely make his findings narrow, which would limit the scope of an appeal.\u201cConventional wisdom is that AT&T and Time Warner will win,\u201d Mr. Glenchur said. \u201cBut even we who are in the business of trying to predict what will happen can only really say that we really can\u2019t know at this point.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Comcast Offers $65 Billion for 21st Century Fox, Challenging Disney", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byComcast announced an offer worth $65 billion for the bulk of 21st Century Fox\u2019s businesses on Wednesday, setting up a showdown with the Walt Disney Company for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire.The one-upmanship reflects an industry under threat from Silicon Valley, where deep-pocketed technology companies like Netflix and Amazon are stealing audiences, ad dollars and big name creative talents.Now Comcast is back \u2014 creating a likely bidding war for a conglomerate that Mr. Murdoch has spent a lifetime building, and setting up a showdown between the Comcast chief executive Brian L. Roberts and his counterpart at Disney, Robert A. Iger, who has staked his legacy on this deal.\u201cComcast seems hellbent on winning this time, and I think the narrative in Philadelphia is that Brian should have listened to his gut in 2004 and bought Disney,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a co-founder of the research firm MoffettNathanson and a longtime media analyst, referring to Comcast\u2019s headquarters. \u201cHe seems very personally committed to this.\u201dIn a statement, Fox said it planned to review Comcast\u2019s offer. Representatives for Disney declined to comment.There are questions about how hard Disney will fight. As Doug Creutz, a media analyst at Cowen and Company, put it in a client note on Wednesday, Mr. Iger \u201chas never (as far as we are aware) been put in a position where a proposed acquisition faced a significant competitive challenge such as this, so it\u2019s hard to gauge his sensitivity to price.\u201dMr. Iger does have a history of paying premiums for properties he wants, albeit on a much smaller scale. The most obvious example is Pixar, which Disney bought in 2006 for $7.4 billion, or $9.4 billion in today\u2019s money. The price was criticized at the time as exorbitant \u2014 wrongly, as it turned out, given the value that Disney has since gotten from the animation studio.Comcast\u2019s new offer is about 19 percent higher than Disney\u2019s proposal, according to its statement. It also includes contractual assurances such as a reverse breakup fee \u2014 worth about $2.5 billion \u2014 in the event a transaction is blocked by the government.Mr. Murdoch and his company\u2019s board had rejected Comcast\u2019s earlier offer partly because of concerns that the government would block the deal, but the AT&T-Time Warner decision allayed many of those worries.Mr. Roberts wrote in a 700-word letter to Mr. Murdoch and his sons \u2014 James, the chief executive of Fox, and Lachlan, the executive chairman \u2014 that he \u201clong admired what the Murdoch family has built,\u201d but that he and his company were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Fox\u2019s decision to engage Disney.\u201cIn light of yesterday\u2019s decision in the AT&T/Time Warner case,\u201d Mr. Roberts continued, \u201cwe are pleased to present a new, all-cash proposal that fully addresses the board\u2019s stated concerns with our prior proposal.\u201dThe businesses that Mr. Murdoch has agreed to sell include the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios, almost two dozen regional sports networks like the Yankees\u2019 YES channel, a lineup of cable networks that include FX, and a 30 percent ownership stake in the streaming service Hulu.But the key attractions for Comcast are Fox\u2019s broad international assets. Among them are Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in the European pay-TV operator Sky and its control of Star, one of India\u2019s largest media companies, which reaches 700 million people every month, according to the company.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s overseas business accounts for 27 percent of annual sales, about $7.8 billion. Comcast, whose cable business is strictly a domestic operation, draws in only 9 percent of its revenue from foreign agreements, largely through NBCUniversal.Comcast has already made an offer to buy the other 61 percent of Sky in a separate deal. The Fox News cable network, the Fox broadcast stations, the Fox Business Network and the sports network FS1 would not be part of a transaction.A Fox combination could help Comcast amplify its streaming services. Netflix, YouTube, Apple and Facebook are spending billions of dollars a year to create original series and are competing directly for content and sports programming.Hulu, which has more than 17 million subscribers, would come under Comcast\u2019s control if it pulls off the acquisition. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a wonderful asset,\u201d NBCUniversal\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Burke, said Wednesday on a conference call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s an important part of this deal, and we\u2019d be very interested in growing that business in the future.\u201dAT&T\u2019s decisive court victory \u2014 the judge said the merger could move forward without requiring the telecommunications giant or Time Warner to divest any assets \u2014 creates a blueprint for Comcast. Both AT&T and Comcast are distributors seeking to buy content companies that they do not directly compete with, in what is known as a vertical acquisition. Comcast, for example, already pays Fox for the right to carry its channels like FX and Fox News.\u201cThe AT&T ruling pretty much eliminated the vertical issue from at least where the world stands now,\u201d said Ketan Jhaveri, a former antitrust lawyer for the Justice Department, which had sued to block the merger. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to make the comparison from AT&T buying Time Warner to Comcast buying Fox.\u201dEven so, the combination of Comcast and Fox would put more content and distribution under one company\u2019s control than even the AT&T deal with Time Warner. In his ruling, the judge wrote that \u201cthe temptation by some to view this decision as being something more than a resolution of this specific case should be resisted by one and all!\u201dIn the weeks ahead, Comcast and Disney are expected to work overtime to convince Fox shareholders that each will have an easier time passing regulatory muster.Mr. Iger is expected to contend that Disney\u2019s regulatory process will be faster because it has a head start, having announced its deal in December. Comcast maintains that the two timelines will be comparable.Unlike its merger with NBCUniversal in 2011, Comcast said, a deal with 21st Century Fox would not undergo a regulatory review by the Federal Communications Commission because the transaction would not involve the transfer of broadcast licenses, which requires a rigorous public interest and competition review by the agency.Either merger would be the first test for the Department of Justice since its sweeping court defeat this week. Analysts say it may be reluctant to challenge another major media deal.\u201cThe regulatory backdrop is now more positive for companies in a \u2018get big\u2019 environment,\u201d Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie Research, said.Two businesses that would receive particular regulatory scrutiny would be Fox\u2019s film business and its 22 regional sports networks.In 2017, Disney and Fox controlled a combined 35 percent of the box office in North America. This year, the two make up 50 percent. Comcast and Fox controlled a combined 28 percent last year; this year, the total is 25 percent.As for sports, NBCUniversal owns nine regional networks of its own, while Disney owns ESPN, the most popular national sports network.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The commission is empowered to impose fines of up to $11bn \u2014 which is 10 percent of the global turnover of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet \u2014 but typically decisions are at the lower end of the range.The decision will mark an escalation of the commission\u2019s battle with Google, which began eight years ago with an investigation into comparison shopping, then only a narrow part of online commerce. Though that case concluded with a \u20ac2.4bn fine, it has not led to significant changes to Google\u2019s business.The issue with AndroidAs the FT notes, this penalty could have big ramifications for Google. Its Android operating system dominated smartphone market worldwide because Google gave it away for free. But Ms. Vestager has been looking into whether the Silicon Valley behemoth improperly forced phone makers to favor services like Chrome and Google search, as well as stopping others from developing competing operating systems using the open-source parts of Android.The bigger picture\u2014 Michael de la MercedAthenahealth acknowledged that this was possible. From a statement by its executive chairman, Jeff Immelt, on Wednesday:To ensure athenahealth maximizes shareholder value and is best positioned to realize the full potential of its premier health care technology platform, the board has authorized a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger or continuing as an independent company under new leadership.The context Over the past two weeks, Mr. Bush (Athenahealth\u2019s co-founder, and a cousin of George W. Bush) had taken fire for a variety of disclosures about his conduct, both at the workplace and at home.In an unusual statement on Wednesday, Mr. Bush said of his exit:\u201cI believe that working for something larger than yourself is the greatest thing a human can do. A family, a cause, a company, a country \u2013 these things give shape and purpose to an otherwise mechanical and brief human existence. athenahealth is a near once in a life time example of such a thing. With that lens on, it\u2019s easy for me to see that the very things that made me useful to the company and cause in these past twenty-one years, are now exactly the things that are in the way. I cannot imagine a single organization more loaded with potential to transform health care.\u201dWhat happens nowAthenahealth has the investment banks Lazard and Centerview Partners and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges advising it on a potential sale.Elliott\u2019s response to the newsFrom a spokesman:\u201cElliott welcomes the Board\u2019s decision to explore strategic alternatives and believes it is the right one for athenahealth\u2019s shareholders, employees and customers. We have long believed that athenahealth is a great company, and we look forward to participating as a bidder in the company\u2019s strategic exploration process.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedMembers of the British government\u2019s digital, culture, media, and sports committee tried to catch him out with questions about a series of media reports on Cambridge Analytica, but they didn\u2019t seem to unsettle the ex-C.E.O.Things didn\u2019t start well for Mr. Nix. He argued with Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, about whether he was allowed to give an opening statement to provide \u201cfew clarifications\u201d about what happened when he last testified before the same panel. He wasn\u2019t.Here are some choice interactions from the rest of the hearing:\u201cThe allegation is false, the facts are not correct.\u201d\u201cThose boxes were not ours. As far as I\u2019m aware, the I.C.O. were the only people to remove documents, files and hardware from that office.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t represent the company properly, I didn\u2019t represent what we do. In our overzealousness to secure a contract, Mark Turnbull and I were guilty of hyperbole of agreeing on matters that, not only had we never done, but we had no understanding of. We were telling a client what we thought he wanted to hear.\u201dDid Mr. Nix mean to mislead the politicians during his last hearing (in February, before the Cambridge Analytica scandal exploded)? Then, one member of the committee asked about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s possession of data obtained from Global Science Research, which has been originally gathered from Facebook users.\u201cIt was my firm impression that Mr. Collins\u2019 questions were about whether we were currently in possession of the data\u2026 so I answered no.\u201d\u201cWhen I read the transcript, it became clear that Mr. Collins was also asking whether we had ever held it. Clearly the answer should have been yes. The fact that we received data from G.S.R. was already in the public domain from as early as December 2015, when the Guardian published an article.\u201d\u201cI also stand by my evidence that we do not work on Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data. That data was given by G.S.R., and subsequently deleted at Facebook\u2019s request.\u201dHow useful was the Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, which was used to inform the company\u2019s work in the U.S.?\u201cThat data was less useful than simply using Facebook\u2019s own advertising algorithms.\u201d\u2014 Jamie CondliffeMore from Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance:Facebook officials said the agreements with the Chinese companies allowed them access similar to what was offered to BlackBerry, which could retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends \u2014 including religious and political leanings, work and education history and relationship status.According to Facebook, the user data stayed on phones and never reached those companies\u2019 servers. Lawmakers are irate anyway: Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that he will \u201clook forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that.\u201dMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, announced that he was dismissing the bureau\u2019s consumer advisory board, which provides feedback on its rules and policies.By law, the bureau must convene the advisory board and hold an in-person meeting with its members at least twice a year. The bureau canceled a meeting scheduled for February, and last week it canceled one planned for this week.Anthony Welcher, who, as one of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s deputies, oversees external affairs for the bureau, told those members of the board, which now numbers 25, that it would be reconstituted as a smaller group.The consumer advisory board\u2019s members are consumer activists, academics, entrepreneurs who run financial start-ups and industry representatives from companies including Citi, Discover, and Mastercard.The White House has said that it plans to help A.I. researchers develop better artificial intelligence systems by making government data available to researchers to help them. But the nation remains at risk of being overtaken as a global A.I. leader, as other nation states appear to value the technology more highly.\u201cAnything that we can do to unlock government data, we\u2019re committed to. We\u2019d love to hear from any academic that has any insights.\u201dSo far, a big part of the administration\u2019s approach to giving A.I. research a push has focused on removing regulatory barriers so that industry can apply the technology more quickly. It also says that it\u2019s increased investment in R.&D. for \u201cA.I. and related technologies\u201d by more than 40 percent since 2015 \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear what those \u201crelated technologies\u201d are.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeElsewhere in tradeBut something bigger is at work.

After all, it was her funeral. Or, as she pronounced it, her FUN-eral.\u201cCome on in,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of food. And a coffin that people are decorating.\u201dAnd so it was that a hundred or so people gathered in the common room of an Upper West Side apartment building recently to eat, sing, mingle and hear Ms. Weisberger\u2019s thoughts about death and dying.\u201cI hope we have fun,\u201d she said.A former nurse, Ms. Weisberger wore white slacks, white sneakers and a bright floral print blouse. A biodegradable cardboard coffin in one corner bore handwritten messages in colored marker: \u201cGo Shatzi! (but not literally)\u201d; \u201cdeath is only the beginning\u201d; \u201cShatzi, many happy returns \u2026 as trees, as bumble bees, as many happy memories.\u201dMs. Weisberger worked the crowded room. \u201cI have been studying and learning about death and dying, and I want to tell people what I\u2019ve learned,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people are coming because they love me, and some people are coming because they\u2019re curious about what the hell it\u2019s about.\u201dAt 88, Ms. Weisberger has found a second calling in what has been labeled the positive death movement \u2014 a scattering of mostly women who want to break the taboos around discussions of death.All share a common idea: that Western culture has become too squeamish about talking about death, and that the silence impoverishes the lives leading up to it.Ellen Goodman, a retired newspaper columnist who started the Conversation Project after caring for her mother at the end of life, likened the foment to the earlier movement for natural childbirth. \u201cBirth was perceived as a medical event, and then in came the women\u2019s movement and \u2018Our Bodies, Ourselves,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t doctors who changed the way we give birth in America. It was women who said that giving birth was a human event. I think that we\u2019re trying to do that now. Dying is a human experience. We\u2019re trying to put the person back into the center of the experience.\u201dMs. Weisberger is by no means a morbid person. She sings in the Brooklyn Women\u2019s Chorus and shops at the new Trader Joe\u2019s in her neighborhood. But a few years ago, after sitting with a friend who was dying of cancer, she realized that she was unsatisfied with the American way of death.\u201cShe became terrified, so scared that she couldn\u2019t even talk about it,\u201d Ms. Weisberger said of her friend. \u201cI kept urging her to talk about what was going on, but she wouldn\u2019t. And then she died. So that was a problem. We had not dealt with the issue \u2014 myself, herself and the others.\u201cSo I started studying about it,\u201d she said. Down the digital rabbit hole she went.If there is a germinal moment for the positive death movement, it is 2003, when a social worker at a New York hospice center became disillusioned by the care that the medical staff were able to give to dying patients and their families. The social worker, Henry Fersko-Weiss, saw what doulas did for women during and after childbirth. Why couldn\u2019t dying people get the same level of attention and emotional support?\u201cThere are tremendous similarities between birthing and dying,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal unknown, there\u2019s a great deal of pain and a need for support for the people around the person who is going through the experience.\u201dFor doulas in either setting, he said, \u201carranging the atmosphere, creating a special space around the event, is exactly the same.\u201dAs Mr. Fersko-Weiss was getting his program underway, Joanna Ebenstein, a graphic designer in Brooklyn, was thinking about death from a completely different angle.From the first posts, she said, she started hearing from an audience she had not known was out there: people who felt isolated by their interest in death. Before then, the only people she knew who shared her interest in death had been in the goth subculture.\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to be curious about death now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how can you not be? It\u2019s a great human mystery. It\u2019s the thing that defines our life, but we\u2019re supposed to pretend it\u2019s not interesting to us? It\u2019s in horror movies and pop culture, but there was no high culture discourse around it.\u201dShe withheld her name from the blog because she was afraid her design clients, especially Scholastic, would think she was creepy. This was the era when Sarah Palin warned that the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act was trying to impose \u201cdeath panels.\u201dMs. Ebenstein, 46, sees her work as resurrecting a lost strand of American culture.\u201cThis idea that we have now, that death is exotic and cannot be seen, is brand new,\u201d she said. \u201cYour grandparents tended to die in the house. They\u2019d be laid out in the parlor when they died, which the Ladies\u2019 Home Journal advocated changing to the \u2018living room\u2019 when the funeral parlor came around. The living room became the living room because it\u2019s no longer the parlor for laying out the dead. And that\u2019s around 1900. All of these changes are happening, and now we think of death as something that happens offstage, that we don\u2019t see and children certainly shouldn\u2019t see. But that was not possible until so recently.\u201dIn April of 2013, Ms. Doughty tweeted, \u201cWhy are there a zillion websites and references for being sex positive but nothing for being death positive?\u201dWith that, an inchoate curiosity had a brand name, a cachet and an internet presence. All it needed was an occasion to gather.On a Monday evening at Bluestockings bookstore on the Lower East Side, Emily Leshner, a graduate student in visual media anthropology, had a question about the end of life. Specifically, she wanted to discuss the issue of digital immortality: is it right for people\u2019s social media profiles to live on when they die? \u201cOur digital presence exists beyond our biological life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me think what kind of person I\u2019d want to be my legacy.\u201dIt was the monthly gathering of the Lower East Side Death Cafe, one of a handful of death cafes that have formed in the last few years around the city. Jafar Al-Mondhiry, a resident in internal medicine, picked up Ms. Leshner\u2019s question. He hoped to start a death-related podcast for other residents \u2014 a virtual death cafe. \u201cIs social media a triumph over the body?\u201d he asked.Around two tables piled with carrots and other snacks, the conversations were lively and unstructured. Melanie Nilsson described taking her father\u2019s cremated remains to all of his favorite restaurants for a year. Millet Israeli, a former corporate lawyer who changed careers to become a grief counselor, asked what sort of reactions the others got when they told friends they were attending a death cafe.\u201cThey said, \u2018Is that some sort of goth thing?\u2019\u201d Ms. Leshner said. \u201cThat it\u2019s dark and trendy and cool.\u201dThe death cafe, she said, \u201cis almost like my form of activism to create an atmosphere publicly that permits talking about death. If we can talk about death and dying, maybe that will spread to easier conversations about grief and terminal illness.\u201dMs. Israeli recalled a guided meditation at the Zen Center imagining her own death: the mouth becoming dry, the body shutting down, the attention becoming more internal. Even with all her work as a grief counselor, Ms. Israeli said, she was nervous going into it. \u201cIt seemed scary,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the experience was the opposite. As heavy as that sounds, it made it feel lighter. It felt safer than it did going in.\u201dThis is the odd math of the positive death activities. Embracing mortality, practitioners say, helps them live with less fear, more life.Ms. Cunningham discussed alternatives to embalming \u2014 which involves toxic chemicals \u2014 and coffins made of wool or other materials that decompose easily. The group included 24 women and two men.\u201cWe\u2019re part of a movement, and it\u2019s really a return to a female presence at the time of death,\u201d Ms. Cunningham said.Several of those attending worked in hospice or in the funeral trade. Others had enrolled after the deaths of people close to them.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit macabre,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve always been superfascinated by dying \u2014 the physiological processes, but also this idea of what happens to our consciousness. I don\u2019t believe in heaven or an afterlife.\u201cI also feel that decomposition is deeply spiritual. One of the things that draws people to this work is that we don\u2019t have a basis in religion. That\u2019s why a lot of people are becoming part of this death positive movement.\u201dOthers offer different explanations for why all this is happening now. The AIDS crisis transformed grief and caregiving into expressions of community. The mass shootings on the news call for examination: What if today was your last day? The rising interest in Buddhism introduced alternative concepts of dying. And the aging population brought more urgency to questions of how people want to consider the last years.\u201cThe first step is recognizing that death is a natural part of life\u2019s journey,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe can have it go well or have it go poorly. They say death and taxes are the only things guaranteed in life. But people don\u2019t pay their taxes. So I\u2019m saying death is the only one that\u2019s for sure.\u201dAt the FUN-eral, Ms. Weisberger showed off a burial shroud she plans to use when her time comes. She bought it online, from Amazon, she thinks. Three friends have agreed to wash her body according to Jewish tradition, and Ms. Cunningham \u2014 who supplied the cardboard coffin \u2014 will provide dry ice to preserve her body before burial, she said.On the wall was a quote from Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, who died in 2011: \u201cRemembering that I\u2019ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\u2019ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.\u201d Ms. Weisberger found it on WeCroak.\u201cI was about to give up on WeCroak until I saw this,\u201d she said.Ms. Weisberger assured her friends that she was in no hurry to occupy the coffin in the corner. Her health was good and her studies in death and dying gave her motivation to keep going, maybe to age 100, she said.After all, she had too much work to do to stop now.\u201cI really want to experience my dying,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die in a car crash or be unconscious. I want to be home, I want to be in my bed, I want to share the experience with anybody who\u2019s interested.\u201dIt has been the journey of a lifetime, she said, and the last chapter was still to come.\u201cThere\u2019s so much more to share, but I don\u2019t want to go on \u2014 no, I really do want to go on,\u201d she said.Everybody laughed. For one afternoon, death did not get the last word.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Wins Approval for $85.4 Billion Time Warner Deal in Defeat for Justice Dept.", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday approved the blockbuster merger between AT&T and Time Warner, rebuffing the government\u2019s effort to stop the $85.4 billion deal, in a decision that is expected to unleash a wave of corporate takeovers.The judge, Richard J. Leon of United States District Court in Washington, said the Justice Department had not proved that the telecom company\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner would lead to fewer choices for consumers and higher prices for television and internet services.The merger would create a media and telecommunications powerhouse, reshaping the landscape of those industries. The combined company would have a library that includes HBO\u2019s hit \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and channels like CNN, along with vast distribution reach through wireless and satellite television services across the country.Media executives increasingly say content creation and distribution must be married to survive against technology companies like Amazon and Netflix. Those companies started producing their own shows in just the last several years. But they now spend billions of dollars a year on original programming, and users can stream the video on apps in homes and on mobile devices, putting pressure on traditional media businesses.Executives and investors of other companies had watched the six-week trial closely for signs about how it might affect their ambitions. Comcast, for example, would like to beat out the Walt Disney Company for some of 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets, but has held off from making a formal bid until the trial ended.The ruling is a major setback for the Justice Department and its antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, whose decision to sue to block the merger broke with convention. Deals such as this one, in which the two companies are in related industries but do not produce competing products, are usually approved by federal regulators.Mr. Delrahim had insisted that the two companies sell some major parts before getting government approval, a demand that the executives rejected. That led the Justice Department to file its lawsuit in November. Judge Leon\u2019s decision essentially confirmed the conventional thinking about antitrust law.Mr. Delrahim appeared somber after the decision. He said he was disappointed and would review the 172-page opinion before deciding whether the government would ask a higher court to issue a stay of the ruling. The Justice Department could appeal the decision even if it did not get an injunction.\u201cI\u2019ve taken an oath to uphold competition,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said. \u201cWe are going to take the next steps as necessary.\u201dJudge Leon took the unusual step of warning the government not to try to seek a stay, saying it would hurt the defendants, which had already gone through an 18-month regulatory and legal battle for their review. The companies face a June 21 deadline to close their deal.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that it took 18 months to get here,\u201d Daniel Petrocelli, the lead litigator for AT&T and Time Warner, said outside the courthouse after the opinion. \u201cBut we are relieved it is finally behind us and we look forward to closing the transaction in the upcoming days.\u201dShares in AT&T fell 5.5 percent in morning trading on Wednesday, while shares in Time Warner rose 2.7 percent.The deal was hatched in August 2016 when Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&T, called Jeff Bewkes, his counterpart at Time Warner. Mr. Bewkes\u2019s company, with its popular HBO shows, live N.B.A. and N.C.A.A. sports broadcasting rights, and CNN, has been a takeover target for years.The two then had a long lunch in the Time Warner dining room in New York and agreed that their industries were under siege. The purchase of Time Warner would give AT&T the premium television content it needed to make its bundle of wireless, television and broadband services more attractive to customers.The deal would put AT&T in charge of Time Warner\u2019s vast portfolio, which includes HBO and CNN, rights to major sports leagues, and valuable film franchises such as Harry Potter. John Stankey, an AT&T executive, would oversee the integration of these units into AT&T and eventually lead the Time Warner business.\u201cWe want people engaged with their mobile devices all day watching movies and video,\u201d Mr. Stephenson testified at the trial.Presidential politics clouded the merger from almost the moment it was announced. President Trump, while still a candidate, said he would block the deal \u201cbecause it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201dThose comments and his repeated criticism of CNN, which is owned by Time Warner\u2019s Turner Broadcasting unit, raised speculation that Mr. Trump had pushed Mr. Delrahim and the Justice Department to block the deal.But Mr. Delrahim swore to the court that he was not influenced by the White House, and Judge Leon stopped the companies from introducing evidence about possible political interference.\u201cWe always believed that the motivations for bringing this case were questionable at best,\u201d Gary Ginsberg, an executive vice president for Time Warner, said on Tuesday. \u201cThe court\u2019s verdict resoundingly supported that view.\u201dMr. Delrahim had argued that the only way antitrust concerns could be resolved was through the sale of major businesses. Last fall, he presented AT&T and Time Warner with two options: Sell the majority stake in either DirecTV, which is AT&T\u2019s satellite television company, or Turner Broadcasting. The companies rejected both options.Mr. Delrahim\u2019s position, which the White House said it supported, also had the backing of some left-leaning politicians and antitrust experts. They have been increasingly calling for the government to break up Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon and to prevent greater consolidation in health care, media, transportation and agriculture.Judge Leon, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, tried to limit the reach of his opinion, writing that \u201cthe temptation by some to view this decision as being something more than a resolution of this specific case should be resisted by one and all!\u201dBut many antitrust experts and analysts believe the decision will embolden companies to pursue deals.The decision \u201cwill give AT&T market power to raise the price of Time Warner content, and, secondly, it will lead to further vertical mergers in this industry that will harm consumers,\u201d said Steven Salop, an economics and law professor at Georgetown University who has pushed for stronger government regulation.The trial drew large crowds that included executives, hedge fund managers and financial analysts. Mr. Delrahim attended occasionally, and so did Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes. The two executives each took the witness stand to defend the merger.Judge Leon asked few questions during the trial and gave little indication of where he was leaning before his opinion on Tuesday. But many experts felt that the government had struggled to make its case.After Judge Leon delivered his decision to a packed courtroom, representatives from AT&T and Time Warner lined the small hallway just outside. The men and women embraced and clapped one another on the back, beaming as they whispered congratulations.\u201cIt\u2019s a receiving line,\u201d one woman joked, her hands outstretched for the next hug.Cecilia Kang and Emily Cochrane reported from Washington, and Edmund Lee from New York.Advertisement"}

Dropped From the Dow After More Than a Century", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd then there were none.General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain.The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company\u2019s new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company\u2019s financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.Over the last year, G.E.\u2019s shares have fallen 55 percent, compared with a 15 percent gain for the Dow. G.E., which closed Tuesday at $12.95, has the lowest share price of any of the index\u2019s 30 components.S. & P. Dow Jones Indices \u2014 which owns the Dow \u2014 suggested that the slide in G.E.\u2019s stock price contributed to the decision to remove the company from the index, where it had been a member continuously since 1907. The Dow is a price-weighted index, which means higher priced stocks have a greater influence on its direction.\u201cThe low price of G.E. shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point,\u201d said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S. & P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cWalgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s share price is higher, and it will contribute more meaningfully to the index.\u201dThe move also is freighted with economic symbolism. With the inclusion of Walgreens Boots, the index \u201cwill be more representative of the consumer and health care sectors of the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Blitzer said.The removal of G.E., which will formally occur June 26, reflects a shift in the economic composition of the United States, which long ago tilted away from heavy industry and toward services, such as technology, finance and health care.And it also amounted to a milestone for General Electric. It was the last remaining original member of the index, when the stock market measure was introduced in 1896.Back then, just a few years after the company was formed through a merger of Thomas Edison\u2019s electric companies with a rival, G.E. was the modern-day equivalent of a technology stock, and the Dow itself was geared heavily toward the growth industries of the day such as railroads. In the more than 120 years that followed, the company was often at the center of American capitalism. And as recently as the 1990s. G.E. was at times the most-valuable American company by market value.Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are the five most valuable companies in the United States today.After G.E.\u2019s departure from the index, the company with the longest presence in the Dow will be Exxon Mobil, whose corporate predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey, joined the Dow in 1928, according to S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.Advertisement"}

But he wasn\u2019t budging. \u201cI genuinely believe this is dangerous,\u201d Mr. Musk told the table, according to one of the dinner\u2019s attendees, Yann LeCun, the researcher who led Facebook\u2019s A.I. lab.Mr. Musk\u2019s fears of A.I., distilled to their essence, were simple: If we create machines that are smarter than humans, they could turn against us. (See: \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d and \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d) Let\u2019s for once, he was saying to the rest of the tech industry, consider the unintended consequences of what we are creating before we unleash it on the world.Neither Mr. Musk nor Mr. Zuckerberg would talk in detail about the dinner, which has not been reported before, or their long-running A.I. debate.The creation of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 the name for the supersmart technological breakthrough that takes A.I. to the next level and creates machines that not only perform narrow tasks that typically require human intelligence (like self-driving cars) but can actually outthink humans \u2014 still feels like science fiction. But the fight over the future of A.I. has spread across the tech industry.Artificial intelligence research has enormous potential and enormous implications, both as an economic engine and a source of military superiority. The Chinese government has said it is willing to spend billions in the coming years to make the country the world\u2019s leader in A.I., while the Pentagon is aggressively courting the tech industry for help. A new breed of autonomous weapons can\u2019t be far away.\u201cYou can now talk about the risks of A.I. without seeming like you are lost in science fiction,\u201d said Allan Dafoe, a director of the governance of A.I. program at the Future of Humanity Institute, a research center at the University of Oxford that explores the risks and opportunities of advanced technology.In April, Mr. Zuckerberg spent two days answering questions from members of Congress about data privacy and Facebook\u2019s role in the spread of misinformation before the 2016 election. He faced a similar grilling in Europe last month.Facebook\u2019s recognition that it was slow to understand what was going on has led to a rare moment of self-reflection in an industry that has long believed it is making the world a better place, whether the world likes it or not.Even such influential figures as the Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the late Stephen Hawking have expressed concern about creating machines that are more intelligent than we are. Even though superintelligence seems decades away, they and others have said, shouldn\u2019t we consider the consequences before it\u2019s too late?\u201cThe kind of systems we are creating are very powerful,\u201d said Bart Selman, a Cornell University computer science professor and former Bell Labs researcher. \u201cAnd we cannot understand their impact.\u201dPacific Grove is a tiny town on the central coast of California. A group of geneticists gathered there, in the winter of 1975 to discuss whether their work \u2014 gene editing \u2014 would end up harming the world. In January 2017, the A.I. community held a similar discussion in the beachside grove.The heavy hitters of A.I. were in the room \u2014 among them Mr. LeCun, the Facebook A.I. lab boss who was at the dinner in Palo Alto, and who had helped develop a neural network, one of the most important tools in artificial intelligence today. Also in attendance was Nick Bostrom, whose 2014 book, \u201cSuperintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\u201d had an outsized \u2014 some would argue fear-mongering \u2014 effect on the A.I. discussion; Oren Etzioni, a former computer science professor at the University of Washington who had taken over the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle; and Demis Hassabis, who heads DeepMind, an influential Google-owned A.I. research lab in London.And so was Mr. Musk, who in 2015 had donated $10 million to the Cambridge, Mass., institute. That same year, he also helped create an independent artificial intelligence lab, OpenAI, with an explicit goal: create superintelligence with safeguards meant to ensure it won\u2019t get out of control. It was a message that clearly aligned him with Mr. Bostrom.On the second day of the retreat, Mr. Musk took part in a nine-person panel dedicated to the superintelligence question. Each panelist was asked if superintelligence was possible. As they passed the microphone down the line, each said \u201cYes,\u201d until the microphone reached Mr. Musk. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. The small auditorium rippled with knowing laughter. Everyone understood that Mr. Musk thought superintelligence was not only possible, but very dangerous.Mr. Musk later added: \u201cWe are headed toward either superintelligence or civilization ending.\u201dWarnings about the risks of artificial intelligence have been around for years, of course. But few of those Cassandras have the tech cred of Mr. Musk. Few, if any, have spent as much time and money on it. And perhaps none has had as complicated a history with the technology.Just a few weeks after Mr. Musk talked about his A.I. concerns at the dinner in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s house, Mr. Musk phoned Mr. LeCun, asking for the names of top A.I. researchers who could work on his self-driving car project at Tesla. (That autonomous technology was in use at the time of two fatal Tesla car crashes, one in Florida in May 2016 and the other in March of this year.)During a recent Tesla earnings call, Mr. Musk, who has struggled with questions about his company\u2019s financial losses and concerns about the quality of its vehicles, chastised the news media for not focusing on the deaths that autonomous technology could prevent \u2014 a remarkable stance from someone who has repeatedly warned the world that A.I. is a danger to humanity.There is a saying in Silicon Valley: We overestimate what can be done in three years and underestimate what can be done in 10.On Jan. 27, 2016, Google\u2019s DeepMind lab unveiled a machine that could beat a professional player at the ancient board game Go. In a match played a few months earlier, the machine, called AlphaGo, had defeated the European champion Fan Hui \u2014 five games to none.Even top A.I. researchers had assumed it would be another decade before a machine could solve the game. Go is complex \u2014 there are more possible board positions than atoms in the universe \u2014 and the best players win not with sheer calculation, but through intuition. Two weeks before AlphaGo was revealed, Mr. LeCun said the existence of such a machine was unlikely.A few months later, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, the best Go player of the last decade. The machine made moves that baffled human experts but ultimately led to victory.Many researchers, including the leaders of DeepMind and OpenAI, believe the kind of self-learning technology that underpins AlphaGo provided a path to \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d And they believe progress in this area will significantly accelerate in the coming years.It\u2019s the kind of unpredictability that raise grave concerns about the rise of A.I., including superintelligence.But the deep opposition to these concerns was on display in March at an exclusive conference organized by Amazon and Mr. Bezos in Palm Springs.One evening, Rodney Brooks, a roboticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, debated the potential dangers of A.I. with the neuroscientist, philosopher and podcaster Sam Harris, a prominent voice of caution on the issue. The debate got personal, according to a recording obtained by The Times.Mr. Harris warned that because the world was in an arms race toward A.I., researchers may not have the time needed to ensure superintelligence is built in a safe way.\u201cThis is something you have made up,\u201d Mr. Brooks responded. He implied that Mr. Harris\u2019s argument was based on unscientific reasoning. It couldn\u2019t be proven right or wrong \u2014 a real insult among scientists.\u201cI would take this personally, if it actually made sense.\u201d Mr. Harris said.A moderator finally ended the tussle and asked for questions from the audience. Mr. Etzioni, the head of the Allen Institute, took the microphone. \u201cI am not going to grandstand,\u201d he said. But urged on by Mr. Brooks, he walked onto the stage and laid into Mr. Harris for three minutes, saying that today\u2019s A.I. systems are so limited, spending so much time worrying about superintelligence just doesn\u2019t make sense.The people who take Mr. Musk\u2019s side are philosophers, social scientists, writers \u2014 not the researchers who are working on A.I., he said. Among A.I. scientists, the notion that we should start worrying about superintelligence is \u201cvery much a fringe argument.\u201dPanicking about A.I. now, so early in its development, could threaten the many benefits that come from things like self-driving cars and A.I. health care, he said.\u201cWith A.I. especially, I\u2019m really optimistic,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cPeople who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios \u2014 I just, I don\u2019t understand it.\u201dIn other words: You\u2019re getting ahead of reality, Elon. Relax.\u201cThis is going to be a very central question for how we think about A.I. systems over the next decade and beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, a lot of our A.I. systems make decisions in ways that people don\u2019t really understand.\u201dMr. Hassabis, the founder of DeepMind, still thinks Mr. Musk\u2019s views are extreme. But he said the same about the views of Mr. Zuckerberg. The threat is not here, he said. Not yet. But Facebook\u2019s problems are a warning.\u201cWe need to use the downtime, when things are calm, to prepare for when things get serious in the decades to come,\u201d said Mr. Hassabis. \u201cThe time we have now is valuable, and we need to make use of it.\u201dCade Metz reported from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "The Rich Are Planning to Leave This Wretched Planet", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byatmosphereHere comes private space travel \u2014 with cocktails, retro-futuristic Philippe Starck designs and Wi-Fi. Just $55 million a trip!Now a company called Axiom Space is giving those with piles of money and an adventuresome spirit something new to lust after: the prospect of an eight-day trip to space that is plush, if not entirely comfortable, and with a bit of the luster of NASA as well.\u201cIt\u2019s no New York hotel room,\u201d he said with a shrug, as if apologizing for its size.\u201cMy vision is to create a comfortable egg, friendly, where walls are so soft and in harmony with the movements of the human body in zero gravity,\u201d Mr. Starck wrote in an email, calling his intended effect \u201ca first approach to infinity. The traveler should physically and mentally feel his or her action of floating in the universe.\u201dBrace for the rise of the cosmos-scenti.\u201cThe guys who are doing Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are going to the edge of space \u2014 they\u2019re not going into orbit,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is a cool experience. It gives you about 15 minutes of microgravity and you see the curvature of the earth, but you don\u2019t get the same experience that you get from viewing the earth from above, and spending time reflecting, contemplating.\u201dAnd, naturally, posting to Instagram. \u201cThere will be Wi-Fi,\u201d Mr. Suffredini said. \u201cEverybody will be online. They can make phone calls, sleep, look out the window.\u201dMaybe it will be so nice they\u2019ll want to stay there.The Starck-designed station will supposedly open in 2022, but Axiom says they can start sending curious travelers into orbit as early as 2020. (Note: nearly everything space-related is delayed by years, sometimes decades.) They\u2019ll just have to make do with the comparatively rugged accommodations of the International Space Station, which is working with Axiom in addition to other commercial space station outfits. Axiom\u2019s station can house eight passengers, including a professional astronaut. Each will pay $55 million for the adventure, which includes 15 weeks of training, much of it at the Johnson Space Center, a 10-minute drive from Axiom\u2019s headquarters, and possibly a trip on one of Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX rockets. Thus far, three entities have signed up for on-the-ground training, which starts at $1 million, Mr. Suffredini said, though he declined to name them. The inaugural trip will be only $50 million. \u201cIt\u2019s a bargain!\u201d he said. \u201cThe lion\u2019s share of the cost comes from the flight up and down,\u201d Mr. Suffredini went on. \u201cRocket rides are expensive. You know people\u201d \u2014 meaning competitors \u2014 \u201cdon\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about if they\u2019re quoting prices substantially less than what we\u2019re stating.\u201d Axiom guests will be required to wear a NASA-grade spacesuit for the rocket ride to and from the station. (Features include a fiberglass torso and a drink tube for consuming small sips of water. Also, a diaper.) Years after Pierre Cardin, Paco Rabanne and Andre Courr\u00e8ges envisioned space-age fashion, Axiom is also in talks with a high-end European fashion house it also declined to name about custom-designing leisure suits travelers can wear once they dock. \u201cThey will be tailored to each person and can be customized with their own logo, if they want,\u201d Ms. Rein said \u201cIt\u2019s a very special keepsake and part of their luxury experience.\u201dTo understand the grand scale of Axiom\u2019s plans, it helps to know that astronauts have, thus far, largely been roughing it up there. The Johnson Space Center contains a life-size mock-up of the ISS, whose drab, beige interior is lined with drab, gray handholds to tether down things and people, necessary given the lack of gravity. A tour guide quaintly referred to the onboard bathroom as a \u201cpotty.\u201d There are no showers. \u201cThe few folks that have gone to orbit as tourists, it wasn\u2019t really a luxurious experience, it was kind of like camping,\u201d said Mr. Suffredini. The Axiom station will still have hand holds, but thanks to Mr. Starck (who Mr. Suffredini hadn\u2019t heard of before Axiom\u2019s branding consultant suggested they hire him) they will be plated in gold or wrapped in buttery leather, like the steering wheel of a Mercedes. Axiom\u2019s private cabins will have screens for Netflixing and chilling \u2014 there\u2019s not a lot to do up there, although going outside to do a spacewalk is a possibility \u2014 and there will be a great, glass-walled cupola to gather with travelers and take in a more panoramic view of the earth, perhaps with an adult beverage.You\u2019ll want to pack deodorant. \u201cThere's a hygiene compartment where you do kind of a sponge bath,\u201d said Mr. Suffredini. Fond of folksy sayings (he referred to wine as \u201cfruit of the vine\u201d) and thorough explanations, Mr. Suffredini, who is 59, retired from NASA in 2015 with the intent of starting a commercial space venture. Soon after leaving, he became the president of the commercial space division of the engineering firm Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies, and in 2016, launched Axiom, which has raised more than $10 million in funding so far. \u201cWe\u2019ve met their engineers, we\u2019ve seen their plans, we hired domain experts that grilled them and did a deeper dive,\u201d said Lisa Rich, a founder of Hemisphere Ventures and an early Axiom investor. \u201cEverything came up with \u2018This is a big go sign, we\u2019ve got to get in on this.\u2019\u201d \u201cAt the Johnson Space Center, when Mike walks down the hall, they\u2019re all practically saluting him,\u201d Ms. Rich said. \u201cHe\u2019s a legend in his own right.\u201dMr. Suffredini\u2019s professional life has revolved around space. \u201cI was like everybody who watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon and decided that NASA was cool and wanted to work there,\u201d he said. But while he\u2019s overseen many missions, he hasn\u2019t been in orbit and has no plans to see Axiom for himself. (\u201cWe\u2019d have to work out who\u2019s going to cover my cost,\u201d he demurred, when asked.)Still, Mr. Suffredini sees Axiom as a necessary step in continuing scientific research and development in space, which he believes is crucial to the survival of our species. His company may cater to rich thrill seekers, but he insists he is an idealist.\u201cIf you just go visit and come back, you\u2019re not pioneering,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to pioneer.\u201d Pioneers include countries who have yet to send someone to space (a German organization seeking to get that country\u2019s first female astronaut in orbit is in talks with Axiom), material-science researchers, and biologists trying to understand how the human body adapts outside earth\u2019s atmosphere. Also, maybe, Tupperware.An earlier version of this article misstated the material of the Axiom space station's mock-up cabin. It is wood, not cardboard. And because of an editing error, a subheading miscalculated the height of the space station. It is 1,320,000 feet, not 132,000 feet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One-Season Wednesdays: \u2018Aliens in America\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bysummer watchingEvery Wednesday this summer, we\u2019ll be recommending a one-season show for low-commitment, high-enjoyment summer viewing. Updated weekly.\u201cAliens in America\u201d debuted on the CW in 2007, when comedies were in a weird place. That was the fall when \u201cCavemen\u201d also debuted on ABC, when \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d was still dominating the CBS comedy lineup, when \u201cEntourage\u201d was still being nominated for Emmys, when \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d was competing as a comedy. Not long, and yet very long ago. So a sitcom about a Muslim Pakistani exchange student who finds himself living with a white, nominally Christian family in Wisconsin \u2014 airing on a network that was only a year old \u2014 did not make the impression it perhaps could have.\u201cAliens\u201d aired just 18 episodes. Absolutely skip the first three, where the show is at its most expository and labored, and just know this: Justin (Dan Byrd), our narrator, is a high school dorkus whose social life is so crummy that his mother, Franny (Amy Pietz), agrees to house a foreign exchange student, Raja (Adhir Kalyan), in the hopes that Justin will make a friend and gain some social footing. It sort of works. Justin remains at the very bottom of the social ladder, but he and Raja are instantly and sweetly best friends.The show is often called a \u201cfish out of water story,\u201d but that\u2019s not quite right. There\u2019s no water, or maybe no fish: No one here is totally comfortable, and none of the characters find their environment completely suitable. Franny is frustrated by her family\u2019s indifference to her (sometimes smothering) efforts. Her husband, Gary (Scott Patterson), loses his job and, with it, his identity. Their daughter, Claire (Lindsey Shaw), thrives on the cutthroat popularity game, but she also craves more meaningful validation. Justin refers to himself as an alien, having no idea how to fit in better.So \u201cAliens\u201d is really just a family comedy. It has a lot in common with \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d or \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d right down to the not-always-necessary narration, the clear sibling roles, the contrived but deeply revered suburban rituals.Revisiting the show this week, I was struck by how darling it is, how gently it regards that floppy, scary, badly dressed, constantly stressed time of teenhood, when boys wear the ugliest sandals on earth and eat 17 cupcakes in a sitting. (I was also struck by the occasional use of the word retarded, a term that has rightly been banished since the show aired.)This ensemble cast is where \u201cKitchen Confidential\u201d really shines: John Cho, Nicholas Brendon, Jaime King, John Francis Daley and Bonnie Somerville have great chemistry and alternately squabble, flirt and get up to high jinks against the backdrop of the glitzy Manhattan restaurant scene. (One episode is focused around the star power of Lindsay Lohan\u2019s dog.)Do you ever feel like you\u2019re being gaslit by members of the underworld? Then look no further than this demon-hunting comedy on Netflix, by way of Channel 4, which offers a roadmap for women navigating personal, and actual, demons.In \u201cCrazyhead,\u201d Susan Wokoma and Cara Theobold star as Raquel and Amy, two young women in Bristol who have the ability to see the malevolent, supernatural beings who walk among us. Since this isn\u2019t a common gift, they are treated as if they were unwell, resulting in both having a justified skepticism of prescription-happy doctors and psychiatric institutions. This all helps to cement their friendship. Fast.Which is good, because the demons, who occupy Southwest England have been up to no good. It\u2019s a fast-paced romp through bowling alleys and night clubs, full of scatological, dark humor.Our picks for One-Season Wednesdays have usually been shows you might have missed a few years ago. Here, for a change, is a great show that was airing just two weeks ago, but chances are you weren\u2019t watching it. Fox\u2019s \u201cGhosted,\u201d a charming series that was part paranormal police procedural, part workplace sitcom, ended its first and, as far as we know, only season on July 22.During its short life it had an onerous distinction: It was jerked around in a classic broadcast-network fashion that we\u2019re less used to seeing in the short-season, streaming era. Fox seemed to be in the show\u2019s corner after it debuted last fall, announcing an order for an additional six episodes (bringing the total to 16). But in January it yanked the show from the schedule for six months, burning off the extra episodes this summer.The first nine weeks were an \u201cX-Files\u201d parody involving mismatched partners solving wacky-alien cases of the week. But then, Fox switched showrunners midstream \u2014 Paul Lieberstein, an \u201cOffice\u201d alumnus, replaced Kevin Etten \u2014 and \u201cGhosted\u201d ended up being two different series in a single season. The final six episodes dropped the existing plot lines for a more serialized and naturalistic comedy about office underdogs. The result is a season that is not a natural binge, but each of the two sections of the season works on its own terms, centered as they both are on the comic teamwork of Craig Robinson and Adam Scott, who play a police detective turned mall cop and a physics professor turned bookstore clerk. Recruited to a clandestine government E.T.-hunting agency, they\u2019re a low-rent Scully and Mulder with something to prove, and Robinson and Scott are equally funny in the season\u2019s more raucous first half and its more melancholy second.Remember that time that Baz Luhrmann, the Australian filmmaker famed for his indulgence of dizzying pastiche in \u201cRomeo + Juliet\u201d and \u201cMoulin Rouge,\u201d decided to create a series about the last days of disco, the birth of hip-hop and political corruption in the Bronx? No, it was not the stuff mad libs are made of. It was Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d a musical extravaganza set during the late \u201970s, which has an impressive ensemble of reliable character actors and vibrant newcomers \u2014 and a sick soundtrack.At the center of this delightful pop opera are two young dreamers: Mylene (Herizen F. Guardiola), a pastor\u2019s daughter torn between abiding by her strict religious upbringing and becoming the next Donna Summer, and Ezekiel (Justice Smith), a smart poet who aspires to escape the Bronx. Guardiola and Smith make a convincing pair as high school kids in love, evoking all the awkwardness and uncertainty of their age. They play against a backdrop of story lines touching on race, class and religion (for starters) with a sensory overload of elaborate production numbers, cultural references (Star Wars, kung fu, Grandmaster Flash) and wildly alternating cinematic styles.I\u2019ll admit my bias up front: I love John Cho. I think he is a fine actor who is also quite charming and extremely good looking! I would watch anything that cast him as a romantic lead. And that is pretty much exclusively the short-lived 2014 ABC sitcom \u201cSelfie.\u201d\u201cSelfie\u201d is ostensibly a \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d update set in the offices of a children\u2019s pharmaceutical company. Cho plays Henry Higgs, a stuffy marketing guru tasked with rebranding Karen Gillan\u2019s Eliza Dooley, a social-media famous sales rep who can\u2019t socialize in real life. The premise is silly, and the internet references were stale even four years ago. But the show\u2019s charms reveal themselves as the relationship between the leads transcends those priors.\u201cSelfie\u201d is about the acts we put on to distance ourselves from one another, online and off, but once the show allows Cho and Gillan to get close, they spark. Things really get going around Episode 6, in which Eliza and Henry touch, in a sexy way, for the first time, then recoil back into their defensive poses. At which point: ABC promptly canceled the show. But on Hulu, you can watch the remainder of the first truncated season and marinate in their will-they-or-won\u2019t-they thing for a full 13 episodes.This show might also have been too weird. It transported the biblical story of David to a world that looked a lot like America in 2009, but it was accented with motifs found in dystopian futuristic fantasies, such as a \u201cHunger Games\u201d-like decadence in the capital city. Beyond that, it was vaguely religious, with frequent, jarring mentions of God and sincere invocations of divine right.Yet it\u2019s utterly binge-worthy, and perfect summer-watching fun.After all, what operatic plot isn\u2019t? There\u2019s palace intrigue, young love, closeted homosexuality, illegitimate children, war, assassination \u2014 the list goes on, much of it absurd, such as a kaleidoscope of monarch butterflies that land on David\u2019s head like a crown. (Get it?) Prepare yourself, though: This show was canceled before the writers could achieve much resolution. For the nearly 10 years since the season finale, I\u2019ve been wondering what happened to David, who was hapless yet destined for great things.It\u2019s been a joy to revisit \u201cKings\u201d recently, not only for the delicious plot but also for the fun of trying to figure out its filming locations, like watching a Nora Ephron or Woody Allen movie. The series takes place in a city called Shiloh, but it\u2019s clearly just New York with the Empire State Building edited out and a few glossy skyscrapers added in.Filled with irreverent jokes fired like fastballs, the 13 episodes of this Fox comedy are a breeze to binge and are smartly satisfying, even as they leave a bitter aftertaste. \u201cAction\u201d debuted in 1999, placing it a few years (and a few bleeps) too ahead of its time to last longer than a single season on broadcast TV. But the audacity of its satire, which skewered the very Hollywood industry that created it, is still surprising, even now.Jay Mohr stars as Peter Dragon, a Hollywood movie producer who is reeling from an action-movie flop and in desperate need of a hit. That means the frequent demeaning of others and himself as he fights to stay on top: He\u2019s queasily lecherous, he\u2019s conniving, and he\u2019s perfectly willing to throw a colleague to the wolves in order to make a deal.Later in the week, Kate, who feels like a \u201cweird Craigslist roommate\u201d living with Pete and his three children from two previous marriages, tells Pete she wants more parental responsibilities. So he offers her a herculean task: putting Bert to sleep.\u201cTrophy Wife\u201d is full of arcs like this: good, clean comedy in the style of \u201cModern Family,\u201d with humor that ranges from silly to absurd. Most of the main plot lines center on Kate\u2019s struggle to define her role in a family that includes the precocious and cheeky Bert (\u201cI get a horndog?\u201d he exclaims when his parents buy him a puppy, having overheard a word he shouldn\u2019t), as well as two teenagers and two ex-wives: Diane Buckley (Marcia Gay Harden), a no-nonsense surgeon with an unmatched talent for beer pong, and Jackie Fisher (Michaela Watkins), an obsessive yoga-meditation-reiki-farmers\u2019-market lover with no interest in boundaries.Here is what you can expect from the first five minutes of \u201cSwingtown,\u201d a one-season fantasy that opens in July 1976. With \u201cYour Love Is Lifting Me Higher\u201d as the backing track, you get: a simulated simulated sex act; a simulated actual sex act; the sentence \u201cMy wife is going to love you\u201d; Grant Show, bred in a lab for just this role, sporting a pornstache and a white tank top; a large can of Tab with a soft aluminum pull; a threesome; Lana Parrilla; the sentence \u201cI feel like I\u2019m ready for the next thing.\u201dThe episode goes on to include: a Harvey Wallbanger; a glass of Chablis; the line dance where you roll your hands; polyester halter dresses; the phrase \u201cWe missed the whole Woodstock counterculture thing\u201d; the response \u201cThe train is still boarding\u201d; cocaine being done with $100 bill; cocaine being rubbed on the gums; sunglasses that start dark but fade toward the bottom; quaaludes; hair so feathered that it might take off at the next breeze; did I mention the basement orgy?But for all its flamboyance and audacity, \u201cSwingtown\u201d does a good job of exploring a generation of people who aren\u2019t quite sure why they fell for the traditional value of marriage, which (like swinging, to me at least), seems like more trouble than it\u2019s worth. It\u2019s a meditation on conservatism, risk, values, fidelity and aging. And swinging.Why did it have to die? Why was it pulled away from us too soon? Why was it gone before it could answer the question of whether people who have key parties bought the fishbowl just for the key party or if there was a dead fish in its past? \u201cSwingtown\u201d was a midseason replacement in the summer of 2008. Entities like the American Family Association and Parents Television Council wrote strongly worded letters to CBS to try to get a boycott going. Man, I miss those swingers. There were cliffhangers in the season finale that I still think about. Mostly I\u2019m grateful for \u201cSwingtown\u201d because it allows me to continue to participate in my fantasy that I think we all share about swingers, which is that all they think about is swinging \u2014 that it consumes their every day, that their lives are built around it.I\u2019m pretty sure the denizens of \u201cSwingtown\u201d would agree with me when I say that I don\u2019t think guilty pleasures exist. Pleasure exists \u2014 I know they\u2019d agree with me about that. But I beg you, do not feel guilty about the pleasure that \u201cSwingtown\u201d can bring you over the course of its 13 delicious hours. Like its predecessor and successor, this 2012-13 ABC Family (R.I.P.) series is a show about starting over. Here, it\u2019s Michelle (the Broadway veteran Sutton Foster) going through upheaval. A classically trained ballerina stranded in a Vegas chorus line, she winds up \u2014 through a first-episode twist I won\u2019t spoil \u2014 alone and jobless in the small town of Paradise, Calif., teaching dance.In some surface ways, \u201cBunheads\u201d plays like a \u201cGilmore\u201d revival. Paradise is more or less Stars Hollow but warmer (meteorologically and culturally). The cast includes Kelly Bishop as Fanny Flowers, the imperious dance teacher who takes Michelle on; other familiar \u201cGilmore\u201d faces include Liza Weil and Sean Gunn in a cameo as a haughty barista. (Also a recurring favorite from \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d: coffee.) But the true secret weapons of \u201cBunheads\u201d are the four teenage students whom Michelle and Fanny mentor, whose show the series gradually becomes. Artistic aspiration and teen coming-of-age are two bittersweet tastes that taste great together, each with its own flavor profile of longing, rejection and fumbling toward identity. This German series (with English subtitles) clocks in at only eight episodes, and it\u2019s too intense to binge; don\u2019t watch more than two at a time unless you want to feel extremely trashola about everything. That\u2019s not to say the show is wall-to-wall violence \u2014 it\u2019s not, and there are poppy, fun moments, and sweet and silly ones. But a lot of brutality and sorrow, too. The show is, as you might expect, set in a divided Germany in 1983. Martin (Jonas Nay) is a young East German soldier with the odd luck of looking a lot like a West German soldier named Moritz, who is preparing to become an aide to a powerful general. East German forces kill Moritz, and Martin is recruited to pose as him in West Berlin, thus collecting all kinds of valuable intelligence.Unlike the spies in most stories, Martin is largely mediocre. In one memorable training montage, he can barely learn how to hand off small parcels discreetly. He\u2019s also utterly taken with the food and music and culture of West Berlin. But he\u2019s not there for shenanigans, and his responsibilities to his country, his family and himself sometimes pull him in opposing directions. This is further complicated by the fact that his aunt is one of his Stasi bosses.In \u201cCrashing,\u201d Waller-Bridge plays Lulu, a luminous troublemaker who moves into the hospital to follow her old friend Anthony, who lives there with his uptight fianc\u00e9e, Kate. This of course creates tension. There\u2019s also the moody French artist Melody, the sex-crazed and often offensive Sam, and the lovable, anxious Fred.Lulu sees herself as cool and whimsical, but she\u2019s really just callous and irresponsible. When she shows up with her ukulele in tow, strumming improvised songs, Kate is immediately a little put off. \u201cWow, quirky!\u201d she says. \u201cThanks, I try really hard,\u201d Lulu jokes. Well, sort of jokes. Lulu is the quintessence of the kind of woman other women see as artificial but men see as charming, and Waller-Bridge devilishly plays with these types and conventions in interesting but still empathetic ways.There\u2019s an abundance of love and romance and sex on \u201cCrashing,\u201d much of it completely charming. There\u2019s also genuine friction among the characters, along with struggles to set healthy boundaries and to be decent people.Advertisement"}

Step One: Lure New Talent.", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI\u2019m out there banging the drum,\u201d Ms. Salke, 53, said last week, striking the air with two imaginary mallets.\u201cI\u2019m a killer, and I\u2019m ambitious, and I\u2019m going to compete,\u201d she added.Ms. Salke, who was previously a president of entertainment at NBC, had decided that the time had come to take her campaign public. One by one on Thursday, reporters from various publications were invited over \u2014 never mind those pictures still waiting to be hung \u2014 to briefly chat about her strategy while snacking on cheese and crackers.Her message to Hollywood\u2019s creative community boiled down to this: Amazon now has its act together \u2014 come join us.One television kingpin seen as potentially being available in the next year or two is Dick Wolf, whose \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and \u201cChicago\u201d series have powered NBC for two decades.\u201cDick is a very close friend of mine,\u201d Ms. Salke said, putting her hand on her heart. \u201cHe and I are talking. In fact, we\u2019re talking about developing something together.\u201dShe added: \u201cA few months in, I\u2019m not going to be publicly poaching. But I\u2019m going to be out there like I was with Jordan, proactively approaching people who are available or coming available.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re homing in on a strategy,\u201d she said of the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d adaptation. \u201cThe estate has actually been super helpful. Offering insight. Giving permission to make some big moves. They\u2019re not being precious.\u201dFor a company that spent an estimated $4.5 billion on programming last year, however, the programing slate is thin.\u201cWe\u2019re not going for something small and niche,\u201d said Ms. Salke, describing her strategy. \u201cYou can still have something that feels specific. But it needs to invite people in.\u201dThat\u2019s certainly how her bosses in Seattle feel. Because Amazon\u2019s hefty investment in content has yielded only mixed results in Hollywood, it is up to Ms. Salke to change that as quickly as possible.\u201cThe pressure on Amazon is their Prime membership growth has been slowing,\u201d said Greg Melich, a retail analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cAs a result, they need the members they have to get that much more engaged. And people that stream content also shop more frequently, spend more and are more likely to renew their Prime membership.\u201dMs. Salke comes to Amazon with a proven track record. She helped orchestrate a turnaround for NBC, taking it from a nadir when it briefly abandoned 10 p.m. dramas to first place for each of the last two seasons. During her tenure, NBC found the smash hit \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d Ms. Salke previously worked at Fox\u2019s television production studio, where she guided notable shows like \u201cGlee\u201d for Fox and \u201cModern Family\u201d for ABC.Dan Fogelman, the creator of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d credited Ms. Salke with taking an interest in his drama even before it became a runaway hit.\u201cWhen she is impassioned about a project, she is more intimately involved with the material than a quote-unquote entertainment president normally would be,\u201d he said.Ms. Salke may luck out with another film from the Price era, however \u2014 one from Mr. Fogelman. He directed \u201cLife Itself,\u201d a romantic drama about intersecting lives over multiple generations that is scheduled for release by Amazon in September. Amazon has high box office hopes for the film, which could also figure in the Academy Awards race.Ms. Salke will probably add a senior executive to Amazon\u2019s film team. With movies, \u201cwe want to maintain the level of excellence,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, we do want to widen the aperture a little bit.\u201dBrooks Barnes reported from Culver City, and John Koblin from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hello, You Must Be Going: Hulu Parts With a Top Executive", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast summer, the executive Joel Stillerman started work at Hulu as its first-ever chief content officer. On Friday, the streaming platform announced that he was out.Hulu hired Mr. Stillerman to pursue ambitious original programming and acquire shows from other networks for its expanding library. But soon after he moved from New York, where AMC has its headquarters, to Santa Monica, Calif., where Hulu is based, he ran into knotty complications.Mr. Stillerman\u2019s vision for Hulu\u2019s future did not impress his corporate overlords, and there were some chemistry issues with Mr. Freer, said three people familiar with the reasoning behind his departure. Mr. Freer, now seven months into the job, made the decision to reorganize the company.A Hulu spokeswoman said, \u201cThis change was entirely due to the reorganization, and not at all about performance.\u201d Mr. Stillerman declined to comment.Even before he took the job of chief content officer, the position was not exactly seen as one of the hottest jobs in Hollywood. It had taken Hulu several months to fill it, partly because of the company\u2019s unique \u2014 some would say tangled \u2014 corporate structure.Unlike Netflix executives, who have the freedom to make deals with little oversight, Hulu\u2019s leaders must answer to many masters: the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner, all partial owners.The merger mania sweeping through corporate media means that the latest reshuffling may stay in place for only so long. If Disney prevails in its bid to acquire most of 21st Century Fox, it will become Hulu\u2019s majority owner. On the other hand, if Comcast succeeds with its rogue bid for most of 21st Century Fox, it will assume 60 percent of the company. Whatever the outcome, Hulu is likely to have a majority owner for the first time \u2014 and, with it, a new content strategy.For the time being, the position of chief content officer has been expunged.As Hulu has introduced a live TV service and expanded its original programming and its library of content, which now includes vintage shows like \u201cER\u201d and \u201c30 Rock,\u201d its number of subscribers has surpassed 20 million. And yet the losses are mounting: In 2017, the company lost nearly $1 billion, a figure that will climb to more than $1.5 billion this year, according to the firm BTIG.Spending freely seems to be part of doing business in streaming, however: Netflix is expected to have a negative free cash flow of anywhere between $3 billion and $4 billion this year.Hulu, which is available only domestically, has undergone shifts in its identity several times since it started in 2007. Until the success of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d it was seen primarily as a place where viewers could click their way to last night\u2019s episode of a network television show.In addition to the news about Mr. Stillerman, Hulu announced that the senior vice president of experience, Ben Smith, and the head of partnerships and distribution. Tim Connolly, were no longer with the company.\u201cBen, Tim and Joel have all played a significant role in getting Hulu to the strong position it is in today,\u201d Mr. Freer, the chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cThey will forever be a part of Hulu\u2019s success story, and we wish them the very best in their next endeavors.\u201dBut it wasn\u2019t all departures. The streaming service has hired Dan Phillips, the former chief operating officer of TiVo, as its new chief technology officer. Jaya Kolhatkar, formerly a Walmart executive, will become Hulu\u2019s first chief data officer.Advertisement"}

Come back every Friday for new suggestions from our TV critic on what to watch.It\u2019s not too late to get on the \u201cPose\u201d train \u2014 this is only the third episode, and while the first two are great and worthwhile, you can just join in now. The show is set within the New York drag scene of the 1980s, rebellious and glamorous and raw. On this week\u2019s episode, it\u2019s Christmas, although Angel (Indya Moore) and the others are not much in the holiday spirit. \u201cPose\u201d moves with the energy of an underdog sports movie, and even when it\u2019s dwelling in serious and sometimes tragic moments, it still feels celebratory.This aired as a two-part mini-series in Britain, but it is airing on PBS as a feature \u2014 still neatly in two halves, though. The first half is the sad, doomed love story of two World War II soldiers, Michael and Thomas (Oliver Jackson-Cohen and James McArdle). After the war, Michael unhappily marries a woman, Flora; Thomas begs him to imagine what their lives together could be like, but homosexuality was still criminalized in England at the time. The second half is set in the present day and centers on Flora and Michael\u2019s grandson, Adam, and his own struggle to come out in a still-homophobic society.Season 1 of \u201cGoliath\u201d came out almost two years ago, but don\u2019t worry about needing a refresher for this savvy, often hilarious legal drama. Billy Bob Thornton (right, with Lou Diamond Phillips) stars as brilliant but seedy lawyer, now flush with cash thanks to last season\u2019s big courtroom win. He reluctantly returns to work in order to help a friend\u2019s son, who is wrongly accused of a double murder. If you like grown-up shows about smart people, watch this.Thornton won a Golden Globe for his performance in Season 1, and he\u2019s just as good this go-round \u2014 wily and shockingly sympathetic for someone who\u2019s a lowlife and a drunk. (His daughter greets him by saying, \u201cHow\u2019s the drinking?\u201d) We, as a culture, truly do know how to make legal dramas, and \u201cGoliath\u201d is a shining example of that well-earned knowledge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: \u2018Live Like a French Woman\u2019 Books", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationSeveral years ago, a website asked a bunch of contributors, including me, to write about our most embarrassing favorite books. When the piece went live, I scanned it eagerly at first, and then with dawning horror. Some writers listed fantasy novels, or flirtations with Ayn Rand. A few mentioned Kerouac. And then there was mine: \u201cI did go through a period where I would covertly \u2014 but slavishly \u2014 read every book I could lay my hands on on how to be sexy/chic/mysterious/alluring like a French woman,\u201d I wrote. It was, by far, the most embarrassing admission on the list.But at least I know I\u2019m not alone in my shame. The Frenchwoman how-to is a mainstay of the industry, the publishing equivalent of a bottomless brunch. A visit to your local bookstore will tell you not merely how to dress, eat and raise children like a Frenchwoman but also how to buy lingerie, decorate your home, seduce a man after a certain age and wear perfume \u2014 this last suggestion, unlike the rest, seems to have taken. I cannot resist a single one of these volumes; I own them all. Indeed, my shameful French-girl library takes up an entire suitcase that I keep stashed under my bed, like Breton-striped porn.The books devoted to this legendary woman all fall into three basic categories. One: Wise Frenchwoman, dismayed by American crumminess, deigns to share her wisdom on, say, how she and her countrywomen don\u2019t get fat. Two: North American schlub marries Frenchman, becomes expat and learns secrets of life, home d\u00e9cor, child rearing and bras from French fairy godmother. Three: The sad-sack protagonist has passing experience of idealized France \u2014 generally a year abroad \u2014 and brings back superficial lessons to transform the lives of fellow sad-sacks.This is the part I love. While it is the Frenchwoman who is the ostensible protagonist of these stories, it\u2019s the wretched North American slattern we really get to know. And in an era when we\u2019re told to practice self-love, there\u2019s something perversely glorious about wallowing in such a cesspool of self-loathing. We cheer for her. We want her to succeed \u2014 impress her mother-in-law with her children\u2019s palates, lose that excess weight by limiting herself to only the finest pastries, prune her closet to beautifully curated investment pieces. By the end of the book, the American or Canadian has learned what\u2019s important, looks chic and despises her own kind with the zeal of a convert. It\u2019s as satisfying as a makeover montage and as predictable as an episode of \u201cSVU.\u201dSadie Stein is a writer based in New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Waiting for Po-Po in a Searing \u2018Pass Over\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe game is called \u201cpromised land top ten,\u201d and you get the feeling that Moses and Kitch, the main characters in Antoinette Nwandu\u2019s blazingly theatrical play \u201cPass Over,\u201d have been at it forever, whiling away time and tamping down dread.As one calls out the count, the other announces things he\u2019d like to see should he be lucky enough to \u201cpass over\u201d into paradise. Soft sheets, a girlfriend and brown bunnies \u2014 the characters are barely past puberty \u2014 mix uncomfortably with \u201cmy brotha here with me back from the dead.\u201d Footwear figures prominently on both lists: for Moses, a drawer full of clean socks; for Kitch, a pair of Air Jordans, \u201cnot thrift store new\u201d but \u201cnew new.\u201dThat\u2019s no metaphor; death, hovering so closely around them, may be the only thing they can confidently expect to achieve. So many of their friends have achieved it already, at the hands of the police, that they give up trying to name them after about two dozen. What\u2019s more, they frequently rehearse their own demise, or at least their close calls, suddenly falling to the ground amid their games and rituals at the real or imagined approach of the officers they call \u201cpo-pos.\u201dDespite its grim relevance, \u201cPass Over\u201d creates a vivid world of injustice while riffing on earlier ones. Moses and Kitch specifically recall not only Beckett\u2019s vaudevillians, but also enslaved African-Americans working a plantation and even biblical Israelites escaping from Egypt. At any moment, elements of these antecedents may erupt through the skin of the modern tale, as if to say that the current crisis for young black men is a tragedy too big for one era to encompass.Technically, it is ideal; Wilson Chin\u2019s set, striking in itself, also hints at the historical connections with its grimy streetlamp standing in for Beckett\u2019s sad tree and its slice of sidewalk surrounded by a desert of sand. The sound design (by Justin Ellington), costume design (by Sarafina Bush) and especially the lighting design (by Marcus Doshi) all contribute at a similarly high level to the feeling of theatrical entrapment.Within this prison, Ms. Nwandu has been careful to particularize and humanize her main characters so that the tragedy is not just theoretical or surreal. Moses (Jon Michael Hill) is the alpha male, stoical and sophisticated. (He knows, as Kitch does not, that caviar is fish eggs.) Kitch (Namir Smallwood) is more dependent and deferential, apter to sulk but also more watchful. Both actors are excellent, building complex characters from the rough urban patois that Ms. Nwandu provides without getting purple, even while approaching a kind of street poetry.It\u2019s hard to say, though, what Ms. Nwandu intends in her shaping of the two white characters, both played by Gabriel Ebert. One, called Mister, wanders into the scene like Little Red Riding Hood carrying a magic picnic basket; he\u2019s a dandy in a white suit, saddle shoes and argyle socks. A corollary to Beckett\u2019s pompous Pozzo, he offers food and \u201csalutations\u201d and says \u201cgosh golly gee\u201d but soon reveals an angrier and even sinister aspect.Mr. Ebert\u2019s other role \u2014 a police officer whose quasi-sexual sadism is barely more than a clich\u00e9 \u2014 departs from the \u201cGodot\u201d template, and from Ms. Nwandu\u2019s general interest in examining real humans despite the surreal setting. She may be asking us to consider whether police violence against young black men should be humanized at all, or whether, at least as seen by Moses and Kitch, it can be. To them, \u201cOssifer,\u201d as he\u2019s called, isn\u2019t much more than a uniform and a gun: an archetype of domination, a bringer of death.My quibble is from the other direction: that the impact of the play\u2019s argument about police violence against young black men, whatever its statistical prevalence, is undercut rather than enhanced by its cartoonish conception of Ossifer.But even now, \u201cPass Over\u201d resonates as a powerful tragedy because it does not depend on the believability of its white characters, just its black ones. What the play understands (as Beckett did) is that all endangered people are tragedies in the making. The only thing necessary to dramatize this \u2014 the only thing but also the hardest thing! \u2014 is the creation of characters whose death would be a loss. Moses and Kitch, and the many others they represent, are more than sufficient.Advertisement"}

But tech companies \u2014 Uber comes to mind \u2014 often scoff at local laws. And it\u2019s not just Google that\u2019s trying to reshape cities.

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Widens Reach of Sales Tax for Online Retailers", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Americans have done more and more of their shopping online in recent years, drawn by the promise of low prices, wide selection and buy-from-home convenience. But e-commerce has also had another edge: Many of those sales were, in effect, tax-free.The Supreme Court on Thursday moved to close that loophole, ruling that internet retailers can be required to collect sales taxes even in states where they have no physical presence.\u201cState and local governments have really been dealing with a nightmare scenario for several years now,\u201d said Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington think tank. \u201cThis is going to allow state and local governments to improve their tax enforcement and to put local business on a more level playing field.\u201dBut as online retailing has grown, the dynamics have shifted. Online sellers are no longer scrappy upstarts competing with more established businesses. Amazon had $119 billion in revenue from product sales last year, making it bigger than all but the largest traditional retailers.And state budgets are increasingly feeling the pinch. Writing for the majority in the 5-to-4 ruling, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the Quill decision caused states to lose annual tax revenues of up to $33 billion.\u201cQuill puts both local businesses and many interstate businesses with physical presence at a competitive disadvantage relative to remote sellers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRemote sellers can avoid the regulatory burdens of tax collection and can offer de facto lower prices caused by the widespread failure of consumers to pay the tax on their own.\u201dJustices Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch joined the majority opinion.In dissent, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. agreed that the court\u2019s rulings in this area had been \u201cwrongly decided,\u201d but said there were insufficient reasons to overrule the precedents. \u201cAny alteration to those rules with the potential to disrupt the development of such a critical segment of the economy should be undertaken by Congress,\u201d he wrote.Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the dissent.South Dakota responded by enacting a law that required all merchants to collect a 4.5 percent sales tax if they had more than $100,000 in annual sales or more than 200 transactions in the state. State officials sued three large online retailers \u2014 Wayfair, Overstock.com and Newegg \u2014 for violating the law. Lower courts ruled for the online retailers, citing the Quill decision.Marty Jackley, South Dakota\u2019s attorney general, called Thursday\u2019s ruling \u201ca big win for South Dakota and Main Streets across America.\u201d He said the decision could be particularly significant for rural areas where local businesses have been hit hard by competition from online retailers.Mr. Jackley is a Republican. But South Dakota\u2019s appeal drew bipartisan support, including from attorneys general in 35 states and the District of Columbia.Mr. Jackley estimated that South Dakota would be able to begin collecting sales tax on online purchases in 30 to 90 days. Other states may be close behind: Anticipating Thursday\u2019s ruling, several states, including North Dakota, have passed laws modeled on South Dakota\u2019s.President Trump, who has previously accused Amazon of avoiding taxes, wrote on Twitter that the decision was a \u201cgreat victory for consumers and retailers.\u201dOther states will have to change their laws if they want to take advantage of the decision, said Hayes Holderness, a law professor at the University of Richmond. He predicted a flurry of activity in legislatures.Many of those laws could face their own legal challenges. Justice Kennedy\u2019s decision left open the possibility that some transactions were so small and scattered that no taxes should be collected. The court also did not decide whether states may seek sales taxes retroactively, which South Dakota\u2019s law does not.For consumers, the reversal of Quill could mean paying more for products bought online. In theory, most states already require consumers to pay a \u201cuse tax\u201d equivalent to the state sales tax when buying online. But in practice, few consumers do so.Owners of brick-and-mortar stores welcomed the ruling.\u201cI firmly believe that it\u2019s a huge stride in leveling the playing field,\u201d said Jason Patton, owner of Oz Music in Tuscaloosa, Ala. \u201cIn my record store, the average price point is around $20. I\u2019m not going to say I continually lost customers because of the sales tax, but on higher-ticket items, that tax absolutely matters.\u201dShares in Amazon fell 1.1 percent on Thursday, and other online retailers took a bigger hit. Overstock.com shares were down more than 7 percent.\u201cToday, the U.S. Supreme Court has reshaped the interstate commerce landscape in a move that could impact small business innovation on the internet, which has been a driving force behind our nation\u2019s economy for the last 15 years,\u201d said Jonathan E. Johnson III, a member of Overstock.com\u2019s board.Overstock said the decision would have little impact on its business but argued that with more than 12,000 different state and local taxing districts, the ruling would present a \u201ccompliance challenge\u201d for internet start-ups. Chief Justice Roberts made a similar argument in his dissent.Many experts, however, played down that problem. When the Supreme Court decided the Quill case in 1992, complying with various state and local tax laws would have been a major hurdle for small businesses. But today, many companies offer software that helps small businesses navigate local laws.\u201cThe digital and internet revolution contributed to the problem, but those same factors contributed to the solution, which is easy-to-use tax-automation software,\u201d said Daniel Hemel, a University of Chicago law professor.Wayfair, in a statement, said it already collected sales tax on approximately 80 percent of its orders in the United States. \u201cAs a result, we do not expect today\u2019s decision to have any noticeable impact on our business,\u201d the company said.The impact on Amazon could be even smaller: As of last year, the company collected sales tax in the 45 states that have one.But about half of Amazon\u2019s total online sales come from independent merchants who simply post their inventory on the online store. In most states, those merchants are responsible for calculating and paying the various state taxes if they are owed. In the past year, Washington State and Pennsylvania have enacted laws requiring internet retailers to collect taxes on third-party sales. More states are expected to follow suit.Amazon declined to comment on the ruling.In his ruling on Thursday, Justice Kennedy wrote that world had changed since 1992, when mail-order sales totaled $180 million. Last year, remote sellers racked up sales exceeding half a trillion dollars, he noted.That growth seems unlikely to slow. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a group that supports independent businesses, said the tax-free nature of online retail had given Amazon and other internet sellers a big advantage when they needed it most.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate how much not having to collect sales tax mattered in the first 15 years of Amazon\u2019s growth,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Ben Casselman and Julie Creswell from New York.

{"Headline": "A Critic Sells Books Down by the Seashore", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "Critic\u2019s NotebookA bookstore in the village of Wigtown, Scotland, allows people to run the shop while renting an apartment upstairs. A book critic for The Times recently took his turn at the till.Supported byWIGTOWN, Scotland \u2014 Isak Dinesen had a farm in Africa. Recently, if only for a day, I had a bookstore in Scotland.It wasn\u2019t easy to get to Wigtown, in the remote Dumfries and Galloway region of Scotland, in time for my shift. Though the village is only a two-hour drive from Glasgow, a GPS sent me through 33 miles of the desolately beautiful Galloway Forest Park on a single-track road that rattled the nerves.The nerve rattling was compounded because I was driving on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of the road and with a stick shift installed on my left rather than my right. This felt like trying to use a mortar and pestle with my good arm tied behind my back. While in oncoming traffic.Best of all, Wigtown offers a literary experience unlike any other I\u2019m aware of. In town there is a good used bookstore called the Open Book, with an apartment up above, that\u2019s rentable by the week. Once you move in, the shop is yours to run as you see fit.I was handed the keys and a cash box. I was told I could reshelve and redecorate. I could invite Elena Ferrante and Thomas Pynchon to speak, and Sly Stone to play, if I could find them.The Open Book is run by a nonprofit group. It has touched a chord with so many people, from every continent, that it\u2019s booked through 2021, which is as far as Airbnb will take reservations. There\u2019s a waiting list after that. I managed to wedge myself in for a single night by begging and whining like a dog that\u2019s lost a piece of andouille sausage under the refrigerator.I opened the Open Book at 10 a.m. on a cool and overcast Monday in the spring, while nursing a generous hangover. For this I must blame Shaun Bythell, the shaggy-haired owner of Scotland\u2019s largest secondhand bookshop \u2014 helpfully, it is called the Bookshop \u2014 just down the street. He\u2019d kept me up late the previous night. The Facebook page for Bythell\u2019s shop prominently features an Amazon Kindle, mounted as if a deer head, that he blasted with a shotgun.My first task as proprietor of the Open Book was one I hadn\u2019t anticipated. What to write on the slate sandwich board that sits out front?A favorite exhortation came to mind. With chalk I scrawled: \u201cRead at whim! Read at whim! \u2014 Randall Jarrell.\u201d For the opposite side, after a bit of puzzling, and given my physical and mental state, I shakily wrote: \u201cOf course it\u2019s all right for librarians to smell of drink. \u2014 Barbara Pym.\u201d I set my board outside.It was time to get a look around. The Open Book is not entirely my kind of used bookstore in that its literature section is modest, dwarfed by the sections for miscellaneous subjects like birds and Scotland and garden design. But there was a nice shelf of Penguins under the register.My first customers were a middle-aged couple who seemed to be casing the joint for a robbery. I felt sure they would mark me out instantly as an American interloper and groan, but they merely grunted hello and set to browsing.After 10 minutes, the man brought two well-thumbed paperbacks to the register: Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s science fiction novels \u201cThe Garden of Rama\u201d and \u201cRama II.\u201dMy first sales! Together they were 8 pounds. I vaguely felt I should save the 10-pound note he handed me for framing. I made change from the cash box, noted the titles and prices in a spiral notebook left for that purpose, and my day had commenced.I\u2019ve worked in many bookstores in my life, and I hadn\u2019t realized how much I missed them. It\u2019s surprising what you learn, as if by osmosis, a daily mental steeping, about every possible subject.Often you learn more than you want to know, when people bring to the register books about hemorrhoid care, loneliness or coping with the death of a child. To this day, when a young person asks me for advice about finding employment in the word business, I say (after telling them to read like lunatics): Work in a bookstore if you can find one, or a library, all through high school and college.My second customer was a wiry and distraught-seeming woman who didn\u2019t bother to acknowledge me as she entered. She seized upon an illustrated book titled \u201cShrubs and Climbers\u201d and bought it for 2 pounds.After this, there was a drought. No customers for a half-hour or more. I sipped my coffee and stared out the window, as if scanning for tumbleweeds.Then something excellent happened. A young couple, Beth Porter and Ben Please, arrived with their infant daughter, Molly. They had musical instruments in tow: Beth, a cello; Ben, a ukulele; Molly, a toy glockenspiel.Porter and Please are the core members of the Bookshop Band. They write songs inspired by books and play them in bookstores. I\u2019d met them the night before at Bythell\u2019s apartment, which is above his store. They\u2019d decided to welcome me to Wigtown by performing an impromptu concert.My hangover dissolved in the bliss. If America\u2019s independent booksellers can\u2019t figure a way to get these two, plus Molly, to tour America, they\u2019re doing something wrong.All day, kind and eccentric locals popped in to say hello. One woman brought me shortbread. Others inquired worriedly about our American president, as if I might have a copy of the famous Russian tape.It was Jessica Fox\u2019s idea to allow guests to stay in and operate The Open Book. She\u2019s an American filmmaker who first arrived in Wigtown in 2008, possessed by the romantic dream of working in a used bookshop in Scotland.She landed at Bythell\u2019s store and the two fell in love. When word got out in 2013 that a local bookshop was going to close, she had a thought about what to do with it. Bythell\u2019s parents purchased the shop, and they arranged for a small nonprofit volunteer group to operate it. The Open Book is rentable for 28 pounds (about $37) a night.\u201cI remember thinking to myself, I can\u2019t be the only person who would love to run a bookshop by the sea,\u201d Fox told me. The store was an almost instant success. For many visitors, running the shop is the fulfillment of a lifelong fantasy. Fox tries to accommodate people with special circumstances, such as life-threatening illnesses.Fox and Bythell are no longer a couple but remain friends. She now lives in Edinburgh, but keeps a hand in the shop\u2019s operation. She\u2019s written a memoir, \u201cThree Things You Need to Know about Rockets,\u201d about her Wigtown experience.Bythell has written his own memoir, \u201cThe Diary of a Bookseller,\u201d which will be published in the United States this fall. It\u2019s among the most irascible and amusing bookseller memoirs I\u2019ve read. Sample line: \u201cI am putting together a mental jigsaw of what a hobbit looks like, based on a composite of every customer I have ever sold a copy to.\u201dIf this all sounds like a romantic comedy, it may become one. Fox\u2019s and Bythell\u2019s books were recently optioned together by Annapurna Pictures (\u201cAmerican Hustle,\u201d \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d) for a possible television project.Fox and her group have no plans to open a second Open Book. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to feel like a franchise,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to dilute the specialness of it.\u201dThough there were many browsers while I ran the shop, and as many as six people in the store at once, I sold only three books in the afternoon.I did buy a small pile of books myself \u2014 so many that, when added to other books I\u2019d bought while traveling, Norwegian Airlines charged me for overweight luggage flying home.Before I closed up the shop, I pulled my sandwich board inside, locked the front door and dropped the keys through a slot. Mentally, I was making plans to run this place, in 2022 or 2023, for as long as they will allow me. With luck, Bythell will take me out for some Kindle-shooting.Advertisement"}

Hughley, Taye Diggs, Martina McBride) as well as the writers who, against all odds, have become celebrities by writing books (Michael Wolff, Amor Towles, Jodi Picoult). The music was very loud. True to its name, this literary magazine, founded in 2002, publishes just one piece of short fiction in every issue. On Friday, May 4, it held its annual fund-raiser (ticket sales, but there was also an auction of manuscript pages from the likes of Ann Patchett and Colson Whitehead), which is also an occasion to toast alumnae who have, in the last calendar year, published their first book. Thus, it\u2019s a debutante ball. \u201cYou can dress up or you can wear whatever you want, everyone talks about books, then eats finger sandwiches and gets drunk, and then dances to Lil Jon,\u201d said the novelist Angelica Baker, who was a One Story debutante in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect party.\u201dAmazon hosted a reception on Wednesday, May 30, to celebrate Book Expo America. The rooftop venue afforded a beautiful view, though as the sun vanished the evening grew quite cold.Stepping into the Midtown French restaurant where this imprint of Penguin Random House celebrated Book Expo America was like being transported to the days when John Cheever supported a family by publishing short stories and chat shows were eager to book Truman Capote. Editor in chief and chairman Sonny Mehta lingered outside, perhaps in deference to the city\u2019s smoking laws. There were so many hors d\u2019oeuvres that by the time the petit fours came out no one was eating. The novelist Tara Isabella Burton took off her heels and padded around the restaurant in bare feet.In an earlier version of this article, the author Lesley Nneka Arimah was quoted as saying that the maximum amount of books she could take out of the library when she was young was 15.

The Orlando Police Department and the Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Oregon were among the first to try the program.The program thrust Amazon into the center of a heated debate around the role of facial recognition in law enforcement.

{"Headline": "In Vancouver, a Housing Frenzy That Even Owners Want to End", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "Facing a crisis of affordability, officials are trying to reduce real estate demand through a package of tax measures, some aimed at foreign buyers.Supported byHere is a new one: Vancouver is so expensive that politicians want to tax its real estate market into submission, and many homeowners \u2014 who will lose money if home prices fall \u2014 think it\u2019s the best idea they\u2019ve heard in years.\u201cI would like to see a correction to sober up this whole place,\u201d said Rob Welsh, a retired airplane mechanic who lives in a Vancouver suburb. Mr. Welsh bought his house in 2000 and has become a paper millionaire based on its appreciation. It makes him more anxious than happy.\u201cIf I got to lose 200 or 300 grand to keep the kids and the future of this place, so be it,\u201d he said.Like many cities around the world, Vancouver is grappling with punishing housing costs that have pushed out large swaths of residents \u2014 and are causing distress among young adults who can\u2019t afford rent today and take it for granted that they will never own a home.Part of the reason is the attraction of Vancouver itself, and not just among Canadians. Between its natural beauty, its temperate climate and Canada\u2019s liberal immigration policies, the city has become a magnet for foreign buyers, especially from China.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that many of the measures we are bringing in are bold, but we felt they were critical if we were really going to address this crisis,\u201d Carole James, British Columbia\u2019s finance minister, said in an interview.No doubt, many voters would think twice about that opinion if home prices actually crashed. Still, respondents \u201cwere clearly reacting from a place of deep anxiety, even desperation, about their own or their loved ones\u2019 ability to access the housing market,\u201d said Shachi Kurl, executive director of Angus Reid.\u201cUnbeknownst to many people in the local population, Vancouver has been sold as a subsidized resort town and retirement community to the world,\u201d said Josh Gordon, a political science professor at Simon Fraser University here. \u201cWe are now seeing the culmination of that dynamic.\u201dHow much of the city\u2019s housing demand is coming from China is hotly debated. Government statistics show that foreign buyers own about 5 percent of the housing stock in the metropolitan area, but the numbers are several times as high for new condominiums, which helps to explain why a surge of building hasn\u2019t done much to reduce prices, according to an analysis by Mr. Yan. And this almost certainly underestimates the influence of foreign capital, since the data exclude Canadian immigrants with money from overseas.The real estate industry contends that the issue is not an influx of Chinese, who have been coming to Vancouver for decades, but zoning restrictions that prioritize low-density living, outside of a few high-rise areas.\u201cI live 15 minutes from the downtown core in a house,\u201d said Keith Roy, a real estate agent. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. I should be in a townhouse at this distance, maybe even a low-rise condo building.\u201dThe figures show, however, that unlike other expensive West Coast cities like San Francisco, where the housing supply has long lagged behind population growth, Vancouver has consistently produced new housing. Over the past decade, the housing stock has grown by about 12 percent, while the population has grown by about 9 percent, according to the city.This disparity has persuaded the city to broaden its measures beyond just a push for new buildings to efforts like the empty homes tax.\u201cIt\u2019s getting out of the mind-set that just more is better,\u201d said Gil Kelley, the city\u2019s general manager of planning, urban design and sustainability.Tom Davidoff, an economist at the University of British Columbia, said it was all of the above. Vancouver is popular with foreign buyers, yes. But it also has strict zoning laws that reserve most of the city\u2019s land for single-family homes, as well as high income taxes but low property taxes of about a quarter of a percent of the property value.\u201cThe message we have sent the world is, \u2018Come and buy our real estate, but do not try to make a living here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Davidoff said. \u201cMission accomplished.\u201dWhile the new government\u2019s housing measures are popular with many voters, richer homeowners are fuming. A recent stroll through Vancouver\u2019s wealthier West Side turned up bright red signs protesting the tax on $3 million homes. \u201cAre you angry yet?\u201d read one. \u201cRally against the N.D.P. tax grab now.\u201dHowever it happened, Vancouver\u2019s transformation to an international gateway has given the city something of an identity crisis. For Vancouverites who a generation ago took it for granted that they could buy a home or condo near the urban core, the trade-offs for the steep rise in prices are hard to accept.\u201cPeople who live and work in Vancouver can\u2019t afford to live here,\u201d said Nathalie Baker, a lawyer who is in favor of measures to cool the market, even though she owns a home here. \u201cAnd that is a very significant problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Coming Tech Battle With China", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sharma is\u00a0the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Arriving in Beijing last month, I knew I would not be able to connect to Google, Facebook or Uber. As strange as it was to go without these staples of online life in the West, it was even stranger to find that local Chinese didn\u2019t seem to feel deprived at all. They search through Baidu, get their social media fix on WeChat, hail rides on Didi, curate news through sites like Toutiao. And while they know Beijing is watching, they accept this surveillance as normal.The Chinese government has carved out an alternative internet universe with its own brands, rules and culture, in which privacy doesn\u2019t exist. But its real ambition is to break out of this parallel universe and dominate not just the internet but the technology industry worldwide. To contain Beijing, the United States and its allies are fighting back with a campaign of technoprotectionism, opening a perilous new front in the global trade battles.President Trump is the unlikely leader of the fight against Chinese tech dominance. Widely seen as a champion of rust belt industries, he recently slapped heavy tariffs on all the leading aluminum and steel exporters, drawing fierce protests not only from China but also from American allies like Germany and Canada. But steel is a side show compared with the emerging tech battle with China.Technology will decide which country emerges as the world\u2019s dominant economic power in the long run. While about 20 percent of per-capita gross domestic product growth is driven by labor and capital, the remaining 80 percent is determined by how rapidly an economy is developing and applying new technology to increase production. China\u2019s ambition to catch up to Western living standards thus depends largely on how rapidly it can match or surpass Western technology.Mr. Trump is both accelerating and expanding trade battles that began before he took office. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, countries around the world began to restrict cross-border flows of trade, capital and migrants. Globalization\u2019s champions predicted that borders would continue to fall in at least one area \u2014 digital tech and the internet \u2014 but China has shown that a determined government can build walls in the virtual sphere, too.The president\u2019s tough stand on trade with China may be more popular than he is. The overwhelming consensus in the West is that Beijing is catching up illegitimately, by forcing companies that invest in China to share their best technology, or dispatching hackers to steal it. Though borrowing from the leading tech power is a standard development strategy \u2014 think of 19th-century America copying British industrial technology and Japan\u2019s great success replicating American technology \u2014 the scale and organization of China\u2019s campaign makes the threat feel new.Beijing has banned some foreign competitors like Google and Facebook outright, and regulated others so heavily that they have been compelled to sell themselves to Chinese rivals (Uber) or forced to consider pulling out of China (Amazon). In essence, China has created domestic internet monopolies that are generating enough cash in their vast local market to finance aggressive expansion abroad. I have been told, for example, that Toutiao already sells its novel content curating service to one in 10 Japanese.Last year Beijing rebranded the manufacturing centers of the Pearl River delta as the \u201cGreater Bay Area\u201d and began urging the main cities there \u2014 Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong \u2014 to cooperate to become China\u2019s rival to Silicon Valley, which the Chinese would like to make the lesser Bay Area.In Beijing, the buzz was about how \u201cCreated in China\u201d is replacing \u201cMade in China,\u201d with some claiming that Shenzhen is now more innovative than Silicon Valley in key industries. Instead of just assembling simple goods from parts built elsewhere, China is now increasingly seen as a cutting-edge designer and developer of artificial intelligence, drones and other advanced technologies.Mr. Trump was willing to lift the ban on ZTE after the company paid a $1 billion fine and fired its top executives, but Congress was not. The Senate voted to reinstate the ban, which is likely to fuel trade battles to come. When I was in Beijing, many Chinese were talking about how the humiliation of ZTE was inspiring an official push to reduce China\u2019s dependence on the United States for semiconductors, software and other critical tech imports.The European Union recently imposed new data protection rules written largely to give consumers more control of information now in the hands of corporate giants like Facebook, but also to guard against the spread of a China-like surveillance state. The European Union is also pondering a new digital single market, in part to give European companies a market in which they have a chance to grow as large as Chinese rivals.This is how a digitally interconnected world could die by a thousand cuts, and technoprotectionism may get a further push during the next global downturn. From the United States to Europe and Japan, public debts are high and deficits are rising, which means these governments are poorly positioned to spend their way out of any slowdown. Central banks can\u2019t help much, either, since interest rates are still very low, with little room or reason to drop further right now. In this environment, governments may see protectionism as the only lever they have left to pull.For most of the postwar era, the consensus in support of free trade was so strong that governments rarely resorted to raising tariffs even when times were tough. The trade wars that broke out after 2008 have involved mainly nontariff or \u201cstealth\u201d trade barriers, including cheap state loans and subsidies for favored industries. But in the last two years, the rise of Mr. Trump and other antiglobal populists has given new currency to protectionism in all its forms, including technoprotectionism.The global financial markets had largely ignored the brewing trade battles, until recently. As the tariff threats grow in scale, and the battleground shifts from rust belt industries to new technologies, the markets are growing more skittish. So far, stocks have been hit harder in China than in the United States, but there will be no winners. The latest surveys of American investors and manufacturers show that their biggest concern is the threat of a trade war.The risks from deglobalization are growing. If the current skirmishes turn into a full-blown trade war, blame will fall heavily on the thousandth cut. But the real fault will lie with the 999 that came before.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Catch a Killer in China: Another Chinese Crime Novel Goes Global", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProfileYANGZHOU, China \u2014 Zhou Haohui, the latest author to catch the wave of Chinese crime fiction crashing on international shores, had an unsatisfying job teaching engineering at a university outside of Beijing in 2007 when he began publishing \u2014 online \u2014 the novels that would earn him a cultlike following in China.These books \u2014 a trilogy about a police hunt for a vengeful killer \u2014 went into print two years later, ultimately selling more than 1.2 million copies. They inspired a serial on the streaming site owned by Tencent, the social media giant, that has, to date, been watched a staggering 2.4 billion times, according to his agent, China Educational Publications Import & Export Corporation. A feature film went into production in April.Crime, Mr. Zhou says, is a universal theme, which is why detective stories or police thrillers (even from an authoritarian political system like China\u2019s) can more easily transcend cultural divides than, say, historical fiction.\u201cWhen you are talking about crime \u2014 criminal cases, the police in large cities, this suspenseful feeling of mystery \u2014 I feel that readers all over the world like this kind of thing,\u201d he said in an interview here in his hometown, Yangzhou, a historical imperial city of two million people on the Yangtze River a couple hours upstream from Shanghai.Mr. Zhou, who is 40, seems unfazed by his celebrity here. He is as likely as not to pass unnoticed, even here in his hometown, where his novels are prominently on display in bookstores. He is cerebral and soft-spoken, and his interests are broad.His mild manner seems at odds with the lurid violence of crime novels. In \u201cDeath Notice,\u201d the killer of two police academy cadets in a gruesome bombing resurfaces after 18 years, this time orchestrating the murder of a revered police sergeant whose failure to solve the original case haunted his career.Then, as now, the killer fashions himself as an avenger, bringing justice to those whose crimes have gone unpunished. The killer calls himself Eumenides after the third of the Oresteia ancient Greek tragedies by Aeschylus and warns each of his victims in notes drawn with exquisite Chinese calligraphy, luring the police into a diabolical game. The new killing spree revives a special police task force that had been shelved for reasons that, to explain fully here, would amount to a spoiler.Of course, censorship shapes crime writing here, which to some can make the genre seem relatively wan. A Yi, who was a police officer in Jiangxi Province before writing thrillers, said in an interview that the crime novel might have exhausted its potential in China. \u201cCrime novels still do very well,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for the writers, creating these stories is getting harder and harder.\u201d\u201cWhen you write crime novels you know you shouldn\u2019t write anything too negative,\u201d Mr. Zhou said, \u201cbut you have no way of knowing where the line is.\u201d The solution, he said, was to have a good editor with a better sense of what can pass muster.The producers of the film version of \u201cDeath Notice\u201d dealt with potential political sensitivity by shifting the action to Hong Kong, which is considered by Communist propaganda to be thoroughly dissolute after decades of colonial rule.For commercial rather than political reasons, Mr. Zhou\u2019s literary agent here also made changes in the English-language version of the book, translated by Zac Haluza. The action now takes place in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, not Yangzhou or nearby Nanjing, the cities Mr. Zhou said he had in the back of his mind when crafting the story. The assumption was that Chengdu, which is best known for pandas and spicy food, would be recognizable to foreign readers and give the drama a more visceral feel, Rob Bloom, Mr. Zhou\u2019s editor at Doubleday, said in an email.When asked about the change, Mr. Zhou laughed and said he, too, had wondered why they did that.Doubleday has options for the second and third parts of the trilogy, called in Chinese \u201cFate\u201d and \u201cFarewell Song,\u201d but has not yet committed to them \u2014 perhaps because Mr. Zhou\u2019s first foray into English, a novel called \u201cValley of Terror,\u201d published by Amazon Crossing last year, did not take off.Mr. Zhou remembers playing in the park as a child \u2014 when there was no entrance fee \u2014 but literary inspiration came to him much later.\u201cIn the Chinese education system, there was no one to guide you to consider \u2018what do you want to do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey just told you, study, study, study and get into a good university.\u201dHe did, attending Tsinghua University in Beijing \u2014 one of the country\u2019s most prestigious \u2014 and pursuing a degree in environmental engineering. Soon, though, he realized he did not really like engineering. He wrote as a hobby, posting stories on the message board of the university on the edge of Beijing where he taught for a decade.He seems part of a generation for whom the boundaries between the written and the visual, the printed word and the image on screen, have blurred, allowing him to glide dexterously from one medium to the next, one genre to the next. The format, Mr. Zhou said, was not so important. \u201cI just ask myself, \u2018What is the best way to tell the story.\u2019\u201dOlivia Mitchell Ryan contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Wins Exclusive U.K. Rights to Broadcast Some Premier League Matches", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A generation ago, Sky, then an upstart satellite broadcaster, outbid rivals for the rights to televise the Premier League. The deal revolutionized the fortunes of the TV service, and helped turn the British soccer league into one of the world\u2019s most watched \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 in sports.Another transformation now appears to be underway. Amazon, which is increasingly pushing beyond its e-commerce origins, won rights on Thursday to broadcast Premier League games in Britain for the first time.Amazon\u2019s deal highlights the seismic shifts happening in sports and television entertainment, as deep-pocketed digital outlets compete with traditional broadcasters like NBC, Disney and, in Europe, Sky. The fierce battle between Silicon Valley companies and historically dominant studios and broadcasters has extended from developing new scripted shows to broadcasting live sports.The matches that Amazon will broadcast, available to its Prime members in Britain, are relatively minor. It will showcase 20, scheduled at times when there tends to be lower viewership than normal. But Amazon\u2019s victory was in how it can deliver the games: While digital companies have typically bought only the digital streaming rights to sporting events, Amazon\u2019s deal includes the exclusive rights for the matches it shows.\u201cPrime Video continues to drive Prime member adoption and retention,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote.The company has also sought to develop scripted entertainment, earning awards and acclaim with shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d though it still lags behind competitors like Netflix.In Britain, Amazon will share the broadcast rights to the Premier League with two British heavyweights \u2014 Sky Sports and BT Sport. Sky and BT will televise the vast majority of matches on offer, totaling 180 in all. Those matches will be at times that are more likely to garner high levels of viewership.The auction for Premier League broadcast rights was held in February, but only Sky Sports and BT won partial rights at the time.\u201cWe welcome Amazon as an exciting new partner, and we know Prime Video will provide an excellent service on which fans can consume the Premier League,\u201d Richard Scudamore, the Premier League\u2019s executive chairman, said in a statement on Thursday.Digital media companies have long proclaimed an interest in sports rights, but they have largely failed to enter competitive bids for marquee properties. And while sports leagues are eager to increase the number of bidders, they have shown a reluctance to turn over rights wholesale to digital partners, preferring instead to craft deals that include digital streaming on top of traditional TV broadcasting.But the format of the Premier League\u2019s auction makes it easier for digital media companies to compete. While most large rights packages in the United States are for seven seasons or more, the Premier League offers only three-season blocks, lowering the get-in cost. The 200 Premier League games on offer were also split into seven packages of 32 or 20 games each, making it easier for Amazon to dip a toe in the water, albeit in a smaller market than the United States.The revenue for the Premier League rights in Britain is supplemented by income from broadcast deals elsewhere, including in the United States, where NBC televises the matches, and in China, where the digital broadcaster PPTV holds the rights.An earlier version of this article misstated when Amazon took over streaming rights for some N.F.L. games. It was in April 2017, not this year.Prashant S. Rao reported from London, and Kevin Draper from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War Faces Its First Big Test: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Verizon names its next C.E.O.\u2022 The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief weighs in on the Fox battle\u2022 Trump will play the G-7 on his termsBut the real test is approaching.Next week, the Trump administration\u2019s fight with China \u2013 which could hit far more businesses than the tariffs on steel and aluminum now in effect \u2013 enters a crucial phase. The administration is scheduled to release on June 15 a final list of Chinese products covered by $50 billion of tariffs. It said that it will impose the tariffs shortly thereafter. China has threatened to retaliate.The Trump administration has two choices. It can settle for relatively unambitious gains and try to spin them as significant. Investors would welcome that outcome. Voters may, too. Alternatively, Mr. Trump can keep demanding big changes in China, and possibly plunge the U.S. into a drawn-out trade war. The imposition of the metals tariffs shows that he is willing to follow through. But it\u2019s still not clear how he will respond when his trade measures do significant harm to businesses or the financial markets.That moment may not be far away.-- Peter EavisReplacing him will be Hans Vestberg, currently the president of the company\u2019s global networks.\u2014 Michael de la MercedDuring his tenure as Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Mr. McAdam helped reshape the telecom giant \u2014 and part of that was through deal making. Not all of the transactions were particularly flashy, but they tended to follow one of two paths: Overhauling the company\u2019s network operations or building up its digital media division (which is now called Oath).Here are Verizon\u2019s top transactions since Mr. McAdam became C.E.O. in 2011, according to data from Thomson Reuters:\u2022 Verizon had asked Shari Redstone, the media company\u2019s controlling shareholder, if it would ever come up for sale, according to CBS\u2019s lawsuit against Ms. Redstone last month.\u2022 It briefly looked at buying the assets of Fox that Walt Disney ended up agreeing to acquire for $52.4 billion, including the 20th Century Fox movie studio and cable channels like FX.We\u2019ve looked at that over the years, and we made our decision to go digital. That\u2019s why we bought AOL and Yahoo, and we talk now about superchannels of sports and finance and news and some entertainment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIn his seven years as Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Mr. McAdam was known for his relentless focus on his company\u2019s wireless network and his aversion to striking big, splashy deals.As Verizon prepares for the telecom industry\u2019s future \u2014 where the only certain things are the rise of 5G wireless technology and online video streaming \u2014 here\u2019s what two research analysts think about what the company has done and where it\u2019s headed.Craig Moffett, MoffettNathansonMr. McAdam will be defined by the deals that he didn\u2019t do. Unlike AT&T \u2014 which paid nearly $50 billion for the satellite TV service DirecTV and is trying to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion \u2014 Verizon never struck splashy acquisitions, aside from those of Yahoo and AOL (combined purchase price: $9.2 billion).But that conservatism has worked in Verizon\u2019s favor. DirecTV has steadily lost customers in this age of cord-cutting, dragging down AT&T\u2019s financial health.\u201cI think he deserves a lot of credit for avoiding some of the traps that some of his peers have fallen into,\u201d Mr. Moffett said of Mr. McAdam.As for the fear underpinning many telecom companies\u2019 deal-making \u2014 that sticking to basic internet and phone service is boring \u2014 Mr. Moffett said Verizon has shown that worry to be unfounded.\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about being a distribution channel?\u201d he told me. \u201cVerizon fully understood and embraced that there will always be a place for an advantaged network \u2014 and people will pay a premium for it.\u201dAmy Yong, MacquarieMr. McAdam\u2019s relentless focus on making Verizon\u2019s network the best in the U.S. has paid off handsomely, with the company earning a premium from investors based on the strength of its core business.The big question is whether that will be enough going forward, as rivals AT&T and T-Mobile pursue bold moves.Verizon\u2019s cautious strategy may ending up costing the company. Though AT&T\u2019s bet on wireless video streaming hasn\u2019t paid off yet, if it works, it will make that company a formidable creator and distributor of content. And T-Mobile and Sprint could prove to be a strong new rival if their proposed union works out.\u201cThe future is looking very different,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat worked in the past may not be what works in the future.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedA new report suggests that Apple is preparing to sell fewer phones later this year. It may sound worrying. But we\u2019ve seen similar news before, and the fallout is unlikely to be all that bad.But Apple\u2019s phones are getting more expensive, so every sale counts for more. And its services businesses \u2014 things like Music and Pay \u2014 are becoming an increasingly valuable revenue stream, meaning that the company can make more money off existing users even if they don\u2019t upgrade to the latest device.\u2014 Jamie Condliffe\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe job faced by investigators of car collisions is getting more difficult as autonomous car features become more advanced, and the way they do their jobs might need to change to accommodate that.In March, a Tesla Model X collided with a concrete lane divider as it was driven down a highway in Mountain View, Calif. A new report by National Transportation Safety Board investigators suggested that Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology played a role in the death of a Tesla owner.The driver was using the advanced driver assistance features traffic-aware cruise control and autosteer lane-keeping assistance, which Tesla refers to as \u201cautopilot.\u201d As the Tesla approached the paved gore area dividing the main travel lanes of US-101 from the SH-85 exit ramp, it moved to the left and entered the gore area. The Tesla continued traveling through the gore area and struck a previously damaged crash attenuator at a speed of about 71 mph.Information isn\u2019t recorded in most cars\u2019 event data recorders, the automotive equivalent of airplane black boxes. Instead, the boxes show more basic information such as steering-wheel input and throttle.While automakers commonly provide the information if it is requested by the vehicle owner, accident investigators\u2014typically contractors hired by insurance companies\u2014say they sometimes have to seek a court order to obtain crash data.An update to the rules published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could change that situation, by demanding that automakers log more details about the vehicle\u2019s behavior.The complexity of the mathematical calculations involved means it\u2019s not straightforward to take the network apart to understand how it makes its decisions. This can make unintended behavior hard to predict; and if failure does occur, it can be difficult to explain why. If a system misrecognizes an object in a photo, for instance, it may be hard (though not impossible) to know what feature of the image led to the error.Many artificial intelligence researchers are trying to develop ways to make it easier to understand the inner working of A.I. systems. But for now, that\u2019s likely to involve looking at complex computer code. That suggests that crash investigation teams, as well as the regulations that are applied to automakers, might require an update in the near future, too.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeComcast is threatening to challenge Walt Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion bid for most of 21st Century Fox. Behind the scenes, it\u2019s playing down investors\u2019 and analysts\u2019 fears of an antitrust response. We may have just gotten a clue about whether it\u2019s right.The head of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, appears unruffled about a Disney-Fox deal, at least. From an interview at The Deal\u2019s conference yesterday:\u201cThey had good advice and carved out surgically what a transaction is that might be doable and who knows where that transaction leads.\u201dBut Mr. Delrahim also defended his team\u2019s effort to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, saying it was a merger of a kind that federal regulators had sought to block for decades. (A federal judge is expected to rule on the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against the deal on Tuesday.)Mr. Trump is the black sheep of this family, the estranged sibling who decided to pick fights with his relatives just before arriving to dinner. The dispute, Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, acknowledges, is \u201cmuch like a family quarrel.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 any of that will affect America\u2019s trade policies. But diplomatic tensions look set to rise, and economic uncertainty would rise with them.Elsewhere in trade:The Trump administration removed crippling penalties on the ailing Chinese telecom company in exchange for $1.4 billion in fines and other measures. But did some other big gain drive the deal?Getting Beijing to approve Qualcomm\u2019s takeover of another chip maker, NXP Semiconductors? Maybe. China\u2019s latest trade concessions, which were linked to the Trump administration not imposing certain tariffs? Unlikely.More from Jane Mayer:A business associate who declined to be identified, in order not to jeopardize his ties to the family, told me, \u201cCharles pushed David out. It was done with a wink, and a nod, and a nudge.\u201dSF Bloodstock and SF Racing Group, a company controlled by top executives at the billionaire\u2019s investment firm, has a 15 percent stake in the horse, which is the heavy favorite to win tomorrow\u2019s Belmont Stakes.SF Bloodstock, which according to court filings is owned by SF Agricultural Holdings L.L.C., employs a for-profit model and focuses on the breeding side of the industry, purchasing stallions, or shares in them, and broodmares while selling yearlings at auction. In 2015, it entered into a three-year partnership with WinStar Farm and China Horse Club that allowed them to spend big while spreading risk at yearling and 2-year-old sales.

{"Headline": "Peru Invades Russia. Well, at Least Many of Its Fans Have.", "Date": "2018-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySARANSK, Russia \u2014 Augusto Caceres, 81, had all but given up hope of seeing his beloved Peru at a World Cup again during his lifetime.He has been to 13 straight World Cups, beginning with the 1970 tournament. And for much of that time, Peru had failed again and again to make it to soccer\u2019s biggest showcase. Still, Caceres kept going, and hoping that Peru might somehow be a part of the World Cup for the first time since 1982. And now Peru is.Dining in a restaurant here on Friday, a day before Peru made its return to the World Cup in a frustrating 1-0 loss against Denmark, Caceres spoke about his adventures, of the great players and the great teams he has seen over the years, and of Peru\u2019s continued absence from it all.\u201cI went back home every year and they didn\u2019t improve,\u201d he said, recalling all the years of failure and of the Peruvian national teams that did play good soccer but had bad luck. \u201cIn soccer, you win by scoring goals, and when 10 years had passed by, I thought they will never make it.\u201dBut they did, and now Caceres will have a lot of company. For after a 36-year wait, Peruvians are not taking any chances. Who knows how long it will be until the next World Cup opportunity arises. Better to take part in this one.As a result, thousands upon thousands of fans from the Andean nation and the greater Peruvian diaspora have descended on Russia, with more arriving daily, giving Moscow\u2019s Red Square the air of Lima\u2019s own Plaza Mayor. Even at the World Cup opener on Thursday, between host Russia and Saudi Arabia, Peru\u2019s distinct uniform shirt \u2014 a white shirt with a red sash \u2014 was a regular presence among the throng.Francois Braendle, a Swiss banker based in Russia, said he hadn\u2019t seen anything quite like the Peruvian invasion. \u201cHonestly, I believe the whole country of Peru is here,\u201d he said on Thursday. Behind him, in Moscow\u2019s early evening sunshine, the red-and-white tide marched on toward Nikolskaya Street, a gathering point for fans from across the world, but another place where Peruvians now seem to outnumber the rest.And before Saturday\u2019s game, the streets of Saransk, the smallest of the World Cup host cities, were swamped by Peruvians, heralding chance meetings of friends and neighbors that usually take place an ocean away in places like Lima, Arequipa and Cusco.\u201cEverywhere you go you see someone you know,\u201d said one fan, Balere Ort\u00fazar. Her uncle Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui said he had already bumped into 50 people from back home.Peru\u2019s presence in the World Cup was hanging in the balance until the very end of South America\u2019s qualifying tournament, widely accepted to be the toughest in soccer. And had Brazil scored either one fewer goal in its 3-0 victory over Chile, or had Paraguay beaten last-place Venezuela at home (instead, it lost), Peru would have been shut out of the World Cup again.But instead it was Peru that was handed a secondary route into the World Cup via a playoff game against New Zealand, and its 2-0 victory unleashed the sort of celebrations one might expect in a soccer-mad nation. A national holiday was declared, and travel agencies in Peru and FIFA\u2019s ticketing website were swamped by people wanting to go to Russia. Officially, in its most recent update, FIFA said it allocated 43,583 tickets to Peruvians, but the real number might be considerably higher, since those supporting Peru in Russia this week seem to have come from anywhere and everywhere, including Australia, which Peru will meet in its final group game.Being at the World Cup can be an expensive proposition. Caceres, who splits his time between a home in Connecticut and Lima, said he spent $2,000 securing resale tickets for Peru\u2019s three group games, starting with its matchup with Denmark in Saransk on Saturday. He has committed to spending $20,000 in total.Already, there are all sorts of tales of the lengths that Peruvians have gone to pay for their World Cup odyssey. At least some of those tales, no doubt, are true. There are the ones about remortgaging a home or selling a car. And there are the more exotic solutions, such as the one hatched by Diva Rivera, 24, who is an actress and the owner of a clothing store in the Amazon city of Iquitos. Rivera started a campaign called \u201cdonate one sol so I can go to the World Cup\u201d and traveled across the country with a plan to gather one Peruvian sol, the equivalent of 30 cents, from each person she met.\u201cIt was a challenge that came about from a kind of fever that arose when the team qualified for the tournament,\u201d Rivera said in a telephone interview from Saransk after arriving by train for Peru\u2019s game on Saturday. She was joined in Russia by a man who was said to have gained 25 kilograms (about 55 pounds) in three months to qualify for seats reserved for obese spectators after finding regular seats for Peru\u2019s matches had been sold out.\u201cThirty-six years,\u201d said Sergio Inamine, 33, his short answer to what has been described as \u201cuna locura,\u201d or a madness, that has descended upon Peru. \u201cThat\u2019s the answer, that\u2019s all you need to know,\u201d added Inamine, who had traveled from Peru to Moscow and was headed to Saransk.Peru\u2019s years of soccer failures came as the country struggled to cope with political and economic crises as well as a destructive, and prolonged, guerrilla war with the Maoist insurgent group Shining Path. \u201cSoccer is a reflection of society, and we were lost, we had terrorism, bombs all the time, we had the worst presidents, corruption, and sport was forgotten,\u201d Inamine added.Failure to reach the World Cup had become so regular that Peruvians adapted it as a motif for everyday life, including the repayment of debts, said Martin Llerena, 33, who was with Inamine. \u201cWhen you owe someone money it became usual to say, \u201cI\u2019ll pay you when Peru goes to the World Cup.\u2019 \u201dIn a strange twist, the man behind Peru\u2019s renaissance, Coach Ricardo Gareca, known as el Tigre, is partly responsible for the wait having been so long. In a World Cup qualification game in 1985, Peru was leading Gareca\u2019s Argentina, 2-1, when, with the game entering its final stages, he poked the ball into the net to snatch a 2-2 draw and take away a place in the tournament from Peru.It turned out to be a bittersweet moment for Gareca. When Argentina later announced its final squad for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, Gareca was left off, and he has been waiting to be involved in the event ever since.Now Gareca and a new generation of Peruvian players finally have their chance, and when they looked up into the stands on Saturday, they were met by the sight of Peruvians just about everywhere.This multitude \u2014 including 93-year-old Wyenceslao Ferro, who had never been to a World Cup \u2014 marched on Mordovia Arena in Saransk before the game, transforming the stadium into the Estadio Nacional del Per\u00fa, the Lima bear pit where the South Americans finally clinched their World Cup berth.As a result, ear-piercing whistles greeted the Danish team as it came out to warm up before the game. From there, the intensity only increased, even affecting Coki Gonzales, a well-known commentator from Peru\u2019s Latina Televisi\u00f3n. Colleagues motioned for him to take deep breaths and drink water so he could steady himself for the game.\u201cI broke down,\u201d Gonzales said later. \u201cI\u2019m 39 years old now, and never seen Peru at the World Cup. It has been my life\u2019s dream, the most important moment in my life.\u201dThe emotions attached to the game even seemed to overcome Peruvian midfielder Christian Cueva. Given a chance to score Peru\u2019s first World Cup goal in four decades, Cueva skied a penalty shot over Denmark\u2019s goal just before halftime. The miss proved costly when Denmark\u2019s Yussuf Poulsen slotted what would be the only score of the game with 30 minutes left to play.Denmark\u2019s goal didn\u2019t dampen the singing in the stands or Peru\u2019s repeated efforts to find a tying goal, which ultimately came to nothing.Age Hareide, Denmark\u2019s coach, said his team almost buckled under the pressure created by Peru\u2019s fans and players, and described the victory as a lucky one. Referring to the atmosphere, he said: \u201cWe were a little scared of it, and it did affect us.\u201dThe Peru circus now moves to Yekaterinburg, where the frenzy will commence anew on June 21 in a game against imposing France. Peru\u2019s fans will be hoping their team will still be able to do something it has not managed since 1982: score a goal at the World Cup. And in the process, maybe even come up with a victory against the French or at least a tie. Having traveled all the way from Peru, why think small?Andrea Zarate contributed reporting from Lima, Peru.Advertisement"}

DeepFarhad isn\u2019t quite ready yet, but our engineers are confident that it will attain Farhad-level insights fairly soon.But while you\u2019re still here in human form, let\u2019s talk about the year\u2019s biggest overarching tech narrative: the \u201ctechlash\u201d against companies like Facebook and Google over issues like privacy, data protection and antitrust concerns. As someone who has been mercifully spared from every twist and turn of the techlash, does it feel like a lot has changed since you left?When I left, Facebook was under the gun, Amazon was getting hit by President Trump, and Apple and Google were trying to stand clear of the fallout. Three months later, Facebook is still under the gun, the president still regards Amazon as a pariah, and Apple and Google still would very much like to be excluded from these narratives.I\u2019m not saying I was expecting wholesale structural change among entrenched businesses over the course of a season. But, still: For all the fireworks in Washington, there\u2019s been little movement on regulation or legislation to curb some of the excesses in tech. I don\u2019t see much of an advance toward stricter antitrust scrutiny of the large tech firms. And their most recent earnings reports show they\u2019re all going gangbusters; Americans may harbor growing worries about the power of tech companies, but not enough to make us quit them.Which isn\u2019t to say the techlash isn\u2019t real, just that change will come slowly. We\u2019re all living in a world where most communication and commerce is ruled by a handful of nearly unregulated oligopolies. That sort of thing doesn\u2019t change quickly, I guess.Techlash indeed!And then there was the bit about how we\u2019re all staring at our phones too much. The tech industry has been consumed recently by new worries over \u201ctech addiction,\u201d and both Facebook and Google recently announced plans to tackle digital \u201cwell-being.\u201d Now Apple\u2019s jumping in, too. In the next version of iOS, your phone will give you detailed stats about how often you use your phone and what you do on it, and it will even let you block yourself and your children from using certain apps.It seems slightly opportunistic to kick a social network while it\u2019s down, but Apple\u2019s aggressive criticism also highlights the real and growing philosophical differences between the two companies. Facebook is an advertising-supported communications conglomerate aimed at the masses, and dead set on remaining free so that all seven billion humans on Earth can eventually be connected (and monetized) through its platform. Apple is predominantly a high-end hardware business that caters to an increasingly privacy-conscious consumer base, and thinks that security will be a differentiating factor when people choose which smartphones, tablets and laptops to buy.Maybe it was inevitable that these two giants would clash, but to a tech writer who lives for drama, it\u2019s still interesting to watch.Anyway, that\u2019s all for now.

{"Headline": "E-Commerce Might Help Solve the Mystery of Low Inflation", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment is sinking and businesses are churning out more goods and services. Yet even with the economy standing on tippy toes, prices and wages are climbing a lot more slowly than anyone has expected.The studies reinforce the views of Federal Reserve officials who see the internet\u2019s increasing influence as a leading suspect in a continuing mystery: why inflation routinely falls short of their 2 percent target, considered the sweet spot for keeping the economy humming without overheating.But some of the latest findings suggest that those fears could be unfounded \u2014 and that the official statistics are overstating inflation.An analysis of that information by Austan Goolsbee of the University of Chicago and Peter Klenow of Stanford found that prices for goods sold on the internet rose much more slowly from 2014 to 2017 than indicated by barometers like the Consumer Price Index, or C.P.I.Online prices of personal computers fell by 12.3 percent, for example, but the C.P.I. showed just a 6.9 percent drop. Toy prices online slumped 12 percent, while the C.P.I. put the drop at just 7.8 percent. Online prices for photographic equipment and supplies fell 9.2 percent compared with the 0.6 percent decline registered by the official measure.\u201cPrices are going down a whole lot faster than the C.P.I. shows for the same things,\u201d he said.New online research offers more evidence that \u201cthe more efficient method of selling through e-commerce is holding inflation down compared to what it would have been otherwise,\u201d said Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University.Figuring out just how much of an impact online shopping has had on inflation, however, remains a challenge.The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which calculate those two measures, look at a typical basket of goods and sample prices, at times adding or eliminating items, like food and energy, that can vary widely from one month to the next.Even with thousands of price inspectors, the government can sample only a tiny portion of goods and services sold across the country. The traditional measures are also not well suited to take account of the constant introduction of new and upgraded products \u2014 like Instapots and athleisure yoga pants.Cellphones, for example, were not included in the C.P.I. until 1996, when about 40 million Americans, or 15 percent of the population at the time, were already using them. In many cases, prices for those new goods \u2014 like computers \u2014 plunge over time, but price indexes fail to capture the change.Putting aside apparel, where designers offer new fashions every season, the research found that 44 percent of the products sold online did not exist in the previous year. And nearly a quarter disappeared from one year to the next.\u201cWhat we have never had before is the quantity of stuff online,\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said. Online spending now accounts for 10 percent of all retail spending, and in some categories 50 percent.This isn\u2019t the first time innovations in shopping have upended pricing structures. Over time, the introduction of the Sears catalog similarly held down prices compared with the small, local stores where people had always shopped, said Mr. Gordon, the Northwestern economist.Stephen Reed, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that \u201cwe constantly re-evaluate our methods and consider new research.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen and Jim Tankersley on Twitter: @PatcohenNYT and @jimtankersleyAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Comcast and 21st Century Fox in Focus After AT&T-Time Warner Approval", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe battle for the future of media has begun.How quickly are things changing? Netflix recently surpassed Disney to become the most valuable media company at $158 billion.That helps set the stakes for the pending clash between Comcast and The Walt Disney Company as each seeks to own the bulk of 21st Century Fox.The contest will pit Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, against Disney\u2019s Robert A. Iger in what could be a fierce bidding war for a significant chunk of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire.Comcast, which already owns NBCUniversal, has put together a bid of slightly more than $60 billion in cash and contractual assurances that Fox would be paid what is known as a reverse breakup fee \u2014 perhaps as much as $2.5 billion \u2014 in the event a transaction is blocked by the government, the people said. But any regulatory concerns may be allayed by the straightforward approval of the AT&T-Time Warner deal. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington said the agreement could go through without either company divesting any assets.It is hard to overstate how closely Comcast was monitoring the situation. Executives at NBCUniversal had dispatched people to wait in the courtroom to hear the verdict. Mr. Roberts waited at his executive offices at Comcast\u2019s headquarters in Philadelphia, tuned to CNBC and keeping an eye on Twitter. According to a person familiar with the matter, Comcast\u2019s board met Tuesday evening to discuss its revamped bid for Fox, which rebuffed an overture last year.In November, Mr. Roberts traveled to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s estate in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, according to two people familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because it has not been made public. There, over glasses of wine produced from vineyards on the estate, Mr. Roberts broached the possibility of Mr. Murdoch making a deal with Comcast. Mr. Murdoch explained that talks with Disney had already begun, but that the companies were still $4 billion apart on price.Mr. Murdoch said he had wanted $56 billion, which Mr. Roberts then offered, according to the two people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Murdoch said he would take it to the board.The businesses that Mr. Murdoch has agreed to sell include the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios, almost two dozen regional sports networks like the Yankees\u2019 YES channel, a lineup of cable networks that includes FX and a 30 percent ownership stake in the streaming service Hulu.A deal would also include Fox\u2019s 39 percent ownership stake in the European pay TV operator Sky. Comcast has already made an offer to buy the other 61 percent of Sky in a separate deal. (The Fox News cable network, the Fox broadcast stations, the Fox Business Network and the sports network FS1 would not be part of a transaction.)Mr. Murdoch sees Disney\u2019s stock as ultimately more valuable than Comcast\u2019s, according to two people familiar with his thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal was still in process. Since Disney\u2019s bid is in stock, Mr. Murdoch is banking on a rise in the company\u2019s value over time. Comcast\u2019s all-cash offer would also mean an immediate tax hit.Each man vying for a piece of Fox is an accomplished dealmaker.Mr. Roberts spends a great deal of time analyzing merger possibilities and is always on the hunt. One of Comcast\u2019s most successful transactions was for control of NBCUniversal in 2011. In 2014, he bid for Time Warner Cable but walked away after the Justice Department said it was leaning toward blocking the deal.As the head of Disney, Mr. Iger has completed several major acquisitions, including the purchases of Pixar Studios, Lucasfilm and Marvel Entertainment, though all were private transactions that did not require approval of public shareholders.The Fox board has scheduled a shareholder meeting for July 10 to vote on the Disney offer, but that meeting could be moved back if Comcast makes its bid, as it is expected to do as a result of Tuesday\u2019s ruling.AT&T\u2019s victory shows the way forward for the media industry, which has grappled with a sharp slowdown in the past few years. The decline in pay TV subscribers has blunted businesses once thought to be invincible. ESPN, owned by Disney, has seen a significant drop in viewership as younger viewers spend more time on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.Mergers will allow companies to compete for costlier rights to professional sports, seen as perhaps the only way to keep viewers from cutting the cable cord, and to build out their streaming services.The pay TV industry may not be dying, but it is \u201cslowly grinding down,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a founder of research firm MoffettNathanson.Mr. Nathanson said he thought Disney will ultimately succeed in its pursuit of Fox because it has less debt than Comcast.\u201cBut at some point, if the bid is too high from Comcast,\u201d he said, \u201cthen Disney will have to walk away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Sex, Cash and Death\u2019: The Story Behind \u2018A Very English Scandal\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the three-part mini-series \u201cA Very English Scandal\u201d hits Amazon Prime on June 29, it will be received by a much different audience than the one that rapturously watched it on BBC One last month. That audience was presumably much better-versed on the scandal that inspired the series (and the John Preston true-crime novel it was adapted from), which involved a closeted gay member of Parliament named Jeremy Thorpe, a male model, blackmail and a murder plot.If you aren\u2019t familiar with the history, one of the pleasures of the series is watching it unspool in all its stranger-than-fiction glory. But if you want some background, or you\u2019re fuzzy on the details, here\u2019s a primer on the key events and players, as well as on the shamelessly lascivious tabloid coverage that swirled around the story.Thorpe was a member of British Parliament for 20 years, where he served as representative of the North Devon district. In 1967, at age 37, he assumed leadership of the Liberal Party and held the post for nine years \u2014 more than doubling their voter support.He was also rumored to be gay, and although he did not acknowledge it (particularly because male homosexual acts were against the law in Britain until 1967) and married twice, he only admitted to homosexual \u201ctendencies\u201d during his 1979 trial. He insisted he was never more than friends with Norman Scott.Scott, an author and former male model, was a stable boy when he met Thorpe in 1961, but he first appeared in the British press in January 1976. Under the banner headline \u201cTHESE WILD SEX CLAIMS,\u201d the Daily Mirror reported that Scott, while appearing in court on a charge of defrauding a post office, made an \u201castonishing outburst\u201d: \u201cI am being hounded by people the whole time just because of my sexual relationship with Jeremy Thorpe.\u201dAccording to the Mirror, Thorpe quickly supplied a statement refuting Scott\u2019s claims, saying: \u201cIt is well over 12 years since I last saw or spoke to Mr. Scott. There is no truth in Mr. Scott\u2019s wild allegation.\u201d But within days, the same paper was reporting on the \u201criddle\u201d of a payment of 2,500 British pounds Scott said he received in exchange for letters from Thorpe. Scott said the transaction was handled by Peter Bessell, from whom he reportedly received a \u201cmonthly retainer\u201d for six months in the late 1960s. Bessell described those payments as charity for a \u201cdestitute\u201d man, and that \u201cno further significance should be read into those payments.\u201dHolmes was a wealthy banker, one of the deputy treasurers of the Liberal Party and a loyal friend of Thorpe\u2019s (he was best man at Thorpe\u2019s first wedding); shortly after the \u00a32,500 payoff became public knowledge, he came forward to admit that he had supplied the funds. But there was more: Holmes was accused of hiring a hit man, allegedly at Thorpe\u2019s prodding, through a chain of contacts that included two acquaintances named John Le Mesurier and George Deakin. The man they allegedly settled upon was an airline pilot named Andrew Newton; Holmes, Le Mesurier and Deakin would eventually stand trial with Thorpe for conspiracy to murder.The trial concluded just over a month later, after testimony from Scott, Bessell, Newton and others (but not from Thorpe), with a widely ridiculed round of jury instructions from the judge, Sir Joseph Cantley. He insulted most of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, branding Scott a \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201csponger,\u201d \u201cwhiner\u201d and \u201cparasite\u201d; calling Bessell \u201ca humbug\u201d and Newton \u201ca chump\u201d; and insisting that none could be trusted because they all stood to benefit financially by selling their stories to the press.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers Must Get Radical to Fight Back Against Janus", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which ruled that public sector unions may no longer require all the workers they represent to pay \u201cagency fees,\u201d is a wound to the labor movement that will bleed resources at a time when it\u2019s already weak. Working Americans must now get radical to get heard. Even the lawyer representing the unions warned during oral arguments that when unions are denied agency fees, \u201cthey tend to become more militant, more confrontational.\u201d The moment now necessitates it.The Janus decision comes just weeks after the Supreme Court issued a decision in Epic Systems v. Lewis that curtailed employees\u2019 ability to band together in class-action lawsuits, forcing workers to go it alone if they experience discrimination or abuse.Taken together, the decisions indicate that a majority on the Supreme Court seems to be ignorant of the enormous power corporations now hold. Corporate consolidation has meant Americans have little option but to accept whatever pay and benefits are on offer. Big employers force low-wage employees to sign agreements that bar them from working for competitors and have even colluded with one another to keep pay down. Demands for lower prices from behemoths like Walmart and Amazon even hold down workers\u2019 wages at suppliers and contractors.It used to be that this kind of power was at least tempered by the countervailing power held by the work force, through unions that worked to increase pay and benefits, even for nonunionized Americans. But their clout has long been on the decline. In the mid-1950s, about one in three workers were in a union. Today it\u2019s one in 10.Workers will have to reconstruct this countervailing power and find new ways to build solidarity. We\u2019re going to have to get bold again.We\u2019ve seen a version of what this could look like in this year\u2019s teachers strikes. As the momentum of those strikes has shown, when workers are boxed into a corner there\u2019s appetite for going outside the normal lines of acceptable action. In West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arizona and Kentucky, where teachers are not legally allowed to strike, they nevertheless walked out of classrooms and won raises for themselves and other state employees.It won\u2019t be easy. Going on strike is no longer a familiar exercise for American workers. Last year there were just seven major work stoppages, the second-lowest number ever recorded. In the aftermath of Janus, if unions are further undermined, workers will need to take on this kind of organizing themselves. The teachers strikes offer yet another example of how this can work. The rank and file did much of the organizing in Oklahoma over social media, and the union leadership had to catch up to the members\u2019 overwhelming desire to strike.Teachers were up against state lawmakers, who they can vote out of office. It could be harder for private-sector workers going up against the largest corporations on the planet.Americans have done this before. In the 1930s, workers had to get militant in the face of a legal landscape in which strikes and organizing were restricted or even banned. That period ended with a truce that exchanged labor peace for laws that facilitated unionization, a truce that is now all but broken. We have no choice but to take up our organizing arms once more.If we don\u2019t, employers will only hoard more power. Economic growth will continue to leave us out. And if the courts keep turning their backs on us, we will have no choice but to take drastic measures.Bryce Covert is a contributor at The Nation and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Roberts Court Protects the Powerful for a New Gilded Age", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Purdy is a professor of law at Duke.Faith in courts runs deep in the American liberal imagination. Remembering Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade and the recent marriage-equality decisions, we keep hoping that wise and fair-minded judges will protect the vulnerable and lead the country toward justice.When it comes to economic inequality, today\u2019s Supreme Court is not only failing to help but is also aggressively making itself part of the problem in a time when inequality and insecurity are damaging the country and endangering our democracy.Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the court has consistently issued bold, partisan decisions that have been terrible for working people. Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, decided on Wednesday, was one of them.Just hours after that decision, Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement. With this \u201cswing\u201d vote gone, Chief Justice Roberts is now likely to take even more control over the direction of issues related to economic inequality \u2014 a direction that is earning him a legacy as chief justice of bosses, not workers.It\u2019s the kind of knotty technical issue \u2014 one type of fee for nonmembers of one variety of union \u2014 that makes law boring. Unlike the Masterpiece Cakeshop case the court decided in June, Janus isn\u2019t an obvious morality tale: Even many liberals often have mixed feelings about the public-sector unions that represent bureaucrats, subway employees, police officers and teachers.But Janus is big. As Justice Elena Kagan explained in her dissent, allowing employees to opt out of paying union fees while getting the benefits of representation risks starving the unions of resources, leading to ineffectiveness and collapse. Moreover, knifing unions at a time of intense controversy over state austerity budgets and widespread teachers\u2019 strikes suggests, as Justice Kagan wrote, that the court \u201cwanted to pick the winning side\u201d in these fights by \u201cweaponizing the First Amendment, in a way that unleashes judges, now and in the future, to intervene in economic and regulatory policy.\u201dThe New Deal shook American law. Its triumph brought new attention to economic power. Antitrust law worked to cut back corporate concentration and control. Labor unions were essential to what the Progressive-Era jurist Louis Brandeis called \u201cindustrial democracy\u201d \u2014 democracy adapted to a complex modern economy.Some people still imagine \u201cworkers\u201d as white men, but the American working classes are increasingly female, immigrant and nonwhite. There\u2019s no separating these hierarchies.The 1970s court also returned to its old habit of dressing economic power in constitutional principle. The dominance of the very rich in American politics is often attributed to the Citizens United decision of 2010, but that case only amplified a 1976 opinion, Buckley v. Valeo, in which the court shredded post-Watergate campaign-finance regulation and announced that private individuals could spend unlimited sums on candidates (including themselves). When the Roberts court used the First Amendment to protect corporate (and union) political spending in Citizens United, it was extending a longer-running trend. This is part of what Justice Kagan means when she observes that the conservative majority is weaponizing the First Amendment.These cases have the potential to make economic and political inequality significantly worse. Take the mandatory arbitration cases. In 1992, as the Supreme Court began to allow arbitration to enter employment relationships, only 2 percent of non-unionized companies imposed arbitration on their workers. Today the figure is 54 percent and sure to grow because it conveniently ties the hands of disgruntled or mistreated workers. These cases have replaced a majority of employees\u2019 legal protections with a system of private agreements that replicates the unequal bargaining power of workers and companies. Arbitration agreements will become only more important as \u201cgig\u201d employers such as Uber devise their contracts to get around labor law.And as the court used to recognize explicitly, there is no keeping economic power separate from political power. The remaining (disproportionately public-sector) unions are bastions of support for Democrats. The partisan overtones of suits seeking to weaken union influence are uncomfortably overt: The court was asked, in effect, to shift the rules in favor of Republican constituencies, and the votes fell out along squarely partisan lines.It is especially damaging for the court to rule with such unmistakable partisan implications when many still hope to see it stand as a forum of principle against the Trump administration\u2019s self-dealing, attacks on immigrants and other vulnerable groups, and general disregard for the procedural regularity that is the day-to-day life of the rule of law.But the challenge is deeper than partisanship. Democracy treats people as equals. An economy that makes them increasingly unequal undermines it.Justice Frankfurter was right. Economic and political matters are inseparable, and the law decides how they are stitched together. The Supreme Court can defend bosses\u2019 bargaining power, the political spending power of the very wealthy and the prerogative of states to deny health care to their low-wage workers \u2014 or it can curb these powers to support a modern safety net. It can tilt organized labor closer to a death spiral, as it did with Janus; but with different justices, it might recognize the importance of unions to postindustrial democracy, as previous courts did.These are choices. A different law of economic power is possible. In a time of significant economic inequality, we need campaign-finance laws that limit the influence of wealth and treat citizens as equals. We need a labor law that helps workers organize in new kinds of workplaces, such as home health care and the gig economy. We need antitrust law that can wrestle with the new quasi-monopoly power of platform-based companies such as Amazon and Facebook. We need forms of social caretaking and security that are even stronger and more universal than Obamacare.These aren\u2019t tasks for the Supreme Court. They are jobs for better legislators and presidents \u2014 and for scholars, unions and mobilized citizens. What is at stake is whether American democracy can overcome the new Gilded Age of inequality and insecurity. The justices, meanwhile, are part of the problem: In Janus and other rulings, they have retrenched on the side of private power and budgetary austerity. A different law of economic power will have to wait for a different court, and that will come only through winning elections. Those victories get more uphill every year, thanks in no small part to the current court.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thermostats, Locks and Lights: Digital Tools of Domestic Abuse", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The people who called into the help hotlines and domestic violence shelters said they felt as if they were going crazy.One woman had turned on her air-conditioner, but said it then switched off without her touching it. Another said the code numbers of the digital lock at her front door changed every day and she could not figure out why. Still another told an abuse help line that she kept hearing the doorbell ring, but no one was there.In more than 30 interviews with The New York Times, domestic abuse victims, their lawyers, shelter workers and emergency responders described how the technology was becoming an alarming new tool. Abusers \u2014 using apps on their smartphones, which are connected to the internet-enabled devices \u2014 would remotely control everyday objects in the home, sometimes to watch and listen, other times to scare or show power. Even after a partner had left the home, the devices often stayed and continued to be used to intimidate and confuse.For victims and emergency responders, the experiences were often aggravated by a lack of knowledge about how smart technology works, how much power the other person had over the devices, how to legally deal with the behavior and how to make it stop.\u201cPeople have started to raise their hands in trainings and ask what to do about this,\u201d Erica Olsen, director of the Safety Net Project at the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said of sessions she holds about technology and abuse. She said she was wary of discussing the misuse of emerging technologies because \u201cwe don\u2019t want to introduce the idea to the world, but now that it\u2019s become so prevalent, the cat\u2019s out of the bag.\u201dConnected home devices have increasingly cropped up in domestic abuse cases over the past year, according to those working with victims of domestic violence. Those at help lines said more people were calling in the last 12 months about losing control of Wi-Fi-enabled doors, speakers, thermostats, lights and cameras. Lawyers also said they were wrangling with how to add language to restraining orders to cover smart home technology.Muneerah Budhwani, who takes calls at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said she started hearing stories about smart homes in abuse situations last winter. \u201cCallers have said the abusers were monitoring and controlling them remotely through the smart home appliances and the smart home system,\u201d she said.Graciela Rodriguez, who runs a 30-bed emergency shelter at the Center for Domestic Peace in San Rafael, Calif., said some people had recently come in with tales of \u201cthe crazy-making things\u201d like thermostats suddenly kicking up to 100 degrees or smart speakers turning on blasting music.\u201cThey feel like they\u2019re losing control of their home,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter they spend a few days here, they realize they were being abused.\u201dSmart home technology can be easily harnessed for misuse for several reasons. Tools like connected in-home security cameras are relatively inexpensive \u2014 some retail for $40 \u2014 and are straightforward to install. Usually, one person in a relationship takes charge of putting in the technology, knows how it works and has all the passwords. This gives that person the power to turn the technology against the other person.Emergency responders said many victims of smart home-enabled abuse were women.Connected home gadgets are largely installed by men, said Melissa Gregg, a research director at Intel working on the implications of smart home technology. Many women also do not have all the apps on their phones, said Jenny Kennedy, a postdoctoral research fellow at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, who is researching families that install smart home technology.The people who spoke to The Times about being harassed through smart home gadgetry were all women, many from wealthy enclaves where this type of technology has taken off. They declined to publicly use their names, citing safety and because some were in the process of leaving their abusers. Their stories were corroborated by domestic violence workers and lawyers who handled their cases.Each said the use of internet-connected devices by their abusers was invasive \u2014 one called it a form of \u201cjungle warfare\u201d because it was hard to know where the attacks were coming from. They also described it as an asymmetry of power because their partners had control over the technology \u2014 and by extension, over them.One of the women, a doctor in Silicon Valley, said her husband, an engineer, \u201ccontrols the thermostat. He controls the lights. He controls the music.\u201d She said, \u201cAbusive relationships are about power and control, and he uses technology.\u201dShe said she did not know how all of the technology worked or exactly how to remove her husband from the accounts. But she said she dreamed about retaking the technology soon.\u201cI have a specific exit plan that I\u2019m in the process of implementing, and one of my fantasies is to be able to say, \u2018O.K. Google, play whatever music I want,\u2019\u201d she said. Her plan with the smart thermostat, she said, was to \u201cpull it out of the wall.\u201dWhen a victim uninstalls the devices, this can escalate a conflict, experts said. \u201cThe abuser can see it\u2019s disabled, and that may trigger enhanced violence,\u201d said Jennifer Becker, a lawyer at Legal Momentum, a women\u2019s rights legal advocacy group.Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said disabling the devices could also further cut off a victim. \u201cThey\u2019re not sure how their abuser is getting in and they\u2019re not necessarily able to figure it out because they don\u2019t know how the systems work,\u201d Ms. Galperin said. \u201cWhat they do is they just turn everything off, and that just further isolates them.\u201dLegal recourse may be limited. Abusers have learned to use smart home technology to further their power and control in ways that often fall outside existing criminal laws, Ms. Becker said. In some cases, she said, if an abuser circulates video taken by a connected indoor security camera, it could violate some states\u2019 revenge porn laws, which aim to stop a former partner from sharing intimate photographs and videos online.Advocates are beginning to educate emergency responders that when people get restraining orders, they need to ask the judge to include all smart home device accounts known and unknown to victims. Many people do not know to ask about this yet, Ms. Becker said. But even if people get restraining orders, remotely changing the temperature in a house or suddenly turning on the TV or lights may not contravene a no-contact order, she said.\u201cI\u2019m sure that it\u2019s happening,\u201d said Zach Perron, a captain in the police department in Palo Alto, Calif. \u201cIt makes complete sense knowing what I know about the psychology of domestic violence suspects. Domestic violence is largely about control \u2014 people think of physical violence but there\u2019s emotional violence, too.\u201dSome people do not believe the use of smart home devices is a problem, said Ruth Patrick, who runs WomenSV, a domestic violence program in Silicon Valley. She said she had some clients who were put on psychiatric holds \u2014 a stay at a medical facility so mental health can be evaluated \u2014 after abuse involving home devices.\u201cIf you tell the wrong person your husband knows your every move, and he knows what you\u2019ve said in your bedroom, you can start to look crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to believe someone\u2019s crazy than to believe all these things are happening.\u201dAsking everyone in a home to understand smart home technology is essential, researchers said.\u201cWhen we see new technology come out, people often think, \u2018Wow, my life is going to be a lot safer,\u2019\u201d said Katie Ray-Jones, chief executive of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. But \u201cwe often see the opposite with survivors of domestic violence.\u201dIf you are in an abusive relationship, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.Advertisement"}

Lasnik of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington agreed to the sentence and ordered Mr. Sanchez to pay more than $190,000 in restitution, John P. Cronan, the acting assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice\u2019s criminal division, said in a statement.\u201cRaphael Sanchez was entrusted with overseeing the honest enforcement of our country\u2019s immigration laws,\u201d Mr. Cronan said. Instead, Mr. Sanchez \u201cabused that trust, and capitalized on his position at ICE to exploit his victims and line his own pockets.\u201dMr. Sanchez\u2019s lawyer, Cassandra Stamm, did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment. In a sentencing memorandum filed last week, Ms. Stamm said that Mr. Sanchez admitted that he \u201cabused a position of public trust\u201d and defrauded people, including some who were \u201cparticularly vulnerable.\u201dBut she said Mr. Sanchez, who resigned from ICE in February and relinquished his law license, was unable to overcome \u201cadverse\u201d childhood experiences that \u201cultimately led him to thoroughly sabotage all that he had worked for so long and so hard to achieve by committing this serious offense.\u201dMr. Sanchez started working for ICE in 2001, the same year that he graduated from the Penn State Dickinson School of Law, Ms. Stamm\u2019s memorandum said. He took assignments aimed at curbing human smuggling and in its war crimes unit, her memorandum said. In 2011, he was promoted to chief counsel for ICE in Seattle.But from October 2013 through Oct. 25 last year, prosecutors said in their sentencing memorandum, Mr. Sanchez used ICE databases and immigration files to obtain the personal information of the seven people, including their social security numbers, birth dates, phone numbers and addresses.He then created counterfeit identity documents in their names, affixing his photograph to the ones with male names, and a photograph of a female murder victim whose image had been published in press accounts for the identity documents that had female names, prosecutors said.Some of the people have left the United States and were not aware that debt balances were growing, the sentencing memorandum from prosecutors said.\u201cHe left numerous victims to suffer in his wake,\u201d AnnaLou Tirol, the acting chief of the Justice Department\u2019s Public Integrity Section, which is overseeing the case, said in the memorandum. \u201cMore broadly, his greed may have diminished the public\u2019s trust in the honest services of its government.\u201d\u201cSanchez sold his principles for profit,\u201d Ms. Tirol added.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Brief History of MTV Trying to Make Old Hits New Again", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMTV announced Thursday that it was creating MTV Studios, which will develop new shows and revive old favorites for a variety of platforms and partners.Revivals of \u201cDaria\u201d (with the writer Grace Edwards, from \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d), \u201cThe Real World\u201d and \u201cAeon Flux,\u201d as well as new projects such as \u201cStraight Up Ghosted\u201d (in which subjects attempt to reconnect with the people who have ghosted them) are among the projects the network will presumably try to sell to services like Netflix and Amazon.\u201cWith MTV Studios, we are for the first time ever opening up this vault beyond our own platforms to reimagine the franchises with new partners,\u201d Chris McCarthy, president of MTV, said in a statement.The move to outsource some of its original programming is a departure for the company, but the methodology is hardly new. In recent years, MTV has unabashedly courted new generations of young viewers by revamping \u2014 or just repackaging \u2014 old shows, many of which began airing long before much of its core audience of 18-34-year-olds was even born.Mike Judge\u2019s vulgar animated hit aired on MTV beginning in 1993. It ended in 1997, so he could devote more time to \u201cKing of the Hill,\u201d which premiered that year. \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head\u201d returned in 2011, and was revamped to reflect MTV\u2019s programming evolution: While the eponymous teenage duo used to crack jokes about music videos, in the new version they also commented upon MTV reality shows like \u201cJersey Shore\u201d and \u201c16 and Pregnant.\u201dSince its premiere in 1992, the groundbreaking reality series has never really left, though it has gone through many updates. What began as a bare-bones series about several strangers \u201cpicked to live in a house\u201d in a major American city became more contrived as the show aged and reality TV became its own genre, with familiar tics and beats. The most recent seasons of \u201cReal World\u201d have channeled programs like the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d franchise and MTV\u2019s own \u201cJersey Shore\u201d \u2014 \u201cReal World: Ex-Plosion\u201d and \u201cReal World: Skeletons,\u201d for instance, centered on cast members being ambushed by their exes and others from the past.Essentially \u201cReal World\u201d with an Italian-American conceit, \u201cJersey Shore\u201d was a breakout hit when it premiered in 2009. Its core cast \u2014 including Snooki (Nicole Polizzi), \u201cThe Situation\u201d (Michael Sorrentino) and JWoww (Jennifer Farley) \u2014 parlayed their success into lucrative business deals and social media fame that outlived the show\u2019s conclusion in 2012 after six seasons. (It also spawned a few cast member spinoffs.)After it launched in 1998, \u201cTRL\u201d quickly became a crucial platform for the biggest pop stars of that era, including Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and \u2019N Sync. Viewers voted for their favorite music videos and tuned in each weekday afternoon to watch the host, Carson Daly, count down the top 10 choices and interview celebrity guests.The original incarnation ran for a decade, though the show\u2019s influence mostly petered out long before the end. (Mr. Daly departed in 2003.) The rise of YouTube and other instantly gratifying corners of the internet meant teenagers no longer had to wait for MTV to play the music videos they craved. Artists now promote and premiere new works across multiple streaming platforms, including Snapchat and Instagram, none of which stopped MTV from bringing back \u201cTRL\u201d in 2017.In April, initial reports that MTV had canceled \u201cTRL\u201d proved inaccurate, with the network clarifying that the show was on hiatus but would return in yet another revamped form. It currently airs weekday mornings, is no longer live, and Sway Calloway, an MTV mainstay, is a host.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Cities Can\u2019t Stop Poaching From One Another", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not just sports franchises: Tax incentives to lure companies tend to help politicians, but they don\u2019t really make economic sense.The measure was part apology for poaching the Golden State Warriors from Oakland, part declaration of city principles (\u201cSan Francisco Will Not Endorse or Condone the Relocation of Any Team With an Extensive History in Another Location\u201d). Voters, who said yes to several tax increases, looked at this largely symbolic measure and voted \u201cno.\u201dThat result was perhaps predictable; coveting what others have is implicit city policy nearly everywhere. The doctrine explains why corporations are so successful at extracting tax breaks from competing communities, why sports teams know their relocation threats usually work, why Amazon\u2019s HQ2 sweepstakes has prompted such a bloated bidding war.The more intriguing question, then, is not whether these deals make sense, but why politicians and voters are so keen on them.\u201cIt\u2019s a little baffling, given that there seems to be such consensus on these programs,\u201d said Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cJust like you could with immigration blame immigrants for crime \u2014 because it\u2019s popular, even if you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s true \u2014 you can use incentives as a way to take credit for economic development,\u201d Mr. Jensen said. \u201cEven if you know a company is coming anyway.\u201dThe inverse is also true: Incentives help politicians deflect blame when a company bypasses them. At least they clearly tried.Mr. Jensen and Mr. Malesky have also found that directly elected mayors offer bigger incentives and demand less oversight of deals than indirectly elected city managers. In other words, the politicians most responsive to voters offer the most. That dynamic may help explain why even some public officials reluctant to bid on Amazon did so anyway.The question wording didn\u2019t present alternative uses of the money, but that\u2019s not how incentives are typically framed to the public. Respondents across these cities who supported doing whatever it takes to lure Amazon cited the additional tax revenue and taxpayers they expected the community to get in exchange.Politicians dangle incentives because voters want them to. And voters want them to in large part because politicians say that incentives make a real difference. \u201cThe dirty big secret,\u201d Mr. LeRoy said, \u201cis that they don\u2019t.\u201dConsultants once had to contact cities to obtain all of that information, said Chris Steele, who runs the North American practice for the location strategies firm Investment Consulting Associates. Now much of it is easily accessible in public data. By the time consultants reach out to cities today, they really only need to ask two questions they don\u2019t already know the answers to: What real estate is available? And what incentives are you offering?\u201cIt\u2019s created an illusion that incentives are much more important in the process than they really are, and/or that it\u2019s the only thing communities have left that they can actually do something about,\u201d Mr. Steele said.Incentive deals also often include \u201cbut for\u201d clauses, statements companies sign pledging that they wouldn\u2019t come to town, or create these jobs, but for the incentives. Those lines offer political cover, too. And they further perpetuate the public belief that communities have to keep entering these bidding wars.In San Francisco, Allen Jones believes the solution, at least with sports teams, is for more cities to make a pledge like Proposition I.

Not all are Blaxploitation films, but the variety of those that are underscores the notion that Blaxploitation was always more of a movement than a genre. Given Brown Sugar\u2019s ever-growing collection, it\u2019s hard to know just where to dive in.

Given Brown Sugar\u2019s ever-growing collection, it\u2019s hard to know just where to dive in. Here are a few suggestions on some of the best Blaxploitation films the service has to offer.An obvious place to start after watching the remake, \u201cSuperfly\u201d incorporates an stylish fashion sense and memorable soundtrack by Curtis Mayfield to bring a sense of class and soul to the world of drug dealers in an early example of Ghetto Fabulous. Directed by Gordon Parks Jr. (whose father found success a year earlier with \u201cShaft\u201d), \u201cSuperfly\u201d trades cops for crooks and still manages to find a moral center. Youngblood Priest (Ron O\u2019Neal), dressed to the nines and adorned with a cross necklace that doubles as a coke spoon, wants to escape his life of drug dealing and go straight. He needs to complete one last job before walking away, but the job leads him deep into a conspiracy, one that costs more than he counted on.An obvious place to start after watching the remake, \u201cSuperfly\u201d incorporates an stylish fashion sense and memorable soundtrack by Curtis Mayfield to bring a sense of class and soul to the world of drug dealers in an early example of Ghetto Fabulous.

Detective John Shaft (Richard Roundtree) acts with action hero efficiency to take down a New York mob, but his presence demands respect not only from black militants but from a number of white members of the police force as well. \u201cShaft\u201d served as a bridge between black and white audiences, a fact that was rewarded with both a Grammy and an Academy Award for Isaac Hayes\u2019s soundtrack. The film spawned two sequels, the first of which, \u201cShaft\u2019s Big Score,\u201d is also available on Brown Sugar. Expect the character to return in a major way next year when \u201cSon of Shaft\u201d unites three generations.

Can you dig it?A year before Charles Bronson took his revenge to the streets in \u201cDeath Wish,\u201d Pam Grier was dealing out vigilante justice on her own terms. This influential film by Jack Hill follows a nurse who seeks revenge on her entire community\u2019s drug organization. Disguising herself as a prostitute, Coffy takes down the pushers in a variety of extreme ways, the most notable of which involves the metal shiv she hides in her afro. Considered a Blaxploitation classic today, \u201cCoffy\u201d wasn\u2019t met with enough success in its time to engender any sequels, but Grier and Hill rejoined the next year for the similarly themed \u201cFoxy Brown.\u201d Both of these films served as the inspiration for Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cJackie Brown,\u201d which helped put the spotlight back on Grier.A year before Charles Bronson took his revenge to the streets in \u201cDeath Wish,\u201d Pam Grier was dealing out vigilante justice on her own terms.

Directed, written, produced, composed, edited and starring Melvin Van Peebles, \u201cSweetback\u201d is notable for its unflinching look at urban black neighborhoods. The film follows a young man, gifted with extraordinary sexual prowess, as he navigates South Central Los Angeles and is blamed for a murder he didn\u2019t commit. Chased by the police and the Hell\u2019s Angels, he travels through a world where there is no safety or quarter for a black man. While neither the most enjoyable nor most competently made film on this list, it\u2019s a must watch for film-history buffs looking for this cinema movement\u2019s origins.It\u2019s rough, it\u2019s dirty, and there\u2019s nothing sweet about it. \u201cSweetback\u201d gave birth to the Blaxploitation era.

Although less action-packed than other films featuring Grier, its political nature feels particularly relevant because of its concerns over white supremacists in high places. Despite the twists and turns the film takes, the high point is the comedic banter between Grier and Yaphet Kotto. And with Eartha Kitt playing the role of a fashion designer who figures into the conspiracy, \u201cFriday Foster\u201d is more fun than it has any right to be.It\u2019s a racially-charged conspiracy film given all the charm of Howard Hawks\u2019s \u201cHis Girl Friday.\u201d Based on the comic strip of the same name, \u201cFriday Foster\u201d follows a former-model-turned-photojournalist (played by the Blaxploitation queen Pam Grier) who uncovers an assassination plot against the nation\u2019s wealthiest African-American.

Directed by Arthur Marks (\u201cFriday Foster\u201d), \u201cDetroit 9000\u201d once again blends political intrigue with humor, but it takes a darker turn. The film puts together a young black detective and an old-school white detective to solve a case of stolen funds that could swing a campaign against a black congressman. Dealing with the racial divide of Detroit, the film explores a city that is tearing itself apart. With a bloody shootout to rival any of its contemporaries, and a moral dilemma that offers no easy answers, \u201cDetroit 9000\u201d challenges notions of justice as frequently as it excites with its buddy dynamics and high-action set pieces.This combination of a buddy-cop picture and a heist flick is a favorite of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s, and it\u2019s the easiest to recommend to anyone looking for some flair and blockbuster panache.

The former football player, Truck Turner (Isaac Hayes), now a bounty hunter, finds himself up against a ruthless Madame, played by Star Trek\u2019s Nichelle Nichols, and a sociopathic pimp played by Yaphet Kotto. Devoid of any larger conspiracies or social lessons, \u201cTruck Turner\u201d keeps the stakes real but is wholly interested in providing an action-packed and good-humored time \u2014 and in doing it with a wink and a smile. One of Blaxploitation\u2019s strongest hidden gems, and a recent addition to Brown Sugar\u2019s library, \u201cTruck Turner\u201d is the perfect entry for a movie night with friends.Isaac Hayes\u2019s Blaxploitation legacy may be most often identified with \u201cShaft,\u201d but \u201cTruck Turner\u201d is one of the greatest things that soul man ever put forth.

Sure, \u201cBlacula\u201d has become a bit of a joke over the course of the decades since its release, and it isn\u2019t exactly terrifying, but it has enough blood and gothic sensibility to deliver some genuinely creepy moments. One of many Blaxploitation horror movies, \u201cBlacula\u201d is often lumped with \u201cBlackenstein\u201d and \u201cDr. Black and Mr. Hyde,\u201d which are also available on Brown Sugar. Offering gothic romance with an African twist, \u201cBlacula\u201d follows Prince Mamuwalde (William Marshall), a vampire whose new neighborhood rejects him at every turn, as he falls in love with a girl. A poignant tragedy, \u201cBlacula\u201d takes itself far more seriously than its title and reputation would suggest. It\u2019s sequel, \u201cScream Blacula Scream,\u201d is also available on Brown Sugar.In its ability to cross genres, Blaxploitation made no exception for horror.

Tapping into the popularity of the James Bond films, \u201cCleopatra Jones\u201d put the Bond girl type front and center as Jones, a federal agent, went after deranged drug lord known as Mommy (Shelley Winters). Equipped with a car full of gadgets, a background in martial arts and a love for her people, Cleopatra Jones worked for the United States government, which made her stand apart from her fellow Blaxploitation heroes. While it offers more flair than grit, fans of the espionage genre will get a kick out of this film\u2019s stylish twist on the familiar conventions.

Slaughter\u2019s explosive crusade led to his teaming up with United States federal agents in South America in order to destroy a supercomputer used to run a criminal empire. It\u2019s full-blooded nonsense that serves as a likely, partial inspiration to the Blaxploiation satire \u201cBlack Dynamite.\u201d \u201cSlaughter\u201d lacked the social justice aspect of many of its counterparts, but it made Brown one of the most prominent actors of the Blaxploitation era. \u201cBlack Gunn,\u201d in which Brown also stars, is available on Brown Sugar as well.Ten years before Rambo drew first blood, there was the one-man army \u201cSlaughter.\u201d Taking a step out of the neighborhood, the film follows Vietnam veteran Slaughter, played by the human wrecking ball and former Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown as he hunts down the mobsters who killed his father.

But despite its crude makeup, \u201cThe Candy Tangerine Man\u201d follows a pimp know as the Black Baron (John Daniels), who rules the streets by night and by day resumes his life as a hard-working suburban father and husband. While the film\u2019s ethics are questionable at best, it is an interesting examination of the kind of superheroism attributed to pimps and hustlers. Despite being a later entry in the Blaxploitation canon, this film operates with a seediness that feels closer to \u201cSweetback\u201d than some of the more commercially appealing Blaxploitation films that came later.With its biting jive talk, violent extremes and unabashed preoccupation with sex, this film may be too vulgar for some.

Together, gifted with the skills of sharpshooting, martial arts and all around charm, these three heroes take on a neo-Nazi brigade that plans to commit genocide against African-Americans by poisoning the water supply with a newly discovered formula. While the film is far more interested in explosions than in plot, it is well-shot and delivers some noteworthy across-state action. The chemistry among the three leads, who all seem to share the screen amiably, makes this a Blaxploitation event film. In addition to several films starring Brown, plenty of films starring Williamson and Kelly can be found in Brown Sugar\u2019s library as well.Bringing together the stars Jim Brown, Fred Williamson and Jim Kelly, this feature from Gordon Parks Jr. is the \u201cAvengers\u201d of Blaxploitation films.

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s JD.com Deal Shows Silicon Valley Still Wants In on China", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Google, a half a billion dollars is a drop in the bucket. But that money could have an outsize impact on the American tech giant\u2019s ability to re-enter China.That doesn\u2019t mean that Silicon Valley moguls have abandoned hopes of building up their Chinese presences. Here\u2019s where some of the top tech companies stand with their forays into China.As part of the JD.com investment, the Chinese online retailer will promote products on the Google Shopping platform. The company also has other business lines in that country:\u2022 A patent licensing partnership with Tencent, one of China\u2019s biggest internet companies.\u2022 Investments in start-ups like Chushou, a Chinese equivalent to the Twitch video game streaming site, and XtalPi, a biotechnology company.\u2022 A small set of apps, like ones for file management and language translation.For now, here\u2019s what Facebook has going in the country:\u2022 Though Facebook doesn\u2019t operate in China, it remains an important market for ad spending, with advertising from Chinese companies and \u2014 somewhat surprisingly \u2014 local governments and state news media appearing on the social network to reach international audiences.Unlike its internet-based rivals, Apple is free to sell its products and services in China, from iPhones to music streaming.Here\u2019s one explanation why:\u2022 China is the second-largest market for Apple, contributing 20 percent of overall sales. In Apple\u2019s most recent fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the company reported $44 billion in net sales within China. (That figure was down from the previous year, thanks to lower iPhone sales.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret Life and Value of Trees", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterTrees are sociable, it turns out, and even somewhat selfless, nurturing their drought-stricken or wounded arboreal siblings. They share nutrients. They suffer when a big arm is lopped during the growing season, or a crown is next to an all-night light. Some trees warn other trees of danger by releasing chemical drifts.I found these relatively new discoveries not long after a giant fir came crashing down in my front yard during a freakish windstorm, nearly crushing my family and our century-old house. We were spared by six inches. But a question remained: What was the big guy trying to say?Trees are fighting back, helped by others doing the talking for them. Sadly, we are past the point when an appeal to our better angels does any good. \u201cIt is worse than boorish, it is criminal to inflict an unnecessary injury on the tree that feeds or shadows us,\u201d wrote Henry David Thoreau. \u201cOld trees are our parents, and our parents\u2019 parents, perchance.\u201d A lovely sentiment, but largely futile.\u201cI have mixed feelings about monetizing the geography of hope,\u201d said Peter Jackson, a writer and conservationist, using one of the best-known phrases of Wallace Stegner. A wilderness in the Cascade Mountains is named for his late father, Senator Henry M. Jackson, a giant of Congress from an era when support for purple mountain majesties was bipartisan.The president is a fossil fool, but beyond that, he\u2019s never taken a view that extends to the world that Ivanka\u2019s grandchildren will inherit. His bias for dirty 19th-century energy is based on pleasing a coal industry that has gone from employing 883,000 people in the 1920s to barely 50,000 now. If the free-market philosophy were still the bedrock principle of governing Republicans, coal would be left to the creative destruction of capitalism.Beyond the economic value, trees force us to measure time in epochs. In 1870, Victor Hugo planted a tree outside his home in exile on the island of Guernsey. His hope was that when the little sapling was a mighty oak, Europe would be unified. The European Union and Hugo\u2019s plant are still standing, though the tree may be in better shape than the E.U.A spruce in Sweden, which sprouted sometime after the last ice age, is 9,500 years old, having survived all the upheavals of history and weather. But will it live through the current era?In \u201cThe Hidden Life of Trees,\u201d an international best seller by Peter Wohlleben, and \u201cThe Overstory,\u201d a masterful new novel by Richard Powers, forests are main characters, crying to be heard. In the summer, Powers writes, water traveling through a single chestnut \u201cdisperses out of the million tiny mouths of the undersides of leaves, a hundred gallons a day evaporating from the tree\u2019s airy crown into the humid Iowa air.\u201dSome scientists think it\u2019s wrong to anthropomorphize trees. They aren\u2019t sentient life-forms, and can\u2019t really \u201ctalk\u201d like that grumpy apple tree Dorothy encounters on the way to Oz. But surely they communicate, through a system that foresters compare to the neural networks of humans. It\u2019s worth a listen.Advertisement"}

Actually, no. The queen is two years, one month and 15 days older than Dr. Westheimer, who turns 90 on Monday and is in talks for a return to television. But the point she wanted to make did not hinge on exactness.\u201cI didn\u2019t see her smile,\u201d Dr. Westheimer said. Always the therapist, she offered advice: \u201cSomebody should have talked to the queen \u2014 look happy so others can rejoice even if you disagree.\u201d Of course Dr. Westheimer would have been happy to have been that somebody. \u201cIf I were there, I\u2019d have made her smile,\u201d she said. \u201cHow wonderful is this \u2014 how wonderful that she is still alive to experience change in the British Empire, when a divorced biracial woman can marry a prince.\u201dDr. Westheimer is still the 4-foot-7-inch dynamo who published her autobiography 30 years ago, when she was only 59 \u2014 one review was headlined \u201cThe Long Life of a Short Woman.\u201d She has just published another autobiography, this one illustrated, like a graphic novel. So 90 seemed an appropriate moment to ask: What have you learned along the way?\u201cOooh, how much time do you have?\u201d she chirped in the idiosyncratic voice that a long-ago listener described as \u201cGrandma Freud.\u201d She continued: \u201cHow fast do I have to talk? It\u2019s an important question.\u201dFor a moment, before the conversation turned into a whirlwind account of what she is up to these days, she took stock. \u201cNot only was I one of the first to talk about matters of sexuality, but the timing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I started the radio program in 1981, not many people were talking about sexuality. Not many people were talking about AIDS or HIV. I said you have to use condoms and know with whom you go to bed.\u201dThis was in the early 1980s, before Viagra \u2014 and before commercials for Viagra and its competitors. Dr. Westheimer preached stimulation and satisfaction, and soon she was a celebrity.But now there is a problem. \u201cThere is an age that does not know me,\u201d she said last week.So, another television show, for another generation. She said the format would be to go to college campuses and tape episodes with a younger co-host. She would not say where the program would be carried because the contract had not been signed. She did say the producers had initially wanted a woman as the co-host. \u201cI said, \u2018No, give me a man,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI will let him talk, too \u2014 I will discipline myself.\u201d\u201cUsually when I go on the boat, I ask the captain to read questions to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe last time, the captain was British, very tall, and had to say \u2018orgasm\u2019 and \u2018erection.\u2019 Never did they think they would hear the captain talk about the things we were talking about.\u201d This time around, she said, she hoped the captain would have time. \u201cIf not, I will take the second-in-command.\u201dThen there are the new books, both written with Pierre A. Lehu, a friend who has been an adviser since 1981. (\u201cShe gave me a title long ago: minister of communications,\u201d he said.) Besides the illustrated autobiography, there is \u201cStay or Go: Dr. Ruth\u2019s Rules for Real Relationships.\u201d\u201cAnybody who\u2019s in a good relationship, don\u2019t buy this book,\u201d she said.That does not sound like a marketing plan that would go over well with the publisher, Amazon Publishing. She is not worried. \u201cI don\u2019t check with them,\u201d she said.A documentary is also in the works. The film crew will attend her birthday party on Monday night, taping reminiscences from the 400 friends she has invited. It will be held at the Museum of Jewish Heritage, in Lower Manhattan. She is a board member, and when she raises money for the museum, she has a unique pitch. She tells donors, \u201cYou get good sex for the rest of your life.\u201dThe humor is disarming, as her humor has always been, but not disarming enough to mask a basic fact of her identity: Before she was \u201cDr. Ruth,\u201d she was a German-Jewish refugee. She describes herself as \u201can orphan of the Holocaust, not a victim.\u201d\u201cI do not call myself a survivor,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents sent me to Switzerland on a Kindertransport.\u201d Her father had been taken away by the Gestapo; after World War II, she learned that her parents had been killed in the Holocaust, possibly at Auschwitz. She emigrated to Palestine, joined the paramilitary group Haganah and was wounded in an explosion.She retraced her life there a couple of weeks ago with the documentary crew in tow. The cameras were rolling as she assembled a rifle like the one she learned to shoot. But there is a difference now. \u201cBecause of Columbine, I would never touch a gun again,\u201d she said.The cameras also followed her to Haifa, where she visited her first boyfriend. She had known him in Switzerland.\u201cHe was smarter than me,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause he was a boy, he was allowed to study in high school.\u201dThis is described in the illustrated autobiography. She said the dormitories in Switzerland had a strict lights-out policy. \u201cBut there was light in the stairwell,\u201d she said, so he would pass his books to her. She would sneak into the stairwell and read.She was in Israel last month when the United States Embassy in Jerusalem was dedicated. \u201cI decided not to go,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not doing politics. I talk about sex from morning till night. People like me have to stay away from politics.\u201dSo, for a moment, let us return to stocktaking at 90.\u201cI saved some lives by saying don\u2019t have one-night stands,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m the same. I\u2019m old-fashioned. I\u2019m still talking about relationships. I\u2019m still saying be careful. Young people don\u2019t see anybody die nowadays, but I say the same to them. They think they can have one-night stands.\u201dAnd there was one more thing about the royal wedding, about the bride and groom.\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re having a good sex life,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has had sex before, she found Prince Charming and captured him. They don\u2019t need Dr. Ruth.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified Dr. Ruth Westheimer\u2019s publisher. It is Amazon Publishing, not Amazon Books.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Getting to the Bottom of \u2018Thrift Store Smell\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHave you noticed that every thrift store and neighborhood Goodwill smells the same? And that the clothes also smell the same? With the help of science, we got to the root of why. (And we have tips to help you get rid of it.)That vintage store smell: We all know it, that musty, grandma\u2019s attic-y smell that licks your nostrils the moment you cross the threshold of any vintage, consignment or used clothing store, no matter how high- or low-end. Where does it come from? And more important, how do I get it out of my purchases when I get them home? \u201cGood vintage smells a wee bit musty, but more like a whiff of wool or your grandmother\u2019s attic,\u201d Ms. McDonnell said. \u201cMaybe just the slightest hint of a cigarette smoke from a party; more like a life well-lived than anything gross.\u201d Vintage items that truly reek, she warns, \u201ccan, like bad-smelling food, portend all sorts of other problems \u2014 damage, moths or other bugs (shudder).\" She also notes that the garment may simply be made from a fabric that retains odors, holding onto them stubbornly even after washing.I sent a bundle of vintage clothes I purchased at random to be tested at the P & G labs. Mary Johnson, a principal scientist at Tide, explained the testing methods: \u201cEach item was placed into a headspace sampling bag and sealed. Then, using an automated headspace sampling system, the bag was filled with nitrogen to equilibrate at room temperature for two hours before headspace was collected onto a thermal desorption unit (TDU) tube packed with 35-60 Tenax-TA adsorbent resin. The headspace samples on TDU tubes were analyzed via thermal desorption in a chromatography mass spectrometry system. Chemical identification was performed using mass spectral libraries.\u201d Did you follow all of that? Me neither. Essentially, they put the clothes in a big resealable bag, shut it up, pumped it full of some nitrogen and then did a bunch of tests on the resulting gas to determine what the smells were coming from.Here\u2019s what they found: 12 of 18 of the key malodor molecules that contributed to the bouquet of that vintage smell were derived from body soils, which is a gentle way of saying your skin, your sweat, your oils. Distressing! But, perhaps, not nearly as distressing as the list of odor descriptors that accompanied the compounds. Sweet, sour, oily, herbal. Fatty. Whiskey, nutty, cheesy, sweaty. Stinky feet. Fermented. Bready. The source of the remaining compounds that made up that vintage smell were environmental contaminants like car exhaust, gasoline, dry cleaning solvents, food and perfume or, as the team at P & G put it, \u201cthe odor molecule peaks form a record of the odors\u201d that the garments were exposed to over its life.When it comes to removing that vintage odor, machine- or hand-washing is ideal. While it may be tempting to outsource the work to a dry cleaner, it\u2019s a temptation you should resist. Dry cleaning is simply not as good at odor elimination as wet cleaning, and that\u2019s especially true when it comes to odors caused by perspiration and other body soils. There are some best practices to follow when laundering vintage clothing, or anything that\u2019s especially rank-smelling. Machine washing will be the best choice for most garments, and if you go that route, stick with cold water, don\u2019t overstuff the machine and opt to air dry the clothes, or machine dry using the no- or low-heat setting. High heat drying can amplify lingering smells. One quirky way to de-funk accessories like beaded clutches, leather jackets and shoes that can\u2019t be machine- or hand-washed is to bury them in kitty litter. Clean litter, please! An ingredient commonly found in kitty litter formulas is active charcoal, and it is an excellent odor absorber. If you are cat-free, you needn\u2019t rush out to buy a giant bag of litter; loose active charcoal can be purchased at pet supply stores in the section devoted to the housing of aquatic life, or even easier, at Amazon.That vintage store smell, complex and bready though it may be, can certainly be removed from your clothes. The bigger challenge is to force your brain not to think about what this means your clothes will smell like when they turn up in a vintage store 30 years from now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will AT&T Be Able to Handle HBO?", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMedia analysts and tech-industry prognosticators look at AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner and wonder about the future of an industry in flux. Hollywood looks at the deal and wonders what\u2019s going to happen to HBO.The cable network that gave the world \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is the glittering jewel of Time Warner. And now that a federal judge has emphatically rejected the Justice Department\u2019s attempt to block the merger, it is much closer to being the property of a conservatively run company based in Dallas.HBO\u2019s would-be minders are experts in distribution systems and profit margins who know little or nothing about the ego-fueled dramas that help put the show in show business. Will these telecommunications executives be able to put up with the producers, directors and stars whose work gave the network 29 Emmys last year?\u201cHBO\u2019s and AT&T\u2019s cultures also come from a very different financial perspective,\u201d said Gary Arlen, the head of Arlen Communications, a research firm that examines the media and telecommunications industries. \u201cAT&T comes from a legacy of rate regulations, and every expense has to be justified.\u201dAnd on the personal level, how will the relationship go between Richard Plepler, the smooth-talking, perpetually tanned chief executive of HBO, and the man who would be his new boss, Randall Stephenson, a former national chairman of the Boy Scouts of America? The two executives seem as different from each other as the companies they run.\u201cAT&T is very much oriented toward technology, but it still comes from the mentality of pole climbers and operations guy,\u201d Mr. Arlen said.HBO is facing a change in ownership as it finds itself competing for viewers and talent like never before.In 2013, when Mr. Plepler became chief executive of the premium cable network, it was almost alone in its field. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was proving to be an unlikely hit with audiences and critics, and Netflix, a company best known, at the time, for sending DVDs in red envelopes to subscribers nationwide, was not yet a threat. Its first real hit, \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d was just about to start its first season.In the 20 months since the AT&T deal was announced, the competition has grown more intense. Netflix now spends $8 billion on content annually, with Amazon kicking in more than $4 billion for its own programming efforts. Another streaming company, Hulu, has an annual budget of roughly $2.5 billion, a figure that is close to what HBO lays out each year.Once the deal is completed, Mr. Plepler will report to John Stankey. In his more than 30 years at AT&T, Mr. Stankey has held a long list of positions: chief executive of the AT&T entertainment group, group president of telecom operations, chief executive of business solutions.In the coming weeks, Mr. Stankey will go on a corporate good-will tour \u2014 he is expected to a host a forum for HBO employees in New York next week, and he will do the same for the channels in Time Warner\u2019s Turner family, including TBS and TNT.Whatever he says probably won\u2019t change Mr. Plepler\u2019s view that HBO needs to be left alone in order to thrive.\u201cYou have to have a Chinese wall between the creative process and everything else,\u201d Mr. Plepler told The New York Times shortly after the deal was announced in 2016. He added that he would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if AT&T did not embrace that.Since then, AT&T has said the right things \u2014 for the most part.\u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re acquiring a business that\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said at a recent tech conference in California. \u201cIt\u2019s been run very independently. HBO is run independently from Warner Bros., which is run independently from Turner, and it\u2019s been a very good model.\u201dAT&T executives have considered how the company might take advantage of HBO\u2019s creative engine to generate new forms of video for mobile devices. And Mr. Stephenson has stressed the need to amplify HBO\u2019s streaming service.\u201cI\u2019m anxious to kind of move the direct-to-consumer platforms as aggressively as possible,\u201d he said at the tech conference.Those statements suggest that AT&T wouldn\u2019t get in Mr. Plepler\u2019s way. But at another conference, Mr. Stephenson let slip one comment that hinted at a more aggressive brand of corporate oversight.\u201cIt will cause Plepler at HBO to panic when I say this,\u201d he said, \u201cbut can you begin to think about things like \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 as an example, where, in a mobile environment, a 60-minute episode may not be the best experience? Should you think about 20-minute episodes?\u201dAlthough HBO still generates big revenue ($6.3 billion last year), its status as the ultimate prestige network is under some threat. While it has led all TV networks in Emmy nominations for 17 consecutive years, that gap is narrowing. Netflix, which makes shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d had 20 fewer nominations than HBO last year; three years ago that gap was more than 90.And in an effort to be all things to all viewers, Netflix turns out programming in dramas, comedies, stand-up specials, documentary series and unscripted reality shows. To counter that approach, HBO executives have begun describing their network as the home of curated content, something like a high-end content boutique.But that strategy comes with some risk.With far fewer releases each year than Netflix, each of HBO\u2019s shows is under more pressure to succeed. \u201cHere and Now,\u201d a drama from Alan Ball that premiered this year, has already been canceled. \u201cSuccession,\u201d the network\u2019s new drama about a warring media family, has had so-so ratings and mixed reviews, but HBO has already renewed it for a second season.\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the most popular series in the network\u2019s history, has six episodes left before it bows out. The network has ordered a pilot for a potential spinoff series, with at least three others in development. \u201cWestworld\u201d has had steady ratings in its second season, drawing more than two million viewers an episode, according to Nielsen\u2019s delayed-viewing data. That\u2019s bigger than anything else on premium cable right now.The network\u2019s next big bet is on a limited series starring Amy Adams and directed by the \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d which premieres in July. If HBO executives knew that \u201cHere and Now\u201d was a miss \u2014 as its sedate marketing campaign suggested \u2014 they are telegraphing the opposite for \u201cSharp Objects.\u201d\u201cIt ranks up there with some of the finest things we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Mr. Plepler told Variety on Tuesday.Mr. Plepler has made clear that talent \u2014 whether Mr. Vall\u00e9e or Ms. Adams or Nicole Kidman \u2014 and his connection to it is what makes HBO work.\u201cIt\u2019s very much part of the DNA of HBO: Talent is sacred,\u201d Mr. Plepler said after the AT&T deal was announced. \u201cThey bring the magic into our company. Writers, producers, actors. It\u2019s their gifts that make HBO HBO. It\u2019s pretty clear to anybody who looks at our company from afar \u2014 and, in AT&T\u2019s case, more closely \u2014 we are a talent-centric place.\u201dIn what could be construed as a plea to his possible future boss, he added: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine, with everything that Randall made clear to us, why would you ever change a winning game? I don\u2019t think they have any intention of doing so.\u201dEdmund Lee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Charts That Show How Big Business Is Winning", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAll of these companies have decided that their best strategy for raising profits involves getting bigger. Larger companies simply have more power \u2014 to compete with other giants, to restrain workers\u2019 pay, to influence government policy and, in the long run, to increase prices.It\u2019s true beyond the media industry, too. Airlines, banks and oil companies have merged in recent decades. So have retailers, hospitals, hotels, manufacturers, drug companies and law firms. The resulting behemoths have then taken advantage of their newfound scale, as well as globalization and digital technology, to grow further.So I set out to create one, with help from an obscure Census Bureau data set known as Business Dynamics Statistics. It shows how many American workers are employed by different-size companies, now and in the past.The changes over the past quarter-century are pretty remarkable.In the late 1980s, small companies were still a lot bigger, combined, than big companies. In 1989, firms with fewer than 50 workers employed about one-third of American workers \u2014 accounting for millions more jobs than companies with at least 10,000 employees.Since then, though, many small businesses have struggled to keep up with the new corporate giants and with foreign competition. You can probably see a version of the story in your community. The hardware store has given way to The Home Depot. The local hospital and bank are owned by a chain. The supermarket is Whole Foods, which is now owned by Amazon. The family-owned manufacturer may simply be out of business.The share of Americans working for small companies fell to 27.4 percent in 2014, the most recent year for which data exists, down from 32.4 in 1989. And big companies have grown by almost an identical amount. Today, companies with at least 10,000 workers employ more people than companies with fewer than 50 workers.\u201cThis has been a blind spot for the last 20, 30 years,\u201d Ro Khanna, a Democratic member of Congress who represents Silicon Valley, told me. \u201cOne of the things that people are rebelling against in this country is large, growing institutions. People feel that individuals don\u2019t control their destiny.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A License to Discriminate", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bedoya is the former chief counsel to the Senate\u00a0Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law.Sweeping privacy violations have the strange effect of revealing that the tracking of consumers by marketers affects everyone while hiding how that tracking hurts some people far more than others. People who value their privacy come from all demographic groups, but the impact of consumer tracking varies greatly by race, class and power. When you\u2019re the \u201cright\u201d race, gender and sexual orientation, when you\u2019ve got the right schools and jobs on your profile, marketers use tracking to flatter and include you. When you\u2019re not, tracking is more likely to be used to exclude or exploit you. This disparate impact is a civil rights issue, and it should be treated like one by Congress.It\u2019s one thing to receive junk mail or phone calls because you\u2019re on one of those lists. But the sophisticated, real-time ad targeting developed by Facebook and other companies takes this marketing to another level. Tech companies can now target \u2014 or exclude \u2014 you entirely in secret, and often at the precise moment when you are most vulnerable.Congress needs to act. In other key areas of American economic life, from employment to housing to credit, Congress has built general protections for everyone \u2014 a minimum wage, mortgage insurance, disclosure rules for loans \u2014 but it has also recognized that those are not enough. Instead, in each of these areas, Congress has also seen it necessary to pass special protections for racial minorities and other vulnerable groups.Federal privacy law is blind to race. Legally, creating a list of Ethnic Second-City Strugglers is as innocuous as creating a list of people who like \u201cPAW Patrol.\u201dThe European law thus implicitly recognizes that privacy is a matter of civil rights.

Some of it could be de-orbited.\u201dThe administration has proposed eliminating direct federal contributions to the space station by 2025 and allocating $150 million to develop \u201ccommercial successors,\u201d including companies like Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and Blue Origin, which was started by Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.NASA\u2019s options for privatization may be limited by the international agreements establishing the I.S.S. A coalition of over a dozen countries helped assemble the structure, the first piece of which launched into orbit in 1998.The United States has spent almost $100 billion on the space station, and even some Republicans in Congress are skeptical of the move to privatize its mission.\u201cAs a fiscal conservative, you know one of the dumbest things you can do is cancel programs after billions in investment when there is still serious usable life ahead,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said after the budget proposal was released in February.Mr. Cruz declined to comment on Mr. Bridenstine\u2019s statements on Wednesday.In the new Pew survey, 63 percent of respondents said that monitoring Earth\u2019s climate should now be among the top priorities for NASA, compared to just 13 percent who favored prioritizing a return of astronauts to the moon.The Trump administration moved earlier this year to cancel the Carbon Monitoring System, a NASA research program that costs $10 million per year.In a meeting with reporters, Mr. Bridenstine said that ending that program would not signal a lack of investment in other climate research missions.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to that, and I\u2019m committed to that, and we\u2019re going to continue doing it,\u201d he said.Mr. Bridenstine was confirmed by the Senate to run the agency in April in a 50-49 vote split along partisan lines. It marked the end of a seven-month-long nomination process slowed in part by views he had expressed on the science of climate change.Mr. Bridenstine said that his beliefs on climate change have evolved.\u201cI want to be really clear, I do believe carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s over 400 parts per million at this point, which is greater volumes than we\u2019ve seen before, and that\u2019s because of human activities.\u201d\u201cThere is no agency on the face of the planet that has the credibility to study it and understand it \u2014 so that policymakers can make good decisions \u2014 than NASA.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Facebook\u2019s two billion monthly active users, and the way those accounts are linked and viewed by users and by third parties, have made it the most powerful communications and media company in the world, even if its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, insists his is a technology business.Throughout its history, Facebook has adamantly argued that it treats our data, and who has access to it, as a sort of sacred trust, with Zuckerberg & Company being the trustees. Yet at the same time, Facebook has continued to undermine privacy by making it cumbersome to opt out of sharing, trying to convince users that we actually do want to share all of our personal information (and some people actually do) and by leaving the door unlocked for its partners and clients to come in and help themselves. Those partners have included 60 device makers that used application programming interfaces, also known as A.P.I.s, so Facebook could run on their gadgets.The European Union has passed such legislation, called the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., which forces companies such as Facebook to do a better job shielding individual data.

{"Headline": "Facebook Gave Device Makers Deep Access to Data on Users and Friends", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "The company formed data-sharing partnerships with Apple, Samsung and dozens of other device makers, raising new concerns about its privacy protections.As Facebook sought to become the world\u2019s dominant social media service, it struck agreements allowing phone and other device makers access to vast amounts of its users\u2019 personal information.Facebook has reached data-sharing partnerships with at least 60 device makers \u2014 including Apple, Amazon, BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung \u2014 over the last decade, starting before Facebook apps were widely available on smartphones, company officials said. The deals allowed Facebook to expand its reach and let device makers offer customers popular features of the social network, such as messaging, \u201clike\u201d buttons and address books.But the partnerships, whose scope has not previously been reported, raise concerns about the company\u2019s privacy protections and compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing, The New York Times found.[Here\u2019s what we know about Facebook\u2019s partnerships with device makers.]In the furor that followed, Facebook\u2019s leaders said that the kind of access exploited by Cambridge in 2014 was cut off by the next year, when Facebook prohibited developers from collecting information from users\u2019 friends. But the company officials did not disclose that Facebook had exempted the makers of cellphones, tablets and other hardware from such restrictions.In interviews, Facebook officials defended the data sharing as consistent with its privacy policies, the F.T.C. agreement and pledges to users. They said its partnerships were governed by contracts that strictly limited use of the data, including any stored on partners\u2019 servers. The officials added that they knew of no cases where the information had been misused.The company views its device partners as extensions of Facebook, serving its more than two billion users, the officials said.\u201cThese partnerships work very differently from the way in which app developers use our platform,\u201d said Ime Archibong, a Facebook vice president. Unlike developers that provide games and services to Facebook users, the device partners can use Facebook data only to provide versions of \u201cthe Facebook experience,\u201d the officials said.Some device partners can retrieve Facebook users\u2019 relationship status, religion, political leaning and upcoming events, among other data. Tests by The Times showed that the partners requested and received data in the same way other third parties did.Facebook\u2019s view that the device makers are not outsiders lets the partners go even further, The Times found: They can obtain data about a user\u2019s Facebook friends, even those who have denied Facebook permission to share information with any third parties.In interviews, several former Facebook software engineers and security experts said they were surprised at the ability to override sharing restrictions.\u201cIt\u2019s like having door locks installed, only to find out that the locksmith also gave keys to all of his friends so they can come in and rifle through your stuff without having to ask you for permission,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a research and privacy consultant who formerly served as the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist.By Rich Harris and Gabriel J.X. DanceDetails of Facebook\u2019s partnerships have emerged amid a reckoning in Silicon Valley over the volume of personal information collected on the internet and monetized by the tech industry. The pervasive collection of data, while largely unregulated in the United States, has come under growing criticism from elected officials at home and overseas and provoked concern among consumers about how freely their information is shared.In a tense appearance before Congress in March, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, emphasized what he said was a company priority for Facebook users.\u201cEvery piece of content that you share on Facebook you own,\u201d he testified. \u201dYou have complete control over who sees it and how you share it.\u201dBut the device partnerships provoked discussion even within Facebook as early as 2012, according to Sandy Parakilas, who at the time led third-party advertising and privacy compliance for Facebook\u2019s platform.\u201cThis was flagged internally as a privacy issue,\u201d said Mr. Parakilas, who left Facebook that year and has recently emerged as a harsh critic of the company. \u201cIt is shocking that this practice may still continue six years later, and it appears to contradict Facebook\u2019s testimony to Congress that all friend permissions were disabled.\u201dThe submission followed testimony by Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global public policy, during a closed-door German parliamentary hearing in April. Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker, one of the lawmakers who questioned Mr. Kaplan, said in an interview that she believed the data partnerships disclosed by Facebook violated users\u2019 privacy rights.\u201cWhat we have been trying to determine is whether Facebook has knowingly handed over user data elsewhere without explicit consent,\u201d Ms. Winkelmeier-Becker said. \u201cI would never have imagined that this might even be happening secretly via deals with device makers. BlackBerry users seem to have been turned into data dealers, unknowingly and unwillingly.\u201dAn Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Samsung declined to respond to questions about whether it had any data-sharing partnerships with Facebook. Amazon also declined to respond to questions.Usher Lieberman, a BlackBerry spokesman, said in a statement that the company used Facebook data only to give its own customers access to their Facebook networks and messages. Mr. Lieberman said that the company \u201cdid not collect or mine the Facebook data of our customers,\u201d adding that \u201cBlackBerry has always been in the business of protecting, not monetizing, customer data.\u201dMicrosoft entered a partnership with Facebook in 2008 that allowed Microsoft-powered devices to do things like add contacts and friends and receive notifications, according to a spokesman. He added that the data was stored locally on the phone and was not synced to Microsoft\u2019s servers.Facebook acknowledged that some partners did store users\u2019 data \u2014 including friends\u2019 data \u2014 on their own servers. A Facebook official said that regardless of where the data was kept, it was governed by strict agreements between the companies.\u201cI am dumbfounded by the attitude that anybody in Facebook\u2019s corporate office would think allowing third parties access to data would be a good idea,\u201d said Henning Schulzrinne, a computer science professor at Columbia University who specializes in network security and mobile systems.The Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed how loosely Facebook had policed the bustling ecosystem of developers building apps on its platform. They ranged from well-known players like Zynga, the maker of the FarmVille game, to smaller ones, like a Cambridge contractor who used a quiz taken by about 300,000 Facebook users to gain access to the profiles of as many as 87 million of their friends.Those developers relied on Facebook\u2019s public data channels, known as application programming interfaces, or APIs. But starting in 2007, the company also established private data channels for device manufacturers.At the time, mobile phones were less powerful, and relatively few of them could run stand-alone Facebook apps like those now common on smartphones. The company continued to build new private APIs for device makers through 2014, spreading user data through tens of millions of mobile devices, game consoles, televisions and other systems outside Facebook\u2019s direct control.Facebook began moving to wind down the partnerships in April, after assessing its privacy and data practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Mr. Archibong said the company had concluded that the partnerships were no longer needed to serve Facebook users. About 22 of them have been shut down.The broad access Facebook provided to device makers raises questions about its compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the F.T.C.After the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the F.T.C. began an investigation into whether Facebook\u2019s continued sharing of data after 2011 violated the decree, potentially exposing the company to fines.Facebook officials said the private data channels did not violate the decree because the company viewed its hardware partners as \u201cservice providers,\u201d akin to a cloud computing service paid to store Facebook data or a company contracted to process credit card transactions. According to the consent decree, Facebook does not need to seek additional permission to share friend data with service providers.\u201cThese contracts and partnerships are entirely consistent with Facebook\u2019s F.T.C. consent decree,\u201d Mr. Archibong, the Facebook official, said.But Jessica Rich, a former F.T.C. official who helped lead the commission\u2019s earlier Facebook investigation, disagreed with that assessment.\u201cUnder Facebook\u2019s interpretation, the exception swallows the rule,\u201d said Ms. Rich, now with the Consumers Union. \u201cThey could argue that any sharing of data with third parties is part of the Facebook experience. And this is not at all how the public interpreted their 2014 announcement that they would limit third-party app access to friend data.\u201dTo test one partner\u2019s access to Facebook\u2019s private data channels, The Times used a reporter\u2019s Facebook account \u2014 with about 550 friends \u2014 and a 2013 BlackBerry device, monitoring what data the device requested and received. (More recent BlackBerry devices, which run Google\u2019s Android operating system, do not use the same private channels, BlackBerry officials said.)Immediately after the reporter connected the device to his Facebook account, it requested some of his profile data, including user ID, name, picture, \u201cabout\u201d information, location, email and cellphone number. The device then retrieved the reporter\u2019s private messages and the responses to them, along with the name and user ID of each person with whom he was communicating.The data flowed to a BlackBerry app known as the Hub, which was designed to let BlackBerry users view all of their messages and social media accounts in one place.The Hub also requested \u2014 and received \u2014 data that Facebook\u2019s policy appears to prohibit. Since 2015, Facebook has said that apps can request only the names of friends using the same app. But the BlackBerry app had access to all of the reporter\u2019s Facebook friends and, for most of them, returned information such as user ID, birthday, work and education history and whether they were currently online.The BlackBerry device was also able to retrieve identifying information for nearly 295,000 Facebook users. Most of them were second-degree Facebook friends of the reporter, or friends of friends.In all, Facebook empowers BlackBerry devices to access more than 50 types of information about users and their friends, The Times found.Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting.June 4, 2018April 4, 2018March 20, 2018March 17, 2018Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seattle Officials Repeal Tax That Upset Amazon", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeattle officials scuttled a corporate tax on Tuesday that they had wholeheartedly endorsed just a month ago, delivering a win for the measure\u2019s biggest opponent \u2014 Amazon \u2014 and offering a warning to cities bidding for the retailer\u2019s second headquarters that the company would go to the limit to get its way.But in Seattle, the notion has proved extraordinarily contentious, culminating in the abrupt reversal on Tuesday.Less than a month ago, the tax had passed unanimously. It was signed into law on May 16 by Jenny A. Durkan, Seattle\u2019s mayor, who said the money would \u201cmove people off the street and into safer places\u201d and \u201cclean up the garbage and needles that are in our parks and in our communities,\u201d as well as provide resources including job training and health services.\u201cI know we can be a city that continues to invent the future and come together to build a more affordable, inclusive and just future,\u201d she said.The opponents funded No Tax on Jobs, an effort aimed at getting enough signatures to put a repeal on the November ballot. It became obvious over the weekend that the measure would succeed in coming before voters, leading Ms. Durkan and seven council members to issue a statement saying, \u201cWe heard you.\u201dThe politicians had no stomach for a protracted battle over jobs, even at a moment when the area\u2019s unemployment rate is only 3.1 percent. \u201cIt is clear that the ordinance will lead to a prolonged, expensive political fight over the next five months that will do nothing to tackle our urgent housing and homelessness crisis,\u201d they said.Mike O\u2019Brien, a council member, said in an interview before the vote, \u201cI have a couple of bad choices and I\u2019m picking the less bad,\u201d meaning a vote to repeal.He was puzzled by the intensity and the virulence of the opposition. \u201cThis tax is not a perfect tool, but I think it\u2019s a good one,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there talking to the community, I hear they\u2019ve been convinced by Amazon and other business leaders that this would be bad.\u201dTeresa Mosqueda, one of the two council members opposing the repeal, said there was no backup plan for dealing with the homeless situation.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a path forward,\u201d she said. \u201cI share the frustration with all the City Council that we have been out-messaged.\u201dKshama Sawant, the other opponent of repeal on the council, called the vote \u201cboth capitulation and betrayal.\u201d\u201cThey are choosing to base themselves on making Amazon executives happy,\u201d she said. That \u201cis the biggest lesson that should reverberate to other cities as well.\u201dThe city\u2019s initial plan was for the tax to collect about $500 per employee a year. Amazon responded in early May by stopping its expansion in the city \u201cpending the outcome of the head tax vote.\u201d That was sufficient to get the tax knocked down to about $275 per employee and scaled back in other ways. The tax was limited to companies with at least $20 million in revenue a year.In recent months, however, there has been the beginning of a resistance to the notion that what is good for Amazon is inevitably good for its host.\u201cFrom coast to coast, people lose their homes and get displaced from their communities even as the biggest corporations earn record profits and development booms,\u201d said Sarah Johnson, director of Local Progress, a national association of progressive elected municipal officials. \u201cElected officials across the country are paying close attention to how Amazon and other corporations have responded to Seattle\u2019s efforts to confront their affordable housing and homelessness crisis.\u201dEspecially, it seems, in Silicon Valley itself, where both problems run deep.\u201cWe have needs we need to meet,\u201d said Lenny Siegel, the city\u2019s mayor. \u201cAnd we look to see where there\u2019s the most money. Most of our companies have money. We\u2019re trying to find a way for them to invest it that helps them and the community.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It eviscerated us.\u201dHe went on: \u201cWhat occurred there is what a lot of people\u2019s impression of our city is, violence, urban decay, lack of economic opportunity. That\u2019s why Art All Night was so important. It provided this beacon of hope.\u201dAs law enforcement officials investigated and event organizers waited to retrieve art from the crime scene, the shooting raised questions not just about the future of Art All Night, but the well-being of the city itself: a place where some 20,000 government workers flood in every day only to disappear by dusk, leaving behind an expanse of dilapidated warehouses and a famous sign, \u201cTrenton Makes, the World Takes\u201d \u2014 reminders of its heyday as a hub of manufacturing.Over the past several years signs of revitalization have appeared. The city may not have a major port or proximity to a major metropolis, assets that other once-industrial New Jersey cities have used to reinvent themselves. But it does have what is a rarity in New Jersey, said George D. Sowa, the chief executive officer of an organization called Greater Trenton: affordability.Mr. Sowa\u2019s group has spearheaded economic development in Trenton, recruiting companies and even pitching Trenton as a location for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. As he ran his hand over a map, Mr. Sowa spoke of how the city could attract a company like Amazon, pointing to Trenton\u2019s many train lines and proximity to Newark Liberty Airport, but also to its old warehouses, vast brick relics of the city\u2019s past. \u201cYou can almost get a building here in Trenton for free,\u201d he said.Mr. Sowa cited the Chambersburg neighborhood, where an industrial property was recently transformed into the Roebling Lofts, as proof that the adage of developers \u2014 bring the artists and the money will follow \u2014 could prove true in Trenton, too.The Art All Night event has played a central role in that transformation.This year, more than 25,000 people were expected to attend Art All Night, which was held at the 50,000-square-foot Roebling Wire Works, once a factory that supplied wire cables for the Brooklyn and Golden Gate Bridges.Still, Trenton faces a host of issues \u2014 a poverty rate of nearly 28 percent and a median household income of around $34,400, well below the state average.The mayor\u2019s office noted that Trenton is also hurt by the state\u2019s exemption from paying property taxes on the large tracts of land it owns downtown.\u201cThey\u2019re short-handed. They\u2019re spread thin,\u201d said Regina Thompson-Jenkins, 51, an educator and a volunteer for Everytown for Gun Safety whose 19-year-old son was killed by gunfire in Trenton six years ago.The police director, Ernest Parrey Jr., pointed to a recent decline in the number of homicides and shootings.Still, gun violence has continued to plague the city. In a 2017 report, the mayor\u2019s office said that since 2014 the authorities collected more than 1,700 firearms in a state-funded buyback program and seized more than 230 in arrests and investigations.Gangs were once a larger menace in the city, but still remain a presence.On Sunday morning, the forces shaping Trenton collided.The arts festival grew rowdy after midnight, the Mercer County prosecutor\u2019s office said, and had to be shut down by the police after fistfights broke out. Then shots rang out shortly before 3 a.m.The one fatality, Tahaij Wells, 32, one of the gunmen, was shot by the police. He had a long arrest record and had been released from prison in February on parole, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Officials said another suspect, Amir Armstrong, 23, had been charged with unlawful possession of a weapon and was being treated for injuries from the shooting. A third suspect, whom officials did not name, was also injured in the shooting, but there were not yet charges filed against him.About two dozen people were injured, two of whom were in critical condition, according to hospital officials.The day after the event, questions remained unanswered over the nature of the confrontation and how the police and officials responded to a warning that had gone out on Facebook the night of the event. \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t go to Art All Night!,\u201d it said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be shooting it up!\u201dAna Lozada, a kindergarten teacher whose friends attended the event, recalled their accounts of the mayhem. \u201cEveryone was screaming,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cOne lady instead of going out, she found a little hiding place inside and locked the door. She was with her child.\u201d\u201cWe try to be positive but you see, suddenly, your life could be over,\u2019\u2019 she added. \u201cYour life could be over just because some crazy people came to the event where we go every year.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Murphy vowed to focus on the needs of the city where he works, telling reporters, \u201cI\u2019m not going to turn my back on Trenton.\u201dJon Hurdle contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Tech Companies Met With Intelligence Officials to Discuss Midterms", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Eight of the tech industry\u2019s most influential companies, in anticipation of a repeat of the Russian meddling that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, met with United States intelligence officials last month to discuss preparations for this year\u2019s midterm elections.The meeting, which took place May 23 at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., was also attended by representatives from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oath, Snap and Twitter, according to three attendees of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because of its sensitive nature.The company officials met with Christopher Krebs, an under secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, as well as a representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s newly formed \u201cforeign influence\u201d task force.Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the F.B.I. responded to a request for comment.Companies like Facebook and Twitter have been changing the way they operate to counter the kind of misinformation that plagued the two social services in 2016. But the May meeting was the first significant discussion between a group of tech companies and intelligence officials ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.The meeting, which was initiated by Facebook, was seen as a hopeful first step to ensure that the midterms were not a repeat of the Russian interference in 2016, said the three people who attended the meeting.But the people who attended described a tense atmosphere in which the tech companies repeatedly pressed federal officials for information, only to be told \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 that no specific intelligence would be shared.The tech companies shared details about disinformation campaigns they were witnessing on their platforms, but neither the F.B.I. nor the Department of Homeland Security was willing or able to share specific information about threats the tech companies should anticipate, the people said.One attendee of the meeting said the encounter led the tech companies to believe they would be on their own to counter election interference.Facebook, in particular, has been facing pressure to stem disinformation ahead of the elections. The company has been hit hard by reports that it allowed Russian-backed agents to buy advertisements and manage Facebook pages with one notable goal: influence voters in the United States and stoke conflict on hot-button issues like gun control.In public and behind closed doors, intelligence officials have offered scant details about what Russia is doing, prompting frustration from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill.Officials in Washington have described problems that range from intelligence agencies losing track of Russian targets to the same kind of poor communication between various intelligence-gathering agencies that hampered the response of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency has proved an especially vexing target in recent months, stepping up efforts to mask its activity, said an American official with access to intelligence reporting.Unlike in 2016, when Russian hackers left unmistakable footprints \u2014 posting tweets that identified locations, for instance, or working in Cyrillic language documents \u2014 they are now making much better use of virtual private networks and other tools that can hide their true identities and locations.At times, the official said, intelligence agencies have lost track of specific individuals they were tracking, and could not see what, if anything, the Russians were posting or trying to hack.\u201cWe\u2019re getting so many mixed signals, depending on what the agency is,\u201d Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters last week.He said his committee was planning to bring together intelligence officials next month to figure out what was going on and how the government should handle it. \u201cIt compels us to bring everybody together in the same room and try to figure out whether or not there\u2019s some stovepipe issues,\u201d Mr. Burr said.Part of the problem, officials say, is that the White House has expressed little interest in the problem of Russian interference, and that the apathy has had a trickle-down effect. Without pressure from the top, it can be difficult to bring together all the different strands of intelligence collected across America\u2019s spy agencies, and evaluate how to act on it.\u201cWhat we would normally see in a normal administration is the principals meeting to discuss what are they doing individually, what are they doing jointly, or what they are communicating among themselves, what\u2019s the whole of government plan to protect the midterms,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and the top minority member on the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with Politico. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any evidence that\u2019s happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.K. Clears Way for Bidding War Between Comcast and Disney Over Sky", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Comcast wants to upend the Walt Disney Company\u2019s empire-building plans, and a jewel of Europe\u2019s media industry could give it an opening.As both companies pursue a bigger-is-better strategy, they are vying for control of the British satellite broadcaster Sky. A regulatory ruling on Tuesday could be a prelude to a bidding war over the company \u2014 and to a larger fight over 21st Century Fox.The deal-making machinations, which have unfolded in two countries for over a year, are complicated and interconnected. Disney has offered to buy Fox, which already owns part of Sky and has offered to buy the rest. Comcast has made plays for both Fox and Sky, all with the goal of causing trouble for Disney.Fox\u2019s bid for Sky had been held up in regulatory limbo in Britain for months over concerns that it would give Fox\u2019s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, too much control over the country\u2019s media. On Tuesday, Britain\u2019s culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, ruled that Fox could proceed with its bid, provided that it sold Sky News, the broadcaster\u2019s 24-hour news channel.In December 2016, Fox offered 18.5 billion pounds, or about $25 billion, for the piece of Sky it did not already own. Comcast countered in April with a $29 billion bid. Given the ruling on Tuesday, Comcast is expected to continue its quest to buy Sky, forcing Mr. Murdoch and Disney to pay up if they want to win.The complexity of the maneuvering underscores the shifting state of the media business. As consumers do more of their viewing online, Amazon, Netflix and other streaming services are shaking up the industry. And as the traditional players try to compete, they have decided on a collective response: making deals.Hovering over Comcast\u2019s deliberations is an antitrust ruling in another media-related deal: AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion offer for Time Warner. Fox cut off earlier talks with Comcast over antitrust concerns. A favorable ruling for AT&T could give Comcast a way back in.Sky would play an important role in the future of either Disney and Comcast. Based in London, the broadcaster and internet service provider has 23 million customers in five countries, and it owns valuable broadcasting rights to English Premier League games, Formula One races and other sporting events. It also produces its own entertainment programs and has a streaming service, Now TV.The combination makes Sky the kind of one-stop shop that Comcast and Disney want to be. Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, has called the satellite broadcaster a \u201ccrown jewel.\u201d Comcast views it as a steppingstone in its own plans to expand beyond the United States.(Mr. Hancock, the British regulator, said that a Comcast bid for Sky would be probably not raise regulatory issues, given the American cable giant\u2019s limited presence in Britain.)When Fox made its bid for Sky in 2016, regulators were again wary. Mr. Murdoch and his family are divisive figures in Britain, controlling not only Sky but also News Corp, which runs some of the country\u2019s most popular newspapers. Lawmakers and regulators have openly questioned whether the Murdochs should have so much sway over British news outlets.But Mr. Hancock said that if Fox could not reach a deal for Sky News that the government would approve, he would be forced to block its bid, adding, \u201cThis is not my preferred approach.\u201dFox, which has waited 16 months for government clearance for its bid, said it welcomed Mr. Hancock\u2019s decision. The company added, \u201cWe are confident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction.\u201dWhat is most likely to come next are internal deliberations within Fox and Disney about how much to raise their offer for Sky. Shares in the British broadcaster have jumped 22 percent since February, when Comcast announced its plans to challenge Fox\u2019s bid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Silicon Valley Could Use More Of: Inefficiency", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Hypocrisy thrives at the Waldorf School of the Peninsula in the heart of Silicon Valley. This is where Google executives send their children to learn how to knit, write with chalk on blackboards, practice new words by playing catch with a beanbag and fractions by cutting up quesadillas and apples. There are no screens \u2014 not a single piece of interactive, multimedia, educational content. The kids don\u2019t even take standardized tests.While Silicon Valley\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is making platforms, apps and algorithms to create maximum efficiency in life and work (a \u201cfriction-free\u201d world, as Bill Gates once put it), when it comes to their own families (and developing their own businesses, too), the new masters of the universe have a different sense of what it takes to learn and innovate \u2014 it\u2019s a slow, indirect process, meandering not running, allowing for failure and serendipity, even boredom.Back in 1911, the English philosopher Alfred North Whitehead said that \u201ccivilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.\u201d By that metric, Uber and Google and Amazon Prime have given us a whole lot of civilization. And there\u2019s no doubt our lives are better for it. (Ordering Chinese takeout in 30 seconds on an app might not be up there with Shakespeare or the incandescent light bulb, but it\u2019s pretty great.) This unrelenting drive for efficiency has, however, blotted out a few things we all know intuitively but seem to be forgetting.To create a product or service that is truly efficient often involves a lot of inefficiency \u2014 more like learning to knit than pressing a button. Likewise, gadgets built with a single-minded focus on efficiency can often backfire, subverting their purpose. Algorithms designed to dish up the news and information we most prefer end up blinkering us to all but a narrow slice of political and social reality. Our smartphones untether us from the office, saving us energy on travel, but also allow our lives to be interrupted nearly 24 hours a day, chewing up any productive idle time.This all seems fairly obvious. But, as Edward Tenner writes in \u201cThe Efficiency Paradox,\u201d \u201cwe sometimes need to be reminded of the obvious.\u201d Tenner has made a career worrying about unintended consequences. His 1996 book, \u201cWhy Things Bite Back,\u201d dealt with phenomena like the overuse of antibiotics leading to resistant bacteria and the introduction of football helmets causing an increase of neck and spine injuries. In 2003, he published \u201cOur Own Devices,\u201d in which he turned to what he called body technologies \u2014 sandals, office chairs, computer keyboards \u2014 and how they had impaired as much as enhanced us. In short, for every three steps forward, he sees the two steps back.With the internet now a dominant social force, Tenner is ready with his wet blanket. But he is not a cyber-pessimist or a fetishizer of the analog. He is, instead, a staunch moderate: \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s mistake is not in developing efficient algorithms from which we all benefit, but in encouraging the illusion that algorithms can and should function in the absence of human skills.\u201dThe dehumanizing effects of big data are well known and Tenner adds no groundbreaking insight here. (Books like Cathy O\u2019Neil\u2019s \u201cWeapons of Math Destruction\u201d and Evgeny Morozov\u2019s \u201cTo Save Everything, Click Here\u201d were more pioneering on this front.) But what Tenner brings is a new frame. Unlike critiquing the denizens of Silicon Valley for deepening social and economic inequality, destroying our brains or helping to undermine democratic norms (issues that seem to matter to us more than them), questioning efficiency is truly kicking the geeks where it hurts.Drawing on an eclectic bunch of anecdotes and studies, Tenner makes his way through four sectors in which \u201cintuition, skill and experience\u201d have been effectively crushed by \u201cbig data, algorithms and efficiency\u201d: media and culture, education, transportation and medicine.A few of his examples:Search algorithms have extended the ability to find scientific journal articles and books dating to the 19th century. In principle, this means scholars may encounter a broad range of research and discovery, dredge up forgotten work and possibly connect important dots. But in reality, as one sociologist found after studying citations in 35 million scientific journal articles from before and after the invention of the internet, researchers, beholden to search algorithms\u2019 tendency to generate self-reinforcing feedback loops, are now paying more attention to fewer papers, and in general to the more recent and popular ones \u2014 actually strengthening rather than bucking prevailing trends.GPS is great for getting from one point to another, but if you need more context for understanding your surroundings, it\u2019s fairly useless. We\u2019ve all had experiences in which the shortest distance, as calculated by the app, can also be the most dangerous or traffic-clogged. Compare the efficiency of GPS with the three years aspiring London cabdrivers typically spend preparing for the arduous examination they must pass in order to receive their license. They learn to build a mental map of the entire city, to navigate under any circumstance, to find shortcuts and avoid risky situations \u2014 all without any external, possibly fallible, help. Which is the more efficient, ultimately, the cabby or Google Maps?In the early 2000s, electronic medical records and electronic prescribing appeared to solve the lethal problem of sloppy handwriting. The United States Institute of Medicine estimated in 1999 that 7,000 patients in the United States were dying annually because of errors in reading prescriptions. But the electronic record that has emerged to answer this problem, and to help insurers manage payments, is full of detailed codes and seemingly endless categories and subcategories. Doctors now have to spend an inordinate amount of time on data entry. One 2016 study found that for every hour doctors spent with patients, two hours were given over to filling out paperwork, leaving much less time to listen to patients, arguably the best way to avoid misdiagnoses.Faced with all these \u201cinefficiently efficient\u201d technologies, what should we do? Tenner wants more balance. Let\u2019s not put the brakes on the drive for efficiency. These tools are good. But they should give way a bit to human sensibility, to our own instincts and insights, which could help them work even better. \u201cAnalog experience can enhance digital efficacy,\u201d he writes. \u201cDigital tools can improve analog access. We don\u2019t have to choose between the two.\u201dHis recommendations are sensible, if hard to imagine actually coming to pass. He wants us to spend more time in the physical world, in the \u201cterrain\u201d of our cities or between the paragraphs of a printed book. We need to get a little lost, pursue \u201cproductive and instructive disorientation, distraction, wild-goose chases, dead ends.\u201d He likes the idea of systematically educating high school students in the skill of online searching, so they can make the algorithms work for them rather than slavishly accepting their results. He wouldn\u2019t mind if we returned to the days of the dial-up modem, when we waited patiently for the pixels to materialize on the screen one by one. Instant gratification has dulled our senses. He\u2019d put us all in Waldorf schools if he could.If this sounds like Tenner is a man impassioned, I should be clearer: This is no manifesto. There is not much blood flowing through this book, which reads more like a report issued by a concerned think tank. Maybe it\u2019s just that preaching moderation doesn\u2019t lend itself to writing that pulls your face to the page.Gal Beckerman is an editor at the Book Review.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Newark, Police Cameras, and the Internet, Watch You", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "Surveillance cameras monitored by the police have become a ubiquitous presence in many cities. In Newark, anyone with internet access is allowed to watch.Supported byNEWARK \u2014 The camera perched above the bus stop sends back a continuous feed from the corner of 16th Avenue and South 18th Street in Newark\u2019s West Ward. Regular customers come and go from Max\u2019s, a convenience store, and a man without a shirt paces aimlessly on the same slice of pavement. Anyone with a fast internet connection and a desire to watch could also see Fernando Demarzino stepping out of his cousin\u2019s barbershop.\u201cMy girlfriend called and told me what I had in my hand,\u201d Mr. Demarzino said on a recent evening as he stood within the camera\u2019s line of sight. His girlfriend had heard about official camera feeds that had recently been made available online, and she was checking out the spot where she knew she was likely to find Mr. Demarzino. He had change in his hand, and she jokingly told him the image was sharp enough for her to count out three quarters. She also spotted his Jeep parked on the street.Surveillance cameras are an inescapable fixture of the modern city. Law enforcement agencies have deployed vast networks to guard against terrorism and combat street crime. But in Newark, the police have taken an extraordinary step that few, if any, other departments in the country have pursued: They have opened up feeds from dozens of closed-circuit cameras to the public, asking viewers to assist the force by watching over the city and reporting anything suspicious.The Citizen Virtual Patrol, as the program is called, has been hailed by officials as a move toward transparency in a city where a mistrust of the police runs deep, rooted in long-running claims of aggressive enforcement and racial animosity. The cameras, officials said, provide a way to recruit residents as Newark tries to shake a dogged reputation for violence and crime. \u201cThis is part of building a partnership,\u201d said Anthony F. Ambrose, who, as public safety director, oversees the city\u2019s police and fire operations. Since the program started about a month ago, he said, 1,600 users have signed into the website, and residents have been lobbying the department to add more cameras in their neighborhoods.But the advent of the program has provoked alarm among civil liberties groups and privacy advocates. They argue that it opens a Pandora\u2019s box of potentially devastating consequences for unsuspecting people and gives would-be stalkers or burglars a powerful tool for tracking their targets. They also argue that it pushes the police to rely heavily on the judgment of untrained civilians whose perception could be clouded by unconscious biases.The newly installed cameras look out over strips of storefronts (some bustling and others seemingly dead), public housing complexes and rows of family homes.\u201cIt\u2019s not just Big Brother,\u201d said Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. \u201cThere\u2019s an infinite number of siblings here.\u201dOfficials said the picture is improving with fewer people registering complaints about police misbehavior. Ras J. Baraka, Newark\u2019s mayor, said that the citizen patrol program was a significant piece of a broader effort to mend ties with residents.The program started in April with 62 cameras placed in areas where officers are called often or locations with heavy foot traffic. Under each camera is a sign advising \u201cThis Area Is Under Video Surveillance.\u201d Over 100 additional cameras are expected in the coming months, and eventually, the police said, the video will be accessible from a smartphone app.A police spokeswoman said the department had received several calls from residents watching the cameras, though none have led to arrests.\u201cWe want to give residents the opportunity to look with us,\u201d Mr. Baraka said in an interview. \u201cIt gives the community an opportunity to be engaged in police work and create a better relationship between the police and the community.\u201dSome critics say it could actually contribute to the problems and that the way to improve the bonds is to have more officers engage with the community and live in the city. \u201cThis is an invasive action,\u201d said Lawrence Hamm, chairman of the People\u2019s Organization for Progress, a civil rights group in Newark.Yet, so far, the program has been met with support in many corners of the city, with neighborhood watch groups petitioning for more cameras and some residents believing that it could be as effective at monitoring police officers on patrol as it could be for spotting criminal activity.\u201cThe cops need to be watched, because we all make mistakes,\u201d Quateisha Rivers, who does kitchen prep for a meal service company, said as she sat in a salon. She welcomed the cameras and brushed aside the concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s designed for safety,\u201d she said of the program. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to use it, not abuse it.\u201dCivil liberties groups have challenged the use of camera networks monitored by the authorities, citing threats to privacy rights and fears that minorities will be disproportionately accused of crimes. A system monitored by the public heightens their concerns.\u201cThe wild card here is the live stream of all this stuff,\u201d said Faiza Patel, the co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program at New York University School of Law. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a kind of flash point. Every individual and every community wants to be safe. The question is: How do we get safety? When you see measures like this, you have to wonder, whose safety is being protected and whose rights are being violated?\u201d\u201cNot only is the program not likely to reduce crime,\u201d said Eric L. Piza, a former Newark police crime analyst and associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, \u201cit has the potential to lead police to respond to situations they should not be responding to.\u201dMr. Sinha, of the civil liberties union, said the only comparable video feeds with such unlimited access were those showing traffic or beach conditions. \u201cThis is expansive,\u201d he said of the Newark program, \u201cand its stated purpose is to have people snitch on one another.\u201dOfficials say the cameras do not have facial recognition technology or the ability to track specific individuals or vehicles. (The cameras were made by Panasonic, a major corporate presence in Newark.) Mr. Baraka also said that the program was still in its early stages, and it might take some time to figure out the pitfalls.Still, he and other officials dismissed the privacy worries over the cameras, arguing that they are part of a modern climate in which the prying eyes of technology \u2014 whether from private security cameras, social media or cellphones \u2014 were difficult to evade.

But Ms. Mulligan, 33, is back onstage for a New York run in Dennis Kelly\u2019s \u201cGirls & Boys,\u201d which opens June 20 at the Minetta Lane Theater.During an interview over coffee in late May, Ms. Mulligan seemed relaxed even though she was about to pack up her family for her New York stint. (She has a three-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son with her pop singer husband Marcus Mumford.) \u201cI love New York,\u201d she said, before going on to talk about why she does relatively little theater work, how she struggled through the \u201cGirls & Boys\u201d rehearsals, and whether it\u2019s hard to switch off after a show. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.You grew up wanting to act in theater. But you\u2019ve been in relatively few plays \u2014 \u201cGirls & Boys\u201d is only the sixth since you made your debut at the Royal Court in 2004. Why is that?Was it the subject matter that seemed impossible?No, the subject matter didn\u2019t frighten me as much as doing a one-woman show. I spend my whole career trying to forget I am being watched. I look at the other person onstage in the eyes and try to tell the truth. But with a one-woman show, the other person is the audience. They are my Bill Nighy. And I didn\u2019t know how to do that.The material is nonetheless difficult, to say the least.I got the script last July and I was really pregnant, about 10 days away from having my second child. I was so excited at the thought of being back at the Royal Court that I read it on my phone, in the car, while we were driving back from the country. When I got to the reveal, I dropped the phone on the floor. [Although the reveal] concerns children and I have a boy and a girl, I didn\u2019t connect them personally to the play. My reaction was more about how to put an audience through this experience. It has to be about something other than the pain.I umm-ed and ah-ed for a couple of weeks, only because it meant going back to work sooner than I would have liked. But in the end, I felt if I didn\u2019t do it, I might spend the rest of my life regretting it.Your character, who remains nameless, is funny and sharp, but dealing with an enormous emotional burden. How did you develop a sense of who she is?I imagined what songs she might listen to, what outfit she might have worn when she met her husband. I made up lots of stories about the children, trying to flesh them out for myself. As the run went on, they became more and more real in my mind. When I\u2019m really in the show, I can hear them onstage, really loud.The first question for us was, where is this character, who is she talking to? And we decided that she was in this theater, in Chelsea or in New York, aware of her audience. The best shows feel like I am two glasses of wine in, regaling my friends. The bad ones are when you feel you are with a group of people who aren\u2019t interested.How did you approach being on your own onstage? I worked through the script with everyone and it all felt very normal. Then one day, I stood up on my own to perform it, and it was really, really difficult. I had never had so much trouble in rehearsal. I would get two pages in, my throat would get tight, and I\u2019d say, \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d Even two weeks before the opening, we were doing a run, and I did one page and my throat seized up. I actually fell to my knees and had to leave the room. I was freaking out. All those lovely people, coming to rehearsals, I had bailed on them and it was humiliating.But I felt either I will get onstage and have a panic attack, or it will work. And, unbelievably, they trusted me, and it worked. I think I couldn\u2019t be alone; I needed the audience.How do you prepare for a performance?I have an insane two-and-a-half hour routine. I get to the theater at five, eat something, go to sleep at six for half an hour, shower and do makeup and then go down onstage to warm up. In London, two previews in, I said to Lyndsey, \u201cI\u2019m so lonely, can someone come and warm up with me?\u201d So the whole crew would come and play [the board game] Articulate!, which was so great. I\u2019m hoping that in New York there will be some willing participants!Is it difficult to switch the emotions off?When it\u2019s gone well, there is an adrenaline rush that helps. When I\u2019ve had a bad show \u2014 and it\u2019s always when someone you want to see it is there \u2014 it\u2019s harder.You\u2019ve just finished the film \u201cWildlife.\u201d What is coming next?Nothing. Just \u201cGirls & Boys,\u201d and waiting for the next great thing, whatever it is.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Over 16 Years, Simon Rattle Transformed the Berlin Philharmonic. Here\u2019s How.", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 The conductor Simon Rattle stepped onto his podium here last month and gave the downbeat. But the orchestra in front of him wasn\u2019t his mighty Berlin Philharmonic \u2014 not exactly. One of the horn players was a police officer. The concertmaster was a cardiologist. The violin section included a Turkish engineer and a Dutch airline pilot.\u201cCould we be noble, rather than aggressive?\u201d Mr. Rattle asked at one point as he shaped a passage in rehearsal. Then he smiled. \u201cThat would actually be quite a good thing for all over the world, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s on the box you get via the high-art Amazon, a warning sign on the cover: \u2018This is Not Going to Be Easy,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Rattle, who has moved on to become music director of the London Symphony Orchestra, said in an interview last week.But the era ended with warmth and admiration on Sunday at an emotional, open-air farewell concert \u2014 with some players donning wigs that mimicked Mr. Rattle\u2019s instantly recognizable poof of white curls.\u201cI\u2019m sure there were many moments of \u2018lost in translation,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Rattle, now 63, a spirited choice to fill a Berlin post that had previously been held by a pantheon of more Olympian maestros, including Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, Herbert von Karajan and Claudio Abbado. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is, at this point, the \u2018lost in translation\u2019 on both sides seems mostly to translate into affection. O.K., we were a strange fit, but we also could become a team.\u201dMr. Rattle made a big statement in his first season, inviting 250 Berlin schoolchildren from different backgrounds to dance Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rite of Spring\u201d with the Philharmonic at Berlin\u2019s Treptow Arena.\u201cI had had this weird dream of putting lots of young people who had not danced with an orchestra,\u201d Mr. Rattle said.It was tied to his vision for reaching out to communities that had previously had little to do with the orchestra, which some players feared was seen as a \u201cchilly diva\u201d by too many in the vibrant city it served. Such educational initiatives were not common at the time in Germany. Sarah Willis, a horn player at the Philharmonic, recalled how surprised some players were when Mr. Rattle, at his first meeting with the ensemble, outlined his expansive education plans.\u201cYou try telling classical musicians that they have to go and stand in front of a class of 10-year-olds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking them to take their clothes off.\u201dBut it worked, and was the first of several large-scale dance projects.Mr. Rattle significantly broadened the Philharmonic\u2019s repertoire \u2014 not only by programming more new music, but also by reclaiming Baroque works that many symphony orchestras had ceded to early-music ensembles. Most notable was Peter Sellars\u2019s simple but shattering staging of Bach\u2019s \u201cSt. Matthew Passion.\u201dIt broke with any number of traditions. Singers popped up and sang from seats in the audience. The chorus, the Berlin Radio Choir, learned its parts by heart so its members could move throughout the auditorium and act. Members of the Philharmonic were asked to get up from their seats as quasi-actors in the spiritual drama.\u201cThis was the point where everybody left how wonderfully they play out in the dressing room,\u201d Mr. Rattle said. \u201cWorking with Peter on a piece like that simply involves everybody deciding on not what it sounds like, but what it means. It was a way of almost healing the orchestra from their own virtuosity and excellence. Because this music has nothing to do with that, however beautifully you can play.\u201dThe Berlin Philharmonic was once a recording-industry titan. When that industry melted, the orchestra responded by starting one of the first, and most sophisticated, orchestra streaming services, the Digital Concert Hall. The ensemble is still building a subscription base \u2014 the service costs about $17 a month \u2014 but the project has extended the orchestra\u2019s reach; its Facebook page has 1.2 million followers. And Mr. Rattle remains one of classical music\u2019s great communicators.Simon Halsey, the choral conductor who has long worked closely with Mr. Rattle, said: \u201cHow do we make sure, in days when a 17-year-old has a million choices about what he or she will do after the high school day ends, why would they practice the cello or play in the orchestra or come to a concert? Therefore you have to have these Pied Pipers, and I think he\u2019s been extraordinarily successful at that.\u201dMr. Rattle presented 40 world premieres during his tenure, and embraced contemporary music. Last season, when the American composer John Adams turned 70, Mr. Rattle made him the Philharmonic\u2019s first composer in residence, and the orchestra released a box set of his works. While the list of most-performed works of the Rattle era is still heavy with Brahms and Beethoven, 20th-century pieces by Stravinsky, Berg and Webern have also been among the most frequently heard works.The Berlin Philharmonic is considered one of the most virtuosic orchestras in the world \u2014 and one of the most independent. It was founded in 1882 by a group of musicians rebelling against their conductor. A little more than a century later, the autocratic Karajan resigned in a dispute with the players.Fergus McWilliam, a Philharmonic horn player, recalled how the orchestra had come to select Mr. Rattle. \u201cDo we turn the clock back, be a more traditional orchestra with a living museum role?\u201d he recalled the players asking themselves. \u201cOr do we embrace the future?\u201dIf any orchestra could have afforded the status quo, it was this one. It plays in a city that embraces and supports classical music like few others, and boasts a global following. It regularly sells over 90 percent of its tickets. But the players decided to go for change.Looking back, Mr. Rattle acknowledged that there were some projects he had not been able to realize, but said he was pleased over all.\u201cI think we moved this big, big ship forward,\u201d he said.On the podium last month, Mr. Rattle was putting the Be Phil amateurs through their paces as they rehearsed Brahms\u2019s First Symphony, which they were playing at the orchestra\u2019s open day, when it unlocks the doors of the Philharmonie for a day of free concerts large and small. Mr. Rattle stepped backstage, where he was given a dab of makeup \u2014 \u201cIt won\u2019t help!\u201d he joked \u2014 and found Ms. Willis, the horn player, who was waiting in the wings with a camera crew to interview him for the Digital Concert Hall.\u201cMusic is for everybody, and we\u2019ve all believed this, and this was really one of my most important goals while I was here,\u201d Mr. Rattle said, his enthusiasm tinged with a note of wistfulness. \u201cTo spread it everywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tropical Forests Suffered Near-Record Tree Losses in 2017", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Brazil, forest fires set by farmers and ranchers to clear land for agriculture raged out of control last year, wiping out more than 3 million acres of trees as a severe drought gripped the region. Those losses undermined Brazil\u2019s recent efforts to protect its rain forests.In Colombia, a landmark peace deal between the government and the country\u2019s largest rebel group paved the way for a rush of mining, logging and farming that caused deforestation in the nation\u2019s Amazon region to spike last year.That made 2017 the second-worst year for tropical tree cover loss in the satellite record, just below the losses in 2016. \u201cThese new numbers show an alarming situation for the world\u2019s rain forests,\u201d said Andreas Dahl-Jorgensen, deputy director of the Norwegian government\u2019s International Climate and Forest Initiative. \u201cWe simply won\u2019t meet the climate targets that we agreed to in Paris without a drastic reduction in tropical deforestation and restoration of forests around the world.\u201dBut figuring out precisely where forests are vanishing has long been a challenge. For decades, the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization has relied on ground-level assessments from individual countries to track deforestation. Yet not all tropical countries have adequate capacity to monitor their forests, and the measurements can be plagued by inconsistencies.\u201cAs FARC has demobilized, large areas are opening up once again, and you\u2019re seeing this rush of people grabbing land for different reasons, like planting cocoa or cattle ranching,\u201d said Mikaela Weisse, a research analyst with Global Forest Watch. The satellite data also provided a clearer picture of Brazil\u2019s vast Amazon rain forests, long vulnerable to widespread deforestation. Over the past decade, the Brazilian government has moved to reduce illegal logging, and Western agriculture companies like Cargill have pledged to farm more sustainably.But the Global Forest Watch analysis showed that Brazil lost a record amount of tree cover in 2016 and 2017, in part because of large fire outbreaks in the Amazon. These fires are typically started by farmers and ranchers to clear land, but a severe drought last year caused them to spread rapidly, particularly in the parched southeast. The satellites also picked up evidence of large-scale land-clearing that may be occurring in areas where enforcement is weak.Elsewhere in the world, the satellite data showed that the Democratic Republic of Congo last year saw more forest loss than any other country outside of Brazil \u2014\u00a0some 3.6 million acres, up 6 percent from the previous year \u2014 with small-scale logging, charcoal production and farming all likely playing key roles.The researchers did find a tentative bright spot in Indonesia, where a government crackdown on deforestation may be showing early signs of success.But such positive stories tend to be a relative rarity and experts say much more is needed to slow the pace of deforestation. To date, just 2 percent of international financing for activities to fight climate change goes toward forest conservation, said Frances Seymour, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put out a house fire with a teaspoon,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

We consequently pay more attention to them. We also think of negative reviews as windows into what could go wrong. Is this camera\u2019s memory card going to go kaput in the middle of my honeymoon? Are these socks scratchy? Dr. Simester pointed out that people may see negative reviews as more informative, and therefore more valuable, than positive ones because they highlight defects \u2014 even if they\u2019re not actually more accurate.Why?Reviews are subjective, and the tiny subset of people who leave them aren\u2019t average. Put simply, we should distrust online reviews \u201cbecause emotions are involved,\u201d Ms. Dragan said. Still, reviews can be helpful gauges when you\u2019re buying stuff \u2014 so long as you keep in mind all the caveats around them.Even people who don\u2019t initially have strong feelings often develop them in response to survey questions \u2014 something called the mere-measurement effect.\u201cWe are socially conditioned to give answers when someone/something asks us a question,\u201d Dr. Gretzel wrote in an email.

Amy Wechsler, a dermatologist in Manhattan, finds their properties soothing and anti-bacterial, to be sure, but is skeptical of the bigger claims. \u201cThese ingredients taste great, smell great and make excellent moisturizers, which leads to healthy skin,\u201d Dr. Wechsler said. \u201cOther than that, I don\u2019t think they do anything magical.\u201d For those who suffer bee allergies, she recommends consulting an allergist before use and then testing a small dose over three days.

Through midnight screenings and one notoriously bizarre billboard in Los Angeles, Tommy Wiseau\u2019s \u201cThe Room\u201d became a genuine cult phenomenon, a hilariously amateurish look into the tortured psyche of its writer-director-star. \u201cThe Disaster Artist\u201d is based on the superb memoir by Wiseau\u2019s co-star, Greg Sestero, and the author Tom Bissell, and is funniest when it\u2019s on set, scrupulously recreating the moments that would go down in bad-movie history. As Wiseau, director James Franco gets the jumbled, vaguely Eastern European syntax uncannily right, but he also hints at the deep vulnerability and misogyny that lingers under the surface.Through midnight screenings and one notoriously bizarre billboard in Los Angeles, Tommy Wiseau\u2019s \u201cThe Room\u201d became a genuine cult phenomenon, a hilariously amateurish look into the tortured psyche of its writer-director-star. \u201cThe Disaster Artist\u201d is based on the superb memoir by Wiseau\u2019s co-star, Greg Sestero, and the author Tom Bissell, and is funniest when it\u2019s on set, scrupulously recreating the moments that would go down in bad-movie history.

{"Headline": "Amazon Urged Not to Sell Facial Recognition Technology to Police", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome Amazon shareholders are calling for the e-commerce giant to stop selling its facial recognition technology to the police.A group of 19 socially responsible investors, including firms like Sustainvest Asset Management and the Social Equity Group, are applying pressure to Amazon over privacy concerns that they have about the technology.Such government surveillance infrastructure technology may not only pose a privacy threat to customers and other stakeholders across the country, but may also raise substantial risks for our company, negatively impacting our company\u2019s stock valuation and increasing financial risk for shareholders.In addition to our concerns for U.S. consumers who may be put in harm\u2019s way with law enforcement\u2019s use of Rekognition, we are also concerned sales may be expanded to foreign governments, including authoritarian regimes.Amazon had no immediate comment on the letter.We believe it is the wrong approach to impose a ban on promising new technologies because they might be used by bad actors for nefarious purposes in the future. The world would be a very different place if we had restricted people from buying computers because it was possible to use that computer to do harm. The same can be said of thousands of technologies upon which we all rely each day. Through responsible use, the benefits have far outweighed the risks.Tech companies recently have come under scrutiny for their work with the government.To be clear: Microsoft is not working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Customs and Border Protection on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border, and contrary to some speculation, we are not aware of Azure or Azure services being used for this purpose. As a company, Microsoft is dismayed by the forcible separation of children from their families at the border.It remains to be seen if Amazon might bow to investor pressure and stop selling its software, or whether Microsoft might cease working with ICE But the news certainly illustrates that relationships between technology companies and government entities have become a serious cause for concern among many critics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Idolatry of Glaciers, Rocks and Leni Riefenstahl", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVDA mountaineer turned amateur filmmaker who became a major figure in German silent cinema, Arnold Fanck (1889-1974) is remembered largely as the man who made the dancer and future Nazi documentarian, Leni Riefenstahl a star \u2014 typically, she would claim, at her suggestion.Dr. Fanck, as he was often billed (he had a doctorate in geology), maintained that he had only seen one movie in his life when he made his first film, \u201cThe Miracle of Skiing,\u201d in 1919. Over the next few years, he took the lead in developing a genre: the Bergfilm, or mountain film. These tales of reckless young mountaineers shot under arduous conditions in spectacular Alpine locations, resonated so powerfully with pre-World War II German audiences that they have been compared, as a specific cultural expression, to American westerns.For a long time, Riefenstahl, who died in 2003 at 101, was said to have had the only surviving nitrate print of Fanck\u2019s \u201cThe Holy Mountain: A Drama Poem With Scenes From Nature\u201d (1926), her screen-acting debut. Evidently not. Recently released in a tinted 2K restoration from Kino and available for streaming from Kanopy, it can take its place as a minor classic of the German silent cinema.The Bergfilm offered something new. The German film historian Siegfried Kracauer called Fanck\u2019s movies \u201cextraordinary in that they captured the most grandiose aspects of nature at a time when the German screen in general offered nothing but studio-made scenery.\u201d Still, Kracauer could not help but feel \u201cirritated at the mixture of sparking ice-axes and inflated sentiments,\u201d not to mention the genre\u2019s irrational \u201cidolatry of glaciers and rocks\u201d and glorification of stern, pure supermen. (The landscapes were not the Bergfilm\u2019s only documentary aspect; Fanck\u2019s actors were required to perform their own stunts \u2014 broken bones were not unusual.)\u201cThe sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related, that it is difficult to class them separately,\u201d Tom Paine wrote in \u201cThe Age of Reason.\u201d So it is with \u201cThe Holy Mountain,\u201d which stars Riefenstahl, just 24 when the movie was released after several years in production, as a madcap child of nature whose flirtatious ways and \u201cartistic\u201d dances drive a pair of young mountaineers (one, Luis Trenker, who would be a major German star) to take impossible chances while scaling the sheer cliff of the peak\u2019s \u201cdreadful north face.\u201dNo less beautiful in its cloud formations and vaporous snow storms than \u201cHoly Mountain,\u201d \u201cWhite Hell\u201d is a sort of romantic triangle in which Riefenstahl and two men attempt an insane ascent of the very mountain where the older man lost his young bride some years before. \u201cHoly Mountain\u201d has one character freeze to death dangling in midair; \u201cWhite Hell\u201d is even more intense in dramatizing a physical ordeal.Riefenstahl and her companions are stuck on a tiny ledge for three nights while skiers are trapped in an ice cave below. Meanwhile, a biplane flies over and around the mountain searching for signs of life. (The wartime aviator Ernst Udet\u2019s stunt flying may be the equal of the stunt climbing.) That the movie seems the summit of Fanck\u2019s art may be attributed to the producer\u2019s engaging the great G.W. Pabst to direct the dramatic scenes \u2014 most famously when a wide-eyed Riefenstahl, shown largely in close-up, helps one of her companions in tying down the other who has gone mad from the cold. In her memoir, Riefenstahl takes credit for recruiting both Pabst and Udet.In part because of its association with Riefenstahl as well as its glorification of individual will and natural superiority, the Bergfilm genre has been seen as proto-fascist cinema. The connection is not unfounded although in their day, Fanck\u2019s films were admired for their athletic displays and sensational photography by left wing as well as right wing critics \u2014 the Communist Party paper Red Flame characterized \u201cWhite Hell\u201d as \u201cundoubtedly one of the best German films ever.\u201dFanck, who managed to avoid joining the Nazi Party until 1940, shortly after the war broke out, exemplified a strain of German Romanticism \u2014 the nature worship found in the paintings of the 19th-century artist Caspar David Friedrich and certain films by Werner Herzog. Mr. Herzog once called himself a director of landscapes. The same could be equally said of Fanck although it could also be said that the German political landscape ultimately directed him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Move Over, China: U.S. Is Again Home to World\u2019s Speediest Supercomputer", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States just won bragging rights in the race to build the world\u2019s speediest supercomputer.For five years, China had the world\u2019s fastest computer, a symbolic achievement for a country trying to show that it is a tech powerhouse. But the United States retook the lead thanks to a machine, called Summit, built for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.Summit\u2019s speeds, announced on Friday, boggle the mind. It can do mathematical calculations at the rate of 200 quadrillion per second, or 200 petaflops. To put in human terms: A person doing one calculation a second would have to live for more than 6.3 billion years to match what the machine can do in a second.Still stupefying? Here is another analogy. If a stadium built for 100,000 people was full, and everyone in it had a modern laptop, it would take 20 stadiums to match the computing firepower of Summit.China still has the world\u2019s most supercomputers over all. And China, Japan and Europe are developing machines that are even faster, which could mean the American lead is short-lived.Supercomputers like Summit, which cost $200 million in government money to build, can accelerate the development of technologies at the frontier of computing, like artificial intelligence and the ability to handle vast amounts of data.Those skills can be used to help tackle daunting challenges in science, industry and national security \u2014 and are at the heart of an escalating rivalry between the United States and China over technology.Supercomputers now perform tasks that include simulating nuclear tests, predicting climate trends, finding oil deposits and cracking encryption codes. Scientists say that further gains and fresh discoveries in fields like medicine, new materials and energy technology will rely on the approach that Summit embodies.\u201cThese are big data and artificial intelligence machines,\u201d said John E. Kelly, who oversees IBM Research, which helped build Summit. \u201cThat\u2019s where the future lies.\u201dAt 200 petaflops, the new machine achieves more than twice the speed of the leading supercomputer in November, when the last Top 500 list was published. That machine is at China\u2019s National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi.Summit is made up of rows of black, refrigerator-size units that weigh a total of 340 tons and are housed in a 9,250 square-foot room. It is powered by 9,216 central processing chips from IBM and 27,648 graphics processors from Nvidia, another American tech company, that are lashed together with 185 miles of fiber-optic cable.Cooling Summit requires 4,000 gallons of water a minute, and the supercomputer consumes enough electricity to light up 8,100 American homes.The global supercomputer sprint comes as internet giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google in the United States and Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent in China take the lead in developing technologies like cloud computing and facial recognition.Supercomputers are a measure of a nation\u2019s technological prowess. It is a narrow measure, of course, because raw speed is only one ingredient in computing performance. Software, which bring the machines to life, is another.Scientists at the government labs like Oak Ridge are doing exploratory research in areas like new materials to make roads more robust, designs for energy storage that might apply to electric cars or energy grids, and potential power sources like harnessing fusion. All of those areas can benefit from supercomputing.Modeling the climate, for example, can require running code on a supercomputer for days, processing huge amounts of scientific data like moisture and wind patterns, and modeling all the real-world physics of the environment. It is not the sort of task that can run efficiently on the cloud computing services supplied by internet companies, said Ian Buck, a computer scientist and general manager of Nvidia\u2019s data center business.\u201cIndustry is great, and we work with them all the time,\u201d said Rick Stevens, an associate director of the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. \u201cBut Google is never going to design new materials or design a safe nuclear reactor.\u201dAt Oak Ridge, Thomas Zacharia, the lab director, cites a large health research project as an example of the future of supercomputing. Summit has begun ingesting and processing data generated by the Million Veteran Program, which enlists volunteers to give researchers access to all of their health records, contribute blood tests for genetic analysis, and answer survey questions about their lifestyles and habits. To date, 675,000 veterans have joined; the goal is to reach one million by 2021.The eventual insights, Mr. Zacharia said, could \u201chelp us find new ways to treat our veterans and contribute to the whole area of precision medicine.\u201dDr. J. Michael Gaziano, a principal investigator on the Million Veteran Program and a professor at the Harvard Medical School, said that the potential benefit might well be a modern, supercharged version of the Framingham Heart Study. That project, begun in 1948, tracked about 5,000 people in a Massachusetts town.Over a couple of decades, the Framingham study found that heart disease \u2014 far from previous single-cause explanations of disease \u2014 had multiple, contributing causes including blood cholesterol, diet, exercise and smoking.Today, given the flood of digital health data and supercomputers, Dr. Gaziano said that population science might be entering a new golden age.\u201cWe have all this big, messy data to create a new field \u2014 rethinking how we think about diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time.\u201dAlthough impressive, Summit can be seen as a placeholder. Supercomputers that are five times faster \u2014 1,000 petaflops, or an exaflop \u2014 are in the works, both abroad and in the United States. The Energy Department\u2019s budget for its advanced computing program is being increased by 39 percent in the two fiscal years ending September 2019, said Paul M. Dabbar, the Energy Department\u2019s under secretary for science.\u201cWe\u2019re doing this to help drive innovation in supercomputing and beyond,\u201d Mr. Dabbar said.An earlier version of this article, using calculations by Jack Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee who tracks supercomputer speeds, misstated how long it would take a person to do the calculations that the Summit supercomputer could do in one second. It would take 6.3 billion years, not 63 billion years. The error was repeated in the headline and in a mobile news alert. The article also misspelled the surname of the Energy Department\u2019s under secretary for science. He is Paul Dabbar, not Dabarr.Advertisement"}
