{"Headline": "Warring Leaders of South Sudan Meet for Peace Talks", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySouth Sudan\u2019s president, Salva Kiir, met on Wednesday night with his former vice president, Riek Machar, who leads the country\u2019s main opposition forces, in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.Yet as the day of talks proceeded on Thursday, the two sides were clear that there was no conclusion on a potential peace deal.A statement from Mr. Machar\u2019s opposition spokesman called the initial meeting \u201ccordial\u201d and said that \u201cthe two leaders discussed the prospects for peace in broad terms.\u201d But the statement said that \u201cfor any meaningful dialogue to take place, it should be within the context of a comprehensive political settlement, so that the guns can fall silent and a conducive environment for dialogue established.\u201dSouth Sudan\u2019s civil war has persisted for four and a half years. Fighting erupted in December 2013 between forces loyal to Mr. Kiir and his Dinka ethnic group and another faction loyal to Mr. Machar and the ethnic Nuer. The clashes quickly devolved into a full-fledged civil war that fractured the nation along ethnic lines just two years after it gained independence from Sudan.Now, South Sudan is in shambles. The conflict has displaced millions, demolished the economy of a nation that was already one of the poorest in the world and left many people without reliable access to food. Previous cease-fires have largely been ignored, and fighting has cut off parts of the country from emergency aid.Last month, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution giving South Sudan\u2019s warring sides a deadline of June 30 to reach a peace deal or face sanctions.Janardhan Rao, the South Sudan country director for the aid group Mercy Corps, said humanitarian organizations were hopeful that the meeting between the leaders would pave the way for peace. He said the threat of international sanctions combined with the resolve of the South Sudanese people to see the conflict end had given momentum to the talks.\u201cThe two leaders at the highest level have agreed to come together, and that is significant,\u201d Mr. Rao said. \u201cAnd what we are seeing, there is a groundswell, there is a level of frustration and desperation and there is a lot of push from civil society organizations. They said, \u2018Do not come back without peace.\u2019\u201dBut the work that humanitarian groups like his have done in South Sudan has been undone repeatedly because of the fighting.The South Sudan Civil Society Forum \u2014 a coalition of dozens of South Sudanese organizations \u2014 has been instrumental in galvanizing support for an end to the conflict.\u201cWe call on you to demonstrate leadership at this critical moment, rise to the occasion, reconcile and save our people and country from further destruction and shame,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIn so doing, you will save your legacy in the history of our country. We, the citizens, are watching!\u201dSouth Sudan has reached a breaking point, some aid groups say, as fighting has forced them out of part of the country. More than 100 aid workers, mostly South Sudanese, have been killed in the country since the conflict began.Elysia Buchanan, a policy adviser on South Sudan for the aid group Oxfam, said it had become increasingly difficult for aid to reach those in need, even as conditions became more dire.\u201cIt\u2019s clear to all on the ground that things are getting worse; needs have never been higher,\u201d Ms. Buchanan said. \u201cI think today there is a feeling of excitement and anticipation \u2014 and I hope it won\u2019t be squandered. I hope that today in Addis there is a sense that they are not only negotiating the cease-fire or power-sharing, but that they are also negotiating an end to the hunger and suffering of millions of South Sudanese.\u201dFor now, aid groups are focusing on the immediate needs of civilians, a mission that will face fewer obstacles if the fighting can be stopped.\u201cI think peace is a precursor,\u201d Mr. Rao said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of it all, it\u2019s just the starting point.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens if Mass Starvation Takes Hold in Yemen?", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. de Waal is a researcher on humanitarian and development issues,\u00a0and an\u00a0Africa specialist.Last-ditch diplomatic efforts could not stop the Saudi Arabian and Emirati coalition\u2019s offensive on the Yemeni port city of Al Hudaydah this week. With no real prospect for peace talks of any kind, the city, a fief of the Houthi rebels who control much of the country and a hub for humanitarian assistance for millions of desperate Yemeni civilians, could fall within days.If the offensive goes according to the Saudis\u2019 and Emiratis\u2019 plan, promptly after that, the Houthis, who also control the capital Sana, will sue for peace. The maritime blockade in place since 2015 could then be lifted. After that, a vast humanitarian operation could unfold, saving Yemen from a devastating famine.But nothing in this war has gone according plan so far, and the risks of mass starvation are greater than ever, even if Al Hudaydah falls fast.And yet the United Nations Security Council has not seized on the emergency, and in my conversations with diplomats in New York on Wednesday, that passivity was laced with cynicism: If the Yemenis could survive the hardships of the past few years of war, some were saying, they would be fine for a bit longer.Just over three years ago, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, responded to the Houthi rebels\u2019 sudden takeover of Sana by ordering an armed intervention to support the official government, which had retreated to the coastal city of Aden. The Houthis are an Islamist revivalist movement with a strong base in northern Yemen and ties to Iran.What will happen to all of them if Al Hudaydah falls?This posture is unlikely to change, of course. But once again, the United States \u2014 as well as other Western countries \u2014 faces a choice between being complicit in an unfolding calamity or stepping in to try to stop it. There would be trade-offs to putting pressure on the Saudis and the Emiratis, and no guarantee that it would work. But the ethical case for getting involved needs to be made.So does the strategic case.Famine isn\u2019t just about masses of people going hungry; famine tears societies apart. It means mass exodus caused by desperation. It means humiliation and collective trauma. Some people profit from the misery of others, hiking food prices or buying land at fire-sale prices. Those who pay the price \u2014 and their children and then those children\u2019s children \u2014 can only resent the opportunists for their plight. Not to mention the aggressors.As the British learned in Ireland in the mid-19th century, and the Soviets in Ukraine in the 1930s, starving people is a dangerous and loaded strategy: It leaves behind a bitter legacy, and a long trail of rancor.If mass starvation takes hold in Yemen, expect an even more deeply divided country. Expect radicalization. Expect an exodus across the Arabian Peninsula and up the Red Sea, toward the Mediterranean Sea and Europe. Expect to see the ugly and perilous repercussions of this harrowing experience for years to come.Alex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University.Advertisement"}

In 2016, some high-school exam questions were posted on social media before or at the start of the tests, marring the results. The government\u2019s failure to secure the exams was widely criticized and ridiculed, and it was forced to organize a new test for latecomers, who might have had illicit access to the questions.Exasperated, Algerian education officials asked internet service providers to block social networking websites like Facebook during last year\u2019s exams, but some of the questions still managed to find their way to other online platforms, reviving the uproar.In some corners, the move was met with derision and anger; people shared photos on social networks of frustrated travelers who were delayed at Algiers International Airport because of the shutdown.Saadia Gacem, a graduate student in sociology, called the internet blockage a \u201cradical measure\u201d that exposed the country\u2019s inability to deal with the problem. \u201cWe do not turn off internet in other countries to fight against the fraud at the baccalaureate,\u201d she said.As is the case in much of the world, the baccalaureate exams for students finishing high schools are very important in Algeria, largely determining their chances of continuing on to a university or landing a good job.

{"Headline": "As China Curbs Borrowing, Growth Shows Signs of Faltering", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s government has been trying to break the country\u2019s addiction to ever-rising debt, but its effort to crack down on easy money is starting to hit growth in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.Beijing has been concerned in recent years about the increased reliance on credit to keep the economy expanding briskly, worrying that it could lead to a financial crisis, or to a long period of stagnation like the one in Japan after the real estate market burst in the early 1990s.But curbing debt may have significant consequences in China and elsewhere. Countries around the world are much more closely tied to China than ever before, because of its role not just as the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer by far but also, increasingly, as a consumer. An economic slowdown in China \u2014 coupled with the knock-on effects of widening trade disputes and slowing growth in Europe \u2014 may augur poorly for a global economy that even recently seemed in rude health.Domestically, China\u2019s credit crackdown has affected smaller businesses hardest. Though the country often appears to be dominated by its vast conglomerates and hulking state-owned enterprises, its economy is, in reality, somewhat more reliant on small businesses than its Western counterparts. And the way Beijing has gone about curbing lending in recent months is unintentionally hitting the most entrepreneurial segments of the economy, the governor of China\u2019s central bank acknowledged in a speech on Thursday in Shanghai.Over all, there is growing evidence that a credit crunch is taking a toll on the Chinese economy.The National Bureau of Statistics released data in Beijing on Thursday showing that investment, retail sales and industrial production all slowed in May. The slowdowns in investment and retail sales were particularly sharp and unexpected.With that backdrop of eroding economic growth, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, conspicuously did not match on Thursday the Federal Reserve\u2019s increase to interest rates on Wednesday. It had at least partly matched previous Federal Reserve interest rate rises since the autumn.An index of 300 large-company stocks traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen dropped 0.4 percent on Thursday, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.9 percent on the poor economic news from the mainland.With the Chinese economy showing signs of slowing and the authorities making it harder to borrow, small businesses are particularly vulnerable. They represent about three-fifths of economic output in China, compared with around half in Germany, Japan and the United States, according to Yi Gang, the governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China.The downgrades were among many reasons the government has tightened some curbs on borrowing since the end of the autumn. Beijing has particularly clamped down on lending by online finance companies and other private sector businesses that bypass the state-controlled banking system.While commercial banks have continued to lend the money they hold from deposits, these conventional loans go mainly to state-owned enterprises. Private lenders, meanwhile, charge interest rates that are double or triple the 6 percent charged by banks, but they are often the only source of financing for small businesses.Despite the higher interest rates, \u201cwe should also fully affirm the significance of private loans, which are an important supplement\u201d to bank lending in the Chinese economy, said Mr. Yi, speaking at the Lujiazui Forum, a gathering in Shanghai of China\u2019s top financial regulators. The forum, held at the start of each summer, is one of the Chinese government\u2019s main channels for signaling the direction of Chinese monetary and financial policy.Even before deciding on Thursday morning not to match the Fed\u2019s rate increase, though, the Chinese government had already made a pair of moves that appear to have been elaborately crafted to channel more money to smaller, more entrepreneurial businesses.Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a Shanghai-based research group, said on the sidelines of the Lujiazui Forum that China\u2019s private-sector companies of all sizes, even large ones, had long faced challenges in obtaining loans. But the credit squeeze on them this spring has been particularly painful.\u201cIt\u2019s very bad, and we see not just small and medium-sized enterprises defaulting but even big companies defaulting,\u201d he said.Some financial regulators nevertheless appear determined to maintain the crackdown on informal lending.Speaking at the forum, Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, called for further rigor. He warned the audience against putting money into the dwindling number of online finance companies that still offered high returns on investment. While some informal lending operations provide valuable credit to small businesses, others have proved to be fraudulent.\u201cYou need to report them so we can find all these Ponzi-type schemes,\u201d Mr. Guo said.China\u2019s financial policymakers have made clear that they do not mind seeing a few defaults and some strains in the system. Retail auto sales slackened last month, and unsold cars have started accumulating at dealerships. A decision by the authorities to allow at least a dozen bond defaults in recent weeks, after years of preventing them, has rattled some investors.The Chinese economy is not crashing. By international standards, the pace of bond defaults is still negligible. While car sales have leveled off, they have done so at a very high level after two decades of strong growth, causing chronic traffic jams. Real estate demand is still buoyant, and so is the construction industry.But faced with a high level of debt across the economy, \u201cwhat regulators need to be careful is not to respond in such a heavy-handed way that it could essentially compound the risks,\u201d said Fred Hu, an influential Chinese economist who is now a hedge fund chairman in Hong Kong.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Milestones in Jobs Report Signal a Bustling Economy", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy roared into overdrive last month, the Labor Department reported Friday, extending the longest streak of job growth on record and echoing other recent signs of strength.The unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent, its lowest level since the heady days of the dot-com boom in early 2000.The net increase of 223,000 jobs reflected healthy gains in a broad range of industries, from manufacturing and transportation to health care and retailing.It was the 92nd consecutive month of job creation. Most economists expect the momentum to continue, but a deeper drop in the unemployment rate or a big bump up in average hourly earnings would stoke fears of inflation and, in turn, a more hawkish Federal Reserve.Fed policymakers are almost certain to raise interest rates when they meet this month, with at least one additional increase likely in the second half of 2018.In May, average hourly earnings rose slightly, lifting the year-on-year gain to 2.7 percent. That\u2019s healthy enough to assuage fears that wages are stagnating but not so strong as to change the Fed\u2019s expected course.\u201cIt was a stronger report than expected, but it wasn\u2019t so hot as to lead the Fed to believe it\u2019s behind the curve,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, adding that the Fed\u2019s plans shouldn\u2019t worry stock-market bulls. \u201cIt will keep the Fed on its gradual normalization path.\u201dIndeed, the stock market rallied in the wake of the news. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished the day up more than 1 percent. Bond prices dipped slightly as traders braced for the possibility of faster economic growth, lifting the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds to 2.9 percent.Mr. Gapen believes the unemployment rate could sink as low as 3 percent by the end of 2019. That would bring it to levels last seen in 1953, the height of the economic boom after World War II.The only negative in the report was a slight drop in the share of Americans who are either working or looking for a job, paced by a 170,000 increase in the number of people not in the labor force. That, in turn, put downward pressure on the unemployment rate, which sank from 3.9 percent in April.Still, the overall report painted a picture of a robust labor market by any measure. Unemployment among African-Americans fell to 5.9 percent from 6.6 percent in April, the lowest since the Labor Department began breaking out unemployment by race in 1972. Among college graduates, the unemployment rate is 2 percent, while it stands at 3.9 percent for workers with a high school diploma.\u201cIt was certainly a good number, with some weather-related bounce-back in construction,\u201d said Diane Swonk, an economist with Grant Thornton.Ms. Swonk said the great conundrum in the current economic environment was why wage growth had been so modest. After all, a tighter labor market should prompt employers to raise salaries to keep the workers they have and lure new ones, right?In theory, yes, but in practice it hasn\u2019t been working out that way \u2014 and everything from slow productivity growth to the decline of unions and digital disruption has been cited as a reason.\u201cThis is the last shoe to drop in the labor market,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before wages start going up more strongly, but there\u2019s frustration that it hasn\u2019t happened yet, even though unemployment is the lowest it has been in almost 18 years.\u201dBesides the other potential causes, Mr. Slok has one of his own: While job switchers are being rewarded with raises, people who stay where they are not. Nearly 15 percent of what he calls \u201cjob stayers\u201d saw no increase in wages in the past 12 months. At comparable periods in past economic cycles, that share was more like 10 percent.\u201cIf you just stay around, you have less bargaining power,\u201d Mr. Slok said.Sectors like construction, energy, transportation and hospitals have been especially tight, Ms. Swonk said, with some employers offering signing bonuses to lure workers. For evidence of the trend, she is watching teenage unemployment, which was 12.8 percent last month. In April, it stood at 12.9 percent, down from 14.7 percent in April 2017.The teenage unemployment rate is significant because this cohort is a prime beneficiary of tight labor markets, Ms. Swonk explained. When there was more slack in the system, teenagers had to compete with 50-somethings for scarce jobs. Now, as the latter group finds higher-paying positions, young workers are filling the gap.In some regions, workers have grown particularly scarce, forcing companies to pony up to compete for new hires. Union Pacific, the railroad giant, has long struggled to find mechanics, electricians and other skilled trade workers. But now it is having trouble filling even unskilled positions in some areas.In Council Bluffs, Iowa, where the unemployment rate is under 3 percent, Union Pacific has started offering $20,000 in hiring incentives for train crews \u2014 a job requiring no experience or education beyond a high school diploma. In some cases, the company isn\u2019t even waiting for students to graduate to start the recruiting process.\u201cWe have communities where we work where the unemployment rate is a percent and a half,\u201d said Lance Fritz, Union Pacific\u2019s chairman and chief executive. \u201cFinding people to do work there is mostly about getting them in high school and making them aware of the career path so that when they graduate and are in the work force, we get them.\u201dAs it turned out, a shortage of workers in one of the industries recently cited in the Fed\u2019s Beige Book economic survey \u2014 trucking \u2014 came to Mr. Bogan\u2019s rescue. The day the mill shut, he signed up for a course at Fox Valley Technical College to get a license to drive trucks. And the day after he graduated, he landed a job at a local trucking company.\u201cI didn\u2019t wait around,\u201d Mr. Bogan said. \u201cI graduated on a Thursday night and went to the trucking company office on Friday morning.\u201dTrucking accounted for nearly 7,000 of the jobs gained nationwide last month. And the demand for workers that Mr. Bogan encountered is part of the larger economic picture in Wisconsin, which has one of the nation\u2019s lowest unemployment rates. The jobless rate there stands at 2.8 percent, down from 3.3 percent a year ago.In fact, after the mill resumed production and Mr. Bogan got a call asking if he\u2019d like to come back, he politely declined. Under a Teamsters union contract, Mr. Bogan\u2019s employer covers all of the cost of his health insurance, so he\u2019s essentially earning the same take-home pay as before.\u201cThings are going pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cI love it. Instead of just watching that machine turning, I\u2019m outside, and it\u2019s different every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bush, a former United States ambassador to China, called cannons of rhetoric \u2014 offer a more direct, and inflammatory, guide to the thinking of the Beijing government.Below is a sampling of the responses.\u2022 \u201cFrom the time of its first trade provocations until now, capricious behavior has become the norm from America. It not only wears away and squanders the country\u2019s reputation, but it also allows China to see more clearly the face of the Trump administration, one that is rude, unreasonable, selfish and headstrong.\u201d\u2022 \u201cAs a leading developed nation, the United States should be an upholder of the multilateral trade system, allowing everyone to benefit from economic development and globalization. However, \u2018America first\u2019 is becoming America on its own. The Trump administration obstinately persists in playing the inglorious role of global economic agitator. Recently, America is brandishing the trade war big stick, smacking other countries at will. Former allies like the European Union, Canada, Mexico have become sacrifices to trade protectionism. This exposes the Trump administration\u2019s outmoded views on globalization and trade liberalization. In the eyes of America, the rules of international trade are like a gorgeous coat. When needed, they wear it, when not required, they cast it off and run naked.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe wise build bridges and the foolish build walls.

Promoting unilateralism and trade protectionism has become a leading move for its \u2018America first\u2019 strategy. Under this situation, it\u2019s inevitable that China and the United States have frictions in the economic and trade realm, and it will be the new normal for the two countries to move back and forth between negotiation and conflict in an ever-changing way.

{"Headline": "Senate Votes to Reinstate Penalties on ZTE, Setting Up Clash With White House", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted on Monday to reinstate tough penalties on ZTE, a Chinese telecom company accused of violating American sanctions, in a sharp rebuke of the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the matter that almost ensures a rare showdown between Republican lawmakers and the White House.Mr. Trump instructed the Commerce Department last month to look into easing penalties that barred ZTE from buying American products for seven years after President Xi Jinping of China personally asked him to save the company.The Senate vote was an unusual act of independence for a Republican-controlled Congress that has shown little interest in publicly crossing the Trump administration, even on issues where it disagrees with the president.But the vote is merely one step in what is expected to be a contentious process. The White House has already objected to the Senate provision and vowed to try to strike it before the bill becomes law.Republican lawmakers were scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday to discuss a path forward, according to Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican.\u201cObviously there\u2019s conflict between what the amendment provides, which is an outright ban, and that deal, so something will have to work out in the conference committee,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. He said he had \u201cno earthly idea\u201d how the two sides might reconcile.The House has already passed its own version of the defense bill, which does not include the ZTE penalty language, and the two chambers must now spend weeks hammering out that and other differences in the two bills before final passage \u2014 a window the administration believes it can exploit to undo the Senate\u2019s action.The provision was supported by large numbers of both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, who view ZTE as a national security threat. It also prohibits the federal government from purchasing or leasing equipment from ZTE or another Chinese company that they believe to be a national security threat, Huawei, or from subsidizing the companies in any way.The defense bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, would authorize just over $700 billion in military spending for the coming fiscal year and is intended to provide a framework for the Trump administration\u2019s continued buildup of the armed forces. The legislation outlines a range of stipulations, including strategic priorities for the military, pay increases for service members and investments in emerging technologies that policymakers believe could reshape the way the United States and other nations conduct warfare.A far-reaching measure that is considered must-pass legislation, the annual defense bill is frequently a magnet for lawmakers trying to attach policy provisions only tangentially related to national security. In the Senate, this year\u2019s bill provided a venue for Republican senators increasingly distraught with Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policies to try to force his hand. Mostly, they failed.Another Republican-proposed amendment that would have given Congress greater oversight of the agency that reviews proposed acquisitions of American companies by foreign firms \u2014 known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius \u2014 failed in a floor vote Thursday. That amendment was opposed by the Trump administration, which said it could hamper the role of Cfius and put national security at risk.But lawmakers did include a separate, bipartisan amendment that would give Cfius more power by expanding its reviews from focusing strictly on mergers and acquisitions to include joint ventures. Lawmakers have said the provision is aimed at Chinese companies that had been bypassing the Cfius review by forming joint ventures with American companies or licensing their technology.The bill, for example, labels China and Russia \u201crevisionist powers and strategic competitors that seek to shape the world toward their authoritarian model through destabilizing activities that threaten the security of the United States and its allies.\u201dThe bill bears the fingerprints of Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, even though Mr. McCain has been absent from Washington for months as he battles brain cancer. Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, pushed the bill through the chamber and fought back several last-minute attempts to amend the legislation.The bill would make major investments in research and development to compete with Russian and Chinese weapons developments. Specifically, it would send more than $600 million above the administration\u2019s budget request for programs in hypersonics, quantum computing, directed energy and other technologies.It also sets policy for a dizzying array of programs and personnel matters, large and small, including a 2.6 percent pay raise for service members. It also outlines purchasing decisions on fighter jets, submarines, combat ships and other craft, and for the first time in decades, it outlines changes in the officer promotion program.And at a time of deepening humanitarian crisis in Yemen, it also takes steps to potentially curtail the United States\u2019 involvement in aiding an Arab military coalition fighting in the long-running civil war there.The House passed its version of the bill, known as the N.D.A.A., late last month, without any of the trade provisions considered by the Senate. Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters last week that he hopes to quickly reconcile differences in the two bills and finish the process before the House leaves for its August recess. He indicated that he would fight letting any provision, including the Senate\u2019s ZTE language, derail that process.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "There Is No Immigration Crisis in El Paso", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs.\u00a0Escobar is the Democratic nominee for the 16th Congressional District in Texas.EL PASO \u2014 To hear it from the White House, America\u2019s southern border is a war zone. Things look a lot different up close. Here in El Paso, local governments collaborate closely with federal agencies in the United States and Mexico to ensure that our ports of entry \u2014 bridges connecting the two countries \u2014 can effectively and safely move more than 10 million people and $90 billion in trade back and forth each year.Our ports are critical to our local, state and national economies, and they stand as proof that international cooperation can make the border work for both countries. Never did any of us imagine that the area around one of them, the Marcelino Serna Port at Tornillo, would someday be the site of the United States\u2019s first tent city for detained immigrant children, or that it would bring us together to protest the separation of refugee families.Maybe we should have seen it coming. Fearmongering about immigrants has long hinged on the notion that the border is a porous, lawless place \u2014 even though it is as safe and secure as ever.But even as El Pasoans and our southern neighbors have built up a vibrant economy, politicians from Washington and other places far from the border have made our region the centerpiece of their efforts to restrict immigration.This idea first surfaced in El Paso in 1993, when the head of the local Border Patrol office proposed building a border wall, inspiring protests and heated local debates. El Pasoans defeated the idea soon after it was introduced, but after that, national conversations about immigration reform became increasingly linked with tightly restricted border flows, making it nearly impossible for humane immigration reform to make it through Congress.Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama attempted to deal with the challenge, but in order to avoid looking soft on undocumented immigration, they gave in to demands to be \u201ctough\u201d on the border. President Obama angered immigrant rights advocates with aggressive deportation tactics, meant, in part, to appease Republicans and get them to the bargaining table. And yet even now, with Republicans in charge of the federal government, conservatives still refuse the slightest gesture at compromise.That doesn\u2019t mean nothing has happened. Here in El Paso, we\u2019ve had a front-row seat to watch the militarization of the border: There is a wall, drones fly overhead and state troopers and National Guard members have been sent to our community. And, of course, images of these tactics, seen on screens around the country, further fuel misperceptions and xenophobia.And it hasn\u2019t just been the work of federal legislators. Texas has spent over $1 billion in the last two legislative sessions on border security, with no measurable benefit. These huge expenditures have yet to appease anti-immigrant voters.This preoccupation with looking \u201ctough\u201d comes at the expense of other, more pressing needs. In El Paso, we need more Customs and Border Protection agents to staff the ports of entry; we also lack the infrastructure to effectively process increases in refugees. And, mind you, this is occurring while immigration is still at historic lows.El Pasoans understand the realities of immigration and know that especially now, the people surging north need to be met with compassion, not fear and hatred.In recent weeks we\u2019ve seen asylum seekers, following instructions from the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, to present themselves at ports of entry, be physically prevented by federal agents from touching American soil. In El Paso, the longtime immigrant rights activist Ruben Garcia has had to escort families over the bridge and face off against agents, some of then carrying firearms. One agent claimed that blocking asylum seekers was a policy directive from higher-ups. And it turns out that El Paso was the training ground for family separations: We\u2019ve only recently learned that families have been separated at our border since at least October.Our experience along the border also gives us special insight into where things might go next. Many people around the country are beginning to suggest that the Democrats should just let President Trump have his wall, in exchange for an end to his draconian border enforcement policies. But El Pasoans know that walls are not the end, but the beginning.That\u2019s because walls might impede migration, but they won\u2019t stop it. And when people keep coming, Mr. Trump and his allies will simply ratchet up their demands \u2014 he has already called for an end to due process for noncitizens. What comes next?Meanwhile, the demonization of undocumented immigrants will soon carry over to the restrictionists\u2019 real target: Mr. Trump has already proposed strict limits on family-based immigration and an end to the diversity lottery program.How do we get from this manufactured \u201cborder crisis,\u201d which is creating real pain for tens of thousands of people, to the dynamic but increasingly fragile reality of life along the border that we cherish here in El Paso? How do we get to a solution for Dreamers, investment in our ports of entry and a humane approach to immigration reform?It\u2019s a long list, and it\u2019s easy to despair. Washington, at least as it stands now, will not find the solution on its own. It will take continued public pressure, both along the border and in every city and state around the country. We might differ on the details of what our immigration policy should look like, but a vast majority of Americans agree that the present situation is morally and practically untenable.It took decades of border and immigrant bashing to get here. But we\u2019re here, and it\u2019s up to us to restore justice and compassion in our country.Veronica Escobar is the Democratic nominee for the 16th Congressional District in Texas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Runners-Up From Our Fifth Annual Student Editorial Contest", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContestsWe\u2019re very pleased to publish these student editorials, which address a diverse range of subjects from physician-assisted suicide, the proposed border wall and prostitution to teenage vaping and children\u2019s literature.________In five months, I will be heading off to college and living without my parents\u2019 care for the first time in seventeen years, and I have never felt so unprepared. Academically, I have no woes. It is the thought of living on my own, in the grown-up world, that troubles me. Society has become so focused on academics, test scores and GPA, that no school wants to spend time teaching kids about buying a house, or paying off loans. Because of this, I am going off to college with little to no knowledge about everyday skills.Professor David Perkins has looked at the issue of what is and is not taught in schools, and tells educators to ask themselves, \u201cWhat\u2019s worth learning in school?\u201d At a seminar that Perkins spoke at, he asked audience members to raise their hand if they had learned in school what mitosis, the process of cell division, was. Nearly every person raised their hand. When Perkins asked how many of them had used their knowledge of mitosis in the last ten years, only one hand went up.I am not arguing that public schools should up and abandon math or science or any subject, but if biology is a required course, why shouldn\u2019t accounting be too? Or home economics? Public schools are built around a curriculum that spends so much time teaching information that will likely never be used again. Instead, teaching important life skills needs to be integrated into the curriculum of public schools. Some courses, like accounting and home ec, are offered as elective classes, but very few kids take them because it won\u2019t make their college application look better or boost their GPA as much as taking the AP Statistics elective. Public schools are doing the bare minimum to make these useful classes available to students and in turn are sending kids off unprepared for their future lives outside of the academic world. There needs to be a bigger push toward making classes about life skills a requirement in public schools, so that people are not going into the workforce, wondering how to do their tax returns.Works CitedHough, Lory. \u201cWhat\u2019s Worth Learning in School?\u201d Harvard Graduate School of Education, 8 Jan. 2015.Ojalvo, Holly Epstein. \u201cWhat Are You Really Learning at School?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 7 Sept. 2011._________In the timeless words of Abraham Lincoln, \u201cAnd in the end, it is not the years in your life that count. It\u2019s the life in your years.\u201d The debate over whether the quality or quantity of life is more important has shaken up the grounds of ethics. Recently, physician-assisted suicide has become legalized in Oregon, Washington, Washington, D.C., Vermont, Montana, Colorado and California. Yet New York, just this past year, banned this end-of-life route.The Death with Dignity Act, passed in selected states, allows strictly qualified terminally ill patients to receive lethal medication from their doctors to end their lives. It is one end-of-life option among others including: palliative sedation, voluntary stopping of eating and drinking, and stopping treatment. All of these alleviate pain and hasten death, however, they are not always effective depending on the diagnoses. Brittany Maynard, who had terminal brain cancer, wrote an article explaining her choice of physician-assisted suicide: \u201cI considered passing away in hospice care \u2026 but even with palliative sedation, I could develop potentially morphine-resistant pain and suffer personality changes and verbal, cognitive and motor loss.\u201d Fundamentally, both physician-assisted suicide and other end-of-life options result in the same outcome. However, physician-assisted suicide is more immediate and less painful while the others, though legal, can result in intolerable, prolonged anguish. Some patients want to have the responsibility of choosing their own way of ending the suffering in the comfort of their own homes, surrounded by their loved ones. For this reason, physician-assisted suicide ought to be legal.By disallowing terminally ill patients from choosing the right to die with dignity, there is an infringement on the right to live a quality life, right to freedom, and right to autonomy. Physicians against assisted suicide claim that since the Hippocratic oath implies a doctor\u2019s responsibility is to heal, assisting patients to hasten their deaths is a violation of medical ethics. John Grohol, a psychologist, wrote a New York Times article stating, \u201cWhen doctors equate healing with quantity of life, they ignore the quality of life. If suffering is intolerable, it is inhumane not to end it.\u201d Therefore, if it is against the patient\u2019s will to continue suffering, disallowing the patient to die peacefully and painlessly is disregarding the patient\u2019s well being and, in fact, rejecting the oath.The Death with Dignity Act entitles a patient to make a decision about his own life and, for once, not allow the disease to dictate the body\u2019s fate. With strict regulations, such as psychiatric evaluations ensuring the patient\u2019s choice is individual and competent, New York should be the next state to adopt such end-of-life care and give people the option to live fully and freely.Works CitedGrohol, John M. \u201cDenying Someone a Peaceful Death Can Be Unethical\u201d The New York Times. 7 Oct. 2014.Maynard, Brittany. \u201cMy Right to Death With Dignity at 29.\u201d CNN, Cable News Network, 3 Nov. 2014._________In China, the competition is great and the opportunities are few. Children are faced with the burden of success the minute they are born. Before they are born, mothers are faced with the pressure of bearing the most well-advantaged offspring. In recent years, there has been an exponential rise in the number of couples who are opting to screen embryos during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Because of the financial burden, lack of facilities for, and social stigma of raising a handicapped child, Chinese parents are more willing to prioritize you sheng (which translates to \u201chealthy birth\u201d) over the protection of an embryo.One of the screening processes, known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), is currently used to detect embryos with single gene mutations that could cause diseases and disabilities like Tay Sachs disease or cystic fibrosis. Chinese law prohibits selection of embryos based on anything else (for instance, selecting for male embryos is illegal). However, a whole new array of problems will develop as we achieve a greater understanding of what genes influence intelligence.The trailblazer in this field is the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), which launched a project in 2012 to analyze the DNA of 2,000 of the world\u2019s smartest people. There are thousands of variants that influence mental abilities, but BGI aims to decipher the substantial genetic component of intelligence in the near future. While the study is purely academic, insight into the labyrinthine genetics of genius will define the future of genetic screenings; Pandora\u2019s box will be opened with no possibility for return.Fertility clinics may go from advertising for \u201ccancer-free babies\u201d to promising \u201cprodigy babies\u201d. The starting line for the rat race to the middle class will shift from family standing to predestined genetic design. PGD won\u2019t necessarily result in China mass-engineering super-citizens, but it will easily be misinterpreted by and desensitize result-driven consumers. \u201cSelecting for the smartest embryos\u201d overemphasizes the hereditary facet of intelligence and glosses over the influence of nurture. Clinics cannot guarantee smarter babies, but eager couples will still flock to them nonetheless. In addition, even with PGD for simpler single gene mutations there is the risk of false positives. Now, couples might unknowingly dispose of perfectly healthy embryos in pursuit of a prodigy.It is imperative that the Chinese government take proactive measures to oversee future PGD implementation. In addition to a moratorium so officials, scientists and consumers can deliberate, genetic counselors who are well-versed in bioethics need to lead a nationwide discussion on how far we are willing to let competition define us, literally. The human genome is indisputably the new frontier of exploration. However, unrestrained scientific ambition will move China forward before it is ready.Works CitedCyranoski, David. \u201cChina\u2019s Embrace of Embryo Selection Raises Thorny Questions.\u201d Scientific American, Nature America, Inc, 16 Aug. 2017.Eror, Aleks. \u201cChina Is Engineering Genius Babies.\u201d Vice, Vice Media, 15 March 2013.Kolata, Gina. \u201cBuilding a Better Human With Science?

Though Mr. Clinton was referring to her qualifications and unusually significant political role \u2014 she remains the only first lady ever to maintain an office in the West Wing \u2014 presidential couples always present voters \u201ctwo for the price of one.\u201d Presidents\u2019 spouses fulfill a variety of official responsibilities: They manage paid staffers, promote nonpartisan causes and entertain White House visitors. Crucially, the first lady is unpaid, and, as former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson once quipped, \u201celected by one person \u2014 her husband.\u201dAs every new election raises the prospect of a man in the office of first lady, this amorphous role has become awkward and archaic: The presidential spouse should be absolved of public obligations altogether. The position of first lady evolved within the context of a society that could not imagine a woman in power or a president\u2019s wife with a high-powered career, relegating her to the domestic sphere. It devalued traditionally feminine tasks such as event planning, deeming them unworthy of monetary compensation.Feminist advances have allowed successive presidential spouses to expand their public profiles, becoming vocal advocates for women\u2019s and children\u2019s issues. Thus, some have argued, as Professor Jean H. Baker proposed in The New York Times, that the office should \u201cbe defined as a paid public position, with salary and expectations.\u201dHowever, this change would only affirm the expectation that women subsume their identities into those of their powerful husbands. If the role of the presidential spouse is a \u201cfull-time job,\u201d as Baker claims, he or she would likely be compelled to relinquish their existing occupation, just as Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton gave up prestigious positions. Yet, a life of visiting elementary schools or choosing flower arrangements for the next White House dinner may not appeal to every spouse. Furthermore, since the first lady is eligible for office by virtue of being married to the president, greater politicization inevitably bumps up against charges of nepotism.A far simpler solution would be to abolish the office and treat the presidential spouse as a normal private citizen. After all, the position is dispensable. German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s husband, a theoretical physicist, has eschewed the public eye so unwaveringly that a German newspaper once labeled him \u201cas invisible as a molecule,\u201d a practice that has not impeded the smooth functioning of the German state.The United States can and should follow suit. We can only free ourselves of the sexist assumptions and stereotypes that currently underlie the role of first lady if we free presidential spouses from public servitude.Works CitedBaker, Jean H. \u201cGive First Ladies a Salary and Expectations.\u201d The New York Times. 9 March 2016.Cornwell, Rupert. \u201cBill and Hillary\u2019s Double Trouble: Clinton\u2019s Two for the Price of One\u2019 Pledge Is Returning to Haunt Him, Says Rupert Cornwell.\u201d Independent. 9 March 1994.Finkelstein, Sarina. \u201cWant to Fix Wage Inequality?

In this day and age, the extensive use of fuel-burning vehicles is becoming a larger issue as global warming develops into a growing threat \u2014 especially in the United States. While replacing all gasoline cars with electric vehicles (EVs) would be impractical, widespread change is necessary. A good place for us to begin is with some of our nation\u2019s most admired and respected individuals: police officers.According to the most recent law enforcement census, 17,985 police departments across the United States deploy thousands of police vehicles, becoming one of the country\u2019s largest contributors to greenhouse gases. Living in a city where EVs and hybrids are becoming increasingly common, the dozens of diesel police cars around me begin to feel archaic. Within the next decade, several departments can reasonably aim to replace a majority of their police fleets, or at least nonemergency fleets, with fuel efficient vehicles.In fact, plans for this system have already garnered support and are underway in New York City, one of the nation\u2019s greatest greenhouse gas emitters. For instance, recent city plans call for replacing just under a fifth of its 11,000 car fleet; this is estimated to reduce city government emissions by 50 percent, according to the New York Times article \u201cNew York City Aims for Vast Electric Car Fleet by 2025.\u201dAlbeit costly, replacing only 2,000 cars will pay for itself through fuel savings, while dramatically improving the environment of one of the world\u2019s busiest cities. Furthermore, police officers serve as an example to the public, which is why their use of green vehicles could cause a larger change to ripple across America.The variety and practicality of electric vehicles have grown tremendously in the past half decade, showing no signs of stopping. Some argue against this plan\u2019s practicality due to the failure of the most significant previous attempt in the LAPD, in which a 100 car fleet of EVs had seldom been used since its introduction in 2016. However, cars in this fleet were among first-generation mass market EVs and faced significant limitations.Most modern models have evolved past those limitations with greater durability, safety, speed, affordability and other factors that strengthen the practicality of the car. Some gasoline vehicles may remain for specialized missions, but their necessity is limited.The more Americans neglect the benefits of today\u2019s fuel efficient vehicles, the more dire our climate situation becomes. A solution is widely available, and a step forward taken by our nation\u2019s officials can push us toward a future of clean energy. With this advance, police officers can save more than just lives.Works CitedCity of New York Inventory of New York City\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Emissions, April 2017, by Cventure LLC, Cathy Pasion, Christianah Oyenuga, and Kate Gouin, Mayor\u2019s Office of Sustainability, New York, 2017.Grynbaum, Michael M. \u201cNew York City Aims for Vast Electric Car Fleet by 2025.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 1 Dec. 2015.King, Alanis. \u201cThat Fleet Of Electric Cars The LAPD Paid At Least $2.9 Million For?

Reynolds Tobacco hid and denied the health risks of smoking in pursuit of greater profits.The courts have forced the companies to release \u201ccorrective statements\u201d in newspapers and on major news channels. Although these statements are a step in the right direction, their sparse design does not catch people\u2019s attention and, therefore, does not effectively spread their information to the public.Tobacco advertisements in the 1900s were flashy and colorful; they featured pictures of grinning doctors endorsing the health benefits of cigarettes and attractive people smoking happily. These advertisements grabbed the reader\u2019s attention, but the corrective statements do just the opposite.The print and televised statements consist of plain black text in bullet points on a white background, with a monotonous, slow voice-over that is reminiscent of a digital assistant added to the televised ones. They appear designed to be unattractive and slip under the radar of viewers and readers.This is not how to get a message across.An antismoking campaign by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention entitled \u201cTips\u201d ran in 2012 and featured former smokers telling their stories with graphic images of their injuries.According to NBC News, this campaign led 1.6 million people to attempt to quit smoking, and 78 percent of surveyed smokers and 74 percent of surveyed nonsmokers recalled seeing at least one Tips advertisement. The CDC\u2019s advertisements made an impact because they caught people\u2019s attention; these corrective statements do not do that, so how will people see them?These statements reveal important information about smoking\u2019s adverse effects and the companies\u2019 deceitful actions. It is imperative that smokers and those considering smoking are fully aware of the negative consequences of their actions. In Texas, women seeking abortions must receive information about the procedure\u2019s risks and alternative options 24 hours beforehand. Don\u2019t smokers, whose choice to smoke exposes them and every person around them to numerous fatal diseases, deserve the same educational material?And how will they receive that information when it is practically invisible?When Kessler ordered these companies to release corrective statements, her intent was that the American public see and hear those statements. In their current form, these advertisements do not satisfy that condition.The courts cannot allow these ineffective statements to continue; the companies must release new advertisements that actually attract the eye to fulfill their obligation. We do not allow our children to avoid apologizing for misconduct; let us apply this same rule in this case. Altria, Lorillard, Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, say it like you mean it.Works CitedFox, Maggie. \u201cGraphic Anti-Smoking Ads Helped 100,000 Kick the Habit for Good, CDC Says.\u201d NBCNews.com, NBCUniversal News Group, 9 Sept. 2013.Maheshwari, Sapna. \u201cWhy Tobacco Companies Are Paying to Tell You Smoking Kills.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 24 Nov. 2017._________\u201cThe King and I\u201d\u201cMiss Saigon\u201d\u201cAllegiance\u201dAt face value, these recent Broadway musicals are evidence of an increasingly diverse Broadway: one that allows Asian-American artists to thrive alongside those of every color and identity. In fact, the 2015-16 Broadway season was praised for bringing diversity \u201cfront and center\u201d with shows emphasizing heritage, like \u201cOn Your Feet!\u201d and \u201cAllegiance.\u201d However, as diverse audience members search for representation on the Broadway stage, we must reevaluate: Do these shows offer Asian-American artists the same opportunities as those of other ethnicities? The Asian American Performers Action Coalition\u2019s report \u201cEthnic Representation on New York Stages\u201d confirms the trend of growing diversity: Between the 2006-07 and 2015-16 New York theater seasons, minority actors\u2019 representation increased from 15 percent to 35 percent while Asian-American actors\u2019 representation rose to only 9 percent.High Asian-American representation accompanies musicals such as \u201cThe King & I\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d \u2014 among the only shows to employ large Asian-American ensembles. According to the same report, the 2015 revival of \u201cThe King & I\u201d hired \u201calmost half of all Asian actors employed that season.\u201d Japanese-Canadian director Stafford Arima confirms their impact: \u201cYou would look at the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and just see 12 productions of the \u2018King and I\u2019 and nine productions of \u2018Miss Saigon\u2019.\u201dThese classic musicals, however, carry the remnants of a less racially-aware time. \u201cThe King & I\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d include large Asian ensembles, but consistently cast Asian-American actors as background to white story lines. Unlike the vibrant cultural celebrations of \u201cHamilton\u201d or \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d which pridefully explore ethnocultural roots through hip-hop or religion, these Asian-centric shows only \u201ccelebrate\u201d a long history of Anglo-European interference in Asia and the Pacific Islands.Asian-American actors deserve to play characters that embrace their history without focusing on the white man\u2019s role in it. They deserve to involve themselves in shows that look toward a future in which Asian-American pride is loud and present. They deserve the same opportunity to love, honor and celebrate their culture as the trailblazing African-American, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ actors currently shining on the Broadway stage.The theater community should take pride in its beacons of diversity \u2014 \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cOn Your Feet!\u201d and \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d \u2014 but should also recognize the inequality among actors of color. Modern musicals such as \u201cAllegiance,\u201d about Japanese-American internment, or \u201cHere Lies Love,\u201d about the political controversy of the Philippines, drive the industry in a positive direction, yet they have not closed the gap between Caucasian and minority \u2014 particularly, Asian \u2014 representation on Broadway. Let Broadway applaud itself for its monumental gains in the past decade, but never let it stop pushing for the equal, truthful and proud representation its diverse audience deserves.Works CitedBandhu, Pun.

My friends, who also have their driving permits, frequently joke with me about the woes of lane-changing, parallel parking and three-point turns as we prepare for our looming driver\u2019s license tests.Yet we remain part of a dwindling majority. In 1976, nearly 87 percent of high school seniors held a driver\u2019s license. By 2016, this percentage dropped to under 72, a decrease that may correlate with a climbing dependence on parental or public transportation, a lack of car ownership, or simply not needing to drive anywhere.Then add these declining rates to a rising innovation: autonomous cars. The introduction of effective autonomous cars could drastically reduce vehicular deaths, since 94 percent of traffic fatalities involve human error. Self-driving cars would eliminating the dangers of intoxicated driving, distracted driving or simply incompetent driving \u2015 and render learning to drive unnecessary.But, following the fatal Arizona crash between an autonomous Uber car and a pedestrian, Americans question the true safety of such technology. Company documents reveal that Uber\u2019s self-driving cars drove an average of only 13 miles before a human supervisor had to interfere to prevent a crash. In comparison, a study by Virginia Tech found that the average American driver crashes approximately once every 49,505 miles. Juxtaposed with the data of human drivers, Uber\u2019s autonomous cars appear laughably incompetent. Nevertheless, autonomous cars collectively travel about 113,636 miles per crash, indicating that they can and will be more reliable than humans.Autonomous cars remain far from flawlessly navigating the roads, but we often fail to consider that developers designed our traffic regulations with humans \u2014 and human error \u2014 in mind. An entire network of self-driving cars would optimize traffic congestion and pollution by reducing the number of cars on the road. Consequently, regulations such as speed bumps and parking spaces may become restrictive rather than protective. To take full advantage of autonomous cars, we must prepare to rescind and replace longstanding laws.As self-driving cars continue to improve, so does public reception of them. The percentage of Americans that distrust driverless cars decreased drastically from 74 percent in 2017 to 47 percent in 2018. If this downward trend continues, autonomous cars will soon be an accepted and integral part of society. Akin to penmanship and opera singing, human driving will soon be a practice of the past. And, given the potential security benefits and efficacy of autonomous cars, this is a future that we must accept \u2014 and even embrace.Works CitedBahrampour, Tara. \u201cNot Drinking or Driving, Teens Increasingly Put off Traditional Markers of Adulthood.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 19 Sept. 2017.Blanco, Myra. \u201cAutomated Vehicle Crash Rate Comparison Using Naturalistic Data.\u201d Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, Virginia Polytech Institute and State University, 8 Jan. 2016.\u201cCritical Reasons for Crashes Investigated in the National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey.\u201d National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Feb. 2015.Giffi, Craig A. \u201cA Reality Check on Advanced Vehicle Technologies.\u201d Deloitte Insights, Deloitte Insights, 5 Jan. 2018.Wakabayashi, Daisuke. \u201cUber\u2019s Self-Driving Cars Were Struggling Before Arizona Crash.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 23 March 2018._________Education has become an industry in which the upper-class\u2019s monopoly of resources is unchecked. A New York Times study of 38 top colleges in America, including five Ivy League schools, found that more students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire bottom 60 percent. China faces a similar conundrum, where rich families in urban areas can send their kids to \u201ckeypoint\u201d high schools. These schools receive more funding per student than average schools, have better teachers, and reliably place their students into elite colleges. In a world where income inequality is growing \u2014 China\u2019s bottom 25 percent owns less than 1 percent of the aggregate wealth while the top 1 percent owns over one-third \u2014 one wonders if people not born into wealth are doomed to poverty.However, in 2016, the Chinese Ministry of Education sparked hope when it announced 140,000 spaces \u2014 about 6.5 percent of spots in top colleges \u2014 would be reserved for students from less developed provinces. Unfortunately, this policy immediately ignited strong protests by urban parents. Under protest banners of \u201cfairness in education,\u201d protesters rallied to preserve using \u201cGaokao\u201d college-entrance examination score, as the sole metric. They noted that Gaokao mimics China\u2019s old imperial civil service exam (\u201cKeju\u201d) in relying purely on exam results and praised this meritocratic system as superior. Essentially, their argument is that in the long race of college applications, no one should be forced to run 6.5 percent further than their competitors.What these protesters failed to mention is that times have changed, and the race\u2019s participants begin on vastly different starting lines. The Keju system that was effective in bringing people from rural areas to government posts in cities, and thus increased social mobility, is not applicable in a country experiencing the fastest urbanization trend in history. As recently as 1993, over 40 percent of students in China\u2019s colleges were children of farmers or factory workers. But now social mobility is becoming an obsolete concept. Today, less than 10 percent of young people in the countryside go to senior high schools compared with 70 percent of their urban counterparts.Fairness in education is the right slogan, but a truly meritocratic system should not ignore complex social realities that put some students at a disadvantage from a young age. The Chinese government\u2019s new higher-education admissions policy is a step toward balancing the unequal \u2018starting lines\u2019 that poor, rural students face. More such creative, comprehensive policies should be encouraged. Without these measures, growing inequality in society cannot be redressed. Every citizen \u2014 regardless of location, family background or wealth \u2014 should have hope that hard work and dedication can transform their lives.Works CitedAisch, Gregor, et al. \u201cSome Colleges Have More Students From the Top 1 Percent Than the Bottom 60.

Today, our political climate is marked by increasingly acerbic and polarizing rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum. While we tend to blame those in Washington for splitting America into two, there is another major reason for this internal discord \u2014 ourselves. From social media to news outlets, we often shut ourselves in echo chambers that reinforce our existing views but exclude alternative views.Understandably, we naturally do so in the first place because we like hearing what we want to hear and because we feel confident when others accept our opinions, especially when we browse through and post on social media. But, why is this specifically bad?While some may contend that these platforms allow us to converse with like-minded individuals, echo chambers have silent, pernicious effects on the way we perceive truth. When we surround ourselves only with ideas that are similar to our own, we succumb to groupthink as we take everything we read as fact. This dangerous cycle perpetuates disinformation since we almost always don\u2019t take the time to independently verify what we read and view to be true in the echo chamber.Statistical data already proves this phenomenon. In a 2016 study published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, Swedish researchers analyzed 700,000 posts on a right-wing forum. The results were shocking: It took only six months for the average user to adopt the community\u2019s radical opinions and go from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cWe.\u201dOnce we fall under the influences of this \u201cmob mentality,\u201d we regard our beliefs as hard fact and refuse to engage in conflicting opinions, extinguishing civil discourse. For instance, when people of the same political affiliation were told to debate the merits behind denigrating rumors about the opposite party, the discussions notably veered toward reaffirming those erroneous statements.Despite the plethora of multifaceted and diverse opinions offered online, we still overwhelming choose to latch onto narrow viewpoints that we want to hear. Instead of willfully ignoring the other side, we must learn to engage in opposing perspectives to listen and understand rather than to respond or scorn at. Instead of taking everything we read in blind faith, we must learn to analyze and question it.So, at the end of the day, don\u2019t be afraid to question anything in life. Even if you feel like it\u2019s a \u201cdumb\u201d question, ask it. The more you learn, the less \u201cdumb\u201d questions you will have. But most importantly, learn to be prepared for the answer, too. It may not be what you want to hear, but that\u2019s the truth. The plain truth.Works CitedB\u00e4ck, Emma A., et al. \u201cFrom I to We: Group Formation and Linguistic Adaption in an Online Xenophobic Forum.\u201d 13 March 2018.

Although the wall hasn\u2019t been built yet, planning is underway and it\u2019s now possible to see eight prototype walls in Otay Mesa, San Diego. According to the Trump administration, this planned wall will reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants. However, building a wall is actually counterproductive and there are many more effective alternatives.It\u2019s true a wall may keep some undocumented immigrants out, which might decrease the number of these immigrants in the workforce. But, according to the Department of Homeland Security, \u201cmost undocumented immigrants now simply overstay legally obtained short-term visas \u2014 and do not sneak across the border.\u201d Simply flying to the U.S. as a tourist or visitor, many people arrive legally and then stay on as undocumented immigrants. Clearly, physically blocking people from crossing the border using a wall is not an effective way to solve the problem.Building the wall would also cut into the budget for other kinds of border control. The Trump administration plans to spend over 18 million dollars on building a border wall, or over 50 percent of the 33 billion border security budget. Spending so much to build the wall would mean budget cuts for routine spending on maintenance and border control upgrades during the wall\u2019s construction. Spending cuts would result in reductions in patrol routes, lights, cameras, sensors and personnel. This lack of maintenance and improvements would result in more undocumented immigrants crossing over during construction, not fewer.Instead of building a wall, there are more effective ways to solve the undocumented immigration issue. First, money budgeted for the wall could be spent on enhancing law enforcement efforts aimed at companies that hire undocumented immigrants. If hiring regulations are enforced and it becomes harder for undocumented immigrants to find jobs, the number of illegal border crossings would decrease. Another critical way to reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants is to continue investing in other forms of enhanced border control technology like drones and heat sensors, which would increase law enforcement\u2019s ability to find undocumented immigrants sneaking across border.If completed, the wall wouldn\u2019t be an effective protection against undocumented immigrants. Even China\u2019s Great Wall was ineffective at keeping out groups like the Mongolians or at keeping Han Chinese from leaving China to settle outside the wall illegally. Eventually, immigrants will always find ways to cross the physical obstacles that governments put in their paths. Therefore, the U.S. border security budget should be spent on actual solutions instead of on creating a big, inefficient wall that may eventually become just another tourist attraction like the one in China.Works CitedBurgos, Fredy. \u201cTrump\u2019s Mexico Border Wall Isn\u2019t Going to Stem the Flow of Undocumented Immigrants.\u201d Newsweek, 20 Dec. 2017.Nixon, Ron. \u201cTo Pay for Wall, Trump Would Cut Proven Border Security Measures.\u201d The New York Times, 8 Jan. 2018.Nixon, Ron. \u201cWhat Border Agents Say They Want (It\u2019s Not a Wall).\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 22 March 2018.Urrea, Luis Alberto. \u201cLooking at Trump\u2019s \u2018Beautiful Wall\u2019.\u201d The New York Times, 3 March 2018._________Many Americans characterize the Electoral College as a fair system that represents all Americans. Supporters point to the fact that small states like Wyoming and Delaware would be unimportant in a direct election for president and thus ignored. Under the Electoral College, they reason, candidates must pay attention to all states. Yet nearly every argument in support for the Electoral College is inconsistent.The truth is that small states are still ignored despite the extra representation. Rather than diversifying the states that candidates visit, the Electoral College forces candidates to focus on the swing states. This is because of its all-or-nothing approach to granting electors: If a candidate wins a majority in a state, he or she will win all the electors in the state. It matters not whether the candidate wins by 60 percent or 90 percent. The results of this are horrible. As The New York Times stated, \u201cIn 2016, two-thirds of all public campaign events were held in just six states\u2026.\u201dIn addition, there is not a clear reason why the small states should have their votes count more than the large states if the Electoral College does nothing to diversify the states candidates visit. Small states should have their votes count less precisely because they are smaller than the large states.Most in favor of abolishing the Electoral College want a direct national vote giving one vote to every person. However a direct national vote would still retain several problems of the Electoral College, most notably the spoiler effect. The spoiler effect occurs when a third candidate splits the vote of one of the two parties causing the candidate who would have won to lose and the candidate that a minority of Americans wanted to win. This has happened both to Republicans and Democrats and it discourages Americans from voting for a third party for fear of wasting their vote on a candidate who cannot win. Americans would still be stuck with two-party rule under this system.This problem could be alleviated with instant-runoff voting. Under this system, voters could rank their choices for candidates. If no candidate has a majority in the first round, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and the second choice of those who voted for that candidate is considered. This process is continued until one of the candidates has a majority. With instant-runoff voting, the fear of giving away an election would be eliminated because voters could choose third parties as higher choices and give lower priority to the major parties. This would diversify the political landscape of the United States and give Americans more choices for elections.Works CitedEdwards, George C., I.,II. \u201c5 Myths about the Electoral College.\u201d The Washington Post, Nov. 04, 2012, ProQuest.\u201cIt\u2019s Time to Give Instant Run-Off Balloting a Try.\u201d Montgomery Advertiser, Sept. 17, 2017, ProQuest.Lehnert, Tim. \u201cNo Vote \u2018Wasted\u2019 in This System.\u201d Telegram & Gazette, Dec. 30, 2016, ProQuest.\u201cLet the People Pick the President.\u201d Editorial.

Instead of squandering limited sources on policing an issue that history has proved impossible to eradicate, why not give sex work a legal framework that provides sex workers with medical help and legal protection against violence?Prostitution is a multimillion dollar business, yet no one is collecting taxes from it. According to Nevada brothel owner Dennis Hof, the city of Las Vegas alone could make $25 million a year, just from taxing prostitution. A study conducted by the University of California found that one American city spends on average of $2000 arresting one prostitute; this amounts to $125 million a year in enforcement costs nationwide. Legalizing sex work would turn it into a revenue maker, rather than a burden for the taxpayer.Making prostitution legal could minimize serious health concerns. Decriminalizing prostitution allows the government to regulate and monitor the trade. This, in turn, could ensure that HIV and other STD protection programs are carried out effectively, and research proves this to be true; according to expert Steffanie Strathdee\u2019s study, 46 percent of HIV infections could be averted in any of the Canadian, Kenyan and Indian cities she researched, simply by fully decriminalizing prostitution. An Australian study found that the prevalence of STDs was \u201c80 times greater in 63 illegal street prostitutes than in 753 of their legal brothel counterparts\u201d. Additionally, it was found that condom use was significantly higher in legalized sex work compared to illegal prostitution.It could be argued that authorizing sex work encourages ill treatment toward women. Research shows the opposite; legalizing prostitution actually reduces violence toward women. A study in the Netherlands found that opening designated legal street prostitution zones decreased rape and sexual abuse by 30-40 percent. It was also found that giving sex work a legal framework empowered women to demand safer sex and legal punishment of abuse. Furthermore, as Peter G. Hill brings up in his New York Times Letter to the Editor, legalizing prostitution allows the government to enforce age restrictions on sex trade, preventing underage teens from being lured into the trade.I am not proclaiming a moral judgment on prostitution; I am stating facts. Prostitution is a reality of the modern world. This modern world demands equality. It demands protection and change. Yet change, protection and equality are not being demanded for sex workers. It\u2019s time for the government to stop telling people how to live their lives, and it\u2019s time for the citizens to demand protection for those who need it.Works CitedAkers, Mick. \u201cThis Pimp Wants to End Sex Trafficking.\u201d LasVegasSun.com, 20 March 2017.Becklund, Laurie . \u201cProstitution Arrests Cost $2,000 Each, Study Finds.\u201d Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Times, 10 July 1987.Kastoryano, Stephen, et al. \u201cStreet Prostitution Zones and Crime.\u201d Cato Institute, 19 Apr. 2017.\u201cOpinion | Should Prostitution Be Legalized?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 7 Sept. 2015.\u201cProstitution, Public Health, and Human-Rights Law.\u201d The Lancet.\u201cSimple Way to Curb HIV?

I only recently recognized the connection between these two facets of myself \u2014 or rather, the lack of one: in all of my stories since childhood, I had never written about a Chinese American character. The reason? I\u2019d never really read about one either.The lack of ethnic representation in children\u2019s literature is stark. According to the publisher Lee & Low, only about 10 percent of children\u2019s books published in the last two decades contain diverse themes. Meanwhile, roughly 80 percent of people involved in children\u2019s literature \u2014 authors, illustrators, editors, publishers, etc. \u2014 are white. When people of color constitute roughly 39 percent of the current U.S. population, these numbers convey a serious problem. It has been said that books act as mirrors, allowing readers to reflect on their own identities. Children of color are deprived of the opportunity to truly see themselves in the pages they read, thus made to understand that they can never be the protagonists of their own stories.Too often, multicultural books are pushed aside because they can\u2019t connect with the majority of white readers. But to make such an argument when nonhuman characters are so popular in children\u2019s literature is to suggest that white children have more in common with animals than other children. Moreover, research has continuously shown that reading facilitates empathy and understanding. A study conducted by Laurel Hartmann specifically found that multicultural picture books \u201chelped encourage the students to search for similarities between their own lives and the lives of members of diverse cultures around the world.\u201d Thus, representative books may be just as important for white children as for children of color.In recent years, more and more attention has been brought to this issue. In 2014, an online campaign under the hashtag #WeNeedDiverseBooks turned into a nonprofit organization that advocates for diversity in children\u2019s literature. Independent publishers such as Lee & Low Books, ArtePublico Press\u2019 Pi\u00f1ata Imprint, and Just Us Books have introduced more diverse characters into print. It is up to us to support these efforts to ensure that children of color have a chance to see themselves and be seen, to remember that their stories are just as real, valid and deserving. It is up to us to buy diverse books from local bookstores, contact school libraries to ask for more inclusive selections, and promote minority writers who are representing their communities.And as a young minority writer myself, I am learning to find my voice and to speak out for all those who have lost their own. In doing so, I hope that the writers of the next generation will never learn to silence their heritage as I did.Works CitedHartmann, Laurel K. \u201cUsing Multicultural Literature in the Classroom to Encourage Tolerance and Respect.\u201d MS Thesis.

Beijing\u2019s municipal government is waging a targeted, unethical and destructive campaign against migrant communities.On November 18, 2017, a fire killed 19 people in a blue-collar apartment, prompting China\u2019s capital to initiate a safety blitz against \u201cillegal structures\u201d on its outskirts, seeking to \u201cimprove safety,\u201d according to government officials. Consequently, thousands of migrants living in these low-rent areas were forced to move or leave Beijing entirely with as little as one day\u2019s notice, as their homes and business were destroyed. These mass evictions trample on the human rights of Chinese citizens and were met with unusual public backlash. Over 100 Chinese intellectuals authored an open letter condemning the governmental actions and demanding an immediate termination of the campaign, compensation to the evicted, and increased awareness of the migrants\u2019 rights.Furthermore, the illegitimate displacements pose a serious threat to the psychological health of victims and deprive migrant children of equal access to education. At Yingbo, a private kindergarten in suburban Beijing, dozens of security officers forcibly evacuated students, causing significant trauma. Geoffrey Crothall, the director of China Labour Bulletin, explains that this coldblooded operation \u201creinforced [evictees\u2019] feelings of resentment and social exclusion.\u201dIn fact, this campaign fits into China\u2019s ongoing efforts to shrink Beijing\u2019s population. Home to approximately 21.7 million residents (including 8 million migrants), the city suffers from a \u201cmetropolitan disease\u201d and desperately needs a reduction in size. Last year, the level of annual per capita water resources was one-eightieth of the world average. In 2014, Beijing had the country\u2019s highest rates of congestion and per capita commuting time. In an attempt to transform the overcrowded capital into an upscale metropolis, Beijing aims to cap its population at 23 million by 2020.However, diluting the population of Beijing by evicting migrant workers has an acutely negative impact on the city. A Forbes study shows that the total GDP of Chinese cities is proportional to its migrant population. As Beijing\u2019s population ages, migrants are a vital bulwark against failing social and economic institutions. Li Tie, the president of the China City Development Center, states, \u201cBeijing cannot survive without them.\u201dPolicymakers must consider patterns of urban ecology when reforming Beijing. The government should allow more time for migrant families to move between houses, jobs and schools, as necessary. To empower this vital community, new employment opportunities and relocation compensation should be offered. As Beijing strives to transform into a world-class capital, it must stop treating migrants like second-class citizens.Works Cited\u201cBeijing\u2019s Total Water Consumption Will Be Less Than 4 Billion This Year.\u201d The Beijing News, 18 May 2017.Buckley, Chris. \u201cWhy Part of Beijing Looks Like a Devastated War Zone.\u201d The New York Times. 30 Nov. 2017.Hernandez, Javier and Zhao, Iris. \u201cOne Target in Beijing\u2019s Migrant Crackdown: Schoolchildren.\u201d The New York Times. 24 Dec. 2017.\u201cLi Tie: Beijing Cannot Survive without the Migrants.\u201d Sina Finance. 29 Nov. 2017.Ma, Beibei \u201cBeijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform Analyzes Four Major Causes of the \u2018Metropolitan Disease\u2019 of Beijing.\u201d China Youth Online. 23 Jan. 2016.\u201cNotice on Special Operations for Security Hazard.\u201d Beijing Municipal Work Safety Committee, 20 Nov. 2017.________Abortion is one of the most polarizing topics in the United States. For many on both sides, you\u2019re either with them or against them, and unwilling to compromise. But what if there was a way to reduce abortion rates without blocking women from getting them? The answer is simple: better sex education.For the past few decades there has been a large push to end the abstinence-only sex education implemented by many schools across the U.S. Several studies have found that an abstinence-only education does not work, as it is becoming increasingly unlikely to expect young people to remain abstinent until they are married, considering the increasing age of marriage. There has also been significant evidence that cohesive sex ed classes decrease the chances of unplanned pregnancy and abortion. In theory, abstinence is an idealistic solution, but it has been shown time and time again to be unsuccessful in practice.One program that has actually shown positive results is the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, which is evidence-based and funds a wide variety of organizations working to prevent teen pregnancy. In the past decade the CDC has reported the average teenage birthrate has dropped more than 40 percent, due to the help of the TPP and similar programs.After defunding the planned parenthood budget and closing 81 clinics in Texas, teen abortion rates were found to have risen a significant amount. Meanwhile, Colorado offered free birth control, and teen abortions decreased by 42 percent in just 4 years. This is just one example of how it has been shown that limiting access to family planning services such as planned parenthood actually drives up the need for abortions, while providing contraception and informing people of how to be safe drives the need for abortion down. Why is it then that Republican lawmakers continue to slash funding for these organizations?It would be logical to assume that an administration with a pro-life agenda would be eager to decrease abortions in any way they could, however, this seems to not be the case. Regardless of its proven benefits, the Trump administration canceled funding for 81 projects in the TPP program, while increasing funds for abstinence programs. The fact that the government is ignoring fact-based evidence under the guise of being \u201cpro-life\u201d is appalling. It has been shown that quality sex education is highly beneficial, and if the government truly wants to stop abortions from happening, this is the way to do it. Until then, we need to call them out for their blatant hypocrisy and urge legislators to pay attention to the facts, protect the rights of its citizens and remind others to stay informed.Works CitedBaker, Aspen. \u201cA Better Way to Talk about Abortion.\u201d TED: Ideas Worth Spreading, May 2015.Bassett, Laura. \u201cTeen Abortions Surged In Texas After Republicans Defunded Planned Parenthood.\u201d The Huffington Post, 12 July 2017.Bennet, James. \u201cOpinion | The Gathering Threat to Abortion Rights.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 31 Jan. 2018.Bump, Philip. \u201cAnalysis | How America Feels about Abortion.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 24 April 2017.Carroll, Aaron E. \u201cSex Education Based on Abstinence?

Discussions with my peers in the wake of the #MeToo movement have yielded shared feelings of disgust toward these abusers, and horror that we too may be part of the problem. This fear stems not from acknowledgment that we have facilitated harassment, but rather from the uncertainty of what constitutes reprehensible behavior. Our shared worry was not spurred by Harvey Weinstein or Matt Lauer ..., but instead from claims brought against Aziz Ansari. The allegations against Mr. Ansari appeared to be a landmark event, for instead of universally turning favor against him, they divided the community. Some notable feminists, including Bari Weiss, even began to back Ansari. Following the release of the allegations Weiss published an article in The New York Times in which she calls for women to be more vocal about their wishes, and states that lumping Ansari in with other accused abusers \u201ctrivializes what the #MeToo movement first stood for.\u201d This sentiment was shared by my peers. Following the publication of the original expos\u00e9, my morning commute was dominated by debates over whether what Ansari did was wrong, and whether his accuser went too far. The fact that such discussions occurred is evidence of a systematic problem across the younger generations; we are unsure what exactly constitutes inappropriate sexual behavior.The Economist recently published the results of a survey in which participants were asked whether they felt certain actions constituted sexual harassment. The findings were divided by nation, age and gender. The study concluded that in the U.S. there exists both a generational and gender gap. Older generations were shown to be less likely than younger generations to view actions such as commenting on attractiveness to be sexual harassment. Similarly, women were far more likely to view actions as harassment than their male counterparts. The divide demonstrated by the study coupled with the discourse surrounding Ansari paint a picture of a society confused, unsure and anxious. The only viable solution to such sentiments is further education.I propose redefining sexual harassment and restructuring the way young men are taught about relationships. I believe that boys should be taught from a young age what is and is not acceptable, similarly to how young children are taught the difference between a \u201cgood touch\u201d and a \u201cbad touch.\u201d While I understand my claims may be viewed as shortsighted or worse, defensive of predators, my intent is the opposite. We young men know we are the problem and that until we change these issues will still occur. We want to be a part of the solution and long for education.Works Cited\u201cOver-Friendly, or Sexual Harassment?

It\u2019s easy, often helpful, and most importantly: free.But soon, everything about that is going to change.On December 14, 2017, the Federal Commissions Committee (FCC) voted to repeal 2015\u2019s net neutrality rules, officially called Title II. These rules required internet service providers (ISPs) to give equal access to all content online without charging its consumers for higher quality, nor special treatment to certain websites. This repeal may not change the web drastically, but it will take the entire internet as we know it and chuck it down the drain.The ringleader behind the repeal, FCC chairman Ajit Pai, claimed last April that Title II \u201cabandon[s] successful policies solely because of hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom.\u201d But let\u2019s travel to net-neutrality-free countries like Portugal, where these hypothetical harms are already a reality. Portugal\u2019s wireless carrier, Meo, splits internet access into packages: a package where customers pay for traditional data, plus monthly paying packages for any other sites and apps they use \u2014 entertainment, shopping, communication. For instance, more data for both messaging apps and social networks cost \u20ac4.99 [$5.86] a month each. This means you could be paying up to $140.64 USD a year for both packages. Imagine losing almost $150 a year, just for your favorite messaging and social media sites.But wait, there\u2019s more! With no net neutrality, an ISP could block any access to an app unless the customer or the app company pays up. ISPs who view a site as a competitor, or even disagree with their political views, can be censored.And if Portugal can do that, what\u2019s stopping America from doing the same? Without the safety blanket of net neutrality, what\u2019s stopping them from silencing social movements like Black Lives Matter? Suppressing resources from communities that need them most like women, the LGBT+ and immigrants? It doesn\u2019t just hurt small businesses trying to expand, students living in poverty, or even long-distance relationships relying on the internet to communicate. It blocks any of our voices from being heard.Net neutrality is hanging by a thread, but there\u2019s still a small flicker of hope in the midst of the internet\u2019s impending doomsday. Recently, congressional Democrats introduced a resolution of disapproval to counter the FCC\u2019s repeal. Both the House and Senate must pass it in under 60 days.To my fellow Gen Z kids, and those older too \u2014 the clock is ticking. It\u2019s time to let these people know we want to save our messy, manic and magical internet.Works CitedCollins, Keith. \u201cWhy Net Neutrality Was Repealed and How It Affects You.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 14 Dec. 2017.

In a world where freedom is a luxury, underaged brides watch their aspirations die as they are sold into patriarchal family structures that display the very roots of male dominance. The underage marriage of Indian women must be eradicated in order to protect the interests of women worldwide.According to UNICEF\u2019s Child Marriage Statistics, an estimated 47 percent of girls in India continue to be involuntarily married before the age of eighteen \u2014 leaving them little time to grow and develop their social footing. Misogyny is inevitable for several of these girls \u2014 many of their fathers marry them off in an attempt to increase food rations and investments in men, who are regarded as more valuable in rural Indian societies. Unfortunately, girls are simply seen as a \u201cliability and a burden,\u201d according to Dinesh Shur, a village pastor, in a CBN article detailing child marriage in India.As such, futures remain desolate for child brides in rural India. Their educational careers are left on an indefinite hold as they bear children, often by the time they reach puberty. Instead, they spend their time doing dreary chores for their husband\u2019s families. \u201cAfter marriage, what is my work now? Washing dishes, cleaning the floor, washing clothes and cooking,\u201d states Seema, in an article written by Nel Hedayat that details the life of a child bride. With no education, no work experience and no one to turn to, child brides are left dependent on any support offered by their in-laws.What families don\u2019t realize is that by allowing girls to obtain an education rather than being forced into domestic labor could lead to the socioeconomic advancement of India as this enables potential members of the workforce. Additionally, jobs will provide women with financial security and a voice in a male-dominated society. The New York Times article \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t India\u2019s Women Working?\u201d states: \u201cWorking, and the control of assets it allows, lowers rates of domestic violence and increases women\u2019s decision-making in the household. And an economy where all the most able citizens can enter the labor force is more efficient and grows faster.\u201dAfter being upheld for thousands of years, child marriage may seem hard to stop; but it is all of our duties to help these girls through supporting and donating to educational, self-defense and women\u2019s rights groups in India. We must strive to make it possible that no young woman will ever have to see a day when a price tag is set upon her self worth and freedom again.Works CitedHedayat, Nel. \u201cWhat Is It like to Be a Child Bride?\u201d BBC News, BBC, 4 Oct. 2011.Pande, Rohini, and Charity Troyer Moore. \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t India\u2019s Women Working?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 23 Aug. 2015.Thomas, George. \u201cIndia\u2019s Innocent: Secret Weddings of Child Brides.\u201d CBN.com \u2014 The Christian Broadcasting Network, 26 March 2017.\u201cUNICEF Child Marriage Statistics.\u201d UNICEF.________It\u2019s a Saturday evening. You\u2019re flipping through the television channels when you stumble upon the movie \u201cShe\u2019s All That.\u201d Or \u201cAnother Cinderella Story.\u201d Or \u201cFreaky Friday.\u201d While each may have different characters, plot lines and messages, they are all classified as teen movies, which means they share one common feature: bullying.The bullying that occurs in these films is usually of a specific type: The football player and his buddies see the nerd with his calculator in the hallway and shove him into a locker. The cheerleaders fill the chubby girl\u2019s locker with soda so that when she opens it, she gets drenched. The huge bodybuilder of a senior beats up the scrawny freshman who accidentally bumped his backpack.I don\u2019t know if times have changed or movie writers have just forgotten what it felt like to be in high school, but in my four years of being a student, bullying has rarely been carried out in this manner. More often, it happens in whispers, through subtly closed off circles, through feigned compliments that turn into mocking giggles as soon as backs are turned. It happens over the internet: in group chats that exclude one specific person, in comments of \u201cGORGEOUS!\u201d under an Instagram post that the commenters definitely do not think is gorgeous. This cyberbullying is particularly prevalent in the lives of current teenagers, who have almost unlimited access to social media, and it \u201ccan have such a negative impact \u2026 [and] can do great harm to a whole peer group, or to school culture more generally.\u201d These more subtle types of harassment seem to be more prominent in a high school setting than physical attacks, and hurt much more.Most teen movies fail to capture this kind of bullying accurately, and in this way contribute to an unrealistic view of high school life. Bullying can have very strong effects on teenagers, \u201ccausing depression and anxiety \u2026 disrupting [teenagers\u2019] sleep, [and] causing gastrointestinal issues and headaches.\u201d If movies continue to portray bullying in the wrong way, not only may these symptoms be increased as teenagers begin to feel that their own experiences are invalid, but people will not be able to recognize true bullying behaviors. Kids are taught constantly in school not to be a bystander, but even the most noble of students cannot be expected to intervene when they don\u2019t realize that someone is being bullied. Teen movie writers need to take on the responsibility that comes with targeting the adolescent demographic, and complete research and focus groups to make sure that they are portraying one of the most common experiences in teenage life accurately. This, if nothing else, they owe to their viewers.Works CitedKlass, Perri. \u201cIn the Fight Against Bullying, a Glimmer of Hope.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 22 Dec. 2017.Strickland, Ashley. \u201cBullying Is a \u2018Serious Public Health Problem,\u2019 Experts Say.\u201d CNN, CNN, 21 June 2017._________\u201cI swear, I\u2019m so OCD,\u201d the girl says after neatly placing a bundle of colored pencils into a decorated pouch. I offer an awkward laugh, but all I can think about is my friend, who\u2019s OCD keeps him from going to school and hanging out with friends, or the article I read that says people with OCD are 10 times more likely than people without to commit suicide. How many times have you heard similar off-handed comments? \u201cThis class makes me depressed.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s so psycho.\u201d Today, a girl described the weather as \u201cbipolar.\u201d These comments are thrown around frequently without any thought to the harm they might be doing. Even I\u2019ve done it. Most of the time there\u2019s no malice, but comments like these, which trivialize serious illnesses, feed a society that stigmatizes the mentally ill, isolating them and making it impossible for them to live fulfilling lives.Using mental illnesses like descriptive adjectives and not serious disorders is trivializing, and contributes to the stigmatization of those afflicted. NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) estimates that 1 in 5 Americans suffers from a mental illness, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. \u2014 claiming well over 41,000 lives a year. In simpler words, mental illness is a big deal; such a big deal the World Health Organization sites depression \u2014 just one of many mental illnesses \u2014 as the leading cause of disability. So why do we act like they\u2019re not by using them as descriptors or for cheap laughs?Mental illness stigma leads to misunderstandings about the conditions and can create barriers to accessing treatment. In the New York Times piece \u201cAlone With My Husband\u2019s Secret,\u201d Carolyn Ali writes of her husband\u2019s struggle with depression. Even after telling his wife, he asked to keep his condition a secret from his family members because of fear of their reaction. Ali says the experience also took a tremendous toll on her. She wonders why these surprisingly common experiences are kept secret and why the stigma exists. This is just one story, but it underscores what experts say about stigma being a major cause of under-treatment.Although there are many things that lead to the stigmatization of mental illness, and many reasons for treatment barriers, the trivializing of these conditions through jokes and minimization of the severity of the conditions is contributing to the exacerbation of the problem. It can be easily addressed through increased understanding of the words we use to describe experiences and ourselves. Recognizing how serious these disorders are and choosing not to use them as merely descriptors for an exaggerated situation is one small step to a society where stigma won\u2019t prevent those from getting the treatment that they need.Works CitedAli, Carolyn. \u201cAlone With My Husband\u2019s Secret.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 1 Feb. 2018.Hawkes, Nigel. \u201cStigma Is Leading to under-Treatment of Mental Health Conditions, Says Leading Psychiatrist.\u201d The BMJ, British Medical Journal Publishing Group, 21 April 2016.\u201cMental Health By The Numbers.\u201d NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness, 12 March 2018.\u201cPatients with OCD Are 10 Times More Likely to Commit Suicide.\u201d ScienceDaily, ScienceDaily, 19 July 2016.Wilkerson, Abby L. \u201cShould I Tell My Students I Have Depression?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 14 Dec. 2016._______As R. David Lankes once said, \u201cBad libraries build collections, good libraries build services, and great libraries build communities.\u201d In an age where access to the internet is becoming more and more prevalent in people\u2019s lives, some argue that libraries are more of a financial burden than a benefit to society. However, libraries are more than an obsolete source of information. They are places of community and opportunity still important to this day, and thus should not be discarded but adapted for modern purposes.According to the Editorial Board from The New York Times, in 2015 more people visited New York\u2019s libraries than all the baseball stadiums, sports arenas, city-owned museums, gardens and zoos combined. This could be due to the fact that \u201cvirtually all libraries provide free access to the internet [and] WiFi\u201d as reported by the American Library Association. For some, libraries are even a safe haven. One woman called Sandra recalled, \u201c[Libraries were] a space to feel safe. During my high school years of hormone induced mental imbalance, I knew that I could depend on my local library.\u201d The continued use of libraries and the invaluable services they offer, such as technology training and workshops, proves the necessity of libraries in the modern world.Even more than a library\u2019s usefulness for information and support, they also provide a place for the city\u2019s community to gather. The American Library Association found that libraries have been used for book clubs, classes, forums and more. From study groups to citywide events, libraries are the ideal location for people to come together. And in an age where people\u2019s lives are becoming increasingly digitized and secluded, community is all the more important. As a high school student who utilizes the library at least once a week, I can sincerely say that I have built friendships between those bookshelves.Some people may argue that libraries still cling to archaic methods, which extremely diminishes their useful potential. And some libraries are indeed losing their effectiveness by sticking with old routines as the world shifts to a digital face. But many libraries have already adapted wonderfully to the changes. From starting online ebook libraries to integrating new software into their systems, these libraries prove that the answer is not to shut down libraries, but to help them change.Libraries are invaluable for their services, support and the opportunities they offer for the community. By helping them to adapt to current technology and modern techniques, we can ensure that libraries will continue to benefit their cities. So support your local library and take advantage of its services. Maybe you\u2019ll learn something new, or make an unexpected friend. And who knows? You may even read a book while you\u2019re there.Works Cited\u201cALA Library Fact Sheet 6.\u201d American Library Association.The Editorial Board. \u201cNew York City\u2019s Libraries Need Money.\u201d The New York Times.

Unfortunately, this is exactly the life of women in Saudi Arabia, where the treatment of women restricts their fundamental human rights.During my two years living in Dubai and Qatar, I went to Saudi Arabia three times with my father where I witnessed their discriminatory policies. In a mall in Riyadh, I was shocked to see a woman awkwardly eating noodles without taking off the veil of her niqab. She used a fork to lift the noodles toward the eye-opening, and slightly pulled the lower part away from her face, then pointed the fork down so the noodles would slide onto the inside of the veil without revealing her face.As it turns out, the Saudi government strictly prohibits women in public from ever taking off their niqabs. Saudi Arabia claims these restrictions are to ensure \u201cwomen\u2019s modesty\u201d commanded by Allah. Yet, not only are these restrictions undignifying, the Quran calls for \u201cboth men and women \u2018to cover and be modest.\u2019\u201d The fact that the Saudi government only restrict women reveals a double standard.However demeaning the requirement of wearing a niqab in public might be, it is only one symptom of a system that restricts women\u2019s fundamental rights. According to Human Rights Watch, Saudi females\u2019 lives are controlled by male guardians from birth to death due to its unique guardianship system. As hundreds of Saudi females have attested, this is a most inhuman policy as the male guardian decides whether \u201chis\u201d woman can see a doctor or even leave prison. Presumably, Saudi leadership, composed entirely of men, believes that women are unable to make the types of decisions that men make. Over time, the system gradually changes Saudi women\u2019s mind-sets, reducing them to men\u2019s property, even in their hearts. Rania, a 34-year-old Saudi woman, said, \u201cWe are entrusted with raising the next generation but you can\u2019t trust us with ourselves. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dWhile the Saudi government argues that these policies are protecting women, they have nothing to do with protection and everything to do with dehumanization. However, President Trump has proposed multiple economic collaborations with Saudi Arabia, and during his recent meeting with Prince Salman, \u201cover 20 people were at the table, yet none were women.\u201d This symbolic irony along with other policies reveal the U.S. government\u2019s unwillingness to address this gender disparity.It is time for our free nation to push for urgently-needed reforms by placing conditions of ending human rights violations to U.S.-Saudi trade deals. Instead of ignoring these human rights abuses, the United States of America should show the world that abuses are not tolerated.Works Cited\u201cBoxed In: Women and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Male Guardianship System.\u201d Human Rights Watch, 6 June 2017.Cochrane, Emily. \u201cOver 20 People Were at the Table When Trump Met the Saudis.

That is, well, tobacco in the form of cigarettes. Now, because of vape pens \u2014 technology that delivers nicotine through heated oils \u2014 American youth are experiencing the rapid rebranding of our favorite vice. While vape companies such as Juul are capitalizing on the image of a sleeker, less carcinogenic way of getting buzzed, vaping is simply a method of concealing nicotine use, without eliminating any of its physiological consequences. The discreet nature of vaping and the game of cat and mouse that it inspires between teachers and students is prompting a psychological shift among youth that enables drug consumption, while masquerading as doing the opposite.Joe Camel, the icon of tobacco conglomerate R.J. Reynolds, was executed in 1997, after nearly a decade of representing the Camel brand of cigarettes. The reasoning behind the federal government\u2019s decision to outlaw the swaggering camel was that he made smoking seem carefree and enticing to youth. Currently we are experiencing a more subtle version of the Joe Camel, in which vape pens such as Juul are reclaiming fun, risqu\u00e9 smoking. Not only do vapers have a nearly endless array of flavors to choose from, they also have apparatus that can disappear in a closed fist, according to a review of the Juul pen by NPR, in which owning a Juul is like a badge of honor. \u201cY\u2019all this kid came into my 7th period to get a juul and we all started laughing when he left so the teacher was really confused,\u201d according to @hyphyybriannaa, quoted in the study.A recent Times report on vaping attributes vaping partially to a decline in teenage cigarette smoking. While vaping is indeed helping teens move away from more carcinogenic forms of consuming nicotine, it also has the detrimental effect of making drug use seem more commonplace, cosmetic and convenient. After all, some brands of vaporizer can be charged in a laptop USB port, and concealed all day for undetectable puffing. Vaping might in fact just be hiding the harmful effect of drugs through a sleek image. In the National Institute on Drug Abuse study cited in the Times report, 51.8 percent of teens surveyed claimed that the substance inside vaporizers was \u201cjust liquid.\u201dDoes better technology make drug use permissive? No, but it certainly makes it easier. Vape pens are likely going to be short-lived in schools, which will make them only more appealing to youth. In order to truly lessen drug use, government and schools have to go after image, not just drugs themselves.Works CitedChen, Angus. \u201cTeenagers Embrace JUUL, Saying It\u2019s Discreet Enough To Vape In Class.\u201d NPR. 4 December 2017.Elliot, Stuart. \u201cJoe Camel, a Giant in Tobacco Marketing, Is Dead at 23.\u201d The New York Times. 11 July 1997.Hoffman, Jan. \u201cMarijuana and Vaping Are More Popular Than Cigarettes Among Teenagers.\u201d The New York Times. 14 December 2017.________Since 1970, the global Catholic population has nearly doubled. At the same time, 5,000 fewer priests are active in the Church, creating a worldwide priest shortage in which more than 20 percent of parishes lack a resident priest. To address this crisis, the Catholic Church should end the ban on female ordination.Although most supporters of a male-only clergy cite Church tradition, ordaining women only chafes against modern constraints. In fact, the Church didn\u2019t change their rules on ordination in this respect until the 11th century. To be clear, this means women served as priests, deaconesses and even bishops for nearly 1000 years. In the early Middle Ages, the changing Church not only closed these roles to men, but attempted to change contemporary and ancient records to obscure that women ever served in these roles, a campaign that has been remarkably successful through modern times.If tradition is not enough proof, then perhaps Scripture itself provides a better basis. In Paul\u2019s letter to the Romans, he refers to \u201cour sister Phoebe, a deacon\u201d (Rom 16:1). Further, his letter to the Galatians states that \u201cIn Christ there is no Jew or Greek, slave or citizen, male or female. All are one in Christ Jesus\u201d (Gal 3:28). Even the Gospels show the importance of women to Jesus\u2019s ministry. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is widely accepted as the first disciple, and the first Apostles, or witnesses to the Resurrection, are all women, including Mary Magdalene, who reveals the news to the initially disbelieving male disciples. When it comes to celebrating the Resurrection, the purpose of a Catholic Mass, Scripture proves women are equally qualified to do so.If there ever was a time to expand the priesthood, it is now. The Francis Effect has expanded the laity in new ways, welcoming lapsed Catholics disillusioned by social positions of the Church and the sexual abuse scandal, as well as LGBT Catholics. The energy of young people on the side of the Francis Effect can and should be harnessed by a movement to allow women to fulfill their vocation to the priesthood.However, proponents of ordaining women should acknowledge the difficulty of any movement in an institution as reluctant to change as the Church. Some dioceses in the United States don\u2019t even allow girls to altar serve, and Pope Francis, the face of the inclusive Church movement, has made clear his opposition to ordaining women. Still, if Church leaders want to recruit more priests to end the shortage, they would be wise to open the position to the other half of the population.Works CitedEgan, Timothy. \u201cA Francis Effect for a Broken System.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 24 Sept. 2015.\u201cFrequently Requested Church Statistics.\u201d CARA, Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, 2017.Macy, Gary. \u201cThe Hidden History of Women\u2019s Ordination: Female Clergy in the Medieval West.\u201d Oxford University Press, 2008._________In 1997, Tarana Burke was working at a youth camp when a 13-year-old girl told Ms. Burke that her stepfather had been sexually abusing her. Tarana was left speechless \u2014 what could she tell the girl, and hundreds of others in her position, that would convey that she understood and felt their pain? Ten years after that conversation, Ms. Burke finally found what she needed to say: me too.As a survivor of child sexual assault, I have been waiting for these two words for a very long time \u2014 seeing the #MeToo movement explode empowered me to share my experiences with others after years of being silent. The #MeToo movement brought me to a place in which I felt that I could openly discuss my experience without judgment or victim blaming. Saying #MeToo is a statement of understanding like no other. But what must remain fundamental is that the movement is about more than awareness and empathy. It is also about changes to laws and policies that perpetuate the imbalance of power between men and women. It is about challenging social norms and a culture in which the victim is instinctively blamed for the crime.This issue requires us, as a society, to examine ourselves and our culture that allows and encourages this type of behavior. At some point, we must ask ourselves if the \u201cproblem\u201d of sexual assault is an unintended consequence or the purposeful product of a system designed to systematically isolate, silence and marginalize those with lesser power. A report from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that 75 percent of workplace harassment incidents go unreported \u2014 for those who did speak out, 75 percent faced retaliation from their employer. A matter of such magnitude cannot be mended on a case-by-case basis. Comprehensively fixing this issue starts with providing women effective reporting options beyond filing a complaint with HR or talking to their managers \u2014 options that often have only the company\u2019s best interest at heart \u2014 and giving women decision-making roles in which they have the same chance for success as men.Although the #MeToo movement is not exempt from criticism, those who call it as a \u201cmoral panic\u201d are misdiagnosing it. What #MeToo is a social movement that finally holds powerful men accountable for their actions; as author David Perry writes, #MeToo is not an act of persecution, but rather a rebellion against the powers that persecute. In order for our culture to change and in order for future generations to grow up in an equitable world, we must build on #MeToo as a vehicle for reform in our courts, workplaces and schools. It is a wake-up call and an opportunity to inspire genuine change \u2014 an opportunity that we cannot waste.Works CitedBeck, Richard. \u201c#MeToo Is Not a Witch Hunt.\u201d Vox. 11 Jan. 2018.Bennett, Jessica. \u201cThe #MeToo Moment: No Longer Complicit.\u201d The New York Times. 7 Dec. 2017.Campbell, Alexia Fernandez. \u201cHow the Legal System Fails Victims of Sexual Harassment.\u201d Vox. 30 March 2018.Garcia, Sandra. \u201cThe Woman Who Created #MeToo Long Before the Hashtag.\u201d The New York Times. 20 Oct. 2017.Golshan, Tara. \u201cStudy Finds 75 Percent of Workplace Harassment Victims Experienced Retaliation When They Spoke Up.\u201d Vox. 15 Oct. 2017.Gorman, Michele. \u201c1 in 4 Women Experienced Sexual Assault in College, Survey Finds.\u201d Newsweek. 21 Sept. 2015.Guerra, Cristela. \u201cWhere\u2019d the \u2018Me Too\u2019 Initiative Really Come From?

It remains difficult, perhaps impossible, to predict who will commit suicide, and the phenomenon is extremely difficult for researchers to study.One of the few proven interventions is unpalatable to wide swaths of the American public: reduced access to guns. The C.D.C. report found that the states where rates rose most sharply were those, like Montana and Oklahoma, where gun ownership is more common.It is predominantly men who use guns to commit suicide, and men are much less likely to seek help than women.The escalating suicide rate is a profound indictment of the country\u2019s mental health system. Most people who kill themselves have identifiable psychiatric symptoms, even if they never get an official diagnosis.The rise in suicide rates has coincided over the past two decades with a vast increase in the number of Americans given a diagnosis of depression or anxiety, and treated with medication.But if treatment is so helpful, why hasn\u2019t its expansion halted or reversed suicide trends?\u201cThis is the question I\u2019ve been wrestling with: Are we somehow causing increased morbidity and mortality with our interventions?\u201d said Dr. Thomas Insel, former director of the National Institute of Mental Health and now president of Mindstrong Health, which makes technology to monitor people with mental health problems.\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Dr. Insel continued. \u201cI think the increase in demand for the services is so huge that the expansion of treatment thus far is simply insufficient to make a dent in what is a huge social change.\u201dDrug trials and other randomized studies are virtually useless for capturing measurable effects on suicide. Most drug trials explicitly exclude subjects deemed a suicide risk; even when they don\u2019t, the studies don\u2019t last long enough to say anything definitive about who commits suicide.Using detailed medical records, the investigators studied more than 5,500 people who had been treated for deliberate self-harm, including cutting and clear suicide attempts.Over decades, the portion of those people who got psychotherapy at suicide clinics were about 30 percent less likely to die or commit further self-harm than those who did not.\u201cI personally think that it\u2019s the quality of care that matters, not the quantity,\u201d Dr. Insel said. \u201cWe need more access, better measures and better quality of care.\u201dBut in this country, many of those who commit suicide have received little or no professional help. Indeed, they rarely tell anyone beforehand of their plan \u2014 when there is one. Often the act is impulsive.According to Matthew Nock, a professor of psychology at Harvard, the wide majority of people who die by suicide \u201cexplicitly deny suicidal thoughts or intentions in their last communications before dying.\u201dAndrew Spade, Ms. Spade\u2019s husband, said she had seemed fine when he\u2019d talked to her just before her suicide. Mr. Bourdain was filming one of his clever, humorous shows in Strasbourg, France, when his body was discovered.The rise of suicide turns a dark mirror on modern American society: its racing, fractured culture; its flimsy mental health system; and the desperation of so many individual souls, hidden behind the waves of smiling social media photos and cute emoticons.Some experts fear that suicide is simply becoming more acceptable. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard idea to test, but it\u2019s possible that a cultural script may be developing among some segments of our population,\u201d said Julie Phillips, a sociologist at Rutgers.Prohibitions are apparently loosening in some quarters, she said. Particularly among younger people, Dr. Phillips said, \u201cWe are seeing somewhat more tolerant attitudes toward suicide.\u201dIn surveys, younger respondents are more likely than older ones \u201cto believe we have the right to die under certain circumstances, like incurable disease, bankruptcy, or being tired of living,\u201d she said.The cultural currents that deepen despair and increase the chances of suicide have long been staples of sociological debate.The social scientists Christopher Lasch and Robert Putnam identified postwar influences that have corroded the fabric of local everyday life \u2014 the block parties, church meetings, family barbecues and civic groups that once bound people against solitude and abandonment.The aggressive marketing of opioids by Purdue Pharma and others eased some of that pain \u2014 and helped create a generation of addicts, tens of thousands of whom die each year. Opioids are the third most common drugs found in the systems of suicides, after alcohol and anti-anxiety medications like Xanax, the C.D.C. reported.A decline in marriage rates has likely played a role, as well. In her research, Dr. Phillips has found that in 2005 single middle-aged women were as much as 2.8 times more likely to kill themselves than married women, and their single male peers 3.5 times more likely than married men to do the same.\u201cIn contrast to homicide and traffic safety and other public health issues, there\u2019s no one accountable, no one whose job it is to prevent these deaths \u2014 no one who gets fired if these numbers go from 45,000 to 50,000,\u201d Dr. Insel said.\u201cIt\u2019s shameful. We would never tolerate that in other areas of public health and medicine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If that happens, the economy will be in a position to draw on those unused resources and keep growing without overheating. That would allow the Fed to raise rates more slowly than it otherwise would. If there aren\u2019t people outside of the labor market ready to enter, the Fed could raise rates more aggressively.

{"Headline": "Putin Sees an Opening in Europe\u2019s Fury With Trump", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived in Austria on Tuesday sensing an opportunity almost unimaginable just months ago: to overhaul frosty relations with a European Union infuriated by President Trump on a host of issues, from climate and Iran to, most recently, tariffs and trade.Never mind that Mr. Putin was until recently virtually a pariah in Europe after his military interventions in Ukraine, Crimea and Syria; after meddling in European elections and working hard to foment right-wing populist uprisings throughout the Continent; after polluting the political environment with fake news; and after allegedly poisoning a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain, charges Russia denies.Mr. Putin was now gaining considerable traction by casting himself as a reliable friend and trading partner to Europe even as the Trump administration was treating its closest allies there as strategic and economic competitors.Though careful not to gloat, Mr. Putin had to take great satisfaction in the recent turn of events. Often dismissed as a tactician and opportunist, he was looking more like a grand strategist as Mr. Trump bluntly rejected European demands for an exemption from what Brussels considers illegal and unilateral tariffs on steel and aluminum.Populist, Russophile parties are in power in Greece, Hungary, Italy and Austria. The prospect of attaining Mr. Putin\u2019s immediate goal of throwing off economic sanctions imposed by the European Union over the last several years suddenly seemed within reach, even without compromise in Ukraine.Indeed, in recent days, with the G-7 meeting of the world\u2019s largest advanced economies looming, Mr. Trump has had unusually bad-tempered telephone calls on the tariff issue with both the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the British prime minister, Theresa May.The Germans and Canadians are furious about the tariffs, too. Washington justifies them even to its NATO allies on what they dismiss as the specious grounds of \u201cnational security.\u201dThese tensions will be on display this weekend at the G-7 meeting in Canada. That normally American-dominated meeting is likely to see Mr. Trump isolated on the issue of trade, six against one.Such internal divisions probably amuse Mr. Putin, who saw Russia \u201csuspended\u201d from what was the G-8 after the annexation of Crimea, but who now sees a far more welcoming landscape in Europe.Austria, officially neutral, has always had close ties to Moscow and takes over the revolving European Union presidency next month. Austria\u2019s young chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, refused to expel any Russian diplomats following the poisoning of the ex-spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter Yulia.In contrast, most other European allies and the United States readily lined up behind Britain and were quick to isolate Russia diplomatically. More than two dozen countries ejected more than 150 Russians, including people listed by their embassies and consulates as diplomats, and military and cultural attach\u00e9s.Mr. Kurz is in a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party, which in 2016 signed a partnership agreement with Mr. Putin\u2019s own United Russia Party and has called for economic sanctions to be lifted.The new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told the Italian Senate on Tuesday that it was time for \u201can opening toward Russia,\u201d which he said had \u201cstrengthened its position\u201d in various international crises. He called for lifting sanctions against Russia that he said harm \u201cRussian civil society.\u201dThe admiration of Mr. Putin is real from France\u2019s far-right National Front, too, as well as from the leftist populist government in Greece and the far-right opposition party in Germany, Alternative for Germany. And there are strong suspicions that all these parties benefit from Russian funding, according to Western intelligence agencies.In the interview with the Austrian state channel ORF, Mr. Putin said that Russia\u2019s ties to such parties were merely fraternal, with no strategic motive. Russia, he said, wants to cooperate with those who want to cooperate with Moscow.\u201cThis alone is the reason why our political parties, groups and movements have contacts at the political and party level with certain European ones, and not the wish to \u2018rock\u2019 or impede something within the European Union,\u201d he said.But Austria is clearly a friendly gateway for Moscow. Mr. Putin said that the two countries had maintained \u201cvery good and close relations,\u201d adding that Austria had traditionally been Russia\u2019s \u201ctrusted partner in Europe.\u201dMr. Kurz harks back to Austria\u2019s self-styled Cold War role as a mediator.\u201cWe want to be a bridge between East and West, and keep the lines of communication with Russia open,\u201d he has said. That has traditionally translated into a belief that dialogue is the answer to every confrontation, from the Georgian war and the annexation of Crimea to the poisoning in Britain and Russia\u2019s support for the Syrian regime.Stefan Lehne, a former Austrian diplomat, said that the Austrian sympathy for Russia is decades-long, based on the history of neutrality, economic interests, pragmatism and an \u201celement of anti-Americanism,\u201d the view that \u201call big powers behave similarly.\u201d He noted that Mr. Putin had been invited to Austria within months of the annexation of Crimea. But so far, he said, Austria has gone along with the European consensus on sanctions.But with Italy and Greece pushing to end them, that may not continue.Mr. Putin would clearly like to end his isolation. In his current term as president, Mr. Putin has two clear goals, said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research institution.\u201cFirst, to keep Russia together, and that\u2019s a helluva job, and second, to make Russia a great power again and seen to be one,\u201d Mr. Trenin said last weekend at a conference in Estonia.To accomplish those goals, however, \u201cyou need economic success.\u201d And for that, Mr. Putin needs European financing, energy markets and technology, Mr. Trenin said. Mr. Putin also wants good relations with Europe, he said, to concentrate on his real priority, which is China, a rising neighboring power with resource needs and ambitions.\u201cI do think we have to reconnect with Russia,\u201d Mr. Juncker said.Both Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Mr. Macron visited Russia at the end of May to discuss salvaging the Iran deal. And Mr. Macron complained at a conference in St. Petersburg about the damage being done to world trade \u2014 clearly alluding to Mr. Trump.Mr. Macron, the guest of honor, was particularly effusive in evoking the cultural and historical links that tie Russia to the rest of Europe.Ms. Merkel, who has few illusions about Mr. Putin and has been vital to maintaining economic sanctions against Russia, also finds herself and her country a particular target of Mr. Trump. In addition to the tariffs on steel and aluminum, which Germany can live with, he is now threatening unilateral tariffs on imported cars, which it cannot.He has also raised the prospect of tariffs on those companies involved with building Nordstream II, an energy pipeline from Russia to Germany that entirely bypasses Ukraine.Austria was the first country to import Russian energy 50 years ago, another reason for Mr. Putin\u2019s visit, and Europe now gets a third of its gas supply from Russia, a figure likely to increase.At the same time, both Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron noted the nagging sores that continue to infect relations with Moscow, including the continuing wars in Ukraine and Syria. Ms. Merkel underscored that both were impediments to better ties, and there seems little movement possible from Moscow on either front.Many European governments remain deeply concerned about Russian meddling in their internal politics, ranging from spreading false information on social media to fostering far-right opposition to trying to widen divisions among European states themselves over Russia.Still, Russia is cognizant of the fact that Mr. Trump has created a sudden opportunity for them.\u201cA battle for Russia has begun in international politics!\u201d Vladimir R. Solovyov, the host of a prime-time talk show on Russian state-run television that often reflects the government line, said on Sunday. \u201cEurope is compelled to change its policies on the fly since Trump has declared a trade war.\u201dVladimir Chizhov, the Russian ambassador to the European Union, said on Tuesday, \u201cI am closely watching how the situation evolves and when the necessary volume of political will is there \u2014 and I see this tendency \u2014 then the E.U. perhaps will take the necessary decision to change its course.\u201dSteven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow.

{"Headline": "Why Have Bank Stocks Had Such a Bad Two Weeks? A Flattening Yield Curve", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow is supposed to be a good time to be a bank.The largest lenders in the United States are enjoying ballooning profits. The Trump administration has removed rules on banks, and more deregulation is likely to come. The economy is in one of its strongest patches since the financial crisis, and the Federal Reserve is raising rates.But it would be hard to tell all that by looking at their share prices over the last two weeks.Though it was up on Thursday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Financials Index had fallen for 13 straight trading days and was off 5.9 percent over that period. The KBW Bank Index was down the same percentage. Shares of Morgan Stanley had declined 9.1 percent from June 8 through Wednesday\u2019s close, JPMorgan Chase was down 7.1 percent and Goldman was off 5.7 percent.So why are bank stocks struggling? A flattening yield curve.Over the last several years, bank shares have moved with interest rate expectations. When investors believe rates will climb, shares of banks rise as well, and vice versa. The reason for that is simple. Banks are typically more profitable in a rising rate environment, and after years of historically low rates crimping the bottom lines of banks, investors cheered any signs that rates would move higher.But it\u2019s currently a bit more complicated than that. The yield curve \u2014 basically the difference between interest rates on short-term United States government bonds and long-term government bonds \u2014 is often considered a good proxy for the profitability on bank lending. Usually, long-term interest rates are higher than short-term ones. Because banks borrow at the short end and lend at the long end, the greater the difference between the two, the more profitable bank lending can be.But the yield curve is currently flattening. The spread between two-year and 10-year United States Treasury notes is at its narrowest level in more than a decade.And that could bite into the margins of banks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our International Report Becomes a Bit More Modern", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBULLETIN BOARDJournals have long been a way for The Times\u2019s foreign correspondents to bring readers with them as they explore a distant land. But they have needed a reboot, our international editor writes.For at least three decades, The New York Times\u2019s international report included a feature called a Journal. The idea was to add variety to coverage generally focused on daily, often crisis-driven, news. The Journal was a place for our correspondents to bring readers with them to a fun or interesting spot in the world. It was a chance to write with voice and style.But the Journal was conceived in a print era, when storytelling was limited to what worked in ink and paper.These days, the report that rolls off the presses is still a big part of our identity, but even the most casual reader knows that when Times reporters and editors want to tell a story now, they have a lot more than just paper and ink to choose from. With so many new ways for us to do our job, we decided it was time to bring the Journal into the modern era. We are maintaining its mission, but expanding its form. We\u2019re also giving it a new name: \u201cDispatches.\u201d If that sounds a little less sedate, even a bit urgent, that is what we are aiming for. We want to give readers a sense of being there on the ground with us.A Dispatch can still be a traditional written story, like this Delhi Journal about that city\u2019s wintertime sleep economy by Ellen Barry:Or this Venice Journal by Jason Horowitz about that city being overrun by tourists:But it can also be what we call a tap-through, like this piece by Chris Buckley on the river where China meets North Korea:Or a story that uses photos to help drive the narrative, like one Sergey Ponomarev did on young men and wrestling in Dagestan or the one Bryan Denton did on coal pollution in Mongolia:Or maybe a video-only piece like this gripping report about ambulances working in Gaza during the recent protests: Dispatches will include what you might think of as a Reporter\u2019s Notebook, in which writers reveal a bit about themselves as they report the news. The idea here is not to put our correspondents center stage but to let them draw on their personal experiences \u2014 in a way the old, buttoned-down Times might once have frowned on \u2014 to help readers better understand the world. Now, we are asking our correspondents to consider occasionally breaking through that fourth wall to tell readers what is going through their minds as they work, the way Hannah Beech did with her tremendously powerful Times Insider piece about what it\u2019s like to cover the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh:We have already begun rolling out a few Dispatches, like this piece from a ship on the Andaman Sea looking to rescue Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in Myanmar:We will formally launch this initiative on Wednesday.In 1995, Bill Keller, then the foreign editor, wrote a memo to the staff saying what he was looking for in Journals. \u201cThis is the place for the story you know would most delight your family in a letter home, or your friends over a beer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you should feel free to relax in the telling of it.\u201d The main requirements, Bill said, are that a Journal convey \u201ca strong sense of place\u201d and that it be \u201cwritten from beginning to end.\u201dWe want the same from our new Dispatches \u2014 even if many of them will no longer be \u201cwritten\u201d in the old-school sense.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Secretive Investor in Triple Crown Contender Justify: George Soros", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWinStar Farm, one of North America\u2019s leading thoroughbred racing and breeding operations, owns 60 percent of Justify\u2019s breeding rights. China Horse Club owns 25 percent. A third group, a secretive entity that holds the remaining 15 percent, will remain out of the spotlight because it vigorously avoids any public attention. It is a company controlled by top employees of the billionaire investor George Soros.Mr. Soros\u2019s connection to Justify, which was not previously reported, has garnered little notice in the sport despite the horse\u2019s rousing success in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes because his group tries to operate almost invisibly. Several officials, who sit atop one of the biggest owners in stallion equity in the world, declined to comment about Mr. Soros\u2019s involvement in horse racing through his fund.Mr. Soros\u2019s investment firm, Soros Fund Management, is behind SF Bloodstock and SF Racing Group, an international breeding and racing operation started in 2008. Executives from the investment firm oversee the breeding and horse ownership businesses. Gavin Murphy, an Australian based in New York who has served as the Soros Fund\u2019s longtime tax counsel, is the manager of SF Bloodstock and SF Racing Group. Christopher Naunton, chief financial officer for the Soros Fund\u2019s family office, is the president of SF Bloodstock and SF Racing Group, corporate filings show. Tom Ryan, an Irishman based in Lexington, Ky., is the team\u2019s bloodstock agent.SF, which is also a part-owner of Newgate Farm in Australia, has breeding stock in the United States, Australia, England, Ireland and France. It could not be determined how much money Mr. Soros\u2019s firm has committed to the horse racing business.SF Bloodstock, which according to court filings is owned by SF Agricultural Holdings L.L.C., employs a for-profit model and focuses on the breeding side of the industry, purchasing stallions, or shares in them, and broodmares while selling yearlings at auction. In 2015, it entered into a three-year partnership with WinStar Farm and China Horse Club that allowed them to spend big while spreading risk at yearling and 2-year-old sales. That is how the group partly acquired Justify and the third-place Kentucky Derby finisher Audible, but it quickly sold its racing rights in those horses to Head of Plains Partners and Starlight Racing.\u201cTo me, and the couple guys that I do this with, it\u2019s more fun to be in the winner\u2019s circle when Justify wins the Derby holding the trophy,\u201d said Sol Kumin, a hedge fund executive who runs Head of Plains. \u201cSo you kind of have to pick. If this became my full-time job, which it won\u2019t, I would have a different program, focusing more on the stallion business and breeding. Now we still want to make money, and so far we\u2019ve done well, but it\u2019s hard.\u201dBut Winstar\u2019s president and chief executive, Elliott Walden, said a deal had not yet been completed. The partners might wait until September, when it will have owned Justify for two years, to complete a deal so they become eligible for the lower tax rates associated with capital gains.Henry Field, head of SF\u2019s Newgate Farm, and Eden Harrington, vice president of China Horse Club, are graduates of the Darley Flying Start program, a management and leadership training initiative for the industry, and have each worked for Coolmore.American Pharoah, who in 2015 became the first horse in 37 years to sweep the Triple Crown, stands at Coolmore\u2019s farm in Versailles, Ky., in the spring. He then shuttles to its Australian farm for the fall breeding season. In the past couple years in the United States, he was commanding about $200,000 per live foal that stands and nurses. Producing an average of 150 live foals from the breeding season in Kentucky, American Pharoah is racking up more than $35 million in stallion fees there. He commands about $50,000 per live foal in Australia.WinStar, meanwhile, stands American Pharoah\u2019s sire, Pioneerof the Nile, for $110,000 and will likely add Audible, the Florida Derby winner, to the mix.Bradley Weisbord, who runs BSW Bloodstock, which manages Mr. Kumin\u2019s stable along with several others, said that while a deal had not been completed, from an industry perspective, it made sense.\u201cKenny Troutt has always run his WinStar Farm as a business,\u201d he said of the owner of WinStar who made his fortune from a long-distance phone company that used a multilevel marketing approach. \u201cOn the flip side, Coolmore has always wanted the best.\u201dHe continued: \u201cSure it\u2019s probably a tough decision for him, and he\u2019s probably going through it thinking, Do I sell or do I keep him, but WinStar, SF, China Horse Club, they are traders, and there is a number where it becomes the perfect bloodstock deal, and that is when the buyers and the sellers both walk away with a smile on their face.\u201dMr. Soros is one of the world\u2019s most successful investors, who may be best-known for his bet in 1992 against the fortunes of the British pound. Mr. Soros is said to have made more than $1 billion by shorting the pound \u2014 a move that cemented his reputation as one of the shrewdest currency traders.In recent years, he\u2019s become better known for his support of philanthropic activities, and in particular, his financial support to liberal and progressive causes. He personally has given tens of billions of dollars to support the work of the Open Society Foundations, which he formed more than 30 years ago to support efforts to promote freedom of expression and human rights in 120 countries.For decades, Mr. Soros was one of the more successful hedge fund managers \u2014 investing billions of dollars for wealthy individuals and institutions. Soros\u2019s firm has spawned the careers of a number of other famous investors, but in 2011, he decided to shut down his then 42-year-old hedge fund and convert into a family office to mainly manage money for himself and his family. The move has rendered the investing decisions of the firm, which controls about $26 billion in assets, more opaque than ever as it is no longer answerable to outside investors.But the fund continues to actively invest in stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies. The firm is also known for making significant private equity style investments and sinking money into more esoteric investment strategies and assets, like distressed sovereign debt, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and art.Mr. Soros was an early investor in China, investing $25 million in a stake in China\u2019s Hainan Airlines, a regional carrier in southern China that had the backing of the Hainan government and sought to bring in foreign money in 1995. In the past, Mr. Soros has had outspoken views about China that have upset the political leadership. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in 2016, Mr. Soros compared China\u2019s economy to the United States\u2019 before the 2008 financial crisis. China\u2019s leaders have also grown wary of the work and money that Mr. Soros has spent promoting democracy in politically unstable countries like Hungary.He will almost certainly not be seen at Belmont Park on Saturday, when all eyes turn to Justify\u2019s bid to become the 13th Triple Crown winner in a sport that has experienced a profound shift in recent years, with a rise in splashy partnerships and an influx of overseas money.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of new people getting involved in the business, buying horses,\u201d said Bob Baffert, the trainer of Justify and American Pharoah, referring specifically to the effect of Pharoah\u2019s Triple Crown achievement. \u201cPrices have gone up, and everybody wants quality. You\u2019re getting money from the Middle East, you\u2019re getting it from Europe, China. You know, I think it\u2019s really boosted the business at the top level.

{"Headline": "The N.B.A.\u2019s Decider: How LeBron James Controls Fortunes", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeBron James reportedly informed the Cleveland Cavaliers, his current employer, on Friday that he was exercising his option to become a free agent rather than remaining under his current contract for another year.The decision vigorously revived an annual phenomenon in the N.B.A. that is unknown to every other sports league: One person grabs hold of the collective psyche of fans, team officials and even civic leaders, single-handedly in control of their fortunes.If James decides to join your team, you are instantly an N.B.A. title contender, and your city feels the lift. If James decides to leave your team, you are the Jackson 5 after Michael left the band, or \u201cThe West Wing\u201d after Aaron Sorkin\u2019s departure \u2014 looked up to fondly with nostalgia but otherwise obsolete.James, 33, has successfully turned the high-stakes drama of free agency into his own reality show. He is the N.B.A.\u2019s best player and its most captivating presence. He is also one of its savviest power brokers, and he has developed a summer ritual of holding the rest of the N.B.A. and entire metropolitan areas in a state of expectancy as he weighs his options every July.\u201cThis one guy not only controls the league, but part of our economy, too,\u201d said Jason Herron, 45, a longtime Cavaliers season ticket-holder and the general manager of a car dealership.Herron said he recently talked to a bar owner in downtown Cleveland who told Herron that he might have to lay off part of his staff next winter if James leaves town.\u201cIt\u2019s been a heck of a ride,\u201d Herron said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want it to end.\u201dBasketball is different from other team sports. The Los Angeles Angels can have Mike Trout, the best player in baseball, and still be thoroughly mediocre because he gets only four or five at-bats a game. An N.F.L. team can sign a star quarterback and still fall short of making the playoffs because he cannot throw the ball to himself, and he won\u2019t be on the field to play defense.But when free-agent maneuvers involve the very top tier of N.B.A. players, those players\u2019 decisions can have an outsize impact on individual teams, the league more broadly and even entire cities.Kevin Durant is one of the more famous examples. Since he jumped to Golden State in 2016, the Warriors have won two straight championships. Without him, the Oklahoma City Thunder, the team he departed, have not won a playoff series.Players like James, Durant and precious few others forge title contenders \u2014 which means higher ticket and merchandise sales, higher TV ratings, more tourists coming to see the show, more international media exposure for the city.It is technically the off-season for the N.B.A., which means that all the players have dispersed for the summer. No practices, and no games. But the superstar sweepstakes of free agency create a strange rhythm for the league, which finds out in the summer which teams are going to be world-beaters next season \u2014 and which ones will be sent spiraling into competitive oblivion for the foreseeable future.When that superstar sweepstakes involves James, a four-time most valuable player who is capable of dominating games \u2014 and who has continually kept the pressure on the Cavaliers to upgrade their roster in recent seasons by signing a series of short contracts \u2014 the effect is multiplied many times over.A team with James is an instant title contender. A team without James \u2014 well, you better have a collection of All-Stars already on the roster.Cleveland is uniquely familiar with both sides of this equation. James, who grew up just outside the city in Akron, spent the first seven seasons of his career with the Cavaliers and led them deep into the playoffs his final five seasons. But in a made-for-TV spectacle known as \u201cThe Decision,\u201d James announced that he was joining the Miami Heat in 2010. This was the first Summer of LeBron \u2014 the first time he was capable of holding sway over the league as a free agent, and it quickly became clear just how much power he wielded.With James, the Heat went on to win two championships. Without him, the Cavaliers were left in ruins, a perennial resident of the draft lottery as one of the worst teams in the league.The Cavaliers\u2019 fortunes dramatically reversed course when James returned in 2014. Four straight trips to the finals followed, including the franchise\u2019s first and only championship in 2016. For three of those seasons, James teamed with Kyrie Irving, a perennial All-Star, to form one of the league\u2019s most fearsome duos.But the dynamics changed last summer when Irving asked for a trade \u2014 in part so he could escape James\u2019s shadow. The Cavaliers sent Irving to the Boston Celtics.In his absence, the Cavaliers labored last season to find their footing, even as James played some of his finest basketball. He averaged 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds and 9.1 assists a game while shooting 54.2 percent from the field. He also played in all 82 regular-season games for the first time in his career.\u201cEvery G.M. and every president and every coaching staff is trying to figure out how they can make up the right matchups to compete for a championship,\u201d he said at the time.He might as well have included himself. Nobody in the league is capable of exerting greater influence on teams \u2014 and the moves they make, either directly or indirectly \u2014 than James, who recently decamped with his family to Anguilla, a British territory in the Caribbean. For all the agita swirling around him, James has seemed very chill. On Thursday night, he shared a video clip of himself on his Instagram account, which has nearly 40 million followers: He was jumping off a cliff, presumably into a warm body of water below.For the breathless masses who are curious about James\u2019s future \u2014 and those masses include friends and rivals, coaches and executives, fans and haters \u2014 the clip has been parsed with forensic detail: What does it mean? Was he offering some sort of coded message? A metaphor about taking the plunge with a new team?Or maybe he just wanted to go for a swim. The real news will come soon enough, and James, as usual, will be the one making it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Affordable Housing Is Your Spare Bedroom", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Lind is an urban policy specialist working on a book on alternatives to the single-family home.Cities from New York to San Francisco are having a tough time trying to create enough affordable housing for the hundreds of thousands of people who need it. To expand affordable housing in these places where land and construction costs are high, we need to disrupt the model of single-family homes and bring back rooming houses and other shared living arrangements.Until World War II, American cities teemed with single-room-occupancy houses and hotels that served as de facto apartment rentals. In the 1930 census, 11.4 percent of urban families reported that they housed boarders. Many more families included grandparents and older relatives. These shared housing options let more people, more cheaply, enjoy a city\u2019s amenities.Over the past 75 years, however, many of these options have been made illegal through zoning laws that prioritize single-family housing. New norms of privacy, and a cultural shift in which shared spaces in cities became equated with demoralization and depravity, also helped put an end to these styles of living.But now people are rediscovering shared housing and reaping its rewards, whether out of financial necessity, a gig-economy tendency toward transience or a preference for a more communal experience. This may be a way for cities to provide more affordable housing at lower cost.Since 2006, only 82 rooming houses have legally been registered in Philadelphia, yet housing inspectors conducted more than 500 investigations because of neighbor complaints of suspected rooming houses. By legalizing rooming houses, potentially hundreds of housing units can come out of shadows and tenants can benefit from the safeguards that come with landlords\u2019 required compliance.It\u2019s clear that some forward-thinking local governments get it, but they are more the exception than the rule. And they are mostly putting forward piecemeal solutions, not a much needed paradigm shift for housing.These moves exemplify the current approach to creating affordable housing: finding ways to circumvent housing price increases or subsidize housing, rather than facilitating the ways that more people can live together and thereby lower their own housing costs.An alternative approach would be to allocate short-term-rental licenses only to units where a permanent resident remains in place, thereby returning Airbnb to its roots as \u201chome sharing\u201d instead of as a platform for landlords to rent to vacationers.It\u2019s true that research based on outcomes in New York has shown that there\u2019s an \u201cAirbnb effect\u201d that causes increased housing costs. But it fails to consider other factors, like the escalating demands of the tourism industry that cities like New York and New Orleans so heavily promote.It seems irrational for a city to believe that it can bring in millions more tourists each year, yet expect that by restricting the supply of accommodations, it will make itself more affordable.But this is the kind of build-and-restrict, stoke-and-stanch game cities too often play with housing supply and demand. And it\u2019s coming at residents\u2019 cost.Luckily for cities, a font of affordable housing already exists. It\u2019s in the wasted spaces of single-family homes \u2014 spare bedrooms, backyards and the millions of square feet occupied by redundant bathrooms and kitchens that could instead be zoned as shared space. Let\u2019s take advantage of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. Says New Wave of Trump Tariffs Could Force U.S. Job Cuts", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeneral Motors warned Friday that if President Trump pushed ahead with another wave of tariffs, the move could backfire, leading to \u201cless investment, fewer jobs and lower wages\u201d for its employees.The president has promoted tariffs as a way to protect American businesses and workers, aiming at dozens of nations with metal tariffs, as well as bringing broader levies against Chinese goods. But companies, which rely on other markets for sales, production and materials, have been increasingly vocal about the potential damage from his policies.A G.M. spokeswoman, Dayna Hart, said that the company had no contingency plans calling for job cuts, but that such a move was \u201csomething that could happen.\u201d\u201cWe are still assessing the impact,\u201d she added.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cConsumers are already facing headwinds in credit and average prices going up,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you add a tariff, my guess is a lot of people just won\u2019t buy new cars.\u201dThe increasingly global nature of automotive supply chains has left manufacturers especially exposed.\u201cIt\u2019s contingency planning on a massive scale \u2014 supply-based planning, logistics planning, vehicle-build location planning,\u201d Mr. Lee told Bloomberg on Thursday. \u201cThis is not trivial, and it\u2019s been going on for awhile.\u201dG.M. and its chief executive, Mary T. Barra, have been at odds before with the Trump administration.In criticizing prospective auto tariffs, G.M. played heavily on its position as one of the country\u2019s largest employers. The company said it had 47 manufacturing locations, 25 service-part facilities and 110,000 employees in the United States, where it conducts most of its research and development, design, engineering and other work.G.M. suggested that additional tariffs would put American companies at a disadvantage in the midst of a \u201cfast-paced transportation revolution led by cutting-edge technologies.\u201d Its investments in jobs and operations at home, the carmaker said, are critical to this effort. \u201cThe economic fortitude of companies like ours directly supports the economic strength of the nation, which, in turn, contributes to the security posture of the United States,\u201d the company said.The Commerce Department will hold public hearings in a few weeks on the auto tariffs, before it releases the results of its investigation. The government said it had received 2,500 comments already and expected more by the deadline on Friday.\u201cThe purpose of the comment period,\u201d the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said in a statement, was \u201cto make sure that all stakeholders\u2019 views are heard, both pro and con.\u201d\u201cThat will enable us to make our best informed recommendation to the president,\u201d he added.In a highly intertwined, global car industry, a trade war can play out in unexpected and costly ways. American automakers, which export an estimated two million vehicles, increasingly rely on global sales as a buffer in tough times. Retaliatory tariffs from Europe or China could weaken their overseas business.\u201cThe deeper the economic ties from trade and integrated value chains, the more costly conflict would be, and therefore the more unlikely it is to occur,\u201d BMW said.Toyota wrote in its submission to the Commerce Department that the cost of its popular Camry sedan would rise $1,800 if subject to new tariffs. The car is built in Kentucky while sourcing 30 percent of its materials from abroad.The Japanese automaker said that the tariff, if approved, would be terribly timed. The auto industry is at a vulnerable point in its sales cycle, exiting a long stretch of record growth and heading into a period of weaker demand.The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a Washington-based trade group that represents foreign and American companies, was more specific.Neal E.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.In antitrust lingo, this deal represents a classic example of vertical integration: The companies have a \u201cvertical\u201d relationship where one company \u2014 Time Warner\u2019s networks and studios \u2014 supplies the other \u2014 AT&T\u2019s distribution operations. However, the two companies\u2019 main businesses do not compete with each other and so a merger would not reduce the number of competitors in any particular market.Those Comcast-style provisions have appeared reasonably effective. Neither Comcast nor AT&T nor any other old-school media or telecommunications company has been able to hold back the relentless march of internet video behemoths like Amazon, Netflix and YouTube. In fact, the tech giants\u2019 media operations are already vertically integrated; Amazon and Netflix spend billions of dollars a year developing video content and then distributing it themselves through different systems and services.Mr. Delrahim could have pursued such conditions with AT&T and Time Warner. Unwisely, he didn\u2019t. The big risk in the government\u2019s litigation strategy was that if it lost, AT&T could acquire Time Warner without any such pro-consumer provisions at all. That is exactly what is happening.The rule of law is at least as important in business as it is in politics. As Tuesday\u2019s ruling potentially unleashes a new round of corporate consolidation \u2014 on Wednesday, Comcast made a bid for 21st Century Fox assets that Disney already has a deal to buy \u2014 the most important concern remains insulating the application of antitrust law and competition policy from the whims of partisans.Consumers and the vitality of the economy\u2019s most dynamic sectors depend on it.This editorial has been updated.Advertisement"}

But the electoral success of that strategy has previously been modest \u2014 and more important, the party has paid insufficient attention to the substantial policy costs of turning moderate and affluent suburbs blue. Democrats cannot cater to white swing voters in affluent suburbs and also promote policies that fundamentally challenge income inequality, exclusionary zoning, housing segregation, school inequality, police brutality and mass incarceration.To explain the realignment of American politics and the migration of working-class whites to the Republican Party, observers usually focus on how politicians from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump have exploited white backlash against racial and cultural liberalism.The flip side of this is the deliberate, long-term strategy by the Democratic Party to favor the financial interests and social values of affluent white suburban families and high-tech corporations over the priorities of unions and the economic needs of middle-income and poor residents of all races. It\u2019s no coincidence that the bluer that suburban counties turn, the more unequal and economically stratified they become as well \u2014 a dynamic evident along Route 128 outside of Boston, in the once solidly Republican suburbs of Connecticut and New Jersey, in boom regions such as Atlanta and Denver, and along the West Coast from Seattle to San Diego.Democrats haven\u2019t paid enough attention to the substantial policy costs of turning affluent suburbs blue. That focus has failed to reverse the downward mobility of middle-income households and openly favored upscale communities without addressing economic and racial inequality.The Democratic fixation on upscale white suburbs also distorts policies and diverts resources that could generate higher turnout among nonwhite voting blocs that are crucial to the party\u2019s fortunes and too often taken for granted. It should not be that hard for liberalism to challenge the Republican tax scheme to redistribute income upward, and build on Mr. Obama\u2019s important but inadequate health care reform, with policy solutions that address the real diversity of American suburbia.That strategy would embrace a broad economic platform promoted by progressives like Elizabeth Warren and Stacey Abrams in her race for governor in Georgia.Democratic strategists seem unable to understand why Mr. Trump carried the upper Midwest or why Hillary Clinton\u2019s suburban strategy generated such unenthusiastic turnout among nonwhite voters. A political agenda fixated on turning affluent suburbs blue is capable of building neither a stable long-term majority nor a policy blueprint worthy of the progressive mantle.Lily Geismer, an associate professor of history at Claremont McKenna College, is the author of \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Us: Suburban Liberals and the Transformation of the Democratic Party.\u201d Matthew D.

{"Headline": "Why Aren\u2019t More Men Working?", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewBut that number hides a perplexing anomaly: The percentage of men who are neither working nor looking for work has risen substantially over the past several decades.The issue, in economist\u2019s jargon, is labor force participation. When the Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys households, every adult is put into one of three categories. Those who have a job are employed. Those who are not working but are searching for a job are unemployed. Those who are neither working nor looking for work are counted as out of the labor force.This last group is ignored when calculating the unemployment rate. The presumption is that if a person without a job isn\u2019t looking for one, then he or she doesn\u2019t want one, and the joblessness is not a problem. But is that really accurate?In 1950, only 4 percent of prime-age men were not working or looking for work. Today, that figure is 11 percent.Why has that number nearly tripled?Compounding these trends is international trade, which can have much the same effects as technology. Whether an American manufacturing worker is replaced by a robot or a Chinese worker, the result is the same: job displacement. (The benefit to consumers \u2014 lower prices \u2014 is the same, too.) If the jobs that remain available are much less attractive than the one a worker just lost, he may give up looking.It is an open question how policymakers should respond, or whether they should at all. The decision to look for work is a personal one, and in a free society people will naturally make different choices. Yet it is troubling that rising nonparticipation is most pronounced for those at the bottom of the economic ladder.One step in the right direction would be to expand opportunity by increasing educational attainment and skills training. Doing so would help expand opportunity, as well as address many other problems facing the economy. But that is easier said than done.Spending more on education might help, but is a tough political sell. And improving the educational system could require not just more money, but fundamental reforms that are hotly contested by the various stakeholders.The data on labor force participation show that the economy is changing in profound and disquieting ways.

{"Headline": "Five Takeaways From Turkey\u2019s Election", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFormerly prime minister, Mr. Erdogan was elected president in 2014 and, after a failed coup in 2016, persuaded voters to change the Constitution to transform the once-ceremonial job into a position with executive control of the government. Sunday\u2019s election signaled a new era for Turkey, a pivotal country straddling Europe and the Middle East.Here is where Turkey stands after the election.In practice, however, the nature of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s role will change little, since he already informally exerted far more power than his position had technically allowed, said Howard Eissenstat, a Turkey specialist at St. Lawrence University.For instance, Mr. Erdogan has led cabinet meetings since 2015, even though that is usually the prerogative of the prime minister. And few judges have dared to issue judgments unfavorable to Mr. Erdogan, particularly since the start of a purge of the judiciary that has led to the dismissal of around a quarter of all judges since 2016.\u201cI don\u2019t see this as revolutionary,\u201d said Mr. Eissenstat. \u201cIt codifies and solidifies something that\u2019s been underway for a decade.\u201dWith more than 86 percent of Turks participating, the vote was considered free. But international observers said it took place in circumstances that had clearly favored Mr. Erdogan.One of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s leading challengers, Selahattin Demirtas, was forced to conduct his campaign from prison because he had been jailed on politicized charges nearly two years ago, along with several of his lawmakers.And since the election took place under a state of emergency, severe restrictions impinged on the opposition\u2019s ability to hold rallies and protests.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s recent economic interventions helped to cause a loss in the lira\u2019s value \u2014 and the currency problem could worsen now that he has been returned to office.For most of his time in power, Mr. Erdogan had a reputation for strong economic management, partly because of spectacular economic growth under his watch during the 2000s.But his economic reputation weakened in May, when Mr. Erdogan threatened to take greater control of Turkey\u2019s central bank if he won re-election, a move that frightened investors, and caused the lira to plummet, and the price of food to rise.Since voters failed to punish him for his intervention, Mr. Erdogan may now feel emboldened to follow through on his promise \u2014 which would be \u201ca disaster for the lira, inflation and those invested in debt,\u201d said Emre Deliveli, a financial consultant and former columnist for the English-language Hurriyet Daily News. \u201cWe are going to have a huge economic crisis one way or another.\u201dMr. Erdogan\u2019s victory is problematic for Turkey\u2019s allies in Europe and the United States.When he first came to power in 2003, Mr. Erdogan brought Turkey closer to Europe \u2014 by accelerating membership negotiations with the European Union \u2014 and sought a historic settlement with the country\u2019s Kurdish minority. But to maintain the support of nationalist voters in recent years, he has increasingly picked fights with European politicians, led a campaign of repression in Kurdish areas, and \u2014 to the frustration of the United States, drawn increasingly close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.These dynamics are likely to be compounded by the election result, said Marc Pierini, a former European Union ambassador to Turkey.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s victory was partly the outcome of his alliance with a far-right party, the Nationalist Movement Party, with anti-Western and anti-Kurdish views Mr. Erdogan must continue to accommodate.\u201cAll of this plays into the hands of Putin,\u201d said Mr. Pierini, now a fellow at Carnegie Europe, a Brussels-based research group.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s victory is also bad news for the American-backed Syrian Kurdish forces that have carved out an independent enclave in northern Syria, along Turkey\u2019s southern border, which Mr. Erdogan regards as a threat to Turkish security. Emboldened by his victory, Mr. Erdogan may see no reason to abandon his strategy of chasing the Syrian Kurds away from key areas of northern Syria, said Mr. Pierini.The unusually spirited performance of the opposition in such tough circumstances either bodes well for them in the future \u2014 or highlights the futility of running against Mr. Erdogan in such biased circumstances.Muharrem Ince, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s closest rival in the presidential race, won plaudits for engaging in an inclusive and feisty campaign \u2014 and may now have enough momentum to start a new movement, said Halil Karaveli, a Turkey analyst and author of the book \u201cWhy Turkey is Authoritarian.\u201d\u201cTurkey is heavily polarized, but he is interested in reaching out the Kurds and the religious conservatives,\u201d Mr. Karaveli said. \u201cIf he plays his cards well he is the man for the future.\u201dBut other analysts were more pessimistic, and questioned whether the opposition should continue to legitimize a rigged system by taking part in elections.\u201cIf basic civil liberties and basic rules of law are not being respected, they should not contribute to the illusion that Turkey is a real democracy,\u201d said Mr. Eisensstat. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to consider whether they want to continue to facilitate the status quo in the hopes that at some point new realities emerge \u2014 or call attention to the way that those democratic norms have been hollowed out.\u201dPatrick Kingsley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Now the Nation Is Paying the Price.", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRETORIA, South Africa \u2014 The nation\u2019s tax chief steeled himself. Chiding and pleading with President Jacob Zuma to get him to file his taxes \u2014 much less pay the full amount \u2014 was always an excruciating task.And it kept getting worse. One of the president\u2019s sons, a nephew and countless business allies had serious tax problems as well, four former senior officials said, alarming investigators and leaving them wondering what to do.South Africa\u2019s young democracy had depended on the faith \u2014 and taxes \u2014 of its people since the end of apartheid, so the risks were evident. If the leader of the African National Congress, his relatives and his influential associates could dodge their tax duties, the rest of the country might shirk them, too, hollowing out the government\u2019s ability to function at the most basic level.The tax commissioner, Ivan Pillay, said he tried to be discreet, visiting the president several times from 2012 to 2014 to prod him to comply.\u201cIf I am in the way, just tell me and I\u2019ll go,\u201d Mr. Pillay said in a rare interview, recounting his conversations with Mr. Zuma. \u201cI won\u2019t like it, but I\u2019ll go. I\u2019m a disciplined member of the A.N.C.\u201dMr. Zuma demurred, insisting there was no need to resign, Mr. Pillay said. Instead, the president dealt with the issue himself a few months later: He abruptly replaced Mr. Pillay with a loyalist who led a sweeping purge of the tax agency, setting off a blistering national scandal that is threatening South Africa in unexpected ways.Wielding a barrage of fictitious news stories and doctored assertions by one of the world\u2019s biggest auditing firms, KPMG, Mr. Zuma managed to thwart scrutiny into his own taxes, his family\u2019s affairs and his allies\u2019 finances, according Mr. Pillay and three other former senior tax officials who confirmed the account.Then, the president and his supporters went even further. They used the upheaval at the tax agency to seize greater control over the National Treasury, further enriching themselves at enormous cost to the country, according to government officials now trying to repair the damage.The national tax agency, as prosaic as it may sound, had once been an extraordinary triumph, even for the party that helped defeat apartheid. Just a few years after it helped usher in democracy, the A.N.C. switched from liberation to the mundane workings of government and persuaded millions of South Africans to do the unimaginable: pay their taxes.\u201cWhat has happened subsequently,\u201d he added, \u201cis a very, very, very seriously sad story.\u201dSouth Africa\u2019s version of the Internal Revenue Service is perhaps an unlikely setting for a national saga involving spies, spurned lovers, secret brothels, double agents and one of the biggest journalistic scandals of the post-apartheid era.But the story shows how an increasingly corrupt A.N.C. has undermined its own successes by betraying the very people who brought it to power.And the drama is far from over. In today\u2019s South Africa \u2014 dangling precariously between dueling factions inside the A.N.C. \u2014 the nation\u2019s new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is struggling to assert his authority and fulfill his pledge to root out corruption. He now stands knee-deep in a very messy fight to wrest the tax agency from the legacy of his predecessor, Mr. Zuma, and win back the confidence of an angry nation.With corruption and political warfare gutting the agency, more and more South Africans have simply stopped paying their taxes, a dangerous turn in a nation where tens of millions depend on government services that are already enfeebled by graft and misrule. In the eyes of many experts, the government\u2019s \u2014 and the country\u2019s \u2014 ability to right itself is at stake.The dismantling of the tax agency unfolded in full view of the astonished country, squandering so much of the public\u2019s dwindling trust that officials now wonder how they will be able to restore it.Once Mr. Zuma removed Mr. Pillay as acting commissioner in late 2014, he installed an ally who had been close to the president and his family for decades. Almost immediately, explosive leaks started coming from inside the tax agency, spicing up the pages of a major South African newspaper.The articles said Mr. Pillay had approved the creation of an illegal \u201crogue unit\u201d that had planted bugs at Mr. Zuma\u2019s home to intercept his conversations.The news grew juicier by the week: Hush money was paid to a former spymaster during apartheid to keep quiet about the illegal espionage. The rogue unit even set up a brothel to go undercover, the reports claimed.As the shocking details emerged, Mr. Zuma\u2019s new tax commissioner, Tom Moyane, called on KPMG to investigate, giving it a nearly $2 million contract to uncover the truth. A year later, KPMG came back with its results, confirming widespread abuses of power.Trouble is, it\u2019s not clear any of it was true.The newspaper, The Sunday Times, later retracted its articles. KPMG was forced to publicly dismiss its own conclusions as well, admitting that it had essentially copied a memo from its client\u2019s lawyers and passed off the allegations as its own, fully investigated findings.\u201cWhoever pays the piper calls the tune, unfortunately,\u201d said Bobby Johnston, the former chairman of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange who sits on a panel now investigating KPMG.The retractions came much too late for the tax agency. Mr. Pillay and leaders of the so-called rogue unit had already resigned or been forced out, undercutting the agency\u2019s capacity to investigate and pursue tax dodgers, according to current officials and independent tax experts.Hundreds of the tax service\u2019s best employees also left during the upheaval, many going into private practice, and some to tax agencies as far away as New Zealand.Even more damaging, the lurid tales of corruption and intrigue inside what was once an A.N.C. showcase of good governance contributed to sharp drops in the nation\u2019s tax collection: more than $6 billion short of what the government had expected in the previous two budget years.The shortfalls have left the nation with fewer resources to tackle its most pressing needs \u2014 housing, education, health \u2014 in a society that has grown even more unequal under the A.N.C.And in a stinging blow to the impoverished South Africans who have voted the party into power and kept it there for decades, the gaps have forced the government to raise the value-added tax on products for the first time since the end of apartheid \u2014 a move expected to hurt poor people the most.Much of the national ire over the scandal has focused on KPMG, which helped the chaos along by rubber-stamping some explosive accusations that it could not prove. Now the firm is facing collapse in South Africa, raising withering questions about the role Western companies play in providing a sheen of legitimacy while enabling corruption.KPMG is facing two inquiries in South Africa, and a few weeks ago the country\u2019s auditor general terminated all contracts with the firm. Private banks like Barclays Africa, one of the largest on the continent, have also ended their relationship with KPMG, citing the risks to their reputations.Yet the fate of the tax agency is still up in the air. It is only one of many government institutions that have been weakened through years of infighting and corruption by the party that built them. The A.N.C. has especially chipped away at agencies and posts that hold the powerful accountable, like the national police, prosecutors and the public protector\u2019s office.The president\u2019s office has accused Mr. Moyane of meddling in the KPMG inquiry, misleading Parliament and failing to properly investigate allegations of corruption, money laundering and tax evasion by his own deputy \u2014 charges that Mr. Moyane is preparing to rebut in court.\u201cThe tragedy is that SARS was a world-class institution,\u201d said Ismail Momoniat, the National Treasury\u2019s deputy director general for tax and financial sector policy. \u201cTax collection is very critical for nation building, because it\u2019s the kind of underlying foundation for the state.\u201dFor the leader of a country that often symbolizes the historic pursuit of democracy in Africa and beyond, Mr. Zuma certainly seemed to have grown weary of it himself, current and former officials say.During one of his visits to the president, Mr. Pillay said, Mr. Zuma started off making small talk but was clearly exasperated, openly complaining about the questions lawmakers expected him to answer.\u201cHe said, \u2018Listen, I\u2019m so tired and tomorrow morning I\u2019ve got to go to Parliament,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pillay recalled Mr. Zuma saying. The president had faced volleys of outrage, especially over the lavish use of public money to upgrade his private homestead.\u201c\u2018Why must I go and answer questions in Parliament? Putin doesn\u2019t go to Parliament to answer questions,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pillay recounted Mr. Zuma saying.\u201cThat\u2019s where he was\u201d in terms of being open to scrutiny, Mr. Pillay said.On top of that, one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s sons was suspected of hiding profits from contraband cigarettes. Red flags had also emerged with a nephew\u2019s used-car business and a foundation established by one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s wives \u2014 all of which caught the attention of tax investigators, the four former officials said.Mr. Pillay insisted that he never wanted to pursue Mr. Zuma directly through a formal investigation, but that the president seemed convinced otherwise.\u201cHe got it into his head that we are monitoring him,\u201d Mr. Pillay said.During the presidency of Thabo Mbeki, people cheated, of course, but the revenue service was largely protected from political interference, Mr. Pillay said. And while party loyalists enriched themselves in many ways, he said, \u201cthere was order at the trough.\u201dBut under Mr. Zuma, especially in his second term, which began in 2014, corruption began consuming nearly every corner of government \u2014 from the national utility giant, Eskom, to provincial agricultural departments, according to parliamentary hearings and the nation\u2019s former public protector.Inevitably, the tax agency\u2019s investigations into offenders, including Mr. Zuma\u2019s relatives and business allies, encountered stronger pushback, the former officials say.\u201cAlmost every big tax evader we were after would pull a political leader,\u201d Mr. Pillay said. \u201cAll sorts of politicians were unhappy with us. It became a perfect storm,\u201d helping seal his removal as the nation\u2019s chief tax officer, he argued. He and two other former officials now face criminal charges in a case that many experts see as politically motivated.Neither Mr. Zuma nor his choice for a replacement, Mr. Moyane, agreed to be interviewed. But Mr. Moyane, a little-known development economist who had been plucked from running prisons to lead the tax agency, has strongly defended his independence.Even so, in his four years as the nation\u2019s top tax official, Mr. Moyane earned a national reputation as Mr. Zuma\u2019s hatchet man, still guided by his loyalties to A.N.C. leaders who believe in the supremacy of the party over the country.A former anti-apartheid operative as well, Mr. Moyane had known Mr. Zuma for nearly four decades. They met in Mozambique in the late 1970s, when Mr. Zuma led the A.N.C.\u2019s underground operations in exile. Their families were close, too.Barely two weeks after Mr. Moyane took office, the wild stories began appearing in The Sunday Times, fed by unnamed sources inside the tax agency. The paper reported that Mr. Pillay had created the rogue unit, and that the tax agency had paid a former spymaster nearly $230,000 to keep quiet about surveillance devices planted at Mr. Zuma\u2019s home.\u201cSpy Scandal. Blondes, Brothels and Rhinos,\u201d blared one headline. In the article, an unnamed tax employee told the paper that an agent of the rogue unit had set up a brothel, and even hounded a colleague for the money he owed for \u201ctwo blondes.\u201dThe Sunday Times retracted most of the articles \u2014 18 months later. It settled with Mr. Pillay and another tax agency employee named in the accounts.But the coup de gr\u00e2ce had already been delivered.The impact on the nation goes far beyond that, threatening to drag South Africa back toward the days when people looked at the state of their government \u2014 and decided not to support it.While the tax agency blames the economy\u2019s slow growth and a drop in imports for the recent revenue deficit, it also acknowledges \u201ca deterioration in compliance.\u201d Businesses collected taxes on the goods they sold and the employees they hired, but then did not turn over the money to the government, the agency said.Beyond that, nearly half of the shortfall in the last budget year came from personal income taxes that officials had expected to collect but never did, according to the National Treasury.The trend worries the government, which relies heavily on personal income tax, about half of which is paid by the top 1 percent of South Africans. The tax agency says it has made one million calls to remind taxpayers of their obligation to pay.\u201cWhen you asked people, \u2018Why was that?\u2019\u201d Judge Davis said, \u201cthere were two or three reasons that were given. One was the erosion of tax morality, which was caused by increasing levels of government corruption.\u201d\u201cSecondly,\u201d he added, the tax agency had been so thoroughly gutted that \u201cpeople said they\u2019re never going to get caught.\u201dThe scandal did not end with the wreckage at the tax agency. The torrent of unproved accusations gave Mr. Zuma and his allies enough ammunition to grab control over another prize \u2014 the state coffers in the National Treasury.This chapter of the story, in particular, relied on the cooperation of a Western company that carried great weight and credibility in South Africa: KPMG.In December 2014, as The Sunday Times kept churning out headlines about the rogue unit, Mr. Moyane commissioned KPMG South Africa to investigate. A year later, the firm produced a report confirming that a division inside the agency \u2014 officially known as the High Risk Investigation Unit \u2014 had been set up illegally and gone rogue. It was the proof that seemed to justify Mr. Moyane\u2019s sweeping purge.Not surprisingly, Mr. van der Walt\u2019s dive into the tax agency focused on the leader of the so-called rogue unit, Johann van Loggerenberg. The two men, both Afrikaners, had carved out distinct roles for themselves in South Africa\u2019s new order. Now, they found themselves on opposite sides of a showdown roiling the nation.Mr. van Loggerenberg, the tax official, had an especially unusual background. Before joining the agency in 1998, he had worked as an undercover police agent. His work, venturing deep into organized crime, had left him estranged from his family.\u201cEven my parents believed I was a criminal,\u201d he recalled.Back then, as a young man in his 20s, Mr. van Loggerenberg was aware that he had been \u201ca beneficiary of the apartheid system,\u201d he said, but he also saw himself playing a \u201cpart in the renewal of the country.\u201dAfter his police unit was disbanded, he considered an offer from the national intelligence service. But a prominent A.N.C. acquaintance told him to consider the tax agency instead.South Africans, the A.N.C. member told him, had been liberated in 1994 but did not have social or economic freedom. The new government needed money to erase the legacies of apartheid. The thought stuck in Mr. van Loggerenberg\u2019s mind.By the time KPMG started digging into the tax agency, however, Mr. van Loggerenberg had become embroiled in a personal scandal that added even more fuel to the national bonfire.By his own admission, Mr. van Loggerenberg, who was leading an investigation into the tobacco industry, had a brief romantic relationship with a double agent \u2014 a lawyer who represented a tobacco manufacturer and had also operated as a government informant.When that relationship came to a tumultuous end, the lawyer gave The Sunday Times her WhatsApp exchanges with Mr. van Loggerenberg. In them, the couple simultaneously fight and discuss a tax settlement with a political leader, further eroding the public\u2019s confidence in the tax agency.KPMG even took on the relationship in its report: \u201cIt may be that either party had clandestine intentions and that the \u2018love\u2019 fired by physical and emotional sharing with each other was used to extract information of common interest (but with different application).\u201dThe KPMG investigation claimed to be exhaustive. Mr. van der Walt\u2019s team of \u201c20 to 30 professionals\u201d perused 860,000 emails and an \u201cexcess of 1.36 million documents,\u201d according to the firm.One Friday evening, from 6 p.m. until past midnight, a KPMG team took out documents from the tax official\u2019s safe, creating a detailed inventory of each item.\u201cIt was a clinical process,\u201d Mr. van Loggerenberg, the tax agent, said of the interactions with KPMG and its lead investigator. \u201cI was actually very hopeful that he would uncover the truth because of the reputation he had for being a meticulous forensic investigator.\u201dIn the end, the 139-page KPMG report found no evidence of a brothel or illegal wiretapping of Mr. Zuma.But it argued that members of the so-called rogue unit had bugged the offices of national prosecutors in an operation called Project Sunday Evenings, eavesdropping on the investigation of a crime boss and a former police commissioner who wound up in prison.Equally important was a single sentence, in KPMG\u2019s executive findings and conclusions, about Pravin Gordhan, the man who was widely credited with building up the tax agency as its commissioner from 1999 to 2009.Mr. Gordhan, KPMG said, \u201cought to have known of the existence of the unit,\u201d which it said had been established illegally.This sentence gave Mr. Zuma and his allies the tools to go after an even bigger target: the National Treasury, which Mr. Gordhan had moved on to oversee as finance minister. The authorities publicly summoned Mr. Gordhan in late 2016 and charged him with fraud.The charges were quickly withdrawn, but they gave Mr. Zuma political cover when he fired Mr. Gordhan from his post as finance minister a few months later.Mr. Zuma and Mr. Gordhan had often been at odds over the use of government money. Under Mr. Gordhan\u2019s stewardship, the National Treasury had become a bulwark against the freewheeling spending at state enterprises that was enriching Mr. Zuma\u2019s allies.Mr. Gordhan was widely respected in financial and business circles. But when he was ousted in March 2017, the president replaced him with an A.N.C. politician under whose leadership corruption had flourished in the Ministry of Public Enterprises.A few days later, South Africa\u2019s credit rating was downgraded to junk status, creating yet another major challenge for the nation. Just as the chaos at the tax agency was depressing tax revenues, it suddenly became more expensive for South Africa to borrow money, compounding its problems.From there, KPMG might have simply moved on to other government projects, had it not been for a surprising development.Emails leaked last year revealed the chummy ties between close Zuma allies and top KPMG officials. The supposedly ironclad audits KPMG had performed quickly fell under suspicion. Some of the companies the firm had cleared were even being investigated for money laundering and other illicit activities.Forced to audit itself, KPMG acknowledged that it did not have evidence to support the statement it had made about Mr. Gordhan, the finance minister Mr. Zuma had removed.\u201cWe recognize and regret the impact this has had,\u201d the firm said last September. \u201cKPMG South Africa had no political motivation or intent to mislead.\u201dEven more damning was KPMG\u2019s later admission in a hearing before Parliament that the report\u2019s conclusions and recommendations had not been the product of KPMG at all.Instead, they had been copied \u201cby and large verbatim\u201d from a memo drafted by lawyers employed by the tax agency, said Roy Waligora, KPMG South Africa\u2019s head of forensics.But the firm stopped short of disavowing other sections of the report, sowing even more national confusion over whether anything in it had actually been true.The lead investigator, Mr. van der Walt, left the firm last year. He declined to be interviewed.No other individual received more attention in the report than Mr. van Loggerenberg, the former head of the so-called rogue unit. But he said KPMG officials had never interviewed him, even after he \u201cbegged\u201d on several occasions to present his side of the story.The legal problems facing Mr. van Loggerenberg and Mr. Pillay are not finished. Both still face criminal charges linked to Project Sunday Evenings, accused of eavesdropping on national prosecutors.Legal experts say the case appears politically motivated, part of a continuing attempt by the national prosecutors \u2014 still led by a staunch Zuma ally \u2014 to maintain the narrative of a rogue unit at the tax agency. In recent years, the National Prosecuting Authority, which has been compromised by intense meddling by A.N.C. politicians, has increasingly been used for political ends, the experts said.The national prosecutors\u2019 spokesman declined to comment.For KPMG, the inquiry into the tax agency was a lucrative and prestigious contract, bringing in about $2 million and giving the firm a toehold on future work in government. Now critics accuse it of acting as little more than a hired gun in this case, ready to craft reports that fit its client\u2019s wishes.The investigation was one of many scandals involving KPMG in South Africa and elsewhere. Federal prosecutors in New York indicted four of the firm\u2019s former employees on conspiracy and wire fraud charges in January.Last month, two British parliamentary committees said KPMG was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in endorsing the misleading financial statements made by Carillion, a construction giant that collapsed early this year. KPMG, the company\u2019s auditor for 19 years, never raised questions and signed off on management\u2019s \u201cincreasingly fantastical figures,\u201d the committees said.Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, a British organization, said the KPMG case in South Africa provided the clearest example of a major Western auditing firm bending the rules to provide governments with \u201cassurance services.\u201d\u201cWhat you saw\u201d in South Africa, he said, \u201cis the government very much looking for cover to do something that appears to have been broadly illegitimate, and in order to get some cover for that, looking to these international players to give a stamp of approval.\u201dIn the end, Mr. Zuma\u2019s own party turned against him.With opposition figures gaining control of the nation\u2019s biggest cities, the A.N.C. removed Mr. Zuma as president of the country in February. The corruption he presided over had become too much of a political liability ahead of elections next year.But pledges of transparency in the aftermath of the tax scandal have yielded little. John Veihmeyer, the chairman of KPMG International at the time, promised \u201can independent investigation\u201d into the rogue unit report last September.\u201cGiven the significance of the issues involved in this matter to the country of South Africa, and the damage our actions have caused, the public deserves to know the full facts as quickly as possible,\u201d he said in a statement.But KPMG has not followed up in the eight months since Mr. Veihmeyer\u2019s pledge. KPMG International declined interview requests, saying only that it \u201ccontinues to cooperate\u201d with inquiries.That is not how some investigators describe it. Lawyers in one inquiry, conducted by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, were denied access to key documents, according to Dumisa Buhle Ntsebeza, who leads the organization\u2019s inquiry panel and once headed South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s investigation unit.\u201cWe\u2019re still stuck,\u201d Mr. Ntsebeza said.Mr. Ntsebeza has also leveled his frustration at the new leadership of the nation\u2019s tax agency.At a recent hearing, the agency\u2019s new acting commissioner, Mark Kingon, delayed its start by a couple of hours in an attempt to expel journalists, though the hearings had been open to the public since the inquiry began early this year.Then, unlike all previous witnesses, Mr. Kingon refused to speak under oath.\u201cIn order for us to be comfortable that you\u2019re serious about what you\u2019re saying, we need you to bind yourself to what you\u2019re going to say \u2014 the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the truth,\u201d Mr. Ntsebeza said, unable to conceal his anger.Now, South Africa is waiting to see how far its new president, Mr. Ramaphosa, will carry his anti-corruption drive. Many are skeptical, contending that he did little to prevent his fellow A.N.C. leaders from undermining the tax agency and other institutions during his nearly four years as Mr. Zuma\u2019s deputy president.Yet another inquiry, this one ordered by Mr. Ramaphosa, has promised to reveal the real, complete story behind the rise and fall of the tax agency. But it is far from clear whether it will restore the people\u2019s faith in government and persuade them to do what may seem, once again, unimaginable \u2014 pay their taxes.\u201cWe should put behind us the era of diminishing trust in public institutions and weakened confidence in leaders,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa said in his first address to the nation in February.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Year After Trump\u2019s Paris Pullout, U.S. Companies Are Driving a Renewables Boom", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne big question, however, is whether these corporate renewable deals will remain a relatively niche market, adding some wind and solar at the margins but not really making a sizable dent in overall emissions, or whether these companies can use their clout to transform America\u2019s grid and help usher in a new era of low-carbon power.That trend appears to be accelerating. Corporations have already announced deals for another 2.48 gigawatts of wind and solar in the first half of 2018, as companies like AT&T and Nestl\u00e9 join the search for cleaner power to fulfill their sustainability goals and take advantage of the rapidly declining cost of renewables.\u201cBut with how fast wind and solar prices have fallen, we see this as something that makes financial sense,\u201d he said.\u201cWe think this is a major trend,\u201d said Lisa Wood, vice president of customer solutions at the Edison Electric Institute, a major utility trade group. \u201cCustomers are becoming the driver.\u201dThese agreements have gotten increasingly sophisticated: Companies can even arrange to pay for a new wind farm in a different state, such as Oklahoma, and obtain credits from the project even if the electricity is going to someone else. (Basically, the buyer is creating new wind power without using it directly.)\u201cIf we can show utilities that the demand is there, that could convince regulators to expand these programs and allow access for smaller companies,\u201d said Rob Threlkeld, global manager for renewable energy at G.M., which has set the goal to buy 100 percent renewable power by 2050.Mr. Janous of Microsoft, who is engaged in these discussions, says that this aggregation has so far proven to be incredibly challenging. \u201cBut if it\u2019s just Microsoft or just the Fortune 500 companies buying renewable power, that\u2019s not going to be transformative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go beyond that.\u201dA few companies, most notably Google, are now wrestling with an even harder question: What if simply buying up large quantities of wind and solar power isn\u2019t enough?But, as Google itself readily acknowledges, this doesn\u2019t mean that the company is truly powered by 100 percent renewable energy. In many cases, its wind and solar farms operate in different regions (or different countries) than the company\u2019s data centers do. What\u2019s more, the wind and solar farms it has procured don\u2019t provide steady power 24 hours a day, whereas Google\u2019s data centers run around the clock. That means the company is essentially still reliant on fossil fuels to keep the broader grid running.For its next phase, Google wants to locate all of its clean-energy projects in the same grid regions as its data centers, even though that will mean prodding policymakers in places like Taiwan to overhaul electricity markets and allow companies to make direct purchases. Google is also trying to figure out how to assemble a suite of zero-carbon energy sources that can run 24 hours a day, which may require additional technologies like battery storage, demand response programs or even nuclear power.But achieving that goal will take years, and is likely to be far more complicated than simply signing renewable energy contracts.\u201cReaching 100 percent renewable energy is an important milestone, but it\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d said Michael Terrell, head of energy market strategy at Google. \u201cWe have to keep our eyes on the ultimate prize, which is to enable carbon free power in every hour of every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So I officially grant you a hard-news break and offer some thoughts on the important matter of junk food.A few weeks ago, I asked for your memories of forgotten Canadian candies and snacks, and the results were, well, sweet (and salty).Kristen Rossetti, a New Yorker from Smiths Falls, Ontario \u2014 the self proclaimed chocolate capital of Canada until its Hershey factory closed \u2014 said she pined for the Lowney\u2019s Cherry Blossom. \u201cIts core is a maraschino cherry and cherry syrup surrounded by a THICK layer of mixed chocolate, coconut and roasted peanuts,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThink of a giant and exponentially more delicious cherry cordial.\u201dAmong the most interesting people who answered my call was Jim Connell, the man who figured out how to put the vinegar into salt-and-vinegar potato chips, a perennial Canadian favorite.Mr. Connell is 93 and lives in Toronto. But he told me the flavoring breakthrough first happened in Britain. It was 1968 and Mr. Connell was working in the flavor development for the Canadian subsidiary of an American company, Griffith Laboratories, when he was sent off to Bristol, England, to help establish a joint venture there with an outfit that mostly made sausage ingredients.Shortly after his arrival, Mr. Connell said, he was approached by Imperial Tobacco, which at the time was expanding its spectrum of vices to include potato chips. Like Canadians, the British have long sprinkled vinegar on deep fried potatoes, something Mr. Connell said he suspected was about masking the flavor of the \u201crancid grease\u201d used by fish \u2018n\u2019 chip shops. In any case, the tobacco company figured that echoing the taste in potato chips \u2014 the British call them \u201ccrisps\u201d \u2014 would be a winner.The tobacco company ultimately passed on the product. But a much smaller and older British potato chip company that was struggling decided to bite, and was saved by salt and vinegar\u2019s immediate success. Griffith Labs, which is still a major force in the arcane world of flavorings, soon brought salt and vinegar to Canada.Mr. Connell said his lab modified salt and vinegar to create several other chips that were now Canadian icons, including ketchup and dill pickle. Those, he said, use actual dried tomato paste and dill, not chemical concoctions.Mr. Connell dodged my question about what flavor was his favorite child.\u201cI only eat them once in a while,\u201d he said. \u201cI like them all.\u201dThe Sports department at the The New York Times takes soccer seriously. And it pulls out all the stops for the World Cup, which gets underway next week in Russia. At least five reporters will be on the scene, Andrew Das, an editor in Sports, told me.They include Sarah Lyall, who is one of the finest writers in journalism, and who will be filing pieces about the culture of the event: watch for her articles even if you\u2019re not a soccer fan. There will also be live briefings for every game, and we\u2019ll be translating much of the report into Spanish.\u201cWe\u2019ll ping around the 12 stadiums (and 11 cities; Moscow has two sites), from Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg in the west, to Rostov and Sochi in the south, to Yekaterinburg way the hell out east,\u201d Andrew said.Team Canada won\u2019t be competing on the pitch this year. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be some Canadian action.On June 13, the day before the opening match, FIFA will be announcing the host for the 2026 World Cup, and Canada is part of a joint bid with the United States and Mexico. Their only rival is Morocco, Andrew said, and \u201cit\u2019s expected to be close.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alabama\u2019s Longtime Hostility to Gambling Shows Signs of Fading", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 Even more than its Bible Belt neighbors, Alabama has steadfastly resisted legalizing gambling for generations.The clout of evangelical Christians helped make sure of it: Joe Godfrey, the top lobbyist for the state\u2019s most powerful churches, once received an Inauguration Day promise from an influential politician that no proposal for gambling would make it through the State House while he was in office.But the resistance is now openly fraying, suggesting that gambling is no longer a potent moral issue that animates voters and politicians the way it once did.As the landscape shifts in Montgomery, the state capital, the consequences may reverberate across the South, where nearby states gladly rake in billions of dollars that Alabamians are not allowed to wager at home.\u201cI dread going back into session, if I\u2019m re-elected, knowing that there\u2019s probably going to be fantasy sports, there\u2019s going to be the lottery, there\u2019s going to be sports gambling, the Vegas-type gambling,\u201d said Rich Wingo, a Republican state representative who opposes all those things. \u201cI just feel like we\u2019re going to be inundated with this gambling issue.\u201dHardly anyone, Mr. Wingo included, believes that Alabama, which allows bingo, bets on horse and dog racing and a few tribal casinos with no table games, will quickly embrace other ways to wager. But the races this year for governor and for every seat in the Legislature are already accelerating debate about some of them, testing the political strength of the evangelical Christians who have blocked proposals in the past.Republican Party consultants say their polling now shows overwhelming support for a vote on a lottery, even among self-identified churchgoers. In recent interviews, elected officials, pastors, political strategists and voters all said they sensed far less ferocity around an issue that once electrified Alabama politics.No single theory has won out to explain why Alabama\u2019s anti-gambling fervor may have ebbed.And there is the reality that plenty of people who stay in Alabama are placing bets already. Illegal, untaxed gambling is thought to be widespread, and the state\u2019s three tribal casinos, limited as they are in what they can offer, attract patrons from all over Alabama. A local minister was known to drive Harper Lee, the author of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d to one of them before she died in 2016.Mr. Godfrey, the church lobbyist and executive director of the interdenominational Alabama Citizens Action Program, said the coalition against legalized gambling had fractured.\u201cIt used to be that we could count on the Republicans and the business community to fight, but we\u2019ve lost the Republicans, we\u2019ve lost the business community,\u201d Mr. Godfrey said at the group\u2019s offices in Birmingham. \u201cThe churches will be the last line of defense \u2014 that\u2019s the only firewall left.\u201dHe recalled how in 1999, after Georgia had started a lottery and casinos had opened in Mississippi, the Baptist church he pastored took $5,000 out of its missions budget to use in thwarting Mr. Siegelman\u2019s lottery plan.But opposition to gambling has dwindled as a priority for many Christian leaders across the country, and the confidence and vigor that Mr. Godfrey once saw has been replaced with worries about whether many Christians remain willing to fight the issue.\u201cThe biggest priority right now for me is reminding evangelicals of why we are opposed to gambling, which means teaching a biblical view of economic stewardship and a biblical view of concern for the poor,\u201d said Russell Moore, who leads the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s public policy arm and is a native of the casino-dotted Mississippi coast. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned that evangelicals are changing their position on gambling, as much as I\u2019m concerned that there\u2019s often a kind of fatalism that assumes that gambling is going to be part of every economy.\u201dEven so, some Christians and their leaders said they were comfortable with de-emphasizing gambling as an issue. The Rev. Neil Reynolds, the senior minister at the University Church of Christ in Tuscaloosa, said gambling, like alcohol, was not \u201can evil that\u2019s going to ruin our community.\u201d\u201cWe are too often known for the things that we\u2019re against, instead of the things we\u2019re for and who we are,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said in his office near the stadium of a Crimson Tide football program that many an Alabamian would bet on legally if they could. (Even Wayne Flynt, a Baptist minister and a professor emeritus of history at Auburn University, said the one bet he had made in his life had been a friendly $1 wager on Alabama.)With so much money potentially at stake both for Alabama and for its neighbors, there is plentiful speculation about how much resistance may remain to gambling in the state. Professor Flynt said he thought there would still be plenty, simply because many people are used to thinking of gambling as something done in \u201cgodless Yankee places that vote for Hillary Clinton.\u201dGambling proponents recognize the cultural headwinds and, like Mr. Maddox, are framing their plans as vital to the state\u2019s economic future.\u201cI think that evangelical Christians of all denominations, many of whom used to be opposed to the lottery, see that if the money is spent on our children, for our children\u2019s education or for some other important public purpose that it\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Mr. Siegelman said, reviving some of his 1999 pitch. \u201cIt\u2019s like a donation to the church, or a donation to education, or a donation to veterans.\u201dMr. Godfrey said that he and his allies sensed the danger and expected to face a well-financed and well-crafted strategy to promote what they saw as an unmitigated vice.\u201cJesus never told us it would be easy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the U.S. Should Drop All Tariffs", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has announced tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China, $34 billion of which will come into effect on July 6, saying it will force that country to be a better trading partner. China, not surprisingly, said it would slap $50 billion of its own tariffs on American goods in response, to which Mr. Trump threatened to raise the stakes by another $200 billion.On trade, the president has been all over the place. One day he threatened to impose tariffs on our NATO allies on national-security grounds. Another day, he exempted these allies from the tariffs. A few weeks later, he changed his mind.The United States should stop the scattershot, pointless nonsense on tariffs and go the other way, and hard: It should drop all tariffs, even if the rest of the world doesn\u2019t follow.Consider a domestic company that imports specialty European steel not produced in the United States. Thanks to the tariffs, this company faces an instant 25 percent price increase. It will shift some of that cost onto its customers, making the final product more costly and thus less competitive at home and globally. Or the company might shift manufacturing abroad to gain access to cheaper materials.Mr. Krugman also lamented that economists \u201cmust deal with a world that does not understand or accept that case\u201d for unilateral free trade. That becomes clearer by the day: Now so-called free traders seem to believe that the president\u2019s $50 billion of tariffs on imports from China is part of a brilliant strategy to get the Chinese to open their markets to American exports. Similarly, they applaud Mr. Trump for starting a trade war with G-7 countries toward the goal of a tariff-free G-7.President Trump should take a page from Hong Kong. As that territory\u2019s experience demonstrates, and as economists have long argued, lowering trade barriers regardless of other governments\u2019 trade policies fuels domestic economic growth. So if Mr. Trump insists on acting unilaterally, he should cut rather than raise tariffs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Claims to Have Changed. A London Judge Will Decide.", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s 10-month tenure as Uber\u2019s chief executive has been marked by a prolonged public relations campaign to apologize for the company\u2019s past misdeeds and portray the once proudly combative start-up as a reformed corporate citizen.Starting Monday, a judge in London will test the success of his strategy.The case before Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court has ramifications far beyond London, and, given changes the city has already wrung from Uber, it could embolden others grappling with how to regulate ride-sharing services. The ruling will offer a hint as to whether governments and regulators are becoming more receptive to Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s conciliatory efforts as he seeks to move past the brusque manner associated with his predecessor, Travis Kalanick.\u201cThe trial is one of the first big tests of Khosrowshahi\u2019s leadership of the company and new approach,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Spicer, a professor at the Cass Business School at City, University of London, who has been tracking the case. \u201cThe judgment will show whether authorities are willing to accept Uber with some of the harder edges knocked off, or whether there are more fundamental questions about the Uber model.\u201dWith more than 3.6 million people using Uber at least once every three months, and 45,000 drivers transporting them, the British capital is Uber\u2019s largest European market. The company has so far been able to continue operating pending its appeal.But a ban would be Uber\u2019s biggest regulatory setback to date. It would bruise its business at a critical time as Mr. Khosrowshahi is scaling back the company\u2019s operations in money-losing markets in Asia and laying the groundwork for an initial public offering.Mr. Khosrowshahi, former chief executive of Expedia, was in the midst of contentious negotiations to settle a boardroom feud between Mr. Kalanick and Uber investors at the time. He flew to London to discuss a potential compromise, calling into board meetings in San Francisco during the brief dash to Britain.Uber has since tried to address many of the criticisms from the London authorities, and a deal of some sort is likely to be reached to keep the company\u2019s cars on the roads. It has introduced limits on how long a driver may continuously be behind the wheel, offered tools to report incidents to the police, and agreed to share traffic data with the city. A new management team was installed to run the company\u2019s London operations, while three independent executives were recruited to a board that oversees operations in Britain.The company is also seeking only an 18-month license, rather than the typical five years, as a concession that it says will allow regulators to ensure its reforms will last.The trial beginning on Monday is expected to last several days, with testimony from Uber representatives and officials from Transport for London, the city\u2019s regulator. Mr. Khosrowshahi is not expected to attend.The case could drag on for years. If Uber loses this appeal, it can still take the case to higher courts, and the company\u2019s cars would be allowed to remain on the road throughout the process.Uber and Transport for London declined to comment.London\u2019s actions are being closely watched as a potential model for regulators elsewhere who are seeking to extract concessions from Uber. Nine years after the company was founded, policymakers continue to struggle with fallout associated with the success of Uber and similar ride-hailing services, including more congested streets and devastated local taxi groups.\u201cThe wild-West era of platform companies skirting regulation seems to be coming to an end,\u201d said Mark Graham, a professor of internet geography at Oxford University who has studied how Uber and other companies that make up the so-called gig economy affect workers and traditional industries.A new license for Uber would be a blow to London\u2019s black-cab drivers.They argue that rivals working for Uber have an unfair advantage because they do not have to meet the same car specification requirements or pass an exhaustive exam, known as \u201cthe Knowledge,\u201d that tests a cabby\u2019s ability to navigate city streets without a map. That, they say, allows Uber to keep its prices lower than those of black cabs \u2014 Uber can be up to 30 percent cheaper than London taxis.Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, which represents about half the city\u2019s 23,000 cabbies, said he was unconvinced by Uber\u2019s efforts to project a friendlier corporate image.\u201cThey are only saying what they have to say to get a license,\u201d Mr. McNamara said.Yet many experts say that banning Uber entirely is unrealistic.Tony Travers, a professor at the London School of Economics, said he expected Uber to win the appeal. In April, the judge presiding over the case asked Uber and Transport for London to negotiate terms of a new license in the event that she rules in the company\u2019s favor.\u201cUber has accepted it needed to make improvements,\u201d Professor Travers said. An outright ban, he said, \u201cis hard to imagine.\u201dHe added, however, that while the appeal would mark an important moment for Uber, the company would inevitably face more such challenges around the world.This fight, he said, \u201cwon\u2019t be the last.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Feeling Good About the Economy? You\u2019re Probably a Republican", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmericans are feeling better about the economy. Or at least Republicans are.The same partisan split appears in the survey\u2019s broader measure of consumer confidence, which is based on five questions about respondents\u2019 spending plans and views of the economy. Republicans are optimistic and becoming more so. Democrats are pessimistic and have seen barely any improvement in their outlook despite the steadily improving economic data.The pattern is a mirror image of the picture before President Trump took office. Back then, it was Democrats who were far more positive about the economy, a situation that reversed almost immediately upon Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.Republicans are counting on the strong economy to buoy them in congressional elections this fall. Party leaders in the House and Senate celebrate every new measure of economic news, and have been quick to claim credit for it.No one tries to claim more credit than Mr. Trump, who frequently touts the strength of the recovery on Twitter.He may be getting through to voters. A majority of Americans \u2014 56 percent \u2014 give Mr. Trump at least some credit for the improving economy.Joe McGrath, a sales manager for a lighting manufacturer outside Philadelphia, said that by cutting taxes and loosening regulations, Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress had \u201creally turned American business and the American economy loose.\u201dA conservative Republican, Mr. McGrath, 56, said that he didn\u2019t support Mr. Trump during the presidential primaries in 2016, and that he still didn\u2019t always like Mr. Trump\u2019s approach. But on policy, Mr. McGrath said, Mr. Trump won him over by following through on the promises he made during the campaign.Republicans overwhelmingly attribute the economy\u2019s progress to Mr. Trump. Democrats, perhaps unsurprisingly, are likelier to say Mr. Obama had more to do with it. But nearly a third of Democrats say Mr. Trump has earned at least some credit.Nick Holland, a 27-year-old Democrat living in Atlanta, said there was no question that the economy was doing well, adding that this was at least in part because of Mr. Trump.\u201cHe definitely deserves some credit,\u201d Mr. Holland said. \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t vote for him, but this is why people did, because he\u2019s a businessman.\u201dStill, Mr. Holland said Mr. Obama had probably played a bigger role in setting the economy on firm footing. And he said he was unlikely to support Republicans in the fall elections because other concerns, such as police and school shootings, outweighed economic issues for him.Politics isn\u2019t the only factor in people\u2019s views of the economy. Adults from higher-earning households are more confident, regardless of partisanship. (Still, low-income Republicans are more optimistic, on average, than even wealthy Democrats.) Men also tend to be more confident than women, and whites are more confident than members of minority racial and ethnic groups.There has been improvement among virtually all groups, however. Confidence among African-Americans is the highest since Mr. Obama was president. Mr. Trump has repeatedly pointed to low black unemployment as evidence that his economic policies are benefiting groups that often face discrimination in the labor market.Steven Saenz, who is Hispanic, graduated from college in the teeth of the recession, and went to architecture school in part to avoid entering the weak labor market. Even so, it took him nine months after completing his degree to find a job, and two more years to feel stable.Now, however, Mr. Saenz has a good job at a Dallas architecture firm, and last year bought his first home with his wife. Still, Mr. Saenz, 32, said he and his wife watched their spending closely.\u201cJust being a product of graduating in the recession, I tend to focus more on saving,\u201d he said.But the law appears to have helped Republicans\u2019 election prospects in one important way: It appears to have made Republican voters feel better about the economy.The share of Americans who say they and their families are better off financially than they were a year ago has jumped since December, to 36 percent from 29 percent. That jump is almost entirely concentrated among Republicans, and it coincides with the signing of the tax cuts. The improved sentiment could give Republican voters a reason to turn out in November \u2014 to reward the lawmakers they see as having given them a financial lift.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the tax bill did have a significant impact on Republican confidence,\u201d said Laura Wronski, a research scientist at SurveyMonkey.Nancy Steele, a retired psychologist near Allentown, Pa., said she saw more cynical motives in the tax bill.\u201cThey were striving to give lots of people a tax break hoping it would help them in the November elections,\u201d she said.Ms. Steele, a Democrat, said she was concerned about projections that the tax law would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the national debt over the next decade. Mr. Obama also added to the debt, she said, but unlike Mr. Trump, he inherited a financial crisis.\u201cGoing that much in debt just to buy votes this coming November, I don\u2019t think, is such a good thing,\u201d she said.Most Democrats agree with Ms. Steele. Nearly 70 percent say they believe the tax cuts will add to the deficit. Only 22 percent of Republican voters say they believe that. A plurality of them \u2014 37 percent \u2014 say the tax law will actually reduce the deficit.Those voters are echoing Trump administration officials, such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who have predicted the tax cuts will more than pay for themselves. Economists roundly disagree with them. No detailed, independent analysis of the law has concluded that it will avoid adding to the deficit, let alone reduce it. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the law will add $1 trillion to deficits over the course of a decade, even after accounting for additional economic growth it might spur.About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 10,077 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from June 4 to June 10. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump to Dictators: Have a Nice Day", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistWatching President Trump recently accuse Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of stabbing him in the back prompted me to Google a simple question: How many Canadians were killed or wounded since April 2002 fighting alongside Americans in Afghanistan? The answer: 158 were killed and 635 wounded.And yet, when their prime minister mildly pushed back against demands to lower Canada\u2019s tariffs on milk, cheese and yogurt from the U.S., Trump and his team \u2014 in a flash \u2014 accused Trudeau of \u201cbetrayal,\u201d back-stabbing and deserving of a \u201cspecial place in hell.\u201dBut it tells you all you need to know about how differently Trump looks at the world from any of his predecessors \u2014 Republican or Democrat. Everything is a transaction: What have you done for ME today? The notion of America as the upholder of last resort of global rules and human rights \u2014 which occasionally forgoes small economic advantages to strengthen democratic societies so we can enjoy the much larger benefits of a world of healthy, free-market democracies \u2014 is over.Mind you, I can support Trump verbally cozying up to North Korea\u2019s murderous dictator, Kim Jong-un, if it actually does reduce the prospects of war on the Korean Peninsula and lead to a process of denuclearization there. Nothing else has been effective \u2014 so trading Trump\u2019s phony praise of \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d for a real end to North Korean weapons and missile testing is a trade I\u2019ll endorse \u2014 if it works.As Trump told reporters about the North Korean dictator on Friday: \u201cHe speaks, and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same.\u201dTrump later said this was a joke. Sorry, no U.S. president should make such a joke, which, alas, was consistent with everything Trump has said and done before: He prefers the company of strongmen and, as long as they praise him, does not care how leaders anywhere treat their own people \u2014 including how they treat people risking their lives to model their countries on ours (or at least on what they thought was ours).While this approach may buy us some time with North Korea, it is hurting us and our friends in many other places \u2014 because it\u2019s being taken as a free pass for dictators everywhere not just to crush their revolutionaries or terrorists but even their most mild dissenters. It leaves no space for even loyal opposition.\u201cThe state of oppression in Egypt has sunk so low that al-Sisi\u2019s forces are arresting well-recognized activists as they sleep, simply for speaking up,\u201d said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe message is clear that criticism and even mild satire apparently earn Egyptians an immediate trip to prison.\u201dSisi should hang his head in shame for arbitrarily jailing good young people like this \u2014 and the U.S. Congress should be taking up their cause if our president and secretary of state are too cynical to do so.The same is true in Turkey today under the leadership of a real bum, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. I realized the other day that almost all my Turkish journalist friends had been either jailed, fired or exiled by the caliph-tyrant Erdogan.In U.S.-allied Bahrain, Abduljalil Alsingace, the blogger and human rights defender, who was sentenced in 2011 to life in prison for writing \u201ccritically about human rights violations, sectarian discrimination and repression of the political opposition,\u201d is rotting in jail, noted the Committee to Protect Journalists.In U.S.-allied Philippines, the outspoken senator and former human rights commissioner Leila de Lima, who has been critical of President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s antidrug war that has left more than 7,000 dead in the past three years in gun battles with the police and vigilantes, was thrown in jail in February 2017 on trumped-up drug charges and still languishes there.And in once pro-Western Poland, the country\u2019s most powerful politician, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, is trying to replace the independent judiciary with judges selected purely for their loyalty to him and his party, snubbing his nose at the European Union\u2019s liberal, rule-of-law values.In the past, America would have been a reality principle, and at least some voice of restraint, forcing foreign leaders to say, \u201cThe Americans will never let us get away with that.\u201d No more. Trump doesn\u2019t even have ambassadors in Turkey and Saudi Arabia today to whisper.\u201cIn America, we\u2019re going to survive Trump,\u201d says Michael Posner, director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at N.Y.U. Stern. \u201cWe have strong institutions and plenty of people committed to maintaining our democratic processes. But places like Egypt, Turkey or the Philippines are fragile states where activists for decades relied on the U.S. to stand up and say, \u2018There are consequences for your relations with the U.S. \u2014 trade, aid, military, investment \u2014 if you crush peaceful dissent.\u2019 Today, we have a president who is not only not critical, he actually congratulates leaders on their fraudulent elections and seems to endorse their bad behavior.\u201dRemember: These leaders are not repressing violent radicals, Posner adds; they are literally \u201ccriminalizing dissent and debate.\u201d And their citizens now think that we\u2019re O.K. with that. If that stands, the world will eventually become a more dangerous place for all of us.Advertisement"}

Like many residents here, he hopes the summit meeting\u2019s global exposure will restore some glamour to this sleepy village of 9,000 in the Charlevoix region, which once attracted Hollywood stars but has since seen tough times. \u201cI am hoping the leaders will at least help put Charlevoix on the map,\u201d he said.Charlevoix was also seen as an ideal location because the St. Lawrence River creates a natural border, and its remoteness makes it easier to secure than a larger city.The town, about 90 miles northeast of Quebec City, once hosted vacationing American presidents and luminaries such as Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford. In 1916, when President William Howard Taft bought a luxurious villa in La Malbaie, he described the air of Charlevoix as \u201cintoxicating like champagne without the next day\u2019s hangover.\u201d But the region has since struggled with unemployment, brain drain and poverty, as tourism sputtered.The Canadian government has spent $465 million to host the summit meeting, money that some critics contend would have been better spent on roads or public health. But Michel Couturier, La Malbaie\u2019s 49-year-old mayor, argued that the investment was worth it since Charlevoix\u2019s rare moment in the spotlight would reverberate for decades.\u201cThe G-7 is the Olympics of politics, and 100 years from now we will still be talking about this summit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope that heightened profile will draw tourists as well as attracting companies that have been reluctant to invest here.\u201dThe event will give the town a high-tech lift, including the introduction of high-speed internet and improved cellphone coverage that more than 2,500 homes and businesses will be able to subscribe to. To provide those services for the world leaders, the Canadian government has spent almost $16 million to help build 13 cellphone towers and install about 60 miles of fiber-optic cables.Mr. Couturier said he was both surprised and elated when he received a call last summer from Mr. Trudeau, telling him he had chosen the region to host the summit meeting because of its \u201chospitality tradition.\u201dIf the food doesn\u2019t sway them, local residents say they are confident that world leaders will be seduced by their region\u2019s uncommon beauty, including 2,300 square miles of valleys, fjords, steep mountains and rivers, originating about 350 million years ago when an asteroid landed here and left a 34-mile crater.When the French colonized Quebec in the 17th century, Samuel de Champlain, the founder of New France, gave the town the name Malle Baye (Old French for La Malbaie), which means \u201cpoor bay.\u201d Local historians say de Champlain was apparently influenced by his struggle to find a place to anchor his ship.Charlevoix went on to draw a jet-set crowd, and for decades La Malbaie was a particular favorite of luxury cruise ships, including many filled with well-heeled Americans. Le Manoir Richelieu was built at the turn of the 20th century to accommodate the upmarket guests.\u201cThey were coming here to enjoy the landscape and feel the cold breeze that comes from the St. Lawrence River,\u201d said Serge Gauthier, president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Histoire de Charlevoix. But when the luxury cruise industry collapsed in the mid-1960s, he said, the local economy was hit hard and never really recovered.She said the group had decided to organize protests at a bigger alternative venue in Quebec City.As for Mr. Tremblay, the meeting has already brought benefits.In return for putting up with all the inconvenience, security services officials cut down four trees in his front yard, making his stunning view of the St. Lawrence River even better.\u201cI don\u2019t think the leaders will solve the world\u2019s problems in a weekend,\u201d he said, smiling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Athens, Rising", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "Cultured TravelerThe city has endured crisis and chaos, and yet is now emerging from the wreckage as one of Europe\u2019s most vibrant and significant cultural capitals.Supported byIt was Saturday night in Athens, and I was surrounded by dozens of young Greeks on the packed veranda of Six d.o.g.s., a cafe-bar and arts space that runs the length of an alleyway in the Monastiraki neighborhood. It was the 10-year anniversary party for Laternative, a local radio show launched in the wake of the country\u2019s debt crisis, and people spilled into the gallery space, gathered under light-strung trees in the back garden and in the club area where the first of several bands was about to play.Most of the partygoers looked to be in their early and mid 20s, just like I was the first time I came to this exact spot nearly 12 years ago, back when it was a tiny indie rock bar called Kinky. Standing here now, I could almost see myself as I was then: a 24-year-old backpacker sitting alone in the corner, smoking cheap Greek cigarettes and nursing a raki, unaware that my life had come to a crossroads.There are places we live and places we visit, and then there are the other places. Places we return to, where we put down roots, but not strong enough roots to hold us \u2014 places that change us, that we haunt and are haunted by. Nowhere embodies this for me more than Athens, a city I\u2019ve watched shift and evolve, endure crisis and chaos and economic collapse, and yet emerge from the wreckage as one of the continent\u2019s most vibrant and significant cultural capitals, more popular than ever as a tourist destination. (Last year Athens welcomed a record 5 million visitors, double the 2012 figure.)The first time I came here, I was more or less fleeing New York. I had saved up a chunk of money bartending after college at one of those high-volume, pre-crash Soho bars that catered to young Wall Street types. Being a Midwesterner with no connections or career prospects to speak of, I had done what countless other young Americans did before me: I bought a backpack and a one-way ticket to Europe.After a week or so bouncing around the Cyclades, I arrived in Athens, planning to stay only a few days before moving on. People had told me the city was ugly and congested, basically a stopover, yet I remember the first romance of its winding, cracked stone alleyways overgrown with jasmine creepers and bitter orange trees, the roving packs of stray dogs, cats sunning on ruins, the smell of leather, honeysuckle and dust.One night I wandered into Kinky Bar, where the D.J. was playing obscure postpunk records I happened to love. I drank until I was brave enough to approach him. He introduced me to his friends \u2014 Athenians, a bit older than I was \u2014 and at the end of the night, they did something I couldn\u2019t imagine happening back home: They invited me to move in with them.They all lived on or near a small, leafy street called Semitelou on a hill near the Athens Music Hall. Over the next weeks, I lived between their apartments, typical residential buildings with wraparound balconies and sun-bleached awnings that faced each other over the street. They were journalists, D.J.s and architects. Two were identical twin brothers, one gay and one straight. They lived with the straight twin\u2019s girlfriend, a biologist who traveled with a suitcase of human sperm samples.They showed me the city, its chaotic cafes and dusky tavernas. We packed into the car they all shared and drove around the gasworks of the Gazi district in search of after-hours bouzouki bars, saw concerts in Orthodox churches, prepared huge home-cooked dinners that we washed down with wine and vodka and other substances of varying toxicity and legality.\u201cIt\u2019s like the show \u2018Friends\u2019 but with sex, drugs and balconies,\u201d I wrote at the time in my journal. It was a period in my life when I kept one rigorously, documenting nearly every romantic and philosophical quandary, every insight, not least of which was my decision to stay abroad and try to write professionally.I loved Athens but wanted to see more of Europe, and it was my Athenian friends who directed me to Berlin, somewhere I\u2019d had no desire to visit, but where I would end up spending the next decade, settling down, becoming a writer, meeting my husband.How, then, to explain the Athens I find now, returning in the flush of spring with my old journals to reconnect with the city of my recollections? The commercial center, which I remember going dark at the end of the work day, was overflowing with visitors and locals, patronizing stylish, next-generation bars, cafes and restaurants that have largely deposed the cheap souvlaki joints and outdated tavernas I remember.In so many ways, Athens feels more alive, more culturally prolific, than ever, and it\u2019s hard to understand how this could have happened in the midst of the worst economic catastrophe in the history of the European Union.\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting and hellish,\u201d said Theodosis Michos, raising his voice over the music at the Six d.o.g.s. party. With his thick black-rimmed glasses and tattoos, his rake-thin build and wild, Richard Hell-esque hair, he looked exactly as I remembered him when I was staying at his place on Semitelou, give or take a decade of worry lines. Back in 2006, he was a staff writer for Esquire Greece, but like almost all the Greeks I know, the crisis left Theodosis out of work.The day after the party, I headed to Exarcheia, the graffiti-covered anarchist and student district that was the site of a scene I described in my 2006 journal, which now feels to me like an omen: \u201cSaw a shop with a 10-foot hole bashed through the window, riot cops everywhere, employees crying.\u201dBut it remains to be seen whether Documenta\u2019s bolstering of the art scene will last. And despite recent talk of Athens being \u201cthe new Berlin,\u201d the city still struggles with poverty, riots and drug crime, not to mention continued reverberations of the refugee crisis \u2014 something perhaps most visible in Exarchia, where many migrants from war-torn countries in Africa and the Middle East live in squats run by anarchists and activists.\u201cYou\u2019re living in uncertainty all the time,\u201d said Meropi Kokkini, another writer friend I stayed with back in 2006. I had come to meet her and George \u2014 her longtime partner who was the D.J. that first night at Kinky Bar \u2014 at a new pok\u00e9 bowl stand in the city center. I often stayed with George and Meropi when I visited Athens in the years after my first stay, sitting up all night talking and drinking until I had almost missed my flight \u2014 and on at least one occasion, actually had.As we spoke, people streamed by us in the cooling evening air, some dragging suitcases or holding phones open to Google Maps. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling now that things are getting better,\u201d she added, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real.\u201dIn the past year or two, Greece has shown signs of recovery. Unemployment, which peaked near 30 percent in 2013, is below 20 percent and falling, and the economy is growing faster than the European average. Much of this growth comes from the tourism sector as visitor numbers have surged, increasing for the past decade at around 11 percent per year, in part due to fears about turmoil in Turkey and the Middle East, as well as increased tourism from the newly wealthy Asian middle classes. The country expects a new all-time high of 32 million visitors in 2018, three times its population.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, the tourists in recent years. It\u2019s like the whole world is coming on vacation to Greece.\u201d said Fotis Vallatos, the travel editor of Blue Magazine, the in-flight publication of Greece\u2019s largest airline, Aegean Airlines, and a co-founder of Popaganda, as well as the person who first invited me to move in to Semitelou.As tourism has increased, Aegean Airlines expanded from 18 mostly Greek destinations in 2001 to 145 all over the world today. Fotis is now often on the road, exploring those destinations and the many inventive restaurants and visitor attractions that have emerged in Greece since the crisis, from a wave of young chefs using Nordic, French and East Asian cooking techniques on local ingredients, to a multitude of \u201csecond-act producers,\u201d people left unemployed or underemployed who returned to the villages where they grew up and began to sell homemade, organic, artisanal Greek products \u2014 to phenomenal results.\u201cI think everybody became more creative after the crisis, more cooperative,\u201d he said.We talked about the Semitelou days, how much fun it was to be so young and dumb. Back then, he said, \u201cit was still a big party. We earned good money. We worked a lot, but it was a period when everybody was happy. We thought this party would last forever, and because of this, we lived that way. We never thought this might be over in a few years.\u201dListening to Fotis, I realized that for my friends, even more than for me, those years must feel foreign \u2014 like a distant dream.As often happens when I\u2019m in Athens, I was introduced to friends of friends and wound up in the hours just before I had to head to the airport at a party I didn\u2019t want to leave. This one, though, was fancier than I was used to. It was thrown by Afroditi Panagiotakou, the director of culture for the Onassis Foundation. Formidable and eccentric in the way of Mediterranean aristocrats, she is the guiding force behind the foundation\u2019s rebirth as an important engine of the city\u2019s cultural scene.\u201cI have to say, I\u2019ve never felt closer to this city,\u201d said Afroditi, as we sat on the roof terrace of the villa she shares with her partner, Anthony S. Papadimitriou, president of the business and public benefit wing of the Onassis Foundation. We looked out over the Mets district, a palimpsest of red tile and concrete housing blocks behind which the Acropolis rises like a revelation.\u201cI think that Athens lies beyond good and evil, beyond beauty and ugliness,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that cities are supposed to be beautiful anyway. I think they\u2019re supposed to be interesting. They\u2019re supposed to be alive. Athens is definitely alive. It doesn\u2019t have this constipated, sclerotic thing that cities like New York, London, Paris have, where whatever you do, nobody will notice.\u201d She added, \u201cAthens is a city that is changing all the time.\u201dAs we spoke, guests began to arrive \u2014 gallerists and producers, artists and writers on Onassis grants, mostly Greek but some Lebanese, part of the foundation\u2019s effort to build more cultural exchange with the Middle East. Wine flowed and the music got louder, jumping from Bossa Nova to Italo-disco to Greek rebetiko as the sun began to set over Athens. By the time I left for the airport, nearly everyone was dancing.Charly Wilder is a frequent contributor to the Travel section.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is the Trade Deficit?", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not a scorecard, and reducing it won\u2019t necessarily be good for jobs.A core idea that Donald J. Trump has embraced throughout his time in public life has been that the United States is losing in trade with the rest of the world, and that persistent trade deficits are evidence of this fact.In this accounting, the $69 billion United States trade deficit with Mexico or $336 billion gap with China is something of a scorecard reflecting diminishing American greatness. The vast majority of economists view it differently. In this mainstream view, trade deficits are not inherently good or bad. They can be either, depending on circumstances.As the president\u2019s emphasis on trade deficits puts the United States at odds with allies \u2014 in this case at the Group of 7 leaders meeting this weekend in Canada \u2014 the trade-offs in making this an overwhelming focus of economic diplomacy are becoming more clear.Trying to eliminate the trade deficit could mean giving up some of the key levers of power that allow the United States to get its way in international politics. The reasons have to do with the global reserve currency, economic diplomacy and something called the Triffin dilemma.What is the trade deficit?Imagine a world with only two countries, and only two products. One country makes cars; the other grows bananas.People in CarNation want bananas, so they buy $1 million worth from people in BananaLand. Residents of BananaLand want cars, so they buy $2 million of them from CarNation.That difference is the trade deficit: BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit; CarNation has a $1 million trade surplus.But this does not mean that BananaLand is \u201closing\u201d to CarNation. Cars are really useful, and BananaLanders got a lot of them in exchange for their money.Similarly, it\u2019s true that the United States has a large trade deficit with Mexico, for example. But it\u2019s not as if Americans were just flinging money across the Rio Grande out of charity. Americans get a lot of good stuff for that: avocados, for example, and Canc\u00fan vacations.If you want to think of it in terms of winners and losers, you could justifiably reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred framing: \u201cThose losers in Mexico gave us $69 billion more stuff than we gave them last year. Ha, ha, ha. We\u2019re winners.\u201dWhat does that have to do with savings and investment?When a country runs a trade deficit, there is a countervailing force. Think back to our pretend countries. BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit with CarNation. But that means that car producers in CarNation are sitting on an extra $1 million a year in income.Something has to happen with that $1 million. If CarNation doesn\u2019t want the value of its currency to rise, it has to take that $1 million trade surplus and plow it back into BananaLand. There are different ways it could do that. People in CarNation could buy stocks or bonds in BananaLand, or companies in CarNation could invest in factories in BananaLand, or the government of CarNation could buy assets directly.In effect, the flow of capital is the reverse of the flow of goods. And the trade deficit will be shaped not just by the mechanics of what products people in the two countries buy, but also by unrelated investment and savings decisions. The cause and effect goes both directions.So, for example, if a country enacts a giant tax cut that increases its budget deficit, it is effectively lowering its savings rate \u2014 which tends to increase its trade deficit.That, of course, is exactly the fiscal policy choice the United States has made, so the tax cut passed late last year will tend to increase the trade deficit relative to its level if tax rates had remained unchanged.But don\u2019t trade deficits mean fewer jobs?Maybe.It is true that a trade deficit subtracts from a country\u2019s gross domestic product. G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within a country\u2019s borders, so when a country is selling less stuff abroad than it buys from abroad, the country is making less stuff, and as a result there are fewer jobs. This piece of the Trump theory of trade is true.But the flow of capital into the country \u2014 the inverse of the trade deficit \u2014 creates benefits that can be good for jobs, by encouraging more domestic investment.This isn\u2019t just an abstraction. It\u2019s what has happened between the United States and China for the last couple of decades. China has had consistent trade surpluses, but it did not want its currency to rise in a way that would undermine its exporters. So money has flowed from China into the United States \u2014 both from the Chinese government\u2019s purchases of United States Treasury bonds and more recently in the form of direct investment from Chinese companies into the United States.When you see a headline about a Chinese company buying American hotels or factories, you\u2019re seeing the flip side of the trade deficit Mr. Trump bemoans. (The same when a citizen of China buys a luxury apartment in a Trump tower.) Money flowing into a country is usually considered a good thing. It makes borrowing money cheaper, drives up stock prices and can mean more investment in new businesses.So does a trade deficit mean fewer jobs? It depends on which force is more economically powerful: fewer jobs creating exports or investment dollars flowing into the country.So which is it?It depends on what the country does with the investment that comes in.In theory, that money could go toward long-lasting investments with positive economic returns: new factories and equipment; education for the work force; new roads and bridges, or repairs and improvements to existing ones.Unfortunately, how countries use these capital inflows is not always so fruitful. In the United States, the influx of foreign capital in the mid-2000s went in large part to fuel an unsustainable housing and mortgage bubble. Greece\u2019s capital inflows in the same time period went to fund bloated public spending.When the world is flinging money at you, it\u2019s important to use it for something productive. It\u2019s not that trade deficits (and the capital inflows that are their flip side) don\u2019t matter \u2014 but just knowing the numbers doesn\u2019t tell you much about whether they are good, bad or indifferent.Wouldn\u2019t it be better if the U.S. didn\u2019t run a deficit?It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s even an option, because the dollar isn\u2019t used just in trade between the United States and other countries.The dollar is a global reserve currency, meaning that it is used around the world in transactions that have nothing to do with the United States. When a Malaysian company does business with a German company, in many cases it will do business in dollars; when wealthy people in Dubai or Singapore\u2019s government investment fund want to sock away money, they do so in large part in dollar assets.That creates upward pressure on the dollar for reasons unrelated to trade flows between the United States and its partners. That, in turn, makes the dollar stronger \u2014 and American exporters less competitive \u2014 than they would be in a world where nobody used the dollar for anything except commerce involving the United States.The roughly $500 billion trade deficit that the United States runs each year isn\u2019t just about poorly negotiated trade deals and currency manipulation by this or that country. It\u2019s also, to some degree, a byproduct of the central role the United States plays in the global financial system.There\u2019s even a name for this: the Triffin dilemma. In the mid-20th century, the economist Robert Triffin warned that the provider of the global reserve currency would need to run perpetual trade deficits to keep the world financial system from freezing, with those trade deficits potentially fueling domestic booms and busts.If having the global reserve currency means bleeding jobs overseas, why keep it?Be careful what you wish for.There\u2019s no doubt that maintaining the global reserve currency creates costs for the United States, namely a less competitive export industry.But it also creates a lot of advantages. Lower interest rates and higher stock prices are among them (though they have the downside of also feeding debt-driven booms and busts). Even more important is what the dollar\u2019s prominence in global finance does for America\u2019s place in the world.It helps ensure that the United States can afford to finance wars, and it gives the government greater ability to fight recessions and panics. A country experiencing a banking panic will see money sent out of the country, causing its currency to fall and its interest rates to rise. All that limits a government\u2019s options for fixing the problem. In 2008, when the United States experienced a near collapse of the banking system, the opposite happened.The centrality of the dollar to global finance gives the United States power on the global stage that no other country can match. It has enforced sanctions on Iran, Russia, North Korea and terrorist groups with the implicit threat of cutting off access to the dollar payments system for any bank in the world that does not cooperate with American foreign policy.Part of what makes the United States powerful is the great importance of the dollar to global finance. And part of the price the United States pays for that status is a stronger currency and higher trade deficits than would be the case otherwise.The debate over the trade deficit is about more than Mexico and China, cars and bananas, or winning and losing. It\u2019s about what makes America great, and which of the country\u2019s priorities should come first.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s School Safety Commission Won\u2019t Look at Guns, Betsy DeVos Says", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the federal commission on school safety set up this year after the Parkland, Fla., school massacre will not focus on the role guns play in school violence.The comments, provided in testimony before the Senate subcommittee that oversees education spending, perplexed senators who questioned how the commission, led by Ms. DeVos and convened by President Trump, could avoid the subject when it was a military-style assault rifle that left 17 students and staff dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\u201cThat\u2019s not part of the commission\u2019s charge, per se,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in response to a question from Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, about whether the commission would look at the role of firearms in the gun violence that has plagued the nation\u2019s schools.\u201cSo we\u2019ll look at gun violence in schools, but not look at guns? An interesting concept,\u201d Mr. Leahy said in response.Ms. DeVos\u2019s comments came about 24 hours before the commission\u2019s first public forum, scheduled for Wednesday at the Education Department, where it will solicit feedback on solutions to improve school safety. And it comes after months of criticism \u2014 including from the students who survived the Marjory Stoneman Douglas attack that in their response to the school shootings, the nation\u2019s political leaders have zeroed in on everything but guns.\u201cOur focus is on raising up successful, proven techniques and approaches to ensuring schools are safe,\u201d Ms. DeVos said.The commission\u2019s members include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. It is charged with bringing \u201cmeaningful and actionable recommendations to keep students safe at school.\u201dAmong other areas, the commission is slated to examine ratings systems for video games, the consumption of \u201cviolent entertainment\u201d and the effects of news media coverage of mass shootings. The group is also charged with considering whether to repeal a package of Obama-era school discipline policies targeted at addressing disciplinary policies that disproportionately affect minority students. The commission is also looking to fund and bolster mental health and school infrastructure resources.Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the department, clarified after the hearing that \u201cthe secretary and the commission continue to look at all issues the president asked the committee to study and are focused on making recommendations that the agencies, states and local communities can implement.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the commission cannot create or amend current gun laws \u2014 that is the Congress\u2019s job,\u201d Ms. Hill said.Bob Farrace, a spokesman for the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said, \u201cIf the commission won\u2019t address the role of guns in school violence, we hope that means it also won\u2019t recommend a proliferation of guns in schools \u2014 arming teachers, eliminating gun-free school zones and other ill-advised proposals that will make schools less safe.\u201dDuring the hearing, Ms. DeVos evaded questions that would draw her into the gun control debate.When Mr. Leahy asked whether she thought that an 18-year-old high school student should be able to walk into a store and purchase an AR-15 military-style weapon and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, Ms. DeVos pivoted.\u201cI know that this body and your counterparts have addressed a number of these issues, and I know that you\u2019re going to continue to debate them,\u201d she responded, adding that teenagers\u2019 access to guns was \u201cvery much a matter for debate.\u201dMr. Leahy replied, \u201cWell, you\u2019re studying things like how much time they spend on video games and all that, but you can go to a lot of other countries where they spend just as much time but have only a tiny fraction of the shootings that we do.\u201dSenator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, implored Ms. DeVos to look at the policies of other countries where school shootings are rare or nonexistent.Ms. Shaheen cited statistics showing that school shootings in the United States \u201coccur at a scale far beyond any other industrialized nation.\u201d Since 2009, she said, the United States has had 57 times as many school shootings as the rest of the Group of 7 large advanced economies combined \u2014 288 in American schools, compared with two in Canada and France, one in Germany and zero in Japan, Italy and Britain.\u201cIt does seem to me that you should think about reworking the mission of the commission,\u201d she said.Ms. DeVos said the commission would make its recommendations by the end of the year. Since the committee was announced in March, there has been at least one more mass shooting at a school.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Draw Workers, Employers Offer to Help With Student Loans", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserAs educational debt continues to mushroom, younger workers often have to choose between paying off their student loans and saving for retirement. Companies are starting to offer student loan payment benefits, in part to attract and keep workers in a strong economy.On Tuesday, Abbott, the pharmaceutical and medical products company, announced a new benefit to help its employees pay off their student debt while still building their retirement nest eggs.The benefit is being offered in response to financial challenges facing young employees, who often report \u201ccrippling\u201d student debt obligations, and as a way to make the company appealing to workers, said Stephen R. Fussell, executive vice president of human resources at Abbott.Under the new Freedom 2 Save program, employees who contribute at least 2 percent of their pay toward their student loans \u2014 as verified periodically by an outside contractor \u2014 will receive a 5 percent match in their 401(k) retirement savings plan. Abbott offers the same match to employees who contribute at least 2 percent of their pay to their 401(k).So, for instance, if an employee is making $70,000 and uses at least $1,400 to pay down student debt, Abbott will contribute $3,500 to the employee\u2019s 401(k) plan, a spokeswoman said.That benefit can add up over time. Abbott offered this illustration of the program\u2019s impact: Employees who joins Abbott with a salary of $70,000 could accumulate $54,000 in their 401(k) account over 10 years, assuming a 6 percent average annual return and yearly merit increases of 3 percent, without any retirement contribution of their own.The company expects that some younger employees who are already contributing at least 2 percent to the retirement plan may divert their contribution to pay down their student debt, while continuing to get the 5 percent retirement match, the spokeswoman said. (One difference: Contributions to the 401(k) plan reduce taxable income, while their contributions to pay student loans are made with taxed earnings.)Financial advisers say a big concern they hear from clients, in particular those who are in their 20s or 30s, is how to manage student debt. So employers that offer a student loan benefit are likely to attract younger workers, said Michael Kalscheur, a senior financial consultant with Castle Wealth Advisors in Indianapolis.\u201cEmployees need it and value it,\u201d he said.What sets Abbott\u2019s program apart, Mr. Fussell said, is that it promotes both paying down student debt and saving for retirement. He added that putting off retirement saving can be costly: Every decade of delay roughly doubles the amount needed to be saved.\u201cIt all starts with starting early,\u201d he said.Americans collectively owe more than $1.5 trillion in student loans. Abbott, citing federal statistics, said the average monthly payment for borrowers ages 20 to 30 was $350, which often means there is nothing left for traditional retirement plans.Many of Abbott\u2019s workers have advanced degrees in science, engineering and business. The company last year hired more than 1,000 people under 35 in the United States, the vast majority of whom had college degrees. More than a third of those ages 31 to 35 had a doctorate, and the same percentage had a master\u2019s degree, so their debt is relatively high, Mr. Fussell said.Rariety Monford, 26, an engineer in Abbott\u2019s professional development program, said she was eager to take advantage of the new benefit. Ms. Monford, who is from Cincinnati, graduated from North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University in 2016. She said she had chosen the school even though it would cost her more as an out-of-state student. With about $60,000 in student debt, she makes about $800 a month in loan payments. Paying off the debt, she said, is her \u201cNo. 1\u201d goal.Retirement, Ms. Monford admits, seems far away, so it\u2019s helpful that her employer is looking ahead for her. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of the immediate, here and now,\u201d she said.Here are some questions and answers about employer education benefits:What if my employer does not offer student loan benefits?Workplace student loan benefits are still scarce, Mr. Kalscheur said, but many employers do offer some sort of match for retirement contributions. He advised young workers to try to make at least the minimum contribution to their 401(k) \u2014 often, 3 percent of their pay \u2014 to get the match. Then they can put anything extra they earn \u2014 perhaps from a second job or a bonus \u2014 toward paying down their student debt faster. They can increase their retirement contribution in the future, he said, when they are more financially stable.Is there a way to lower my student debt payments? Do employers offer other types of help with education costs?About half of employers offer some type of tuition help to employees, the Society for Human Resource Management found. Typically, the aid is offered to those who earn degrees in areas related to their job. Employers (11 percent) are increasingly offering payroll deductions for contributions to 529 college savings plans; however, just 2 percent offer a matching contribution, according to the society.Advertisement"}

Mr. Breaux was a chief deputy whip for the Senate Democrats.As former leaders of our parties in the United States Senate, we know what it takes to achieve a bipartisan breakthrough in Congress. For all the talk of discord in Washington, we see the possibility of finding common ground on a divisive issue. As surprising as it may sound, climate change offers a chance for both parties to come together and deliver a victory \u2014 and cash dividends \u2014 to the American people.Climate change is one of the great challenges of our generation. The politics of the issue have been divisive for decades and a new approach is needed to address this urgent problem.Both Democrats and Republicans can find that solution. America has always come together at moments of crisis or opportunity, from the shadows of economic depression and world war to the promise of the technology revolution and our rise to global energy dominance. America now must marshal its political will to lead on climate as well.There is only one lever powerful enough to solve this problem at the required scale and speed. Congress should approve legislation to place a meaningful fee on carbon-dioxide emissions that ripples through all sectors of our economy, and return the revenues it generates to the American people in the form of cash payments. We must set it high enough to encourage a turn to cleaner energy sources and accelerate our transition to a low-carbon future. If America leads on carbon pricing, the rest of the world will follow.The plan is simple and elegant. It calls for an initial fee of $40 on every ton of carbon-dioxide emissions at the source, and raising it each year until we reach the necessary emissions reductions as businesses and consumers move to cleaner sources of energy. All revenue would then be disbursed to Americans. A family of four would receive approximately $2,000 a year. We would then export this approach and leadership on this issue to every corner of the global economy, while protecting the competitiveness of American companies.Economists have long agreed that putting a price on emissions is the most cost-efficient way to tackle climate change. The ground rules make intuitive sense: The more businesses pollute, the more they pay; the less they pollute, the more they come out ahead. That goes for consumers and the cars they drive as well.There are various policy details that will need to be addressed. But this is the only realistic, workable path now open to us if we want to solve one of the most daunting challenges of our time. We must put a meaningful price on carbon in America, and then convince the rest of the world to follow our lead.To do so, we must set our politics aside for the greater good. America has done it before, time after time. We believe the country will do so again.There are various policy details that will need to be addressed.

The conference, which styles itself as an alternative to a liberal culture of feminism that many Republicans characterize as oppressive, attracted an estimated 1,000 young conservative women ages 17 to 24 for sessions like \u201cHow Political Correctness Is Making Everyone Stupid\u201d and \u201cIn the Age of Resist: Be Revolutionary.\u201d\u201cThis is my reset for the year,\u201d said Maggie Anders, a 19-year-old student at University of Louisiana at Lafayette who described herself as a former \u201cradical leftist\u201d who had a \u201cleftist haircut\u201d of bangs and shoulder-length hair.\u201cJust one crack in the liberal facade is so important,\u201d Ms. Anders said. \u201cThat\u2019s all you need.\u201dSeveral women described sharing a politics of aggrievement that grew out of their experiences as young conservatives in America today. More than any political ideology, the women at the summit appeared united by their criticism of recent social movements \u2014 such as the March for Our Lives against gun violence, the #MeToo campaign to raise awareness for sexual assault and harassment, or the Black Lives Matter movement against police brutality. In their view, there was nothing worse than being labeled racist, sexist or homophobic by \u201cthe left,\u201d because liberal name-calling was worse than any sin that could precede it.\u201cThe most important thing we need to do is build the wall,\u201d said the teenager, Morgan Tapley.Though there was none of the guttural cheering and angry taunts that often emanate from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign-style rallies, the president\u2019s hallmark rhetoric and propensity to stretch the truth was also ever-present.Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, at one point suggested falsely that Stanford University had stopped teaching classes that include William Shakespeare because he was a white man.

{"Headline": "Maybe the Gig Economy Isn\u2019t Reshaping Work After All", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou can see the gig economy everywhere but in the statistics.For years, economists, pundits and policymakers have grappled with the rise of Uber, the growth of temporary work and the fissuring of the relationship between companies and their workers. Optimists cheered the flexibility offered by the freelance life. Pessimists fretted about the disappearance of traditional jobs, with the benefits and legal protections they provided.Roughly 10 percent of American workers in 2017 were employed in some form of what the government calls \u201calternative work arrangements,\u201d a broad category including Uber drivers, freelance writers and people employed through temporary-help agencies \u2014 essentially anyone whose main source of work comes outside a traditional employment relationship. Far from a boom in gig work, that represents a slight decline from 2005, when about 11 percent of workers fell into those categories.\u201cI think everybody\u2019s narrative got blown up,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.Mr. Strain and other experts cautioned that the data released on Thursday did not signal the American workplace had remained static over the past decade. The government\u2019s numbers, by design, do not include people who do gig or freelance work in addition to traditional jobs, and they may not fully capture income-generating activities that people might not consider \u201cwork,\u201d like renting out a home on Airbnb.\u201cIn my view, it\u2019s this domestic outsourcing that is the big change in why wages don\u2019t rise and why workers feel so insecure,\u201d said Eileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal think tank. \u201cAnd we have only the most indirect data to show it.\u201dRafael Sanchez is one of those who may fall into a gray area in the statistics. He moved to the United States from Mexico 16 years ago, eventually settling in New Brunswick, N.J., and was initially able to find steady work, including a five-year stint as a full-time employee of a window factory.But Mr. Sanchez was laid off in 2007, and he has since worked for a series of temporary-help and staffing agencies, moving from factory to factory and warehouse to warehouse, earning $9 an hour to pack boxes and do other manual labor. The positions can last months or even years without turning into permanent jobs working directly for the factories, which offer better pay and room for advancement.\u201cThey\u2019re not jobs where you can get ahead,\u201d Mr. Sanchez said through an interpreter.Economists have long argued that the most visible kinds of gig work are a relatively small part of the overall labor market, and that nonstandard work arrangements long predated the emergence of app-based platforms like Uber and TaskRabbit. (Uber\u2019s impact was somewhat visible in the data: The number of independent contractors in the transportation and utilities industry increased by about 200,000 from 2005 to 2017.)The report on Thursday did not break out online workers; a follow-up report scheduled for September will do so. But it portrayed an alternative work force far broader than the one typically conjured by the term \u201cgig economy.\u201dThe largest category of alternative workers, independent contractors, are disproportionately in their mid-40s or older and common in sectors like construction that have not been disrupted by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. They earn about as much, on average, as standard employees, and are relatively happy with their arrangements: Nearly eight in 10 say they prefer being an independent contractor to being an employee.The picture looks different for on-call and temporary workers, who tend to be younger, earn less and rarely have access to employer-provided health or retirement benefits. They are also far more likely to say they would prefer traditional work.Neither category, however, has grown as a share of the work force since 2005. Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a staffing firm in Chicago, said the narrative of the gig economy had long been overblown. \u201cBecause of social media and stories out there, I think the perception of the contingent work force has been inflated,\u201d he said.Lawrence Mishel, an economist for the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute and a long-time skeptic of the significance of the gig economy, said it wasn\u2019t surprising that the report showed relatively little impact from online marketplaces.\u201cA lot of this hype has been driven by the tech world believing that they are the center of the universe,\u201d Mr. Mishel said.But Mr. Mishel said he was surprised by the slower growth in other areas. And he wasn\u2019t the only one perplexed by the report.Economists offered various explanations for the discrepancy. One possibility is that the boom in gig-type jobs was real but that as the economy has improved, more people have been able to find traditional work. Part-time work, which surged in the recession, has fallen in the recovery, and employment by temporary-help services has leveled off. If true of alternative work more broadly, that would suggest that what many commenters interpreted as a structural shift in the economy was instead a temporary result of a weak labor market.It is also possible that the new data understates real changes in the nature of work. The government\u2019s standard tools for measuring employment have struggled to capture the shifting employment landscape. For example, the Current Population Survey, the monthly survey used to calculate the unemployment rate and other key measures, shows that self-employment is falling, even as tax data from the Internal Revenue Service has shown the opposite.\u201cThe questions on our standard surveys don\u2019t probe into the nature of these arrangements,\u201d said Katharine G. Abraham, a University of Maryland economist who served as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics under President Bill Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking the right questions, and they\u2019re hard to answer anyway.\u201dThe bureau\u2019s data comes from an add-on to the Current Population Survey intended to fill in some of those gaps. But it has shortcomings. The extra questions, for example, were asked only of people considered \u201cemployed\u201d in the standard survey. That might leave out people who earn income through activities that they do not see as a job, such as selling products online or working erratically as a freelancer.Professor Abraham said there was evidence that workers struggled to accurately report and classify work that did not fall neatly into traditional buckets. Some Uber drivers, for example, might consider themselves employees of the ride-sharing company, even though legally classified as independent contractors. Some Amazon warehouse workers might report being employees of the e-commerce giant, even if employed by an outside staffing firm.Professor Abraham and other experts said, however, that if there had been a big rise in alternative work, it should have shown up in the latest survey. The fact that it did not, they said, suggested that any shift had been relatively modest.\u201cDefinitely, the vast majority of individuals are still W-2 employees working in traditional jobs,\u201d Professor Katz said. He said it was too early to account for the divergence between the government findings and his study with Professor Krueger.Teasing out exactly what has and has not changed will require more data, which may not be coming. The Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2016 received funding to revive its survey on alternative work, but the Trump administration has not requested funding to run the survey on a regular basis.\u201cThe fact that our last data point on this was in 2005 makes it so hard to figure out what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, director of economic research for the job-search site Indeed. \u201cMeasurement is important, and this is why it\u2019s important to fund data analysis.\u201dNelson D. Schwartz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It could put them at odds with some other nations in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meet this coming week.\u201cSaudi Aramco has always carried the kingdom on its back,\u201d said Jim Krane, an energy and geopolitics fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute. \u201cBut to support the kingdom in the coming decades, it needs to transform itself.\u201dIn essence, the crown prince wants the kingdom and Saudi Aramco to plan for the day far in the future when the oil age draws to a close. The present is already making the crude business look less attractive. Countries around the world are shifting to renewable power, while technological advances like electric cars are eroding demand for oil.To diversify, Aramco is building vast new facilities that will turn crude into more profitable petrochemicals, and it is increasingly drilling for gas. It is also working with Google to establish data centers in the kingdom to develop data-analytics and cloud-computing capacity.But the initial public offering will draw scrutiny to a company whose inner workings have long been kept out of sight. Pressure from investors, combined with a prince in a hurry to transform his country, could jeopardize the long-term approach that has made Aramco a dominant force.For two years, a special team has been working with an array of Western bankers and advisers, preparing for how to handle quarterly reporting of results and coordinate trading between stock exchanges. A local Saudi listing seems certain, but London, New York and bourses in Asia are still in the running for a piece.Amin H. Nasser, Aramco\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview that the company was preparing to list in all those locations. Speaking with a picture of the crown prince in the background, he added, \u201cIt makes us ready for any market the government decides.\u201dOthman al-Khowaiter was born in 1933, the same year that Standard Oil of California secured a sweeping oil concession from the founder of Saudi Arabia. The Khowaiter family was made up of poor farmers, and as a child, he worked as a houseboy. He would follow the same path as the country\u2019s nascent energy business.The founder, King Abdulaziz ibn Saud, needed cash to run his country, created from a patchwork of tribes. The American company, the predecessor to what is now Chevron, paid him 50,000 British pounds\u2019 worth of gold for the contract. The company sent teams of American geologists to explore Saudi Arabia\u2019s deserts, accompanied by Bedouin guides and soldiers from the king to ward off raiders.Lacking today\u2019s sophisticated tools to find oil and gas underground, they interpreted clues on the surface \u2014 fossils, domes and folds in the rock \u2014 that hinted oil may be trapped underneath. One geologist, Ernie Berg, noticed that a wadi, or ancient riverbed, took a mysterious turn. He surmised that the bend had been caused by a large uplift, indicating an underlying oil field.It led to the 170-mile-long Ghawar field, which remains by far the world\u2019s largest oil discovery. Such finds altered Saudi Arabia\u2019s prospects. After a pause during World War II, money started coming in, and jobs were suddenly on offer for the new company, the Arabian American Oil Company, or Aramco.Aramco soon became a magnet for men like Mr. Khowaiter. In a society that had long been defined by tribal connections, the company modeled itself as a meritocracy offering young hopefuls the chance for advancement. Mr. Khowaiter spent several days in 1949 crossing the country, hitching rides with passing trucks from his home in central Saudi Arabia, to Dhahran on the eastern coast, where Aramco was ramping up its operations.\u201cI heard about people working for Aramco, that the door was open to getting an education,\u201d Mr. Khowaiter said, over tea and pecan pie.Back then, Al Khobar \u2014 now a major port near Dhahran \u2014 was a medieval-looking walled town that lacked the facilities, roads or people needed for an international oil hub. Saudi employees there lived in palm-thatched huts and were plagued by diseases like malaria.Mr. Khowaiter, who was sent by the Saudi government to study petroleum engineering at the University of Texas, eventually spent 35 years at the company, rising to become vice president of drilling before retiring in 1996. He still lives in Dhahran, now Aramco\u2019s headquarters, in a gated community dotted with date palm trees known as the \u201cgolden ghetto,\u201d a wealthy enclave with a Mexican theme restaurant and a golf course, among other entertainment.Stories like Mr. Khowaiter\u2019s are common, the most famous being Ali al-Naimi\u2019s. Mr. Naimi, the son of a pearl diver and his Bedouin wife, began studying at an Aramco-sponsored school, and was first hired by the company as an office boy at 12 years old. He embraced American culture, even learning to play shortstop in baseball, and pestered the company to send him abroad \u2014 first to Beirut, Lebanon, and then to the United States, where he earned his undergraduate and master\u2019s degrees.In 1988, Mr. Naimi became Aramco\u2019s chief executive, the first Saudi in the position. In 1995, he was named Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister.\u201cWithout Aramco, I don\u2019t know what life would be,\u201d Mr. Khowaiter said. \u201cWe would not be at the level we are now.\u201dAramco\u2019s path has long been driven by politics. Riyadh\u2019s relationship with the United States frayed during the Arab-Israeli war in 1973. Washington supported Israel. In retaliation, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states imposed an oil embargo on the United States. That same year, the Saudis took a 25 percent stake in Aramco, eventually gaining full control by 1980.The American influence is still apparent. Many expatriates stayed, and American companies kept buying and selling Saudi oil. Unlike the rest of Saudi Arabia, where recreation and entertainment are largely forbidden, Aramco compounds have baseball diamonds and movie theaters. Men and women work together and mingle in public. English is widely spoken.Saudi Aramco\u2019s success, in many ways, is tied to its roots. It is run more like a private company than a state-run fief, with top executives typically chosen for competence rather than connections. Its employees are efficient, skilled and highly educated, making the company an outlier in a kingdom where state control has stifled innovation and limited the kinds of opportunities that should be available in such a wealthy country.The company is widely praised for embracing technology and, unlike many government-controlled energy companies, finishing projects on time and on budget. While Aramco does not disclose its financial results, analysts say its large, long-running fields most likely mean that the costs of bringing the oil out of the ground are among the lowest in the industry. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian market research company, estimates Saudi Aramco\u2019s operating costs to be $4.88 for each barrel of oil. Last year, Exxon Mobil reported worldwide production costs of $10.12 a barrel.Its Saudi parentage gives the company an advantage over the likes of Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell. Aramco doesn\u2019t face the relentless quarter-to-quarter pressure to produce profit. It can take a really, really long-term view, and over the years has persistently opted for the most advanced \u2014 and expensive \u2014 technology to ensure it will be able to pump vast quantities of oil for decades.\u201cSaudi Aramco has a much better business model than the international majors,\u201d said J. Robinson West, chairman of the BCG Center for Energy Impact, a consultancy.When Aramco first drilled at the Shaybah oil field in the 1990s, it picked a then unusual and costly process known as horizontal drilling. Rather than exploring straight down into the ground, Aramco\u2019s wells lace through Shaybah. One has so many branches it is known as the \u201cfish bone.\u201dThey more than compensate for the cost, though. During the process, the wells have more contact with oil-bearing rocks to produce more crude, while expending less energy on pumping.This approach is one reason giant fields like Ghawar continue to produce despite having been tapped for decades. Fields in areas like the North Sea in Europe, or in the Gulf of Mexico, have declined sharply.\u201cSaudi Aramco has the longest time horizon in the industry,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, an oil historian.With oil reserves pegged at about 260 billion barrels \u2014 far more than any publicly listed competitor \u2014 Aramco has around 70 years\u2019 worth of resources at present production levels. It has the two largest oil fields ever discovered. And more are coming, with the recently developed Manifa capable of producing 900,000 barrels of oil a day. Western oil majors only rarely get access to such giant deposits.\u201cWe are in a unique position where we have exclusive access to all of Saudi Arabia\u2019s fields,\u201d said Suha Kayum, an Aramco research scientist. \u201cWe basically develop our fields to last for centuries.\u201dAbout an hour\u2019s drive from Dhahran, a gargantuan industrial complex dominates the desert landscape. Two square miles, it looks like a small city, except people are eerily absent and the streets are lined with pipes, storage tanks and smokestacks. Sadara, as this complex is called, represents what could be the new Aramco.The ambitious project, which began operating last year, is the result of a $20 billion investment by the company and its partner, Dow Chemical. In all, 26 separate plants brew an array of petrochemicals from oil and gas for foam, insulation and plastics, as well as chemicals that will go into adhesives, coatings and cosmetics.The idea is not only to feed expanding world markets for these products, but to sow the seeds of a diversified Saudi economy. Officials hope Sadara will drive growth in industries like furniture and car parts, providing jobs to the country\u2019s young and fast-growing labor force.\u201cWe see the world changing,\u201d said Abdulaziz al-Judaimi, Aramco\u2019s senior vice president for chemicals and refining. \u201cIt is very much for us to read the future, and engineer our future in a way that we keep our market share.\u201dBut whether politics and profits can peacefully coexist in this blend is a big uncertainty for Saudi Aramco.Investors in a public Saudi Aramco may want to know why the company has research centers across the globe when others have been cutting back.They might question why the company needs to lend executives and engineers to the government to carry out pet projects for the kingdom, like building a new university on the Red Sea.Or they might wonder why Saudi Aramco maintains as much as two million barrels a day of spare pumping capacity for the country to intervene in world markets, an amount that is equal to the total oil production of Nigeria.\u201cThey have a gold-plating mentality,\u201d Floris Ansingh, a former head of Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s operations in Saudi Arabia, said of Aramco. \u201cThey are very demanding on the technical side. They act like a rich company.\u201dAfter a public listing, he said, \u201cthis mentality has to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He did not respond to colleagues\u2019 calls and emails on Sunday \u2014 a rarity \u2014 and on Monday morning, an National Economic Council meeting was unexpectedly canceled.Colleagues said they had grown worried about Mr. Kudlow in recent days, particularly after a White House briefing last week, before the Group of 7 meeting, in which Mr. Kudlow appeared visibly tired and uncharacteristically frail.On Monday night, friends and colleagues expressed concern for his health. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, praised Mr. Kudlow in a brief interview. \u201cLarry Kudlow is the salt of the earth, and a true patriot,\u201d Mr. Hassett said. \u201cAnd our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family tonight.\u201dStephen Moore, a Heritage Foundation economist and longtime friend of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s, said in an email Monday night that \u201che\u2019s ok and will be back on the job,\u201d in response to a question about Mr. Kudlow\u2019s condition.Mr. Kudlow is a smoker, and was sometimes seen outside the West Wing with a cigarette. He has told people the stress of the director\u2019s job has surprised him, in part because of the constant level of toxic infighting among White House advisers, which he was not expecting.Mr. Kudlow dove into the job with gusto, taking on a wide portfolio that included the president\u2019s roller-coaster trade agenda \u2014 including on-again-off-again tariff threats against China, Mexico, Canada, the European Union and others \u2014 and denuclearization negotiations with North Korea.

{"Headline": "A Peace Deal for South Sudan Is Signed. Will It Last?", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president of South Sudan and his former vice president signed a peace deal on Wednesday in a bid to end their country\u2019s protracted civil war.Jacob Bul, co-founder of a South Sudanese artists\u2019 collective called Ana Taban, or I\u2019m Tired, said the country needed a peace deal that represented the interests of all people in South Sudan, rather than the interests of a few.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a mere signature on paper, but a deal in letter and spirit,\u201d Mr. Bul said.Less than two years after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011, clashes broke out between forces loyal to Mr. Kiir and those backing Mr. Machar, then the vice president. The clashes soon erupted into a civil war that divided the country along ethnic lines, with the Dinka ethnic majority supporting Mr. Kiir, and the Nuer ethnic group aligned with Mr. Machar.The new agreement combines elements of an earlier deal and includes a unilateral cease-fire.It calls for building a \u201cnational army, police and other security organs of an all-inclusive character that shall be free from tribalism and ethnic affiliations.\u201d It states that efforts to rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure and basic services \u201cshall be intensified.\u201dIt also allows the government of Sudan to ensure the security of South Sudan\u2019s contested oil fields in the north of the country. It urges the two governments to work to rehabilitate the oil fields and resume production, with the proceeds to be used \u201cto improve the livelihood of South Sudanese and to alleviate poverty and suffering.\u201dThe Khartoum talks were mediated by President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda.Humanitarian workers in South Sudan are skeptical that the agreement will be meaningful. Elysia Buchanan, who advises the aid group Oxfam on issues related to South Sudan, said Oxfam had recently heard accounts from victims of abuse at the hands of the warring parties.\u201cWe will be most hopeful when any new agreement translates to real changes on the ground,\u201d Ms. Buchanan said, \u201cwhen we hear from South Sudanese civilians that they feel safe from attacks and rape, free from rising hunger \u2014 which is being driven by ongoing conflict \u2014 and they can once again pursue their livelihoods and education without fear.\u201dPrevious cease-fires have largely been ignored by both sides, and fighting has cut off some regions from emergency aid.Brian Adeba, deputy director of policy for the Enough Project, a Washington-based watchdog group, said that while the peace deal could be a positive first step, there was much work to be done.\u201cOne of the things that we have to really gird against is the danger of an agreement that becomes some elite pact that fails to address the structural problems that are at the route of this conflict,\u201d Mr. Adeba said, adding that civic society organizations should be involved in the discussion.The war has fragmented the nation into several groups. Framing it as only a dispute between Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar would \u201cperpetuate the same issues that led to war in the first place\u201d Mr. Adeba said.\u201cIt has evolved significantly. There are other actors involved in it who have grievances, both armed and unarmed,\u201d Mr. Adeba said. \u201cTherefore, any discussion on a deal must involve everyone at the table \u2014 those who are armed and those who don\u2019t have arms \u2014 because a lot of sectors and quarters in South Sudan have grievances with the government.\u201d\u201cThe peace agreement will not resolve everything immediately,\u201d Mr. Adeba said. \u201cBut the first process is to have an agreement so that the guns are silent. Then, when the guns are silent, you can start doing other things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit Nightmare: 17-Mile Traffic Jams at the Dover Border", "Date": "2018-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDOVER, England \u2014 Trucks rumble nonstop through Britain\u2019s busiest ferry port, one every few minutes, some headed for France, others arriving here in Dover, where they trundle along an elevated roadway that scales the town\u2019s striking white cliffs.But a cloud is hanging over the ceaseless flow of cargo to and from continental Europe \u2014 and it is more than a fog blown in from the English Channel.Of the thousands of trucks that use Dover each day, only a fraction are stopped by British officials. That is because both Britain and France are members of the European Union and of its customs union, which removes the need for border checks on most goods.Yet when Britain quits the bloc, a process known as Brexit, all that could change, and the question of how, when \u2014 or whether \u2014 to abandon a European customs union has divided and paralyzed the British cabinet.So vicious is the political infighting over what might happen here that there is talk of a snap general election, or a leadership challenge against Prime Minister Theresa May from her party\u2019s restive, hard-line pro-Brexit faction, whose cheerleader, the lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, has accused her government of \u201cabject weakness.\u201dPassions are inflamed because Brexit supporters see leaving the customs union as \u201ca totemic embodiment of what it actually means to leave the European Union,\u201d said Simon Fraser, a former head of Britain\u2019s foreign office, now managing partner at Flint Global, a consultancy.\u201cThey see the risk that Britain will leave the European Union legally, but stay within a customs union and so remain bound by European Union trading rules,\u201d Mr. Fraser added.Those who want to keep close ties to the bloc point to warnings that quitting a customs union could cause chaos at ports and cost firms more than $25 billion a year.Certainly, Mrs. May could pay a high political price if she gets things wrong.Only around 2 percent of trucks carry goods from outside the European Union. Those require a customs clearance, but that is done at separate centers away from the port and can take anywhere from 20 minutes to several days, said Richard Christian, head of policy and communications at the Port of Dover.In the absence of the customs union, every single truck would, in theory, be subject to such a close examination. Yet, even a modest, two-minute delay in processing truck arrivals could cause a 17-mile line of traffic, says Mr. Christian. He recalled disruption along those lines following strikes that brought gridlock, leaving trucks waiting for hours on highways outside the port and on the other side of the English Channel in France.\u201cThere were supermarket shelves empty and cars not being built; we know what happens when traffic can\u2019t move across the channel,\u201d he said.Officially, Mrs. May is committed to quitting Europe\u2019s customs union because continued membership would prevent Britain from striking independent trade deals \u2014 a primary selling point of the Brexiteers.She favors a \u201ccustoms partnership\u201d under which Britain would collect tariffs for the European Union on many goods but would be able to strike some separate trade agreements. Though complex, this would keep Britain close to many economic rules and strictures of its biggest trading partner.For that reason it infuriates hard-line Brexit supporters who want to break free and detach Britain from the orbit of Brussels.Brexiteers prefer another plan called \u201cmax fac\u201d \u2014 short for maximum facilitation \u2014 that accepts the need for customs controls but uses technology to keep checks light.However, the \u201cmax fac\u201d plan could take three years to introduce and add \u00a320 billion, or $26.6 billion, a year to businesses\u2019 bureaucratic costs, said Jon Thompson, the head of Britain\u2019s tax collection agency.The European Union, whose agreement is necessary for any plan, seems skeptical about both options, and experts doubt that technology for either will be ready by the end of a proposed standstill transition period under which Britain is to obey European Union rules until December 2020.So, to the fury of some Brexit supporters, Mrs. May has suggested that Britain could stay in a customs union with the European Union beyond 2020, if technological solutions to the Irish border problems have not been found by then.Seen from Dover, the outline of a workable replacement for a customs union that can process the huge volume of cross-channel trade looks less visible than the French coast on a misty day.After decades of European integration, companies assume they can move goods freely across frontiers; components are shipped so that they arrive \u201cjust in time\u201d to go on auto factory assembly lines without storage, and pharmaceuticals and food also need to arrive fast.\u201cGoods worth $159 billion passed through the port in 2015, representing around 17 percent of the UK\u2019s entire trade in goods by value,\u201d it said.Were all trucks to face customs checks \u2014 rather than the current 2 percent \u2014 there would be no space for them in Dover\u2019s port, Mr. Christian says.\u201cAll the land is reclaimed, we have the famous white cliffs behind, we have sea and breakwaters in front and we have a town to the side,\u201d he added.Building customs points or truck parks outside the port would take time and money, but until decisions about the customs union are made, nothing can be done.\u201cWe need to know now what we need to deliver,\u201d Mr. Christian said. \u201cWe need to know as soon as humanly possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Women Can Drive, but Here\u2019s the Real Roadblock", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAL KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia \u2014 With her bubble-gum pink hair and stylishly ripped jeans, Doaa Bassem goes a long way to redefining what it means to be a Saudi woman these days.At age 14, she learned how to change the oil of her father\u2019s car and dreamed of owning a classic Trans Am. Although she assumed she would be barred from driving the sleek, loud muscle car, she wanted the fun of taking the engine apart and rebuilding it.By 17, she had entered into an arranged marriage. Within a year, she had given birth to a child, divorced, then remarried and divorced again.\u201cI\u2019ve always been a tomboy and a rebel,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, others are thinking more like me. Parents have started to understand that marriage isn\u2019t everything, that girls might want a different life. And society is starting to accept this, too.\u201dAccording to the Saudi ruler, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and their many supporters, the monarchy is verging on a great feminist leap forward. The change reflects the tectonic shifts in a society that have helped women reach the pinnacles of academic and professional success, combined with the effects of globalization, which have brought more openness to the kingdom than at anytime in its recent history.The new law allowing women to drive removes a lightning rod for critics and allies who have long derided the Saudis, a bastion of conservative Islamic orthodoxy, for following a repressive practice embraced by groups like the Taliban and the Islamic State. The new law also dovetails with the monarchy\u2019s ambitious economic changes that aim to wean Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s top producer, from dependence on oil and to diversify the economy \u2014 shifts that require women to be workers and consumers.However, while the joy shared by tens of thousands of Saudi women over the right to take the wheel is undeniable, a bright red line keeps them from equality \u2014 the restrictive guardianship system. It is a mix of law and custom under which women remain dependents of male relatives \u2014 a father, husband, brother, uncle or son \u2014 their whole lives.Guardianship ensures that the gender balance of power at home, work and perhaps even on the roads favors men by allowing them to consent \u2014 or not \u2014 to letting their women work, travel or receive medical care.Beneath her free-spirited life, Ms. Bassem is legally tied to the consent powers of her brother, her current guardian, who has respected her choices. He helped find a progressively minded landlord to rent an apartment to her and acts as her guarantor. \u201cPeople get nervous when ladies live alone,\u201d she said.The rulers have announced that Saudi women will not need a guardian to apply for driver\u2019s education or receive a driver\u2019s license. But that is one of the rare exceptions where men have no role over women\u2019s lives.Saudi citizens still need to contend with the top-down system of governing in which they all are vulnerable to royal commands, whims and punishments.Eight leading women\u2019s rights activists remain behind bars, according to Amnesty International. They are facing serious charges, including spying and sedition.\u201cThere is no doubt that there is a deep transformation happening in Saudi now,\u201d said Kristin Smith Diwan, the senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \u201cBut we are also witnessing a horrible crackdown on some of the people that made these changes possible. What\u2019s not changing is the nature of authority.\u201dThe crown prince has sent mixed messages about the guardianship system. In interviews with American media, he has declared Saudi men and women absolutely equal. Last year, a royal decree commanded government agencies to allow women access to many services without their guardians \u2014 and to list those services to thwart bureaucratic abuses. The lists, however, have not yet been made public.The structure of the guardianship system, which in many ways mimics the ruler\u2019s power over his subjects, means that individual freedom for women is precarious. Last year, a chilling case came to light when a 29-year-old woman, Maryam al-Otaibi, ran away from home, where she claimed male relatives had abused her. She fled to Riyadh, the capital, but her father \u2014 her legal guardian \u2014 filed a criminal complaint, saying she had been \u201cdisobedient\u201d after he commanded her to return home. She was jailed for more than 100 days before she won the right to break free from him.Many women in the fields of social work, women\u2019s empowerment and family law prefer to focus on the gains women have achieved, not the limitations that remain.Since the crown prince took power last year, judges who once would have automatically given fathers custody of children in divorce cases have started allowing some mothers custody instead. Women no longer need a guardian to register a business. More private companies are hiring women for technical and manual labor jobs, helping pull poor families or single mothers up the socio-economic ladder.A catalyst of social change, Ms. Rashid said, is the growing number of Saudi women who are graduating from college, traveling abroad on scholarships and entering the work force.\u201cSaudi Arabia is not black and white,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are incredibly diverse. The biggest engine that has driven these changes is economical. History shows this is the case everywhere in the world.\u201dIn the eastern province city of Al Khobar, Seham al-Amri, 39, is one of a significant number of Saudi women who have capitalized on the changes to make a better life.From the time she was young, she was the clever one in her family. She attended a public university and studied Arabic literature, married at 19, raised five children and taught at a girls\u2019 school.Three years ago, however, when the kingdom was pushing businesses to hire more Saudi citizens, she sought work in the private sector, where pay was much higher and opportunities for women were growing. A leading telecom company offered her a sales position, but Ms. Amri\u2019s husband \u2014 her guardian \u2014 refused to consent.Ms. Amri went behind his back. She took her brother to the company to act as her guardian, and she got the job. Her stellar sales record made her a standout candidate this spring when car companies were seeking Saudi women to help sell vehicles to the rush of new drivers they were expecting.Her husband still disliked the idea, she said, but her new company, the Saudi owner of the Range Rover franchise, did not ask her for a guardian\u2019s approval.She sold seven cars in her first three weeks. Her husband, she said, likes the larger paycheck she brings home. He also has grudgingly accepted her work because relatives and neighbors have not gossiped about it. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want any shame on the family,\u201d she said. \u201cAs for my family, they are all as proud as can be.\u201dA Saudi public opinion poll, commissioned in February by Uber, showed that more than 90 percent of respondents felt positively about lifting the driving ban.That has not diminished the sexism. A popular preacher last year strongly opposed letting women drive, saying their brains were half the size of men\u2019s. Several men said this week that they would stay home on Sunday, convinced that car accidents \u2014 already a problem in the country \u2014 would surge.The planned rollout for women drivers, despite months of buildup, has hit several bumps, partly because of insufficient driver\u2019s education programs and the overlapping bureaucracies needed to fulfill the royal decree.The government has said that women with valid licenses from abroad may obtain a Saudi license with minimal fuss. Several hundred will be ready to drive on Sunday.Yet for tens of thousands of others, the path to driving has been full of obstacles. Only a limited number of training courses have opened for women \u2014 and given the strict gender segregation in effect in schools and government agencies, it is challenging to staff them.Earlier this year, pilot driver\u2019s education programs were scrambling to find qualified women to instruct their Saudi sisters. That is how Sheikha al-Kadeeb, 29, who had been looking for work in finance, was recruited to teach driving.Ms. Kadeeb learned in Los Angeles, where she earned an M.B.A. She loved cruising California freeways in her Jeep Wrangler and jumped at the opportunity to impart her enthusiasm at home. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m on a mission,\u201d she said. \u201cI get a chance to help my country.\u201dParents and family members, meanwhile, have worried about what would happen to women if their cars broke down or the police pulled them over. Casual encounters with strange men are discomfiting to many Saudi women. Nor are some willing to risk the physical threats of being stuck alone.Another problem is the cost of driver\u2019s education for women, which is four to five times as expensive when compared with what men pay.Mohammed al-Ghanami, a diving instructor for the Saudi Marines, has been giving his wife lessons in remote areas where the police or other motorists will not disturb them. He moonlights as an Uber driver and wants his wife to be able to drive their child to the doctor or anywhere else in an emergency, given his extended absences.\u201cShe can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a careful person and a good driver.\u201dGroups of girlfriends, meanwhile, are making celebratory plans for their first drive. Rezan Ben Hassan, 29, learned when she was 16 on desert camping trips with her family. She intends to take the keys to the family vehicle on Sunday and cruise to a cafe.In Al Khobar, Ms. Bassem, the motorcycle lover, plans to hit the road with friends from the local Harley Davidson club. Of their roughly 700 members in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Eastern Province, a handful of women love Hogs.In what appears to be an attempt to dissuade unqualified drivers on Sunday, the Ministry of Interior announced that the police would be fining drivers caught without a license 900 riyals, or approximately $240.The lack of an official license, however, is not discouraging Ms. Bassem. \u201cThis is going to be one of the most exciting days of my life,\u201d she said.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Despite Caution Over Cryptocurrency, Investors Are Bullish", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, the path to success for start-ups was clear: raise money from venture capitalists, and either start trading in the public markets or sell to a bigger competitor.These days, however, there\u2019s a buzzy alternative that carries ever-growing promises: the initial coin offering, or I.C.O.No longer do companies have to sell shares in themselves to big investment firms. Coin offerings let start-ups go directly to individual investors over the internet, selling digital currencies akin to Bitcoin that can be used for some service that the companies build.The pitch for such offerings: eliminating the hassle of dealing with venture capitalists and investment bankers, while also avoiding the thicket of regulations that accompany traditional initial public offerings. In the best-case scenario, proponents say, coin offerings are far more democratic than what came before.But many entrepreneurs say they believe that, at least for them, coin offerings make more sense as a way to raise money than the old ways of Wall Street and Silicon Valley.The attraction for some companies is simple: It\u2019s a potentially bigger version of a Kickstarter campaign, raising money from backers without giving up any voting control by selling stock. The tokens that investors receive differ from traditional company shares in that they offer no say in how the company is run, so buyers are betting that their value will rise as the digital currencies get used more.And the process of selling a coin offering is relatively simple, where companies create their own cryptocurrency, write a document known as a white paper to describe the service that they\u2019re building and hope enough people are interested in buying into the sale.Still, other entrepreneurs saw something much more interesting in I.C.O.s.Trying to sell that to public investors seems fruitless. But a coin offering could allow Kik to create its own token and sell it to backers, who would find and create uses for it in the company\u2019s own ecosystem.Mr. Livingston said that the hope was to create an entire digital economy based on Kin, with his company betting on its own holdings of the cryptocurrency eventually swelling in value.\u201cYour value at the end of the day is how valuable the asset is multiplied by the amount of the asset you own,\u201d he said in an interview.Still, the ease with which companies have been able to raise money has worried critics, who say that too many coin offerings are essentially scams. Many of these offerings, skeptics say, offer so little documentation as to throw up a host of red flags.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of comical how poor the disclosure is,\u201d said Matt Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital. \u201cIt says you can\u2019t trust anything in this prospectus to the full extent of the law.\u201dEven offerings from well-known companies like Telegram are for services that are years away from completion, leaving many participants in these offerings essentially serving as speculators \u2014 and losing out if the products promised by sellers fail.When the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments.It is that sort of behavior that prompted Ms. Friedman, the Nasdaq chief executive, to say that coin offerings pose real issues, particularly to the average investor who tends to participate in them.\u201cTo make it no rules at all, when companies can just willy-nilly take people\u2019s money and offer no information at all, with no governance, that sounds to me like you\u2019re taking advantage of people,\u201d she said last week.And some skeptics say that traditional fund-raising methods for companies will endure. Neil Rimer, a co-founder of the investment firm Index Ventures, argued that traditional venture capital backers could give entrepreneurs experience and business connections. The biggest technology darlings, including Uber and Airbnb, are still planning to hold mammoth initial public offerings as soon as next year.There is one other potential issue for initial coin offerings: Through more regulations and the entrance of established investment giants, such deals look less and less like the democratic offerings their biggest fans say they are.Nevertheless, Ms. Friedman hasn\u2019t ruled out having Nasdaq host trading of cryptocurrencies, such as those sold in coin offerings, someday. And even investors who have looked critically at these kinds of deals acknowledge that there is some use for them.\u201cOur feeling is that this is too powerful an idea and a technology to try to quash,\u201d Mr. Rimer said. But, he added, \u201cRegulators do need to find a way to live with it and to put a framework around it to avoid egregious blowups.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Dangles Aid Before North Korea. But Does Kim Jong-un Want It?", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 North Korea wants the United States to know: It\u2019s not about the money.Earlier this week, Rodong Shinmun, North Korea\u2019s main state-run daily newspaper, sharply criticized American news outlets as \u201chack media on the payroll of power\u201d for featuring United States officials discussing how aid would flow toward North Korea if it agreed to give up its nuclear program.\u201cAs far as the \u2018economic aid\u2019 advertised by the U.S. is concerned,\u201d the Rodong column said, North Korea \u201chas never expected it.\u201dThat was a clear rebuke to Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy of dangling the promise of prosperity if North Korea agrees to denuclearize.For one, it has made clear that its top priority is its security.But it also does not want to appear as if it is desperate for handouts.Mr. Kim is a proud leader who does not want to appear vulnerable or susceptible to economic bribes. And the North does not want to be too dependent on the United States \u2014 or any other country \u2014 for its economic well-being.In fact, Mr. Kim\u2019s government appeared so offended by the suggestion that the North should surrender its nuclear weapons to reap riches from the United States that it specifically objected to that idea this month when threatening to call off the June 12 Singapore summit meeting.But under North Korean ideology, nuclear weapons give the regime power and legitimacy, said Daniel Pinkston, a lecturer in international relations at the Seoul campus of Troy University. And the power it derives from nuclear weapons translates into an ability to build up economic might.\u201cIf the state is stronger and more powerful,\u201d Mr. Pinkston said, \u201cthen the state is better positioned to pursue and achieve other goals, whatever they might be, including economic development.\u201dThe Americans and South Koreans want to persuade the North that continuing to funnel most of the country\u2019s resources into its military and nuclear programs shortchanges its citizens\u2019 economic well-being. But the North does not see the two as mutually exclusive.Mr. Kim \u201cwould be there, he would be running his country, his country would be very rich, his country would be very industrious,\u201d Mr. Trump said in remarks to reporters.And in his subsequent letter to Mr. Kim canceling the summit talks, Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cThe world, and North Korea in particular, has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Trump announced that the off-again-on-again meeting was back on.In the past, said Ms. Rosenberger, Mr. Kim even resisted invitations to meet China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, because of a reluctance to acknowledge that North Korea\u2019s economy was so dependent on China. Before Beijing began cracking down and enforcing international sanctions, the vast majority of North Korea\u2019s trade was with its Chinese neighbor. Even with sanctions enforced, it still is.Mr. Kim is also wary of introducing too much economic freedom too quickly, for fear that rising expectations and new wealth might destabilize the North and undermine his own authoritarian rule, analysts said.The more that North Koreans see the benefits of material goods from outside North Korea, the more they may question the poverty they have endured for so long under the rule of three generations of Mr. Kim\u2019s family.In that respect, the regime\u2019s vehement rejection of a link between denuclearization and economic assistance is a pitch to Mr. Kim\u2019s domestic audience.\u201cThe North finds itself having to explain why its leader is meeting Trump, the head of the American imperialists,\u201d said Kim Seok-hyang, professor of North Korean studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\u201cThe leadership had said that possessing nuclear weapons would solve everything \u2014 have everyone eat well and live well,\u201d Ms. Kim said.North Korean propaganda, Ms. Kim said, often compares the North with South Korea, highlighting its neighbor\u2019s dependence on the United States.\u201cSouth Koreans may be eating well and have more material things, but that is only because they are depending on the American imperialists, currying favor with them and getting their leftovers,\u201d Ms. Kim said, describing a typical North Korean line.In remarks to reporters after a meeting on Thursday in New York with Kim Yong-chol, one of Kim Jong-un\u2019s most trusted advisers, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emphasized the security that the North could derive if it agreed to denuclearize.\u201cMany conversations have been had about how we might proceed,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, \u201cwhat the path might be forward so that we can achieve both the denuclearization that the world demands of North Korea and the security assurances that would be required for them to allow us to achieve that.\u201dInvoking the possibility of a secure and prosperous future, Mr. Pompeo made clear that the United States is looking for the \u201ccomplete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d a formulation to which North Korea has yet to agree.To change his mind, analysts say, Mr. Kim must be persuaded of a few things: that the country, and Mr. Kim himself, will be safe without nuclear weapons; that it can control the terms of economic engagement so it strengthens rather than weakens the regime; and that Mr. Kim can present any deal as a victory for self-reliance rather than a cry for economic help.\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to convince a devout Christian that the pathway to enlightenment and eternal life is to abandon Jesus for something else,\u201d Mr. Pinkston said. \u201cIt\u2019s that profound.\u201dSu-Hyun Lee contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bavaria: Affluent, Picturesque \u2014 and Angry", "Date": "2018-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUNICH \u2014 All seems well in Bavaria.The streets are clean, unemployment is practically nonexistent, social benefits are generous and a vibrant sense of identity infuses small villages and big cities alike: Even teenagers sometimes don dirndls and lederhosen for a night out at the disco.Yet this is the new angry center of Europe, the latest battleground for populists eager to bring down both Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the idea of a liberal Europe itself.Rich, religious and on the southern border, Bavaria is the Texas of Germany. It is a conservative bastion of the nation most associated with Europe\u2019s open-door migration policy and the ultimate prize in a culture war that has seen populism chip away at consensus on the eastern flank of the 28-member bloc.Since the 2015 migration crisis, the far right has been steadily gaining support in Bavaria, and local conservatives have responded by veering sharply to the right themselves.The number of asylum seekers arriving at Bavaria\u2019s land border is but a fraction of what it was three years ago. But in the past two weeks, the Christian Social Union, a longtime ally of Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives, has mounted a spectacular rebellion against the chancellor. It is demanding a hard border with Austria and threatening to pull out of her government.A last-minute deal with European partners on Friday may be enough to save Ms. Merkel\u2019s fractious coalition \u2014 for now.But the Bavarian mutiny has already left its mark in conservative circles north of the border, increasingly divided themselves and watching closely whether the Bavarian strategy works. Bavaria has become a test case for how to win back voters from the far right even if the price is to move right and close ranks with populists in neighboring countries.Viktor Orban, the semi-authoritarian prime minister of Hungary, has been a regular guest of honor of Bavaria\u2019s conservatives, as has Sebastian Kurz, the chancellor of Austria who governs in a coalition with the far right. There is talk of \u201can axis of the willing\u201d that also includes Italy\u2019s new far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini.Markus S\u00f6der, the Bavarian premier, speaks of the end of \u201corderly multilateralism,\u201d and has ordered that Christian crosses be displayed in every state government building. From July 1, a Bavarian border force will start patrolling along a border that is supposedly open under Europe\u2019s border-free travel.Alexander Dobrindt, the Bavarians\u2019 parliamentary leader in Berlin, predicts a \u201cconservative revolution.\u201d\u201cPopulism has arrived at the heart of Europe,\u201d said Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European history at Oxford University. \u201cYou now have a major European party endorsing the Orban program on migration.\u201dBavaria may seem an unlikely home for populism. Nearly a third of Germany\u2019s blue-chip listed companies are based here, unemployment is below 3 percent and economic growth has exceeded that of other German regions for the past eight years.A melting pot of Slavic and southern European influences for centuries, Bavaria has also been more successful than many other German regions at integrating newcomers. Munich, for example, is far more multicultural than Berlin.As Wolfgang Jirschik, mayor of Baierbrunn, a small village in the Isar valley near Munich put it: \u201cThere is no need to make Bavaria great again. It is already pretty great.\u201dBut as in neighboring Austria, Bavaria\u2019s affluence has not inoculated it against a powerful populist narrative that has entered an increasingly defensive mainstream: that despite falling numbers the migrant crisis is continuing, that Ms. Merkel is to blame and that migrants threaten the traditions, prosperity and stability that have been the backbone of Bavarian identity.\u201cThis is not about economics,\u201d said Gerald Knaus, the director of the European Stability Initiative, a Berlin-based think tank. \u201cIt is about identity and a very successful populist P.R. machine that is rewriting recent history.\u201dIn the fall of 2015, Bavaria was on the front line of Germany\u2019s migrant crisis, processing tens of thousands of newcomers a day along its 500-mile border with Austria and earning worldwide praise for the humanity and efficiency with which bureaucracy and volunteers worked hand in hand to meet the challenge.Refugees were welcomed with applause at train stations. Sport halls were transformed into makeshift camps. Soup kitchens were manned by local residents.But three years later, the mood has shifted, particularly in areas close to the border where the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has made the most of its gains.\u201cOur perfect world was shaken,\u201d said Hans Ruppenstein, 76, a member of a local shooting club in Baierbrunn. \u201cPeople have become scared.\u201dOf what, exactly, no one is quite sure.The only problems with refugees in Baierbrunn have involved complaints about garbage and noise, the mayor\u2019s office reports. And once, a refugee who took his bike onto the autobahn.But the AfD, long associated with the economically depressed regions of the former Communist East, has found fertile ground in largely Roman Catholic Bavaria, stoking diffuse fears of Islamization and warning of migrant crime and terrorism. The occasional shocking headline, like that on a failed asylum seeker who severely injured an emergency doctor with a bottle last week, reinforces a sense of growing insecurity.Take Deggendorf, a picture-perfect town on the Danube near the Czech and Austrian borders. In the fall of 2015, local residents saw tens of thousands of migrants pass through. Now, only about 300 asylum seekers remain in the town of 36,000.Deggendorf has full employment and hardly any crime. But it registered the highest vote for the AfD in western Germany in last year\u2019s national election.Katrin Ebner-Steiner, a local AfD politician, likes to mock the conservatives for stealing her party\u2019s policies.\u201cThe AfD is making itself felt,\u201d she said one recent afternoon, smiling contentedly, before adding: \u201cVoters are no fools. They can tell the copy from the original.\u201dIn some ways, Bavaria is an obvious target for the far right. Nationalism comes more easily to people in this proud former kingdom that has nurtured its distinct identity over centuries.In the 19th century, resisting Prussian dominance, the Bavarian king paid couples to marry in traditional garb. More recently, the state government in Munich created a ministry for \u201cheimat\u201d \u2014 a term that stands for homeland, belonging and geographic rootedness \u2014 celebrating local folklore and shifting jobs and investment from urban centers to rural areas.Hitler started his political career in Munich. But like Austria, Bavaria has managed to somewhat distance itself from that part of German history.\u201cBavarian nationalism has been a tolerated form of nationalism since 1945,\u201d said Klaus Reichold, who runs a cultural institute in Munich and has written about Bavarian folklore. \u201cYou could always bypass the German taboo on nationalism by being Bavarian.\u201dBirgid Ley, an independent local councilor in a suburban district of Munich, said she always tells people abroad she is from Bavaria rather than Germany.\u201cWhen you say you\u2019re Bavarian, people think of beer and castles, not the Nazis,\u201d said Ms. Ley.Germans north of the border sometimes have trouble understanding Bavarians, and not just because of the distinctive local dialects.Bavaria has been more consistently conservative than the rest of the republic. The Christian Social Union has been in power here since 1957 and has lost its absolute majority only twice in nearly half a century.\u201cThe democratic culture in Bavaria is not as developed here as it is elsewhere in Germany,\u201d where conservatives and Social Democrats traded power several times, said Mr. Reichold.The conservatives have never been shy to veer right: The much quoted mantra of their most iconic postwar leader, Franz-Josef Strauss, was to never allow a party to the right of the conservatives to become electable.That, too, explains the current strategy in conservative ranks to fish for votes on the far right.So far, it is unclear whether the gamble will pay off or simply help cement the support base of the AfD. Opinion polls suggest that a tougher line on border security is popular \u2014 but the political jockeying of the conservatives ahead of state elections in October is not.The fact that the AfD has been gaining momentum at a time of strong economic growth is particularly worrying, said Mr. Jirschik, the mayor of Baierbrunn. \u201cWhat happens when the economy slows again?\u201dMr. Jirschik worries about freedom and democracy, as well as a social consensus he fears is wearing thin. He saw the outpouring of sympathy for the refugees in 2015, the volunteer army of helpers, the good will. But the memories are fading.\u201cWhen I see these developments and this new language, I am afraid,\u201d Mr. Jirschik said. \u201cWhen I see how quickly it happened elsewhere, in America, in Poland \u2014 I do ask myself: Could this happen here to us?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a man who runs a cultural institute in Munich. He is Klaus Reichold, not Reichhold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Chronicles of Nambia,\u2019 or Why Trump Knows Nothing of Africa", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistCAPE TOWN \u2014 A half-century from Bobby Kennedy\u2019s assassination, let\u2019s begin with his words in this South African city of mystical mountains:\u201cBut the help and the leadership of South Africa and the United States cannot be accepted if we \u2014 within our own countries or in our relations with others \u2014 deny individual integrity, human dignity, and the common humanity of man. If we would lead outside our borders, if we would help those who need our assistance, if we would meet our responsibilities to mankind, we must first, all of us, demolish the borders which history has erected between men without our own nations \u2014 barriers of race and religion, social class and ignorance.\u201dThat was 1966, in apartheid South Africa. How we in the United States have fallen, electing a president who incarnates ignorance, would erect walls on borders, knows not what dignity is, nor integrity, nor common humanity, nor the meaning of America\u2019s alliances; nor even that a president\u2019s Memorial Day message should honor the fallen, not trumpet low unemployment numbers.Other than that, give or take a flurry on the import of elephant tusks, the real Africa, continent of nearly 1.3 billion people, has scarcely impinged on Trump\u2019s \u201cChronicles of Nambia.\u201dHere in South Africa, one of the continent\u2019s three largest economies, there is no United States ambassador 18 months after the last one departed, and no sign of one being nominated. South Africans have taken note. Their country, scarcely mentioned by the president, sits at the bottom of a continent Trump disparages.The ingredients of Zuma\u2019s methods will be familiar to Americans in the Trump era: policy as personal whim, contempt for democratic institutions and the rule of law, entanglements with Vladimir Putin, attacks on a free press, enrichment of pliant friends, and governance as an exercise in values-free narcissism.Poor Zuma! Dethroned now, he insists he\u2019s cash-strapped, despite his systematic placing over many years of corrupt people that would do his whim at the top of state enterprises and government ministries. So penniless, he says, that he has no money to pay for his defense against fraud and racketeering charges that date back to an arms deal before he became president \u2014 and proceeded to turn the nation\u2019s highest public office into the scandal-ridden hub of a quest for private gain.There\u2019s talk of \u201cRamaphoria.\u201d The president is seeking foreign investment, having declared South Africa open for business once again. Certainly, many South Africans feel a long nightmare has come to an end, even if the economy is contracting and unemployment is at 26.7 percent.Geoff Budlender, a prominent lawyer who was deeply involved in the long struggle against apartheid, told me that \u201cterrible damage has been done.\u201d He spoke of \u201cdamaged institutions\u201d \u2014 including a \u201cbroken police,\u201d troubled situations at the national tax agency and Treasury, and \u201ccaptured state enterprises that are in deep trouble.\u201d Wherever he could, Zuma demanded not competence but loyalty, enriching business cronies like the now disgraced Gupta brothers who served his interests.\u201cThe question with structural and institutional damage is how do you reverse it,\u201d Budlender said.In 2020, or just possibly before that, or perhaps not until 2024, the United States is going to face a similar question in the aftermath of Trump. His unrelenting attacks on a free press, an independent judiciary, truth, decency, and America as a nation of laws will have taken their toll.South Africa offers some encouragement. Its democracy \u2014 younger and flimsier than America\u2019s \u2014 survived a deeply corrupting presidency. If it did, that was due to a vigorous press, not least the online Daily Maverick, and the strength and independence of its judiciary.I decided to visit the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg, guardian of the progressive 1996 Constitution that is the foundation of the new South Africa. It stands adjacent to the site of the Old Fort, where both Mohandas Gandhi and Nelson Mandela were imprisoned. In the courtroom itself, the 11 judges look out of windows set at the level of the feet of passers-by, a reminder that they are there to serve the people. A fire burns outside \u2014 the \u201cFlame of Democracy.\u201d In front of it, the preamble to the Constitution is engraved:\u201cWe, the people of South Africa, recognize the injustices of our past; honor those who suffered for justice and freedom in our land; respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity.\u201dI shivered, for I knew in my youth a South Africa of iniquity. Kennedy would have approved. Trump would, well, nothing. America, like South Africa, will survive the Zuma-Trump test of a democracy\u2019s essential character.Advertisement"}

This month, the government announced that the program would not run out of money until 2032, four years later than its previous estimate last year. Two years ago, the government had warned that the funds might be depleted by 2023.In addition to stronger economic growth, the drop reflects newly tightened standards for eligibility and the increasing number of baby boomers who are leaving the program because they have become eligible for Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare.Fewer than 1.5 million Americans applied to the Social Security Administration for disability coverage last year, the lowest since 2002. Applications are running at an even lower rate this year, government officials say.All told, 8.63 million workers received disability benefits in May, down from a peak of 8.96 million in September 2014. A drop of several hundred thousand may not sound like much. But it is a sharp turnaround from what seemed to be an inexorable rise, in which the disability rolls more than doubled over the past 25 years. That increase led some conservative lawmakers to criticize the program as wasteful and riddled with fraud.The Social Security Administration expected the number of applicants to decline after the recession when the total number of beneficiaries topped out, but even government number crunchers were caught off guard by the steepness and duration of the fall.\u201cIt has just kept dropping, by a much greater extent than we anticipated,\u201d said Stephen C. Goss, the agency\u2019s chief actuary. \u201cWe\u2019re still not done \u2014 we should have a little bit more good news in 2018.\u201dWhen the economy is strong and growing, there tends to be more lower-skilled jobs available that do not require manual labor \u2014 the kind of work that many people with modest disabilities are best suited for.\u201cWhen the economy gets better, employers are more willing to look to other labor pools and be more accommodating,\u201d said Eric Kingson, a professor of social work at Syracuse University. \u201cSome people with disabilities also have a sense there may be something out there that fits with their needs.\u201dOf course, other factors have contributed to the decline in disability applications. As aging baby boomers receive Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare, fewer require disability benefits. People in the disability program receive an average of $1,200 a month and get health insurance through Medicare.What\u2019s more, with the expansion of Medicaid in 33 states and the District of Columbia as well as improved access to insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, many experts argue, fewer people see the disability program as a way to obtain health care.Finally, the Social Security Administration has been making it harder to qualify for benefits, according to scholars and advocates.In some cases, just applying has become more arduous, said T.J. Sutcliffe, senior director of income and housing policy at the Arc, an advocacy group for people with disabilities. Budget cuts have taken a toll, she said, with 67 Social Security field offices closing since 2010.Applicants also face an increasingly uphill battle appealing rejections, with the administrative law judges who handle these cases taking a much more skeptical stance.\u201cIf you make it harder, people just run out of gas,\u201d said Richard Browdie, chief executive of the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging in Cleveland. \u201cThere are a whole bunch of new impediments, and I think the process has become overly restrictive.\u201dIn response, the Social Security Administration analyzed why some of its judges were approving a much larger proportion of appeals than others, said Nicole Maestas, a Harvard economist. Judges were retrained, and those who approved appeals at higher rates were singled out for special instruction, she said.The Social Security Administration tightened the approval process \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d without a big announcement, said Mark Duggan, director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. \u201cIn part, it was a response to the media spotlight and subsequent investigations,\u201d he said.Whatever the cause \u2014 demographic, economic or driven by policy \u2014 the postrecession narrative of an out-of-control entitlement program has been upended, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist of Deutsche Bank.\u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cWe thought the numbers for disability would go up forever.\u201dMr. Slok said he saw a deeper significance in the falling number of claims \u2014 he said it suggested there may be more workers on the sidelines than many experts estimate. If he is right, the Federal Reserve might not need to rush to raise interest rates, despite the unemployment rate falling to 3.8 percent in May, an 18-year low.Still, as the labor market tightens, not only are less-physically demanding jobs more widely available, but employers are more willing to consider workers they might have overlooked in the past.During boom and bust alike, Christian Borrero always wanted to work full time. Born with cerebral palsy, Mr. Borrero, 31, had been receiving Social Security checks in one form or another for nearly his entire life. A program sponsored by a nonprofit organization enabled him to work at a bank answering phones, but the salary in that part-time job was low enough that Mr. Borrero still qualified for disability payments.In 2015, a landscape supplies and waste-to-energy company offered him a full-time job as a receptionist. Mr. Borrero turned it down \u2014 twice. \u201cI knew deep down if I took it, I would lose my benefits,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was terrified.\u201dFriends persuaded him to reconsider. So when the firm, Kurtz Bros. in Independence, Ohio, made him a third offer, he took a few days to consider it and eventually said yes. \u201cI was still terrified of going off disability, but I\u2019d never had a job with real benefits and real hours,\u201d he said.After he was on the job for several months in 2016, what Mr. Borrero had feared came to pass \u2014 the Social Security Administration informed him that his disability benefits would soon stop because he had a full-time job.Mr. Borrero was so determined to keep working, he resigned himself to finding a second job to replace the $895 a month in disability benefits he would no longer receive. But when Kurtz Bros. got wind of his plan, it gave him additional responsibilities and a raise that made up for the lost money.\u201cUnemployment is down, and it can be incredibly difficult to find good people,\u201d said Jackie Repicky, human resources director for Kurtz Bros. \u201cSo when we find people who work hard and have a great attitude, we try to keep and promote them.\u201dFor Mr. Borrero, the experience has been life-changing. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very rewarding,\u201d he said. \u201cThey treat me like a regular employee. They never baby me.\u201dAt the bank, he said, \u201cI was never going to move anywhere. They were supportive, but I wanted to move from a supportive environment to a competitive one.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t had an easy life,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I love the feeling of earning enough money to pay my bills and do what I want to do. I feel very blessed.\u201dOther disabled workers may not be so fortunate to find a position that enables them to forgo disability benefits, he added, \u201cbut my example shows they can try.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Numbers That Explain Why Teachers Are in Revolt", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a quarter-century of steady growth on education spending, a shock to the system. American teachers are angry.They have taken to the streets in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado \u2014 and more recently in North Carolina. Dissent is building in Louisiana and Nevada, too.Moreover, the recovery that has lifted the private economy has not quite restored school spending to pre-recession levels, especially in states run by fiscal conservatives determined to hold the line on government spending.For a system that had experienced nothing but spending growth for a quarter-century, the past few years have been a major shock. K-12 spending per pupil rose 26 out of 29 years before 2010, only to tumble three consecutive years at the beginning of this decade.\u201cPer-pupil spending went up forever,\u201d says Matthew Chingos, director of the Urban Institute\u2019s education policy program. \u201cThe book highlighted these hideous inequalities in schooling, where there were 50 kids in a class with pipes that were broken and stuff like that, and there was a very good, earnest push toward increasing equity,\u201d said Marguerite Roza, a research professor and director of the Edunomics Lab at Georgetown University.Then came a one-two punch to the growth in education spending: The recession worsened financial problems already widespread in many states, and voters began electing conservative governors and legislatures that promised to rein in budget woes with spending cuts.On top of fiscal policy decisions, a more fundamental concern is the increasing volatility of state tax revenues, says Bruce Baker, a professor of education at Rutgers University who studies school finance.States cover about 47 cents of every dollar spent on public education, with a further 45 cents raised locally, mostly through property taxes, and 8 cents coming from the federal government.The political climate has also made it tougher to overhaul the tax system in any way that could be perceived as a tax increase, whether in good economic times or bad.It\u2019s easy to see why teachers are in the vanguard of the protest. Teacher salaries make up the bulk of education spending \u2014 so when education spending stagnates or is cut, teachers feel the pain most directly.Protests over these cuts have been directed mostly at state capitols, where overall education policy is administered.Property taxes to fund education have been attacked by both small-government conservatives and by liberals who note the wide disparity in tax bases in wealthy and poorer communities.It now seems the pendulum is swinging toward spending growth in states that had been lagging.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fix for New York\u2019s Parking Problems", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Shoup is a professor of urban planning at UCLA.If you\u2019ve ever driven a car in New York City, you probably know the drill: The city\u2019s free on-street parking gives a small, temporary benefit to a few lucky drivers, but it creates big problems for everyone else. Drivers hunting for an open spot will circle the block, wasting fuel, congesting traffic and polluting the air.One approach is to charge for on-street parking. But how much? And how do you make it politically acceptable in a city where drivers are used to paying nothing?Fortunately, there\u2019s an answer to both questions: Sell market-priced parking permits for certain heavily trafficked parts of the city, then plow that money back to improve the nearby neighborhoods.The problem is a big one. Laid end-to-end, New York\u2019s three million on-street parking spaces would stretch almost halfway around the earth. They would cover about 17 square miles of land, 13 times the size of Central Park.Because 97 percent of New York\u2019s on-street parking is free, the indirect parking subsidy \u2014 what the city gives to drivers in the form of free parking \u2014 is astronomical. For example, if only half of New York\u2019s on-street spaces were metered and the average revenue per space were only $2,000 a year ($5.50 a day), the total revenue would amount to $3 billion a year.There are other, indirect costs as well. One study of 15 blocks on the Upper West Side of Manhattan found that drivers cruised more than a third of a mile, on average, before finding an open space. In a year, this cruising created about 366,000 vehicle miles of travel and 325 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.If New York charges market prices for curb parking \u2014 the lowest prices that will produce one or two open spaces on each block \u2014 drivers won\u2019t need to hunt for parking because they will always see open curb spaces available wherever they go. Parking won\u2019t be free, but it won\u2019t be scarce.The New York City Council is considering a proposal for residential parking permit districts, in which drivers would need to buy permits to park in certain parts of the city. If the permit prices are set by the demand for parking in the area, they will be higher near, say, Times Square and lower in northern Manhattan.Needless to say, this won\u2019t be popular \u2014 nothing is more political than parking. To create the necessary political support for market-priced curb parking, some cities have created so-called parking benefit districts that dedicate the meter revenue to pay for added public services on the metered streets. Everyone who lives or works in a parking benefit district can see their meter money at work cleaning the sidewalks, planting street trees and providing free Wi-Fi. New York could do the same with its permit plan.To avoid unequal public spending among the parking benefit districts, New York can use what in public finance is called power equalization: Regardless of the revenue each district earns, the city can give every district equal revenue per curb space to pay for added public services. Equal effort will produce equal results.Suppose the city\u2019s average revenue per curb space is $2,000 a year. The city can spend $1,000 per curb space for added public services in all the parking districts and spend the other half for citywide services, such as cleaning subway stations. Drivers parked above ground will pay to improve life for everyone traveling underground.Parking permit districts could also eliminate the need for drivers to move their cars on street-cleaning days: The revenue can pay for staff and equipment to clean under the parked cars. That cuts down on an annoyance for locals, and another major source of congestion and pollution.Market prices for curb parking do not mean only the rich will park on the street \u2014 remember, the permits are market priced, based on the users\u2019 willingness to pay. Because cities are typically segregated by income, the rich will compete with each other for curb parking in their own neighborhoods and pay higher prices than the rest of the city. Richer neighborhoods with higher parking prices will earn more revenue, but power equalization will send much of this money to poorer neighborhoods with lower parking prices.Diverse interests across the political spectrum can find things to like in a parking benefit district. Liberals will see that it pays for public services. Conservatives will see that it relies on market choices. Drivers will see that it frees them from moving their cars for street cleaning. Residents will see that it improves the neighborhood. Environmentalists will see that it reduces energy consumption, air pollution and carbon emissions. Elected officials will see that it depoliticizes parking and pays for public services without raising taxes.Cities can fairly and efficiently manage their curb space as valuable public real estate used for private parking. They can stop subsidizing cars, congestion and carbon emissions, and instead provide better public services.Parking benefit districts can improve cities, the economy and the environment, one parking space at a time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump Should Learn From the \u2018Banana War\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBy taking off the gloves, I mean that literally: a tariff on imported leather gloves would hit China, France, Belgium and Italy, which all are in President Trump\u2019s cross hairs.And why stop there? Luxury cars, perfume, handbags, wine, spirits and cheese are on a list drawn up by the White House of items that the United States could target for tariffs, according to an outside adviser to Mr. Trump with knowledge of the list.The Trump administration has already imposed 25 percent levies on steel, but few people go out and buy steel bars. Mercedes-Benzes, Lexuses and BMWs are another story \u2014 those are recognizable products that plenty of Americans shop for every day. Mr. Trump has already floated the possibility of a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, a dagger aimed directly at German and Japanese exporters.The idea of hitting luxury products has its attractions: It hurts exporting countries but not cost-conscious consumers, who presumably aren\u2019t buying many six-figure bottles of wine.But the Europeans backed off after the United States threatened to slap 100 percent tariffs on a total of about $520 million in European luxury exports.The targeted products included cashmere sweaters from Britain, Pecorino cheese from Italy and handbags from France. Roquefort, the pungent artisanal blue cheese from southwest France, was threatened with especially punitive 300 percent tariffs, prompting angry sheep farmers to storm a McDonald\u2019s in the town of Millau, the center of the Roquefort-producing region.Ten years later, the Bush administration actually imposed a 300 percent tariff on Roquefort (along with Spanish hams and Italian mineral water) after the European Union banned the import of hormone-treated beef from the United States. In a compromise, the bloc agreed to expand imports of hormone-free American beef (while keeping the hormone ban), and President Barack Obama scrapped the tariffs.To some trade warriors, luxury goods are especially appealing targets because there are readily available American-made substitutes, and affluent customers can afford the higher prices.American consumers may think otherwise.To assess the potential impact, I reached out to some retailers and residents in Palm Beach, Fla., a hotbed of wealthy Trump supporters, where the valet parking garage at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club is filled with Mercedes cars and Chanel\u2019s trademark quilted leather handbags are as common as canvas totes.Forbes estimates the average net worth of Palm Beach residents is $29.7 million.Maurice Amiel, who owns the French Wine Merchant there, told me this week that he had been in the wine trade for 40 years. Although he stocks wines from all over the world, 90 percent of what he sells comes from his native France. Stiff tariffs on French wine \u201cwould be terrible,\u201d he said, especially for producers, shippers and retailers like him.That\u2019s because there\u2019s so much competition among wine retailers that it would be hard to simply pass on the higher cost to consumers. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sell Beaujolais if a tariff causes the price per bottle to go from $20 to $40,\u201d he said, referring to wine from the region just south of Burgundy. \u201cI\u2019d have to absorb a lot of the increase.\u201dThat\u2019s not the case with the high-end \u201cgrand crus\u201d produced in Burgundy and Bordeaux. \u201cWe have some of the most affluent wine buyers in the world here\u201d in Palm Beach, he said. \u201cIf they love the wine they\u2019ll buy it, regardless of price.\u201dThey didn\u2019t blink when prices for first-growth Bordeaux in sought-after vintages like 2009 and 2010 climbed above $1,000 a bottle. (A bottle of 2009 Lafite-Rothschild currently goes for $1,595 at Sherry-Lehmann in New York.) As a result, Mr. Amiel said, he\u2019d concentrate more on selling first growths and expensive Burgundy.Mr. Amiel\u2019s greatest fear, he said, is that Mr. Trump will use tariffs to whip up anti-French, pro-American nationalist fervor. That happened in 2001, after France refused to support the American invasion of Iraq, and many Americans boycotted French products. Mr. Amiel\u2019s business barely survived. \u201cNo tariff can be as bad as that,\u201d he said.The United States is France\u2019s largest export market for wine. In 2017 those exports were nearly $3.5 billion.Mercedes-Benz of Palm Beach is one of the country\u2019s largest dealers. A Mercedes-Benz spokeswoman, Andrea Berg, stressed that tariffs on German luxury cars hurt Americans, not just Europeans.\u201cWe believe in the benefits of free trade and competition,\u201d she said. \u201cDaimler Group subsidiaries have been firmly established in the United States for decades. As employers, exporters and good corporate citizens, they provide billions of dollars in direct and indirect support to the United States economy.\u201dEdward Elson, a retail entrepreneur and Palm Beach resident who served as United States ambassador to Denmark under President Bill Clinton, agreed with Mr. Amiel that even punitive tariffs would have little immediate impact on many Palm Beach residents.\u201cYou see Mercedes everywhere, and all the women carry those handbags,\u201d he said, referring to the ubiquitous Chanels. \u201cTo be candid, they don\u2019t care that much about price. People here aren\u2019t going to serve a Beaujolais at a dinner party.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and China Expand Trade War as Beijing Matches Trump\u2019s Tariffs", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday escalated a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, moving ahead with tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods and provoking an immediate tit-for-tat response from Beijing.These countries are fighting back, drawing up retaliatory measures that go after products in Mr. Trump\u2019s political base. China\u2019s response was swift on Friday, focusing on $50 billion worth of American goods including beef, poultry, tobacco and cars.The trade actions could ripple through the global economy, fracturing supply chains and costing jobs at American companies that will be forced to absorb higher prices. Although the United States economy is especially strong, the tariffs are expected to drive up prices for American consumers as well as for businesses that depend on China for parts.Things could get worse if the United States and China ratchet up their actions. Mr. Trump has already promised more tariffs in response to China\u2019s retaliation. China, in turn, is likely to back away from an agreement to buy $70 billion worth of American agricultural and energy products \u2014 a deal that was conditional on the United States lifting its threat of tariffs.\u201cChina\u2019s proportionate and targeted tariffs on U.S. imports are meant to send a strong signal that it will not capitulate to U.S. demands,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University. \u201cIt will be challenging for both sides to find a way to de-escalate these tensions.\u201dThe penalties make good on a campaign promise by Mr. Trump to crack down on Chinese trade practices that he says have cost American jobs. On Friday, Mr. Trump said in a statement that trade between the countries had been \u201cvery unfair, for a very long time.\u201dMr. Trump added, \u201cThese tariffs are essential to preventing further unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China, which will protect American jobs.\u201dBut the White House has lately vacillated between taking a tough stance on Chinese trade practices and declaring that the trade war was \u201con hold.\u201dIn recent weeks, the administration had tried to defuse tensions with China ahead of a summit meeting with the North Korean leader. Mr. Trump extended a lifeline to the Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, at the request of President Xi Jinping.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.In total, the tariffs will fall on 1,102 categories of Chinese goods, including nuclear reactors, aircraft engine parts, bulldozers, ball bearings, motorcycles and industrial and agricultural machinery. The list generally focuses on industrial sectors that relate to the country\u2019s Made in China 2025 plan for dominating high-tech industries, like aerospace, automobiles, information technology and robotics, the administration said.The revised list dropped some products purchased directly by American consumers, including flat-screen televisions and printer accessories, while adding semiconductors, machinery and plastics, according to an analysis by Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.In a call with reporters Friday, a senior official said the administration would soon roll out a process for companies to apply for exclusions to the tariffs for products they cannot get from another source.China said it would hit back with additional tariffs of 25 percent on about $50 billion of American-made products, the country\u2019s Commerce Ministry said in a release. These will also come in two rounds, with penalties on about $34 billion of goods, including agricultural products, automobiles and seafood, scheduled to take effect the same day as the United States tariffs. Tariffs on another $16 billion worth of American goods, including medical equipment, chemical products and energy products, will be announced later, the ministry said.The ministry said in a separate statement Friday that all other recent trade terms negotiated by the United States and China would also be declared invalid.Tensions could escalate further in the coming weeks. The White House is formulating a plan for restricting Chinese investments in the United States and putting stricter limitations on the types of advanced technology that can be exported to the country. It has said those restrictions will go into effect shortly after they are announced by June 30.The White House says its measures are necessary to reset the trade relationship with China, a country Trump administration officials accuse of manipulating economic rules and costing millions of American jobs.The moves could damp economic growth that has been stoked by the administration\u2019s tax cuts \u2014 though the overall effects are likely to be limited because of the small size of the tariffs relative to the American economy. But in a few industries that are heavily affected, the pain could be substantial. Economists say the tariffs will drive up prices for American consumers purchasing products at retail stores as well as for businesses that depend on China for parts used to make other goods in the United States.Goldman Sachs economists said Friday that the initial tariffs on $34 billion of products would have a minimal effect on growth and inflation, in part because it was concentrated on industrial rather than consumer goods. But they cautioned that the president\u2019s moves raised the odds that other measures, including more tariffs from the United States and China and restrictions on investment, would follow.\u201cImposing tariffs places the cost of China\u2019s unfair trade practices squarely on the shoulders of American consumers, manufacturers, farmers and ranchers,\u201d said Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThis is not the right approach.\u201dThe National Retail Federation, which represents grocers, chain restaurants and other stores, said the tariffs would not combat China\u2019s abusive trade practices, but only \u201cstrain the budgets of working families by raising consumer prices.\u201dCao Li contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Is a Win for Consumers", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Moore is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation.The Justice Department must now decide whether to appeal the judge\u2019s ruling, a move that would be sheer folly and a waste of taxpayer money, given the firm rejection of every argument the government\u2019s lawyers made. Hopefully, this decision will also clear the path for other planned cost-cutting mergers in the media and telecommunications industries.The government\u2019s antitrust challenge to this $85 billion deal was one of the flimsiest assaults against a corporate merger in recent memory. These two companies don\u2019t even directly compete with each other. Normally, antitrust cases are brought to block so-called \u201chorizontal\u201d mergers, in which companies in the same line of business \u2014 two airlines, for example \u2014 want to combine forces. Even in such instances, the antitrust laws are antiquated, given that globalized competition and the speed of technological change continually knock down industry leaders.The core argument brought by the Justice Department, in an antitrust action championed by President Trump, was that AT&T could use its new market power to raise prices exorbitantly on cable and satellite operators that want to run Time Warner TV programs \u2014 such as CNN broadcasts or HBO shows. The government\u2019s lawyers argued that consumers\u2019 cable bills would go up if the merger went through.The absurdity of this argument is that the Justice lawyers seemed to be stuck in the 1980s. In 2018, the number of American households getting their television or video entertainment from traditional cable providers is declining. The very notion of \u201cwatching TV\u201d is becoming as obsolete as listening to music on a turntable. My teenage kids and their friends don\u2019t even own TVs. They watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on their computers or smartphones, and one of their favorite \u201cchannels\u201d is YouTube. They can choose from thousands of programs at a very low cost. Today, any hotshot with a camera and a Facebook page can be a media company. Is that enough competition for the Justice Department?In short, there is probably no area in today\u2019s economy where there is less threat of monopolistic power than in media and entertainment. The proliferation of video content and ways to get it means that these companies must stay innovative and affordable, or they are gone as fast as you can say Blockbuster Video.In this cutthroat environment, the AT&T and Time Warner merger is better described as a survival strategy, not a market domination plot. The companies hope to lower costs by merging AT&T\u2019s transmission of video content with the entertainment products that Time Warner offers.This merger could bring welcome competition to Google and Facebook, which have captured about two-thirds of the online advertising market, a point that the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers ignored. Combining AT&T\u2019s mobile, broadband, and DirecTV platforms with Time Warner\u2019s movies, TV shows, music and sporting events could turn them into a serious rival to the tech behemoths.Businesses and families may also benefit from the merger if it accelerates the development of 5G wireless networks. The merged company could use its vast spectrum of resources to jump-start the delivery of Time Warner content through AT&T\u2019s wireless network. This will mean new competition for residential broadband from cable companies such as Comcast.The days when companies like U.S. Steel or General Motors or Microsoft could accumulate the market power to dominate an industry and gouge consumers with higher prices are long gone. Some of the most powerful companies in the world \u2014 Amazon and Walmart, for example \u2014 do just the opposite: they are constantly lowering, not raising their prices.It is too early to know whether this mega-deal will turn out well for shareholders and consumers. But the Justice Department should not be standing in the way. Its goal, instead, should be to allow made-in-America companies like AT&T and Time Warner to do what it takes to become global competitors, not global dinosaurs.The Trump administration should be thankful that, in this merger, it isn\u2019t China buying up America\u2019s strategic companies or assets. These are two American companies merging to gain profitability and global market share. In this way, the merger helps put America first.

And then, I\u2019m the president,\u201d he says at his sprawling farming estate in Crema, in northern Italy. \u201cI was about 10, 11 years old when I started helping my parents on the farm. There are no holidays. The work has to be done every day.\u201d Baldrighi, president of the Grana Padano Protection Consortium, embodies the intrinsic link this region, the Po River Valley (or Pianura Padana in Italian), has with Grana Padano, the slow-ripened hard cheese that has been produced here since the Middle Ages. \u201cMost of the farms in this area are handed down through generations,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a family business.\u201dThis resulted in a hard cheese that could be stored for months. The peasants started calling the cheese \u201cgrana\u201d (meaning \u201cgrain\u201d in Italian), for its grainy texture, with \u201cpadano\u201d later added in reference to its region of origin. Baldrighi attributes the high quality of local milk and cheese to the region\u2019s climate and abundance of water. \u201cThese factors help the cultivation of good grass and grains that are ideal for cows,\u201d he says. \u201cThe earth is ideal for growing.\u201dIn the farms, great attention is also given to the welfare of the animals, guaranteeing that the cows produce high-quality milk that ultimately goes into the area\u2019s star product and pillar of the local economy, Grana Padano, prized for its nutritional value, long shelf life and singular flavor and texture. Remarkably, almost a quarter of all the milk produced in Italy goes into the production of Grana Padano, which takes place strictly in the designated production area. More than 4,000 farms, 130 dairies and 40,000 people are involved in the production and distribution of this cheese.\nGrana Padano uses raw milk drawn from two milkings a day.  The milk is then partially skimmed via the natural surfacing of the cream when the milk is left to rest. Grana Padano must age for at least nine months. \u201cDue to the characteristics of its production and long aging process, the cheese is lactose free,\u201d Baldrighi adds. And depending on how long it ages, the aroma and taste of Grana Padano evolve as well. One of the important distinguishing factors that make this unique cheese is its place of origin. Grana Padano is produced in five regions within the Po River Valley: Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto and in a few provinces of Emilia Romagna and Trentino. Due to its long history and strong ties to its area of production, the cheese was awarded the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO, or in Italian, DOP) status in 1996 \u2014 recognition from the European Union for high-quality products whose tastes are closely connected to their traditions and provenance.Baldrighi says he still eats a chunk of Grana Padano every single day. \u201cEverything starts in a farm like this. Most producers of Grana Padano will have a similar story \u2014 they are all tied to their origins,\u201d he says. \u201cI was born and raised on a farm. I wouldn\u2019t want to live anywhere else.\u201dMilk is partially skimmed naturally when the cream surfaces, as it is left to rest.

{"Headline": "Thinking About a Trade War (Very Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistUntil fairly recently, I didn\u2019t really think we were going to have a trade war. What I thought would happen, instead, was a bit of kabuki: America\u2019s major trading partners would make cosmetic concessions \u2013 perhaps with some lucrative payoffs to Trump businesses on the side \u2013 that would let Trump proclaim a \u201cwin\u201d, and trade would go on much as before.The reason I expected this relatively benign outcome wasn\u2019t that Trump would get or take good advice. It was, instead, the expectation that big money would talk: corporations have invested trillions based on the assumption that an open world trading system, permitting value-added chains that sprawl across national borders, was going to be a permanent fixture of the environment. A trade war would disrupt all these investments, stranding a lot of capital, and I thought big business would get either manage to get that message through to Trump or at least get it through to Republicans in Congress, who would act to limit his room for maneuver.But these political considerations look a lot less compelling now than they did a few months ago. With Gary Cohn gone, it\u2019s not clear that big business has any real pipeline into the White House (OK, polluters have an open line to Scott Pruitt, and predatory lenders a line to Mick Mulvaney, but these aren\u2019t the groups who will stand up against trade war.) And Congressional Republicans, terrified of the Trump base, have proved unwilling to take a stand on anything, even if big money is at stake.Oh, and Trump\u2019s version of diplomacy \u2013 not just trade actions, but the systematic praise of brutal dictators and disdain for democratic leaders \u2013 has created a very angry world out there. Nobody out there wants to give Trump even the appearance of a win, and elected leaders would be punished by their voters if they did.So a serious trade war now looks very possible, and it\u2019s time to think about what it might mean.There are, I think, three main questions:1. How high might tariffs go?2. How much would this reduce world trade?3. How costly would the trade war be?These are all slightly tricky questions, as I\u2019ll explain. But there\u2019s a pretty good case that an all-out trade war could mean tariffs in the 30-60 percent range; that this would lead to a very large reduction in trade, maybe 70 percent; but that the overall cost to the world economy would be smaller than I think many people imagine, maybe a 2-3% reduction in world GDP.This last calculation, however, doesn\u2019t take account of the disruptive effects of deglobalization: some people would actually gain, but a lot of people, very much including large groups and many communities in the U.S., would take big hits, especially in the short-to-medium run.How high might tariffs go?What do we mean by a trade war? In the current context, we mean a situation in which the world\u2019s economies, taking their lead from the U.S., abandon the rules and agreements that currently constrain their tariffs and start setting tariffs unilaterally in their perceived self-interest.The problematic word, of course, is \u201cperceived\u201d. On trade, as on other subjects, Trump\u2019s perceptions generally don\u2019t seem very tethered to reality. And to be fair, the economic policy performance of other major players, notably the EU, hasn\u2019t been noteworthy for the triumph of clear economic thinking.Still, there have been a number of attempts to model trade war over the years, relying on one of two approaches. The first is to imagine that governments actually do maximize national income, or perhaps an objective function that gives extra weight to well-organized interest groups. The second appeals to the historical experience of the world before international trade agreements became the norm. Fortunately, these approaches suggest similar tariff levels.On the first approach: any country large enough that it can affect world prices of the goods it exports, the goods it imports, or both, has an \u201coptimal tariff\u201d greater than zero. The reason is that by limiting its trade, such a country can improve its terms of trade: the price of its exports relative to the price of its imports. This raises real income, other things equal. And the optimal tariff trades off the costs of reduced trade \u2013 e.g., the cost of producing goods domestically when they could be purchased more cheaply abroad \u2013 against the gains from improved terms of trade.The problem is that if everyone does this, you get the costs of reduced trade without the benefit of improved terms of trade, because other countries are doing unto you the same thing you\u2019re trying to do unto them. So you end up in a situation of \u201coptimal tariff warfare\u201d, which is actually more like an arms race than a shooting war, in the sense that there\u2019s (usually) no victor and no resolution, just a lot of wasted resources.So how do you estimate the effects of optimal tariff warfare? You need a \u201ccomputable general equilibrium\u201d model of world trade \u2013 something that shows how production and trade flows depend on tariff rates, calibrated to match the actual data. Then you have to find an equilibrium (a Nash equilibrium, for readers of \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d) in which each country is charging its optimal tariff given what everyone else is doing.So both history and quantitative models suggest that a trade war would lead to quite high tariffs, with rates of more than 40 percent quite likely.How much would trade decline?For any given tariff rate, the amount of trade reduction depends on the elasticity of import demand \u2013 the percentage fall in imports for every one percent rise in their price. Such elasticities are hard to estimate, because we don\u2019t get many natural experiments. (Fluctuations in exchange rates change import prices, but those only give us an idea of short-run effects, and everyone believes that long-run elasticities are much bigger.)As best I can read the literature, consensus estimates for the elasticity of import demand are something like 3 or 4, but there\u2019s not much certainty here.My back of the envelope calculations suggest that we might be looking at around a 70 percent fall in trade for a wide range of cases. I\u2019d be happy to be corrected by trade modelers if that\u2019s wrong.But if that\u2019s right, we\u2019re talking about a really big rollback of world trade. Figure 1 shows world trade (exports plus imports) as a share of world GDP back to 1950; a 70 percent reduction would bring us roughly back to 1950s levels. If Trump is really taking us into a trade war, the global economy is going to get a lot less global.How big are the costs?There has historically been a lot of hype about the evils of protectionism \u2013 Smoot-Hawley caused the Great Depression, and all that. It\u2019s also tempting to assume that because the Trumpist argument for trade war is so stupid, Trump trade policies must be totally disastrous.But I\u2019ve always ended up being really sorry when I let my political feelings override what my economic analysis says. And simple trade models, while they do say that trade wars are bad, don\u2019t say that they\u2019re catastrophic.To do this right, we should use one of those computable general equilibrium models I mentioned above. These suggest substantial but not huge losses \u2013 2 or 3 percent of GDP. What I\u2019d like to do is offer a bit of intuition about why those losses aren\u2019t bigger, then explain why a trade war would nonetheless be highly disruptive.To do this, I\u2019ll exploit a dirty little secret of trade theory: while ultimately stories about trade have to be general equilibrium, that is, they must make sure that you\u2019ve kept track of all markets simultaneously, trade policy analysis using partial equilibrium \u2013 ordinary supply and demand \u2013 usually gets you more or less the right answer.So let\u2019s think about the demand for imports as if it were an ordinary demand curve, with the costs of a tariff coming in the form of lost consumer surplus (Figure 2). Those who remember their Econ 101 will know that the costs of a market distortion normally take the form of a rough triangle (rough because the demand curve doesn\u2019t have to be a straight line, but that\u2019s a fairly minor detail.) That\u2019s because the first unit of imports lost has approximately zero cost, because people are indifferent at the margin between that unit and a domestic product, but the last unit lost imposes a cost equal to the tariff rate, because that\u2019s how much more people would have been willing to pay for the import. And the average cost of reduced imports is halfway between these values.So when a tariff drives up the price of imports to consumers, leading them to buy fewer imported goods, the welfare loss will be roughlyLoss = fall in imports * \u00bd tariff rateNow, the U.S. currently spends 15 percent of GDP on imports. Suppose we end up with a trade-war tariff of 40 percent, and (as I\u2019ve been suggesting) a 70 percent decline in trade. Then the welfare loss is 20% * 0.7*15, or 2.1% of GDP.But these net welfare costs may miss the real point, which is disruption.DisruptionThe U.S. currently exports about 12 percent of GDP. Not all of that is domestic value added, because some components are imported. But there\u2019s still a lot of the economy, maybe 9 or 10 percent, engaged in production for foreign markets. And if we have the kind of trade war I\u2019ve been envisaging, something like 70 percent of that part of the economy \u2013 say, 9 or 10 million workers \u2013 will have to start doing something else. And there would be a multiplier effect on many communities now built around export industries, which would lose service jobs too.This is just the flip side of the \u201cChina shock\u201d story: even if you believe that the rapid growth of Chinese exports didn\u2019t cost the U.S. jobs on net, it changed the composition and location of employment, producing a lot of losers along the way. And the \u201cTrump shock\u201d that would come from a trade war would be an order of magnitude bigger.You can see hints of what might be to come in what\u2019s already happening. So far we\u2019ve had only small skirmishes in what might be the looming trade war, but the effects don\u2019t seem trivial to soybean farmers already facing sharp price cuts and steel users already facing much higher costs. If the trade war happens, expect to see many, many more stories like this.O.K., there\u2019s no certainty that any of this will happen. In fact, I still find it hard to believe that we\u2019re really going to go down this path. But I also don\u2019t have any plausible stories about what\u2019s going to make Trump stop, or induce other big players to give in to his demands.Advertisement"}

Greece and several other countries in southern Europe were forced to impose painful austerity measures in return for bailouts from their richer northern neighbors. The actions included cutting pensions, raising taxes and in some cases even selling off public assets.\u201cAfter eight long years, Greece will finally be graduating from its financial assistance,\u201d said M\u00e1rio Centeno, president of the Eurogroup, which comprises the finance ministers in the eurozone. \u201cGreece joined Ireland, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal in the ranks of euro-area countries that turned around their economies and once again stand on their own feet.\u201dGreece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said his country was looking to the future after years of depression-like economic conditions.\u201cThis government will never forget what the Greek people went through these past years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people must very soon see a difference in their pockets. That is the promise that the Greek government gives.\u201dGreece will receive a final \u20ac15 billion in loans for the last two months of the program. After that, it will receive a significant debt relief package: a 10-year extension on loans that were granted during previous bailouts and a 10-year deferral on interests and amortization. A cash buffer of \u20ac24.1 billion should cover its sovereign financial needs for the next 22 months.The country will remain closely watched by European institutions and the International Monetary Fund, which will be monitoring its fiscal discipline and the reforms started under the current program.\u201cWith all these measures we can safely say that Greek debt is sustainable going forward,\u201d Mr. Centeno said.But Greece still faces daunting challenges.\u201cIf you look at the past three years, the Greek economy recovered, jobs were created,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels think tank. \u201cBut I think you can\u2019t just look at the past three years. You have to look at what happened in 2010, and clearly it was a huge disaster.\u201dPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who rose to power vowing to reverse austerity, has acknowledged that the end of Greece\u2019s third bailout program will not bring about a magical transformation. \u201cWhen you take a patient out of intensive care,\u201d he told a group of Greek entrepreneurs last month, \u201cyou don\u2019t make him run a sprint.\u201dMr. Tsipras\u2019s political opponents, who have been gaining ground in opinion polls, have noted that the country will remain under foreign supervision for years to come and will still be subject to harsh austerity measures, including a package approved by Parliament last week that includes further pension cuts, tax increases and privatization of state assets.That view is often echoed by regular Greeks. \u201cWhat exit? This is a life sentence,\u201d said Giorgos Amanatidis, a 67-year-old pensioner in Athens.

He has singled out certain American industries that he says are at a global disadvantage, including automobiles and dairy \u2014 which led to a public spat between Mr. Trump and the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau over Canada\u2019s dairy tariffs.The president\u2019s trade approach stems from his campaign promise to revive American industry, particularly manufacturing, by putting \u201cAmerica First.\u201d That promise helped propel Mr. Trump into office. But the ramifications of the president\u2019s protectionist approach are beginning to be felt in the towns and counties that elected him, as the downsides become more evident than any upside.For domestic cheesemakers like Sartori, Mr. Trump\u2019s approach has further tilted the global playing field against American manufacturers, giving them an even steeper climb in an increasingly competitive global economy.The dairy industry now faces substantial tariffs on products it exports as Mexico, Canada and other countries retaliate against Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs. American exporters also fear that they could lose access to Canada and Mexico if the president goes ahead with his threat to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. And they are finding themselves at an increasing disadvantage as other countries move ahead with trade agreements that grant each other freer access to their markets while Mr. Trump further isolates the United States.It was counties like Sheboygan, where Plymouth is located, that helped sweep Mr. Trump into the White House, and many people in Plymouth are still staunch supporters of the president. But many differ with his negative views of global trade, which has generally been good for the dairy industry.At a Sartori factory in Plymouth, giant mixers revolve over long silver vats, blending cheese curds with salt. At another plant just across the railroad tracks, workers in white coats and yellow rubber boots infuse cheese wheels the size of dinner plates with Merlot wine and black pepper, and set them up to age on large racks.The Sartori company, which employs roughly 500 workers in the state, earns just one-tenth of its revenue from exports to 49 countries of cheese like Parmesan, Cheddar, asiago, Gorgonzola, Romano and fontina. But its exports to foreign markets are the company\u2019s fastest growing segment and the one where it sees the most opportunity.That equation changes dramatically when tariffs are factored in. Sartori, which sells its cheeses to retail stores and fast casual restaurant chains in Mexico, now faces a 15 percent tariff on its exports, which will rise to 25 percent on July 5, in retaliation for Mr. Trump\u2019s levies on global metal. The price increase is enough that the company\u2019s customers, including restaurant chains, are looking at signing contracts with Sartori\u2019s European competitors.Locals believe that the retaliatory tariffs are aimed at Wisconsin because of its political significance. The state voted for Mr. Trump and is also home to Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker. Wisconsin products targeted for retaliatory tariffs by the European Union, Mexico and China include Harley-Davidsons, cranberries, ginseng and apples.Mr. Trump\u2019s skepticism about trade is leaving the Wisconsin dairy industry behind in other ways beyond retaliatory tariffs. Rather than rewriting trade deals in America\u2019s favor, Mr. Trump has mostly withdrawn from agreements his predecessors were negotiating \u2014 leaving other countries to set the terms of trade.That has given Sartori\u2019s international rivals an advantage, especially cheesemakers in the European Union, who are carving out protections for specific cheeses in their trade agreements.Just like Champagne can technically only come from France, the European Union has striven to enshrine so-called \u201cgeographic indications\u201d for its cheeses. Under these rules, a cheese must be made in Greece to be labeled \u201cfeta.\u201d Parmesan must be made near Parma, Italy, and asiago must be crafted near its eponymous Italian village. As the Europeans sign agreements with countries like South Korea, Vietnam and Canada, they are locking American cheese producers out of using these names.That poses a particular problem for Sartori, a company run by an Italian family that immigrated to America and specializes in Parmesan, Romano and asiago. Jim Sartori, the company\u2019s chief executive, traces the company\u2019s heritage back to his grandfather, who came from a small town near Asiago, Italy.\u201cWe make much more than they ever made in the little town of Asiago,\u201d Mr. Sartori said.The European Union incorporated some of these restrictions into a new trade pact it signed with Japan last July, as well as a new agreement with Canada that went into effect last September. Its trade pact with Mexico is expected to expand similar protections. And on June 18, the Europeans announced they would proceed with another trade agreement with Australia.Mr. Schwager says these agreements create confusion for customers and tremendous expense for his company, which must market its cheeses under different names. In Mexico, because of ongoing litigation, it must now sell its asiago as \u201cSartiago,\u201d a change Mr. Schwager says has led to a roughly 30 percent drop in revenue from Mexico in the last 90 days.\u201cThe consumer doesn\u2019t know what this is,\u201d Mr. Schwager says. \u201cWe can\u2019t even put \u2018used to be called asiago\u2019 on the label.\u201dAmerican cheesemakers are particularly chafing at the prospect of restrictions in Mexico, where the United States was one of the earliest suppliers.\u201cThe Italians did not build the markets here for their cheese,\u201d said Jaime Castaneda, senior vice president of trade policy at the U.S. Dairy Export Council. \u201cWe built the markets for Italian cheeses in Mexico.\u201dBut the president\u2019s aggressive style has its supporters. A few miles out of town, past soybean fields and empty asphalt roads, Scott Ditter, a dairy farmer who sent milk from his cows to the Sartori factory that morning, defended the president\u2019s actions. Mr. Trump was \u201creally standing up for agriculture as a whole,\u201d Mr. Ditter said.The week before, the president had clashed with Mr. Trudeau, in part over Canada\u2019s tight restrictions on imports of American dairy. Canada uses a supply management system for dairy and other agricultural products, which sets quotas for farmers\u2019 production to keep their prices high. And it charges high levies on American milk to keep it from flooding the Canadian market \u2014 a fact that has long rankled Wisconsin farmers, and now the president.Mr. Ditter said that Mr. Trump had the back of Wisconsin dairy farmers and that the president\u2019s tariff threats were an effort to ultimately negotiate lower tariffs for American businesses.\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll get the attention of these other countries,\u201d Mr. Ditter said, as he stood in his field alongside a dozen dairy cows, each christened by his wife and their granddaughter with names like Julep, Chandelier, Thunder and Magic.Mr. Ditter acknowledged that the retaliatory tariffs that Mexico put in place would probably hurt the Sartori Company as well as his farm, but said that he would adjust.\u201cSometimes you have to suffer a little to get what you want,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it ain\u2019t mean. I think it\u2019s just business.\u201dBut cheesemakers like Mr. Schwager are not sure that the suffering will be worth it, particularly if other countries gain an advantage in selling to emerging markets. In countries like China, many in the middle and upper class are just beginning to eat cheese, and demand could skyrocket in coming years.\u201cI\u2019ll give the E.U. a lot of credit,\u201d Mr. Schwager says. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to win the trade war long term.\u201d Meanwhile, he adds, \u201cwe\u2019re having to play with one arm tied behind our back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In China Trade War, Apple Worries It Will Be Collateral Damage", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, may be the leader of the world\u2019s most valuable public company, but lately he has had to act a lot like the tech industry\u2019s top diplomat.Last month he visited the Oval Office to warn President Trump that tough talk on China could threaten Apple\u2019s position in the country. In March, at a major summit meeting in Beijing, he called for \u201ccalmer heads\u201d to prevail between the world\u2019s two most powerful countries.Since he took over Apple from its co-founder Steve Jobs, in 2011, questions about whether Mr. Cook, 57, could recreate the magic that led to the iPod and iPhone have persisted. For Mr. Cook, the analogous breakthrough \u2014 and potentially his legacy as the heir to Mr. Jobs \u2014 has come not from a gadget, but from a geography: China.Under Mr. Cook\u2019s leadership, Apple\u2019s business in China grew from a fledgling success to an empire with annual revenues of around $50 billion \u2014 just a bit under a quarter of what the company takes in worldwide. He did this while China was tightening internet controls and shutting out other American tech giants.The Trump administration has told Mr. Cook that it would not place tariffs on iPhones, which are assembled in China, according to a person familiar with the talks who declined to speak on the record for fear of upsetting negotiations. But Apple is worried China will retaliate in ways that hamstring its business, according to three people close to Apple who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.There is also concern that Apple could face reprisals for legal and regulatory efforts in Washington that have made it difficult for the Chinese tech giant Huawei to sell its phones and telecom equipment in the United States.Apple executives and lobbyists in Beijing and Washington, led by Mr. Cook, have been trying to work both sides. They have fostered close ties to the administration of the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, an effort called Red Apple by employees at Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner Foxconn, after the official color of the Chinese Communist Party.At the same time, Mr. Cook has been pleading with the Trump White House to understand that a trade war is bad for the economy \u2014 and bad for Apple.Mr. Cook, who knows a bit of Mandarin, has attended China\u2019s most important political events in a critical year for Mr. Xi. Days after a Chinese Communist Party congress wrote Mr. Xi\u2019s ideas and name into the constitution, elevating him to the same status as Mao Zedong, Mr. Cook joined a small group of American and Chinese executives for a meeting where Mr. Xi lectured about innovation and reform.Later, Mr. Cook attended China\u2019s World Internet Conference, an effort by Beijing to create a Davos-like conference for technology. There he met Wang Huning, a new member of China\u2019s standing committee \u2014 the party\u2019s top leadership group \u2014 and an ideological force behind China\u2019s deepening authoritarianism.In March, just after an annual meeting of China\u2019s rubber-stamp Parliament formally abolished presidential term limits, Mr. Cook attended a major summit meeting that brings together Chinese policymakers and corporate leaders.Then Mr. Cook switched to explaining why he thought a trade war would reverse the new tax law\u2019s progress, the people said. Mr. Cook told the president that tariffs were effectively a tax on consumers and that the trade deficit with China is inflated because of flaws in how it is calculated, one of the people said.\u201cHe was very helpful in making some suggestions, and I might also add he loves the tax cut and tax reform,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on CNBC shortly after the meeting. \u201cHe says Apple is going to be building plants, campuses, adding jobs, lots of business investment. That was the first point he made to President Trump.\u201dMr. Trump has also told crowds this year that Apple planned to build multiple factories in the United States. Apple has no plans to do so and has not publicly corrected him.He has met with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, but they tend to disagree on trade issues, this person said, and he has avoided engaging with perhaps the administration\u2019s most hawkish member on trade, Peter Navarro, a top adviser to the president.Mr. Cook still sees an opening to engage on the trade issue because of disagreement inside the White House, and he doubts that a trade war \u2014 or Chinese retaliation against Apple \u2014 ultimately will happen, this person said.\u201cHe\u2019s willing to put a brave face on and work with the Trump administration because they probably have more at stake than any other tech company when it comes to China and the tariffs,\u201d said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and partner at the investment firm Loup Ventures.The specter of Chinese retaliation against Apple has increased since the administration targeted the Chinese tech company ZTE for breaking American sanctions against Iran and North Korea. But the administration backed away from stiffer penalties this month and said it would fine ZTE $1 billion and install a compliance team picked by the United States.Apple, meanwhile, has a deal with China\u2019s biggest telecom company, China Mobile, giving it a direct channel to nearly 900 million subscribers in China. The competition to sell smartphones in the country has become increasingly intense, with a number of other Chinese companies also offering high-end \u2014 but usually lower-priced \u2014 phones.Mr. Cook\u2019s frequent visits to China are part of Apple\u2019s increased efforts to court China\u2019s leadership, started in 2016 after the country suddenly removed Apple\u2019s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store there.The company has reason to fear retaliation. In 2014, the Obama administration indicted five Chinese military hackers, stoking tensions already high from leaks about American surveillance from the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden.Apple\u2019s primary leverage with the Chinese government is Chinese consumers\u2019 love for Apple products, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that represents Apple and other tech companies.However, Mr. Garfield added, Chinese consumers would also love Facebook and Google, two products blocked in China. \u201cThere are limits,\u201d he said. \u201cXi and the national party will do what\u2019s in their interest.\u201dJack Nicas reported from San Francisco and Washington, and Paul Mozur from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Agrees to $1.2 Billion German Fine in Emissions-Cheating Scheme", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Even after Volkswagen was hit with billions of dollars in penalties in the United States over an emissions-cheating scheme that continues to unfold, the company remained mostly unpunished in Europe.That changed on Wednesday, when German prosecutors said they had imposed a fine of 1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion, on the carmaker for failing to properly supervise the employees who devised and deployed illegal software in diesel models to evade pollution controls. In a statement, the Braunschweig state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office described the penalty as one of the largest ever imposed on a company in postwar Germany.The fine, based in part on how much money Volkswagen is estimated to have saved via the cheating scheme, pales next to the roughly $26 billion the company has paid in the United States to settle criminal charges and civil suits. But it is a signal that German authorities will not let the carmaker escape punishment despite its political clout and importance to the national economy.Herbert Diess, Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive, said the penalty was \u201ca further essential step\u201d in the company\u2019s efforts to move past the diesel scandal.\u201cWe are working intensively to deal with our past,\u201d Mr. Diess said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cFurther steps are necessary to restore trust in our company and the auto industry piece by piece.\u201dVolkswagen has admitted installing software in 11 million diesel vehicles that caused pollution controls to operate properly only when an engine\u2019s computer determined that the car was undergoing a test. Under actual driving conditions, the vehicles produced much more lung-damaging nitrogen oxides than allowed by law.Although the vast majority of the vehicles at issue are in Europe, the financial penalties were much stiffer in the United States because of the country\u2019s stricter enforcement regimen and a legal system that is more favorable to consumers.Volkswagen\u2019s costs from the cheating scheme keep growing in the United States. On Wednesday, Vermont\u2019s attorney general, T. J. Donovan, said the state had reached a $6.5 million settlement with Volkswagen and its Porsche and Audi units related to the emissions scandal.Germany and most other European countries do not allow class-action lawsuits of the kind that forced Volkswagen to pay damages to the owners of 600,000 diesel vehicles in the United States and to fix or buy back the cars.The European Union also has no central enforcer of clean air rules that is the equivalent to the Environmental Protection Agency, and regulators in individual European countries paid little or no attention to whether cars were polluting more than was acceptable.Those inquiries will probably continue to pose a threat to Volkswagen\u2019s reputation. The company also faces civil suits in Europe brought by shareholders who accuse it of shirking its duty to them. If successful, the suits could cost Volkswagen an additional \u20ac10 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rug-Weaver Searching for Social Justice in Oaxaca", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaterial CultureIn the Zapotec village of Teotitl\u00e1n del Valle, in Oaxaca State, Mexico, the rug-weaver Pastora Asunci\u00f3n Gutierrez Reyes, 46, graciously welcomes me into the open courtyard of her home. She is in the midst of pulverizing cochineal, a parasitic insect, to create a red dye. On an open fire nearby, pomegranate skins are simmering in a pot of water. All the dye recipes Gutierrez uses belong to her great-grandmother. The patterns and symbols that she weaves into colorful rugs are pre-Hispanic representations of the cycles of life and the natural world.Gutierrez is an advocate for change in Teotitl\u00e1n del Valle. She is largely responsible for bringing herself and the women in her village into the modern era using the traditional crafts and methods that have sustained them for generations. Rugs were among the first products developed in Teotitl\u00e1n del Valle expressly for an outside market. Interest in them picked up in the 1970s after a villager from Teotitl\u00e1n del Valle working in the United States saw woven textiles lying on a floor. The rugs were based on the serapes and blankets that had been made in the village for two millenniums, and which had only been sold to locals or tourists.Most of the 5,500 or so people in Teotitl\u00e1n del Valle are involved in rug-weaving. And among them, Gutierrez is a powerful force. About 20 years ago, she tells me, she and other single women (those who were either unmarried or widowed, or whose husbands had migrated to the United States for work) were being exploited by village middlemen, who forced the women to sell their rugs through them. The women weren\u2019t being paid enough to break even. Gutierrez, along with her mother and grandmother, brought a few of the women together to figure out what other products they could make and sell that the middlemen wouldn\u2019t notice or care about. They tried their hand at candle making, trinkets, embroidery and baked goods. But the men insisted that the women continue to produce rugs for them. So the women next tried a schedule where they would work for the middlemen one week, and for themselves the next.The men began visiting their homes at night, Gutierrez recalls. She heard about a government grant for rural farming women \u2014 which was later revealed, she says, to be a corrupt scheme in which the local ruling party doles out money in return for attendance at political rallies \u2014 and decided to apply. The village has its own form of government, and until the 1960s used a barter-based system. \u201cWe had no experience and no contacts,\u201d she says. The trek into Oaxaca, just 20 miles west but still a world away, was humiliating. Gutierrez describes how she and her fellow rug-weavers exited the bus looking as if they belonged to another era, barefoot and clad in traditional clothing. The older women were illiterate, and those Gutierrez\u2019s age had only a grade-school education. Zapotec, not Spanish, is their primary language. They were confused by the intricacies of bureaucracy and looked down on by the Mexicans. But they got the grant.The money allowed the women to buy wool and to sell rugs from their homes, but the middlemen continued to threaten them. The women then decided to travel 200 miles every week to the market in Mexico City to avoid undercutting the middlemen. This only further ostracized them at home. \u201cWe were called \u2018women of the street,\u2019\u201d Gutierrez recalls. They gave up trying to sell rugs, and then discovered that the grant had in fact been a one-year loan they were unable to repay. They were very publicly sued by the government and were further shunned in the community. They sold their jewelry and livestock to pay their debts. On top of it all, they still had to attend the political rallies. Gutierrez remembers feeling hopeless.But one day, about 10 years ago, as Gutierrez was walking back to the bus in Oaxaca, she met a woman named Flor Cervantes who worked in the nonprofit space to help women achieve economic and social equality. For the next eight years, Cervantes met and worked with the women in their village. In the first couple of years, they did not discuss work; Cervantes started by teaching things like basic reproductive health.At this point in the story, Gutierrez\u2019s sister Silvia, 26, finds some old pictures to show me. In one, a group of women, including Gutierrez and her mother Sofia, now 70, regard a diagram of fallopian tubes. For Gutierrez and her peers, many of them already mothers, their own bodies were still a mystery. Cervantes taught them about domestic violence \u2014 \u201cThere\u2019s a word for that?!\u201d says Gutierrez, recalling their shock at the time, \u201cWe just thought that was life\u201d \u2014 and about the concepts of self-esteem and confidence: \u201cIdeas that had never occurred to us,\u201d she adds.After a few years, Cervantes began to hold more business-oriented workshops on how to have meetings or set up a treasury. But they never discussed weaving. Cervantes was focused on helping the women support themselves by keeping chickens and pigs. \u201cEven though we had no money, for the first time in our lives, we felt rich,\u201d recalls Gutierrez. They had all the meat and eggs they could eat, and they could trade for other goods thanks to Teotitl\u00e1n del Valle\u2019s barter system. After eight years, Cervantes encouraged the women to work on their own. \u201cShe sacrificed much in her own life to help us,\u201d Gutierrez says tearing up. \u201cWe not only learned skills from her,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut we also learned to open our hearts.\u201d Gutierrez feels an immense gratitude toward Cervantes; she believes she is responsible for everything she and her group have achieved, and for the woman she is today. It is hard to square the bright, woman sitting across the table from me with the abject powerlessness she describes experiencing only 10 years earlier.The group, which fluctuates between 13 and 20 women, received official approval for their cooperative, Vida Nueva, which they would need to allow them to sell their goods outside of Mexico. They won a grant from the U.N. for new looms. And they initiated a practice of developing a different program each year to benefit their community, each woman giving as much as she chooses from her own profits. Over a year ago, they got their first wholesale client, a new shop in Oaxaca that sells the work of various artisans, and their first export clients.Now, they are creating rugs for the group\u2019s first North American client, a Texas-based home d\u00e9cor website called The Citizenry. The company requested rugs in neutrals with blown-up, simplified patterns, which felt, at first, like an affront to her traditional design practices. \u201cWe love color, and to us a rug without color is depressing,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then I figured perhaps life in the city is so chaotic that people want something more calming.\u201dI ask how the men treat her now. She says that men have changed over the years and she encounters less machismo today. And her community projects and her commercial work have garnered respect, she says. The collective she heads initiated the village\u2019s recycling system, created an eldercare program and spearheaded a reforestation of communal land, even getting the local government to kick in additional acreage. Last year she was the first woman to be offered an official position in the village assembly. \u201cJust a year before,\u201d she says, \u201cno one wanted a woman to have a position.\u201d The men respect how she has diversified her product offerings from just rugs into bags, totes, pillow cushions and even sandals, using leather from a neighboring village. In a traditional community, where the interests of the group come before the interests of any individual, change is welcome only when it benefits the whole community. Modest and proud, Gutierrez does not say anything more. Still, it\u2019s clear that this small group of women, formed out of poverty and desperation, has altered the economy of its entire village.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Trade Slump May Yet Happen: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump broke with protocol by tweeting about jobs report\u2022 Investors have compared Facebook\u2019s actions to human rights violations\u2022 Deutsche Bank can\u2019t catch a break\u2022 Goldman\u2019s consumer finance plans are bigger than you thoughtBefore Donald Trump became president, many feared that the combative trade policies he was proposing would sock the U.S. economy and send unemployment higher.Is this unexpected state of affairs sustainable?If anything, the strength of the economy might persuade Mr. Trump that he can pursue his trade agenda without causing too much collateral damage at home. That could mean following through on his threats to impose tariffs on Chinese products totaling as much as $150 billion.Whether Mr. Trump does so should become clear soon. On June 15, the administration is scheduled to release a final list of $50 billion of Chinese goods subject to tariffs, which would then be imposed shortly thereafter.Some in the administration have warned that a protectionist trade policy could drag the economy and the stock market. But the longer the economy keeps churning out jobs, and the longer the stock market remains resilient, the harder it will be for those advisers to make their case. Indeed, the U.S. may be less sensitive to trade frictions than economists and investors previously believed.But that is a very optimistic scenario, and much could still go wrong.The metals tariffs, alone, are unlikely to crater the markets or hammer the economy. But a full-blown trade war with China, involving $150 billion of tariffs and everything China has promised in retaliation, would almost certainly shake the confidence of investors and businesses. Tomasz Wieladek, an economist at Barclays, in a report on Friday said the metals tariffs and those against China, along with retaliatory actions, could knock nearly a full percentage point off global growth.The fact that the stock market hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since mid-February,when the trade rhetoric heated up, suggests investors never really shrugged off the prospect of trade wars. Now, as a confrontation with China approaches, markets may become volatile as investors prepare for the fallout.It\u2019s also important to remember that the strength of the economy is not an unalloyed positive. If the buoyant conditions, and the impact of new tariffs, produce higher inflation, the Federal Reserve will have less leeway to relax monetary policy in response to a big trade shock or a stock market plunge. In other words, investors would have no protection from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.One way to view the current situation is that Mr. Trump is an opportunist who has astutely ridden an economic expansion that had long been underway \u2013 and is now hoping it will carry him through a drawn-out trade battle.It\u2019s a bold, far from certain, bet.\u2014Peter EavisThe Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely releases its monthly employment report on the first Friday of the month. The night before, under longstanding tradition, the president and several senior administration officials \u2014 including the Treasury secretary and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 are briefed on the numbers, which they are not supposed to disclose until the report is made public at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time the next morning.But Mr. Trump, who was briefed on the numbers Thursday evening, appeared to foreshadow the strength of the latest report on Friday morning on Twitter.Market watchers saw evidence that the tweet was moving markets.Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, pushed back on whether Mr. Trump broke with protocol.President Trump tweeted earlier this morning that he was looking forward to the jobs report. We now know why.Drew Armstrong, a reporter at Bloomberg, tweeted the strong reaction of the dollar after the report\u2019s release:SoftBank\u2019s investment in G.M.\u2019s driverless car division and Waymo\u2019s move to create a huge fleet of robot-taxis suggest maybe not.G.M. CruiseWaymoThose numbers don\u2019t bode well for Uber\u2019s autonomous car technology.

{"Headline": "Deadly Tensions Rise as India\u2019s Water Supply Runs Dangerously Low", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHIMLA, India \u2014 The people of Shimla haven\u2019t agreed on much lately. A drought in the Himalayan resort has had residents blaming farmers, the tourism industry and one another for depleting the strained water supplies.And everyone\u2019s been angry at the key men.Shimla\u2019s decrepit network of water pipes, built under British colonial rule more than 70 years ago, depends on the civil servants known as key men to open and close the valves that supply each neighborhood. The current shortage, which in May left some homes without water for 20 days, has led to such fury toward the key men \u2014 accused, in just about every neighborhood, of depriving it of its fair share \u2014 that a court ordered police protection for them.\u201cI was getting angry phone calls calling me everything \u2014 stupid, worthless \u2014 at one or two in the morning,\u201d said Inder Singh, 44, who has been a key man for 24 years. \u201cI would be mobbed by dozens as I was trying to leave my home for work,\u201d he said, inserting his key \u2014 a meter-long metal contraption \u2014 into the ground to open a valve.As much as 30 percent of the city\u2019s hotel bookings have been canceled since last month because of concerns about the water supply, said Sanjay Sood, the president of northern India\u2019s hotel and restaurant association. Some of those reservations were canceled by tourists, others by the hotels themselves.Water tankers have been lined up at hotels along Shimla\u2019s windy mountain roads. A slogan on one of them read, \u201cIf there is water, there is a tomorrow.\u201dIn Shimla, rising annual temperatures and dwindling rain and snowfall \u2014 the city\u2019s main water sources \u2014 have been major factors in the crisis.\u201cThere\u2019s global warming all over India, and Shimla is no exception,\u201d said Vineet Chawdhry, chief secretary of the state of Himachal Pradesh, whose capital is Shimla.But the city\u2019s ancient pipe system also leaks five million liters of water every day, Mr. Chawdhry said in an interview in his office. A $105 million, World Bank-backed upgrade of the system, including a pipeline drawing water from a nearby river, is scheduled to be finished in 2023.The strain on the water supply increases greatly during the summer tourist season, when Shimla\u2019s population essentially doubles. In the summer months, Mr. Chawdhry said, the city typically needs 45 million liters a day. He said the current daily supply stood at 31 million liters, and at the height of the crisis in May it was as low as 22 million.Shimla is not the only Indian city whose water supplies are under increasing pressure. Last year was the country\u2019s fourth hottest since record-keeping began in 1901, with rainfall down by nearly 6 percent from 2016, according to the Indian Ministry of Earth Sciences.\u201cThere are around 90 cities in India which are water stressed. They face crisis today, tomorrow and the day after,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cShimla got more media attention, but many areas are facing water scarcity.\u201dThat includes the capital, New Delhi. This year, in the city\u2019s chronically water-deprived neighborhood of Wazirpur, a father and son died after a scuffle broke out among people waiting in line for a tanker.Rahul Kumar, 18, was fatally injured in the fight in the grueling March heat, which began when a neighbor accused him and his brother of jumping the line. His father, Lal Bahadur, 60, died of a heart attack after trying to intervene, the authorities said.Mr. Kumar\u2019s mother, Sushila Devi, said that Wazirpur had run out of water in January \u2014 earlier in the season than usual. Other Wazirpur residents said that in the rare instances when tap water flows, it is dirty and undrinkable.\u201cMy husband and son died because of water,\u201d Ms. Devi said.On a hot recent afternoon in Wazirpur, neighbors lined up again with empty jugs waiting for a government-supplied tanker. This time, as the tanker arrived, an older man directed the crowd, to make sure it was orderly.\u201cI do a public service,\u201d the man said. \u201cAfter the fight we came together in the neighborhood and made this system of queuing.\u201dBut there were still tense moments. \u201cWhy is your pot so big? It\u2019s too big!\u201d one woman yelled at another. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d the other woman snapped back.In Shimla, the water crisis has eased since last month. Municipal officials divided the city into three zones in late May, distributing water to them on a rotating basis so that none would go without for more than two days. Residents complained that the city had been slow to act, but over all, tensions have decreased.\u201cNamashkar!\u201d residents yelled cheerfully to Mr. Singh, the key man, from their balconies as he made his rounds recently. Mr. Singh returned the traditional greeting, but he said they hadn\u2019t always been so nice.He said he was cursed and shouted at during the worst days of the crisis, but never physically attacked. But some of the city\u2019s 61 other key men were held down by mobs and forced to keep the water on, municipal officials said.The pandemonium moved Shimla\u2019s High Court to act. It ordered that key men be supervised to ensure that they were not giving favorable treatment to hotels or V.I.P.s. The acting chief justice went into the streets personally to watch some of them work.\u201cThe key man not only holds the key, but in fact, by the strength of the key, he can put the entire town to ransom,\u201d the court said in its ruling this month.The court also ordered that every key man be escorted by two police officers while on duty to ensure their safety. Some key men \u2014 surrounded by a veritable entourage \u2014 said they had never felt so important in their lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit Dividend\u2019 for N.H.S.? British Leader Revives a Pledge", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFew British institutions are as respected as the country\u2019s health care provider, the National Health Service, and a pledge to divert money to it helped convince Britons to vote for withdrawal from the European Union.\u201cSome of the extra funding I am promising today will come from using the money we will no longer spend on our annual membership subscription to the European Union after we have left,\u201d she said in a speech.Mrs. May did later acknowledge that taxes would have to rise to fund health care. \u201cAs taxpayers we will need to contribute more,\u201d she said, adding that detailed plans would be given later in the year.Just about everyone seems to agree that the health service is seriously underfunded, after a lengthy squeeze on its finances and in the face of steadily rising demand for health care, most of which is delivered free and to a rapidly aging population.That explains the potency of the pledge, made by Brexit supporters in a 2016 referendum, to divert 350 million pounds \u2014 $465 million \u2014 a week from Britain\u2019s annual payments to the European Union to the health service. The figure (which was based on gross, rather than net, contributions to the organization) was later described by Britain\u2019s statistics agency as \u201ca clear misuse\u201d of official data.Mrs. May\u2019s promise of a 3.4 percent overall increase in health care spending would exceed the \u00a3350 million figure that was famously emblazoned on the side of a campaign bus used by prominent Brexit supporters, including Boris Johnson, now the foreign secretary.Yet, although it works out at around $510 million a week, it is less impressive than it sounds. The health service\u2019s average annual funding rise since its foundation in 1948 has been 3.7 percent, although that dipped to around 1.1 percent after 2010, when a Conservative-led coalition government squeezed spending after the financial crisis.Chris Ham, chief executive of The King\u2019s Fund, a charity focused on health care, said that her pledge \u201cfalls short of the 4 percent annual increases we argued are needed.\u201d\u201cHard choices lie ahead and it will be difficult to reduce financial deficits among N.H.S. providers, get back on track in delivering national waiting-time standards and bring about further improvements in services like cancer care, mental health and general practice,\u201d he said in a statement.He added that it would \u201calso be challenging to sustain increases in productivity, which have generally outpaced the economy in recent years.\u201dJeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, argued that Mrs. May\u2019s promises were insufficient for a service \u201cin crisis.\u201dMore contentious is the assertion that, in the near future, the health service will be funded, even in part, by a Brexit dividend.But in the short term at least, that money will be swallowed up by a divorce payment of around $52 billion that Britain has agreed to pay the bloc to honor outstanding commitments, and by other pledges. These include a promise to maintain subsidies for British farmers, which are currently paid by the European Union, for several years.Meanwhile, experts say the government can expect to have less to spend because of lower than expected economic growth. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, a highly regarded research institute, noted that the government had already accepted an analysis suggesting that Brexit would weaken public finances by about $20 billion a year.\u201cThere is no Brexit dividend,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, adding that \u201cpayments to the E.U. will fall, but tax revenues will fall more as a result of Brexit.\u201dFunding for health care is therefore likely to come from higher taxes and borrowing.The other Mr. Johnson \u2014 the foreign secretary \u2014 welcomed Mrs. May\u2019s pledge as a vindication of his referendum promise, describing it as a \u201cdown payment on the cash we will soon get back from our EU payments.\u201dBut ahead of Mrs. May\u2019s speech, even the right-leaning Daily Telegraph seemed less than convinced, its front-page article reporting that stealth taxes would be called upon to pay for extra health care spending.One Conservative lawmaker and critic of Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit policy was more direct. \u201cThe Brexit dividend tosh was expected,\u201d wrote Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the health and social care parliamentary select committee, on Twitter, \u201cbut treats the public as fools.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Group of 7 Looks for Relevance as It Gathers in Canada", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeven nations are getting together to discuss gender equality with a leader who once bragged about grabbing women\u2019s genitals, pluralism and tolerance with politicians who have promised to turn away refugees, and economic cooperation with a country severing ties with its neighbors.What could go wrong?Welcome to the Group of 7 Summit in Charlevoix, Quebec, a gathering of the leaders of seven countries that once dominated the world economy, but now struggle with the forces of globalization they helped to unleash.The members of the Group of 7 \u2014 the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan \u2014 once stood together against communism. But now they are often in conflict with each other and struggling to prove their relevance amid China\u2019s growing power.The agenda put together by Canada, this year\u2019s host, would not have provoked much controversy a few years ago. Women\u2019s empowerment. Climate change. Adapting to the changing nature of work.But the old assumptions about shared values no longer apply. This is the era of a president who is reputed to have had an affair with a pornographic film actress and left the Paris climate accord. It is a time of surging populism in Europe.President Trump did not do much to promote a feel-good atmosphere in Charlevoix with his plans to impose punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the other six Group of 7 members. Late in May, Mr. Trump went even further, taking steps to impose tariffs on imported automobiles, a measure that would strike Germany especially hard.In Italy, the two strongest parties in recent elections were a protest party and hard-right nationalists who promised to crack down on illegal immigration and end sanctions against Russia. They, too, were on a collision course with the European Union after threatening to violate its budget rules to fulfill populist campaign promises.Even without those tensions, the group\u2019s relevance has been declining. The members of the club once ruled the world stage. But their share of the global economy has fallen from more than two thirds in the early 1990s to less than half. The group accounts for only about 10 percent of the world\u2019s population, and many Group of 7 societies are aging.The diminished stature of the Group of 7 countries raises questions about their claim to make decisions on global issues. The Group of 7 has already largely been eclipsed by the Group of 20, which includes China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, and more closely represents the way that wealth and people are distributed.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, did not even mention the Charlevoix meeting at a conference organized by Mr. Snower\u2019s group on May 28.\u201cGlobal issues can only be solved globally,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, adding that her view \u201cis not shared by everyone.\u201dIn an obvious reference to Mr. Trump, Ms. Merkel said: \u201cMultilateral action is currently under pressure, indeed in crisis. It is challenged by protectionism and isolationist thinking.\u201dIs there any point in getting together at all?The Canadians, who last hosted the Group of 7 summit meeting in 2010, will try to find enough common ground to reach agreement on enough issues to claim success. The themes of the meeting, which Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, announced on Facebook in December, are vague enough to leave some leeway. Who could possibly be against \u201cbuilding a more peaceful and secure world\u201d?According to Mr. Kirton, there may even be progress on gender issues, despite the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to deny funding for birth control programs. Last year\u2019s summit meeting in Taormina, Sicily, last year, may serve as a guide.Afterward, the leaders, including Mr. Trump, issued a communiqu\u00e9 in favor of promoting more women to leadership positions in government and business, and promoting entrepreneurship by women. The Taormina communiqu\u00e9 avoided terms like \u201creproductive rights\u201d that would rile Mr. Trump\u2019s right-wing base.\u201cOne can think of it as the Ivanka Trump agenda,\u201d Mr. Kirton said, referring to the president\u2019s daughter. \u201cThere is more to be done,\u201d he said, including promoting better education for girls.Mr. Kirton, who takes an optimistic view of the summit meeting, even sees potential in its goal of \u201cgrowth that works for everyone,\u201d a slogan that can be given a Trumpian, populist spin.\u201cThere Trudeau and Trump are very much aligned \u2014 bringing economic benefits to the working class,\u201d Mr. Kirton said.Even when they dislike each other, the group\u2019s leaders usually manage to issue communiqu\u00e9s that gloss over their differences. It may help that, except for a limited number of pool reporters, the news media will be in Quebec City, about 50 miles from Charlevoix.The meeting\u2019s venue is so rural that much of the surrounding region had little or no cellphone coverage or broadband internet until local infrastructure was upgraded for the event. The distance between the leaders and the media may make it harder for journalists to report on points of conflict and harder for political leaders to grandstand.But some leaders have signaled that they do not plan to avoid sensitive topics like trade or the Paris accord. In a statement for the G-7 Research Group\u2019s report, the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, did not mention Mr. Trump by name, but alluded to areas where Europe and Mr. Trump disagree sharply.Mr. Macron said the Paris agreement was \u201ca vital necessity,\u201d that \u201cwe must have free and fair trade,\u201d and that the leaders should \u201cdefend the achievements of multilateralism.\u201d\u201cA century after the end of the Great War, let us not repeat the errors of the past,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cLet us remain vigilant, moved by a desire to take collective, pragmatic and effective action.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Sports Betting Do for Atlantic City What Donald Trump Couldn\u2019t?", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter some bleak years, Atlantic City is hoping for a reversal of fortune, with sports betting now legal and two shuttered casinos about to reopen.ATLANTIC CITY \u2014 The last time there was so much hype about the future of this troubled seaside resort, Donald J. Trump was doing most of the hyping.Altogether, it adds up to more opportunity than many people who live and work here could have imagined just a few bleak years ago when five of the city\u2019s 12 casinos failed and a state takeover rescued the city from a bankruptcy filing.Though this once famous gambling mecca still has far to go to reverse its fortunes, some boosters are already painting a rosy picture. \u201cAll around us we get glimpses of Atlantic City\u2019s future, as new buildings rise and old streets get new life breathed into them,\u201d Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, told a lunchtime crowd at a recent gaming conference here. \u201cNot long ago \u2014 it was not long ago at all \u2014 folks were writing Atlantic City off. It was past its prime. The economy was dead. Now, when people speak of Atlantic City, they speak of renewal, they speak of opportunity.\u201dNew Jersey became the second state \u2014 Nevada was the first \u2014 with a legal casino when Resorts International opened on the boardwalk in 1978. But a gaming license has not always been a sure thing. In a race to cash in, Mr. Trump and his competitors often borrowed more than they could pay back.At one point, this small city had 13 casinos, three of them controlled by Mr. Trump. But each of his properties fell into bankruptcy and he eventually withdrew from the business. Caesars Entertainment, which still owns three casinos here, had been saddled with about $25 billion in debt before it went into bankruptcy in 2015.Given the city\u2019s record not everyone has been won over by pledges from casino executives and elected officials to make Atlantic City a more family-oriented resort. The same promises have been made for decades, yet the city has remained dependent on gamblers even though it long ago lost its status as the only place in the country that welcomed them outside of Las Vegas. The countryside is now dotted with casinos, including several within a short drive.After Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and New York made casinos legal, those states drained a large share of Atlantic City\u2019s lifeblood. What once was a stream of more than $5 billion in annual revenue has been cut in half and not even the most hopeful investors expect a full rebound.\u201cDo I think the gaming market ever comes back to close to $6 billion in revenue? No. Not even close,\u201d said Jim Allen, the chief executive of Hard Rock International.But still, his company and its local partners, the Jingoli and Morris families, have invested more than half a billion dollars to turn the shuttered Taj Mahal into a resort that emphasizes live music and entertainment. Hard Rock\u2019s read on consumer sentiment is that people are rooting for Atlantic City to succeed but they think that it had \u201clost its way,\u201d Mr. Allen said.\u201cIt is another positive thing happening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is another reason to go to Atlantic City.\u201dThe owners of the newest casino on the Boardwalk, Ocean Resort, are making a bigger wager on sports betting. They are turning a bar at the center of the casino floor into a sports book that will serve as a place for fans to watch games as well as bet on them.Standing in the empty space that he said would be ready to start accepting bets when the casino opens on Thursday, Mr. Schorr said, \u201cYou have to have an exciting environment to watch the game. Our goal is to create experiences.\u201dAs soon as the Borgata started taking bets on sports, it had a billboard announcing the new gambling outside the Lincoln Tunnel in New Jersey. \u201cWe feel like the vibrancy this type of offering will create will extend beyond just the race and sports book and spill out onto the rest of the property,\u201d said Marcus Glover, the president and chief operating officer of the Borgata.Mr. Deifik, the owner of Ocean Resort, predicted that sports betting would keep more gamblers in the region. \u201cInstead of getting on a plane and going five hours to Las Vegas from the East Coast and New Jersey, people will stay here,\u201d he said.The bigger uncertainty about Atlantic City is what the reopening of two big casinos will mean for the market. Will they attract a significant number of new customers to the city or simply cannibalize the weaker competitors?Resorts made a profit of less than $3 million last year, compared with more than $80 million for the Borgata, according to the state Division of Gaming Enforcement. Bally\u2019s, one of the three owned by Caesars, had a profit of about $8 million in 2017.\u201cWe\u2019ve been watching this market,\u201d he said, referring to himself and his partner, Jack Morris, a developer. \u201cWe think now\u2019s the time.\u201dAs evidence of Atlantic City\u2019s resilience, Mr. Jingoli mentioned some entrepreneurs who are making investments of their own. Deborah and Mark Pellegrino quit their jobs in the hospitality industry and sank about $200,000 into Made, a chocolate-making business with a small bar attached half a block from the boardwalk. Flanked by sacks of cocoa beans from Madagascar and other faraway places, Ms. Pellegrino said some casinos have shifted what had been their longstanding attitude \u2014 they have stopped discouraging customers from venturing outside their walls and exploring the city. \u201cI think there\u2019s a new audience and they want a new experience,\u201d she said. Some longtime casino customers are less ebullient. Sitting on a bench between Ocean Resort and the beach, Marjorie Parker, who lives in Brooklyn, sounded skeptical.\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d Ms. Parker, a retired Citibank employee, said as she studied the glass-plated tower that will soon be the Ocean Resort. Wearing a lanyard that held membership cards to several casinos, Ms. Parker recalled visiting the Borgata the day it opened 15 years ago. She said she had only returned two or three times.\u201cPeople want to win,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to lose all their money.\u201d But for a city where so many have struggled for so long, the new casinos are already improving lives. In preparation for its debut, the Hard Rock hired more than 3,000 people, at least 800 of whom worked at the Taj. Dora Brooks, 58, and Mary Martinez, 62, were there when the biggest union, Local 54 of Unite Here, went on strike in 2016 and hastened the Taj\u2019s demise.\u201cIt was very depressing,\u201d Ms. Brooks said. \u201cMy heart was just broken in two.\u201dAn Atlantic City native, she said she had been personally offended by all the talk of her hometown\u2019s tailspin. \u201cWhen people talk about Atlantic City, I feel like they\u2019re talking about me,\u201d Ms. Brooks said.Ms. Martinez, who has lived in Atlantic City for 15 years, said she had not expected to land another full-time job in a casino, but she never lost hope.\u201cI never saw it as a downward spiral,\u201d she said. \u201cI always thought of Atlantic City as a little, bright shining star.\u201dNick Corasaniti and Rick Rojas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Talking to London Breed About Her Plans for San Francisco", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.London Breed, 43, became mayor-elect of San Francisco this week when her closest opponent, Mark Leno, conceded. We sat down with her Thursday to ask about her plans for the city. The interview has been shortened and lightly edited.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)In the ever-expanding jumble of running races, from military-style mud runs to ultra-marathons, turkey trots to themed romps, sometimes the best are the throwback originals of the genre.That is why the Dipsea stands out. The 7.5-mile race from Mill Valley to Stinson Beach, north of San Francisco, needs no gimmicks.It began in 1905, and bills itself as the oldest major trail race in the country (and the second-oldest major footrace, behind the Boston Marathon). It covers beautiful and rugged terrain, including achingly steep inclines (and those are after the roughly 700 stairs near the start), chaotic trap-door drops into Muir Woods, and tangles of single-track trails over rocks and roots and through thickets of poison oak, among other nasty elements.What makes it most interesting, perhaps, is a complicated handicapping system, awarding head starts based on age and gender. The oldest adults and youngest children start first. Every minute, another wave of runners is released, each (theoretically) faster than the one before.The result is a mad scramble to the finish line. Oh, and short cuts are allowed.It is how recent winners have included an 8-year-old girl and a 68-year-old woman. And it is how a 32-year-old named Alex Varner has had the fastest time in eight of the past 10 Dipseas, but has never won the race.Every year, he navigates his way around and through hundreds of slower racers, more than anyone else. But he has never been able to pass every last runner in front of him. Almost, but never. Not yet.\u201cYou\u2019re either the hunter or the hunted,\u201d Mr. Varner said.He is the ultimate hunter.

{"Headline": "Stock Markets Slip on Trade Policy Fears", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors have stopped not caring about a trade war.For months, financial markets shrugged off the escalating language and the imposition of tit-for-tat tariffs between the Trump administration and the United States\u2019 most important trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union and China.But in the past several trading sessions, that apathy has been replaced by what looks like mounting alarm about the prospect of a global race to erect trade barriers.On Monday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell sharply, ending the day down 1.4 percent, apparently spooked by signs that the growing trade war could have a negative impact on American companies. That decline, and similar ones in other benchmark indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average, came after the S.& P. slumped 0.9 percent last week.\u201cI think we\u2019re slowly slipping into a more serious stage in the trade war,\u201d said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cPeople are beginning to realize there\u2019s no sign of de-escalation in sight.\u201dThe sell-off is increasingly broad. Tech shares joined industrials in a sharp fall as American markets opened Monday, after reports that President Trump was considering restrictions on Chinese investments in American technology companies.The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index and the tech sector of the S.&P. 500 both fell more than 2 percent.Semiconductor companies were especially hard hit.The chip makers Micron Technology and AMD fell 6.9 percent and 4.4 percent. Intel dropped 3.4 percent. Concerns about the impact of a trade war seemed to be spreading to some giant tech companies, including Apple, Google\u2019s parent Alphabet, and Microsoft. Because of those companies\u2019 large sizes, moves in their stock prices have big impacts on stock market indexes.Industrials also continued to respond poorly to the trade rancor. The S.&P. 500\u2019s industrial sector fell more than 1 percent, led by drops in American manufacturers like the aircraft maker Boeing and the machinery manufacturer Caterpillar, both of which have large and important markets in China.Advertisement"}

The smoldering mess and escalating trade battle that the American president left behind from his first visit to Canada was a particularly low moment in the history of the two countries\u2019 relationship (though it may have helped Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s domestic standing).The Times has been all over this story. I\u2019ve collected some of our best reads lower down.Many Canadians were among the thousands of readers who commented on those articles. Here are some highlights, condensed for clarity:President Trump, the farmers of Quebec thank you this morning.You have accomplished, in a flurry of tweets, what no other politician in Canada has been able to do over the past 30 years: garner near unanimous political support for our supply-side management system, and galvanize Canadians against U.S. pressure to change that system.\u2014 Norman, Kingston, QuebecThe U.S. has not had a better ally or friend in its history. Have we benefited? Yes. But I doubt many people remain for long in relationships where there is not some measure of reciprocity.\u2014 Rob Mills, CanadaMy only question this morning is: Are we still friends?\u2014 Robert, QuebecThe U.S. is NOT the only market we can sell our products to. Canadians are warm and friendly people. But we will not be bullied by any of your representatives.\u2014 Lagarde, MontrealAs far as Canadian domestic politics is concerned, Donald Trump is the great unifier. All of Trudeau\u2019s past and present political opponents are united in support of Trudeau\u2019s stand against Trump.\u2014 Roger D. Moore, Toronto Every longstanding ally has come to the grim realization that this administration cannot be reasoned with, cannot be convinced by rational argument and isn\u2019t our friend. Thanks for the last 151 years, it\u2019s been nice. I hope you all enjoy your new friend Kim Jong-un.\u2014 Henry\u2019s Boy, OttawaIn the news conference that had Trump and his advisers throwing a collective hissy fit, Trudeau repeated statements that he had been making for weeks, after Trump decided to arbitrarily levy tariffs on Canadian-made aluminum and steel. Unlike Trump, Trudeau is being honest and consistent.\u2014 C. Evans, TorontoI really enjoy California wine, Florida orange juice, California avocados and camping in upstate New York. But they also make pretty good wine in France; maybe I\u2019ll buy that instead. I\u2019m pretty sure they grow avocados in Mexico; I think I\u2019ll pick those instead. My doctor says orange juice has too much sugar so maybe I\u2019ll just cut that out entirely. There\u2019s good camping here in Quebec as well, so I think I\u2019ll just stick close to home this summer.\u2014 Zac, MontrealThis won\u2019t play well with America\u2019s other allies who know Mr. Trudeau to be an honorable and decent person. Already European support is being expressed for Canada. Who wants to be friends with Trump? Nobody who ever got to know him.\u2014 Charles, St. John, New BrunswickTrade is the sum of many two-way individual transactions.

{"Headline": "Upheaval in Italy and Spain", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Two of Europe\u2019s southern countries, Italy and Spain, got new governments last week, each a curious mix of disparate parties and neither particularly stable. That\u2019s pretty much where the similarities end.Mr. S\u00e1nchez owed his success less to any common program in what is being called his \u201cFrankenstein Coalition\u201d than to public frustration with a corruption scandal related to a secret campaign fund Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party ran from 1999 to 2005. Mr. Rajoy, prime minister since 2011, claimed ignorance of the goings-on, but popular indignation boiled over last month when 29 people, including a former party treasurer, were convicted of corruption.What next was far from clear, but unlike the reaction to Italy\u2019s government, the European Union and financial markets displayed little anxiety over Spain. Mr. Rajoy was credited with steering Spain through a period of E.U.-backed austerity, and though Spain\u2019s unemployment rate is among Europe\u2019s highest, the country has had three straight years of growth above 3 percent. Mr. S\u00e1nchez, a former basketball player nicknamed Mr. Handsome, is a solid Europeanist who has pledged to retain the outgoing government\u2019s budget and to honor obligations to the European Union.The biggest immediate challenge for Mr. S\u00e1nchez is the secessionist movement in the autonomous province of Catalonia. His swearing-in on Saturday coincided with the installation of a new government in Catalonia under Quim Torra, who promptly declared he would continue to press for independence from Spain. Last year, a unilateral declaration of independence by the Catalan government ignited a constitutional crisis in which Catalan leaders were arrested or fled and the Spanish government took direct control of the province. The Socialists supported the government at the time, but Catalan parties are part of Mr. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s coalition, so he may be open to calls for talks.It is anybody\u2019s guess whether Mr. S\u00e1nchez survives until the next scheduled election in two years, but in any case he is not likely to do anything to destabilize the economy or challenge Spain\u2019s place in the European Union, if only because he doesn\u2019t have the parliamentary votes for it.Italy\u2019s government is a different matter. The populist coalition there has promised tax cuts and welfare spending that could exacerbate an already onerous national debt, and though the partners are no longer threatening to abandon the euro, blaming the E.U. is central to their message. Actually running a government, however, has a way of moderating populist bluster.As in any time of political turmoil, there\u2019s plenty of reason for the rest of Europe to be wary and watchful. But petty tutelage is the last thing Brussels should do. This is a tale of two democracies working out their own problems.Advertisement"}

Now, many fear that the proposed economic zones would be dominated by Chinese investors, including possibly state-owned companies.Past protests against China have become a focal point for a range of grievances against the Vietnamese government, including the seizure of farmland to build malls and factories.The worst rioting occurred at a steel factory being built in Ha Tinh Province by a subsidiary of Taiwan\u2019s giant Formosa Plastics Group, where the company employed thousands of laborers from mainland China. Protesters stopped buses, pulled off Chinese passengers and beat them. Four people were killed.Many people were sickened from eating poisoned fish and the coastal fishing economy collapsed, prompting numerous demonstrations along Vietnam\u2019s central coast.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Picks Economic Winners, Guided by Nostalgia", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump tries to tilt global trade in the United States\u2019 favor, he is increasingly putting his finger on the scale to help once-iconic industries that are declining as a share of the American economy, at the expense of some of the country\u2019s fastest-growing sectors.The president\u2019s attempts to boost domestic steel manufacturing and coal mining have come largely through policies that limit foreign competition, like tariffs, and proposals to prevent coal-fired power plants from closing. Those efforts have produced only modest job gains so far in two blue-collar sectors that Mr. Trump championed in his run to the White House. But they have injected uncertainty into a host of other growing industries \u2014 such as advanced manufacturing, natural gas production and renewable energy generation \u2014 that have helped drive American job creation since the Great Recession.By crafting an industrial policy that largely looks to the past, Mr. Trump differs from his predecessors, who often attempted to hasten the emergence of new industries and position the United States to lead the way.On energy, both the Barack Obama and George W. Bush administrations enacted tax breaks and federal loan guarantees for emerging technologies like wind power or electric cars that were not initially competitive but, they believed, would eventually become widespread as the world shifted toward cleaner energy.Mr. Trump\u2019s approach, by contrast, has largely focused on saving legacy sectors whose workforces have been hurt by globalization, automation and innovation.But while the approach has helped Mr. Trump remain popular with many working-class white voters, it has done little to help those populations prepare for changes that could further decimate their professions.\u201cCoal is not coming back,\u201d said Joshua D. Rhodes, a research fellow at the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cFurther subsidies right now will only prevent workers from being retrained or building careers elsewhere \u2014 which will make things even more painful when the bottom finally does drop out.\u201d\u201cTen years ago, the joke among industry players was that renewables were the energy source of the future and always would be,\u201d said Andy Karsner, a former assistant secretary of energy in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cProblem is, that future has arrived, and coal is now the energy source of the past and always will be.\u201dSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs have also set off retaliation from trading partners, who are hitting American goods with tariffs of their own on food, steel and other products that domestic manufacturers export overseas. And Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on $350 billion worth of foreign autos and auto parts could wind up hurting the domestic auto industry, which gets its parts from abroad. It could also result in higher car prices for American consumers.Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers insist that Mr. Trump\u2019s bold trade stance is boosting growth in the United States, alongside a more broad-based economic agenda that includes cutting taxes and reducing federal regulation of business.\u201cWe\u2019re pushing through 3 percent\u201d growth, Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the National Economic Council, said in a recent briefing with reporters. \u201cSome said it couldn\u2019t be done. It is being done, and we\u2019re proud of it. And I think President Trump\u2019s policies of lower taxes and major regulatory rollback are a key part of this issue.\u201dBut many economists who favor industrial policy efforts and have long argued for more aggressive trade policies to protect American workers say Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach has hurt the blue-collar workers he is trying to protect.\u201cThe trade policies have been so erratic and inconsistently messaged that they are not a part of a broader strategic plan for the economy,\u201d said Thea Lee, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute and a trade specialist. \u201cEven to the extent that there is some playing favorites, singling out workers in different sectors, that\u2019s problematic, because it\u2019s dividing. What workers need are policies that will be empowering, that will lift them up across sectors and not divide them.\u201dFree-market conservatives, who frequently criticized President Obama\u2019s efforts to \u201cpick winners and losers\u201d and favor emerging technologies like wind and solar, have found even less to like in Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to rescue aging power plants in danger of going under.\u201cFrom an economic standpoint, this is one of the worst things you can do,\u201d Nicolas Loris, a research fellow in energy and environmental policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to help ailing coal plants. \u201cIt would keep a whole bunch of uncompetitive resources in place and choke off alternative investment strategies because those resources aren\u2019t allowed to die off.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charleston Apologizes for City\u2019s Role in Slave Trade", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharleston, the South Carolina port city where about 40 percent of enslaved Africans who were brought to North America landed after being taken from their homelands, has become the latest city to apologize for its role in the slave trade.In an emotional and at times heated meeting that drew a standing-room-only crowd, the Charleston City Council on Tuesday night approved a two-page resolution in City Hall \u2014 a structure built by slaves \u2014 that its supporters saw as a step toward racial healing.The resolution, which was approved by voice vote and was met with loud cheers, recognized that the city had flourished at the cost of those enslaved and apologized on behalf of the city for its role in the trade. It also acknowledged wrongs committed against African-Americans by slavery and Jim Crow laws.The resolution pledges city officials will work with businesses and organizations to strive for racial equality, and suggests the creation of an office of racial conciliation to help the process of racial healing.But some people who spoke during a public comment period and council members who debated the resolution for nearly two hours questioned whether it went far enough to tackle systemic issues, like affordable housing, economic development and criminal justice matters facing the city\u2019s African-Americans.Mayor John Tecklenburg, who supported the measure, spoke of how \u201cenamored and intertwined\u201d the city had been with slavery. \u201cDo we have a reason to be sorry, to apologize?\u2019\u2019 he said, his voice unsteady. \u201cWe do.\u201dCouncilman William Dudley Gregorie drew a comparison between children born into slavery who were separated from their parents and migrant children and parents who, under the current immigration policy in the United States, he said, \u201care being torn from their parents and put into detention camps.\u201d The resolution would be a way to apologize and move forward, he said.But other council members voted against the resolution, saying they wanted to see more tangible action.Councilman Perry K. Waring said he wanted more to be done to empower the city\u2019s African-American community. \u201cAs a descendant of slaves, I cannot support this resolution,\u201d he said.Councilman Harry Griffin also said that the city needed to address other issues first. Mr. Griffin abruptly ended his comments after the crowd interrupted him when he said he would not support the resolution.The resolution acknowledged that \u201cfundamental to the economy of colonial and antebellum Charleston was slave labor, Charleston prospering as it did due to the expertise, ingenuity and hard labor of enslaved Africans who were forced to endure inhumane working conditions that produced wealth for many, but which was denied to them.\u201dBefore the vote, dozens of people spoke in favor of the resolution. Some warned it should not be a last step, but one toward equality in the form of opportunities for black entrepreneurs and racial equity training.Advertisement"}

But a violent battle over attempts to create it in English-speaking areas of largely French-speaking Cameroon is quickly escalating. Schools, homes and villages in the Central African nation have been burned to the ground. Travel between some towns has been blocked.For a year and a half, the Cameroonian military has been accused of beating and arresting people suspected of being separatists, torching homes and killing unarmed protesters.For their part, separatists have taken up arms and have also turned to violence. They have been accused of burning markets, launching attacks from civilian bases, beheading soldiers and kidnapping people they suspect as traitors.Videos purporting to show abuses on both sides have circulated on social media, fanning already sky-high tensions. Propaganda and lies proliferate. Both sides are using incendiary rhetoric: The military calls the separatists \u201cterrorists,\u201d while the separatists\u2014 many part of the Cameroonian diaspora \u2014 have accused the military of \u201cgenocide.\u201d\u201cWe see the situation degenerating from a crisis to a conflict,\u201d said Gaby Ambo, executive director of the Finders Group Initiative, a human rights group in Cameroon. \u201cAnd if nothing is done soon, it will turn into a civil war with grave consequences.\u201dAnglophone separatists have been fighting for recognition of Ambazonia \u2014 named after Ambas Bay in southern Cameroon, an 1800s-era settlement for freed slaves \u2014 for decades. But calls for secession have amplified significantly in recent months.So far Cameroon\u2019s government has refused to engage in meaningful dialogue with separatists, largely because it flat-out rejects losing territory. Anglophone regions contribute to the nation\u2019s economy and include important palm oil and other agricultural production.\u201cIt is not possible to sit around the table with groups who would like to take the nation and cleave the nation,\u201d said Issa Tchiroma Bakary, Cameroon\u2019s information minister.\u201cSecession,\u201d he said, carefully emphasizing every word, \u201cthis shall never, ever take place.\u201d\u201cWe are at a very, very dangerous crossroads,\u201d Mr. Ayaba said. \u201cThe absence of willingness on the part of Cameroon to negotiate itself out of its occupation of Ambazonia and insistence on the utilization of disproportionate force leaves the Ambazonian people with no other choice than to defend themselves.\u201dEnglish-speaking citizens of Cameroon make up about a fifth of the population in two of the nation\u2019s 10 regions. Modern-day Cameroon is one of the most geographically, ethnically and linguistically diverse countries on the continent, so much so that it is known as \u201cLittle Africa.\u201d But its two official languages, French and English, come from colonization.Independence for both territories came in the early 1960s with a reunification referendum that, over some objections, limited any option for Anglophone Southern Cameroon to become its own country. Instead, voters were allowed to choose only between joining either Cameroon or neighboring Nigeria. They chose Cameroon.A move away from a federal model and political wrangling in the years that followed left some Anglophones feeling cheated out of power. Even a star representing English-speaking areas on Cameroon\u2019s flag was removed at one point. In the early 1980s when Paul Biya became president, he further centralized power to French-speaking areas.Many English speakers contend they have been marginalized by a government that has failed to give them resources and opportunities for years.Aid workers and analysts attribute many of the problems to the fact that Mr. Biya, one of the continent\u2019s so-called presidents for life, has been in office since the early 1980s. His entrenched grip on power in the French-speaking capital has made it difficult for anyone not in his orbit to climb the Civil Service or political ranks.The new violence threatens to cast a shadow over presidential elections in October when Mr. Biya, 85, is seeking yet another term.Their rallies began to draw hundreds of citizens airing grievances. As they grew in size, the rallies turned violent, with the police firing on protesters. At least 20 were killed, some when security forces fired from helicopters, according to Amnesty International.\u201cEvery day, there is more bad news,\u201d said Col. Didier Badjeck, a Cameroonian defense spokesman.The report says Cameroon\u2019s security forces have arrested hundreds of activists and journalists, torturing nearly two dozen minors to extract confessions. Last year, Cameroon blocked the internet and cut phone lines for months. It jailed the self-declared interim president of the Federal Republic of Ambazonia and dozens of others after they fled to Nigeria and were sent back.\u201cIt\u2019s getting dire,\u201d said Agbor Nkongho, founder and chairman of the Center for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa, who is based in Buea, Cameroon. \u201cThe average civilian is the one who\u2019s suffering.\u201dColonel Badjeck would not comment on specific abuses by the military but said that Cameroon\u2019s armed forces respected human rights and that any reports of abuses were investigated, and perpetrators punished. The military has peacefully arrested separatists who put down their weapons, he said. \u201cIf they have their arms up, we will protect them,\u201d he said.But if not, Colonel Badjeck said: \u201cWe are military. We are going to shoot them. It is a war. You can\u2019t go into a sovereign country and have weapons and shoot police and military. Even in the United States, if you see a terrorist who has a gun, the military is supposed to neutralize these guys.\u201dMr. Bakary, the information minister, said that any abuses, including the burning of villages were being investigated.\u201cThe responsibility of the army is to protect the lives and well-being and the property of our brothers and sisters who speak English,\u201d said Mr. Bakary, who vigorously disputed the notion that the military was engaged in genocide. \u201cIt is unbelievable and unthinkable we willingly would turn the guns against our own people.\u201cObservers at human rights organizations who did not want to be identified because of security concerns have decried the use of the word genocide, saying that while it appears the military has carried out abuses it is not engaged in so-called ethnic cleansing. Cameroonian officials have neither talked of purging the nation of Anglophones nor said that Anglophones are not Cameroonian.The officials have accused separatists of launching attacks from civilian bases and putting lives of innocents at risk.Separatist leaders said attacks on civilians by any of their forces were unacceptable and would be investigated. But Mr. Ayabasaid attacks on security forces were legitimate.\u201cWe want them to withdraw from our country,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir presence is illegal. They have encroached within Ambazonia illegally and dismantled our economic, political and social system. They have engaged in systematic policies of torture political exclusion economic deprivation.\u201dMr. Ayaba, who lives in Europe in a country he refused to identify because he fears for his safety, has been fighting for recognition of Ambazonia since he was a student in the 1990s living in Anglophone Cameroon and attending a university that he said was poorly equipped and neglected by the government. Back then he was involved in protest that turned violent and involved mass arrests.Mr. Ayaba is one of several activists living abroad, many of whom were united in a peaceful pursuit of the creation of Ambazonia until recently.The turn to violence prompted splits within the council.\u201cThe situation may be running out of control,\u201d said Edwin Ngang, who lives in Minnesota and is the senior presidential adviser of the Republic of Ambazonia and community organizer for the Ambazonia People\u2019s Restoration Movement.Mr. Ngang\u2019s profile picture on WhatsApp is a poster for a pro-Ambazonia rally earlier this year in Hagerstown, Md., proclaiming \u201cstop apartheid.\u201d The word \u201cgenocide\u201d is spelled out in dripping, blood-red letters.Mr. Ngang and other separatists lament the lack of attention the crisis has received internationally.\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for the misery index to reach a certain scale before they intervene,\u201d he said.The United States ambassador to Cameroon has called on both sides to stop the violence and listen to each other.Tens of thousands of people have fled the violence, some arriving across the border in Nigeria. Others still living in Anglophone areas are hunkered down, afraid. One of them, Peter Tafu, said his six children had not been to school in more than a year and a half.\u201cIf my children go to school,\u201d said Mr. Tafu, \u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll come back home alive.\u201dFran\u00e7ois Essomba contributed reporting from Yaound\u00e9, CameroonAdvertisement"}

He gave only his first name for fear of repercussions. He said he had voted for the governing party over the past 16 years but complained angrily about the deteriorating economy.\u201cNo jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here for 22 years, it became worse gradually. Our money has no value anymore.\u201dIf 7 to 8 percent of formerly loyal voters abandon the president\u2019s Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., the governing party will lose, said Ozer Sencar, who runs the independent Metropoll polling agency.There are already signs of defections, Mr. Sencar said, noting that some of them had voted against Mr. Erdogan in last year\u2019s referendum to expand the powers of the presidency, which passed only narrowly.\u201cThis is the group that will determine the fate of the election,\u201d he said.Most of the group are conservative Islamists among the Kurds who are disappointed that Mr. Erdogan failed to keep his promise to make peace with Kurdish separatists, Mr. Sencar said.But the state of emergency Mr. Erdogan snapped in place almost two years ago after a failed coup has allowed the government to tilt the playing field greatly in its favor.Mr. Erdogan has used the extra powers to jail political opponents, including nine Kurdish members of Parliament and dozens of Kurdish party officials, as well as 70,000 students and activists and tens of thousands of members of the military and public employees. Demonstrations are banned, and access to national television is tightly controlled.The Kurdish candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, has campaigned from prison, where he is being held while he awaits trial on terrorism charges. He relies on a team of lawyers to relay his messages on social media. And last week he was permitted to record a single campaign speech inside prison that was aired on the state-run Turkish Radio and Television, or T.R.T.Muharrem Ince, the closest challenger to Mr. Erdogan, fares slightly better, appearing on some television channels but still barred from T.R.T.Over the past six weeks, Mr. Erdogan has enjoyed 181 hours of national television airtime, while Mr. Ince was allowed 15 hours, Ms. Aksener three hours and the rest one hour or less, according to the Supreme Board of Radio and Television.It is Mr. Ince who has been Mr. Erdogan\u2019s main target, smeared by \u201cfake news\u201d campaigns by government supporters. But he has parried the attacks with humor and a hopeful message and has started drawing crowds to match those of Mr. Erdogan.Yet there is no doubt that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s persona has dominated the campaign. His campaign posters are the largest and most numerous. His rallies are broadcast live on virtually every television channel. And his voice is heard everywhere.He also controls all the levers of power, rules by decree under a state of emergency and can count on a tame judiciary and presidential guard.Government employees are ordered to attend Mr. Erdogan\u2019s rallies \u2014 and give him their vote if they value their jobs \u2014 opposition campaigners say \u2014 and journalists in media outlets, which are mostly owned by allies of the president, are given guidelines on what to write.But signs of disaffection are visible. Supporters declare their love for Mr. Erdogan, yet many start leaving his rallies halfway through his long-winded speeches.The former Islamist allies who have turned against the president are the most outspoken.Temel Karamollaoglu, leader of the small Felicity Party, criticizes Mr. Erdogan for betraying his religion by letting corruption and injustice invade his government. He is set to draw away 2 to 3 percent of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s conservative religious following.\u201cYou cannot have one man with all the power,\u201d Mr. Karamollaoglu told supporters in the town of Sakarya. \u201cYou cannot expect any justice from judges receiving orders from the top.\u201dThe Republican People\u2019s Party, which has a long tradition of secularism, has added several Islamists to its party list to build an Islamist alternative to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s A.K.P.One of the co-founders of the A.K.P. with Mr. Erdogan, a former deputy prime minister, Abdullatif Sener, is running for Parliament on the Republican People\u2019s Party list in the conservative city of Konya.He stunned villagers during meetings in a farming district with strident criticism of Mr. Erdogan, the likes of which is never heard in the mainstream media.\u201cIf you cannot buy food and clothes for yourself, it means the economy is not growing,\u201d he told them, disputing government claims of 7 percent growth.He accused Mr. Erdogan of neglecting Turkey\u2019s agriculture to make money on deals importing foodstuffs.\u201cYou want to farm your land but this government made us completely dependent on imports,\u201d he said. \u201cAll they think of is ransacking the country.\u201dA shopkeeper in the village of Cayhan told Mr. Sener that villagers were too scared to tell the truth but that almost all were going to switch their support away from Mr. Erdogan.\u201cSomething is going to happen,\u201d said Bulent Ecevit Tatlidil, a member of the executive bureau of the Republican People\u2019s Party who is from the farming district.Outrage over a sudden paucity of onions has even hit the main television news. Ms. Aksener accused Mr. Erdogan of treason for his neglect of agriculture.\u201cOne million are jobless,\u201d she told a rally in Istanbul. \u201cThe fields are empty, livestock is finished. To wipe out Turkish agriculture is treason.\u201dYet the opposition is also bracing for every manner of obstruction, including fraud and violence.Mr. Sener\u2019s campaign office in Konya was attacked last week by members of the local youth wing of the A.K.P., who slashed a poster of Mr. Sener and smashed campaign cars.The opposition parties are fielding 100,000 volunteers to observe voting in every polling station but face multiple challenges as regulations have been changed to allow unstamped ballots to be counted, and some polling stations have been closed and voting moved to other locations.In the southeast, violence has already broken out; an election dispute led to the deaths of three people in the town of Suruc. Some analysts speculated that the clash was about how to fix the vote for Mr. Erdogan.The Kurdish vote, which represents about 10 percent, is particularly important for both sides.If Mr. Demirtas\u2019s People\u2019s Democratic Party, or H.D.P., can pass a 10 percent threshold, it could rob Mr. Erdogan of a majority in Parliament.If the party wins less than 10 percent of the vote, its votes will be distributed to the other parties, which would most likely help Mr. Erdogan secure a majority.In a sign of how crucial the Kurdish vote is, Mr. Erdogan urged party members to make sure the H.D.P. vote remained below 10 percent.Then he asked his supporters to \u201cmark their opponents,\u201d suggesting that by doing so they would be doing \u201ca special job that I believe may bring us a very different result.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S.-China Trade Talks End in an Impasse", "Date": "2018-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The United States and China ended trade talks in Beijing on Sunday without any announced deals and with Chinese officials refusing to commit to buying more American goods without a Trump administration agreement not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports.\u201cIf the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,\u201d China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media.The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China\u2019s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran.President Trump had sent to the talks what was essentially an export promotion team led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and including senior officials from the Treasury and from the Agriculture Department. Conspicuously absent were top officials from the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which has threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion a year in Chinese goods, in addition to the tariffs already imposed on $3 billion a year in Chinese steel and aluminum exports.But at the end of the negotiations, Beijing officials refused to pledge any additional purchases from the United States without an American agreement to resolve broader trade issues.If the United States imposes the tariffs, China has previously said, Beijing would retaliate by blocking an equal value of soybeans and other goods from the United States. That would amount to more than one-third of Chinese imports of American goods.\u201cChinese officials know these talks are precarious, but may underestimate the domestic political cost Trump now sees in lifting the ZTE ban without major concessions from China,\u201d said Andrew Gilholm, the director of China analysis at Control Risks, a political and security consulting firm. \u201cIf the ban stays, Beijing\u2019s retaliation will definitely go up a gear.\u201dChinese state media have glossed over why the United States sales ban was imposed: ZTE\u2019s ties to North Korea and Iran. The company\u2019s links to North Korea in particular are politically inconvenient for China because Beijing has claimed that China\u2019s enforcement of international sanctions against North Korea helped pave the way for the coming summit meeting in Singapore between Mr. Trump and North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un.State news outlets have portrayed the ZTE decision as having been made by Mr. Ross\u2019s Commerce Department, and they have suggested that it is merely a bargaining ploy as part of trade negotiations. But though the Bureau of Industry and Security, a law enforcement agency, is legally part of the Commerce Department, it has considerable autonomy.Agents of the bureau carry badges and guns, and the agency has played a central role for decades in trying to prevent Iraq and Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons technology.Further trade frictions between the United States and China could also create difficulties for Vice Premier Liu He, a close ally of President Xi Jinping. Mr. Liu, an economist, is seen as one of the few moderates in a Chinese government increasingly dominated by advocates of greater state control of the economy.\u201cTrump\u2019s strategy does no favors for the moderates like trade negotiator Liu He who are eager to take China down a more manageable path of market and financial reforms, and such reforms would indeed be good for U.S. commercial interests,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a partner in the Beijing office of the law firm Perkins Coie and a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.Chris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Summit Nears, NATO Allies Have One Main Worry: Trump", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 NATO has been preparing for its July summit meeting for a year now, but there is one wild card: President Trump.Nobody knows which president will show up \u2014 the truculent one railing about inadequate military spending by the allies or the boastful one taking credit for recent spending increases.There, Mr. Trump focused on two of his fixed ideas: the unfairness of trade with European allies and their inadequate level of military spending. He then departed early for Singapore, where he met with and praised the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.The Trump administration regards Western European nations as free-riders on an American-funded, postwar peace that enabled them to build lavish social benefit systems because they spent so little on defending themselves. He has also made clear that he thinks the European Union, as a trading bloc, has taken advantage of American generosity.European and some American officials say they dread the same pattern \u2014 a noisy, divisive NATO summit, damaging deterrence, followed by a chummy meeting with a dictator, in this case Mr. Putin, whose long-term goals are to destabilize the European Union, undermine NATO and restore Russian influence over Eastern Europe, the Baltic States and the Balkans.Whatever the organization has prepared, \u201cthe only real deliverable for NATO summits is solidarity and cohesion,\u201d said Douglas Lute, a former American general and ambassador to the organization. \u201cBut that is at risk because the odds are that Trump will deliver a G-7 performance. And I fear that we will come out of this summit with symbols of division.\u201dR. Nicholas Burns, a former NATO ambassador and career diplomat who served both Republican and Democratic administrations, asked: \u201cWhich Trump will show up?\u201dThe headline for the summit meeting, he said, \u201cshould be about NATO\u2019s containment of Russia in Eastern Europe, but Trump might blow it all up for Putin.\u201d If Mr. Trump \u201carrives pushing dialogue with Russia with no clear deliverables from Moscow in return, it will make a mess in NATO.\u201dEven senior American officials said they had no clarity on Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions for this meeting. They have told senior European officials that a lot will depend on Mr. Trump\u2019s mood as he arrives and what is being highlighted on his favorite American news media outlets such as Fox News. And no one expects him to sit quietly through nearly two days of normally mind-numbing speeches by at least 28 other leaders.For its two-day meeting on July 11 and 12 in its new headquarters (which Mr. Trump has disparaged), NATO has prepared significant steps to enhance deterrence against Russia.Who would deploy those forces is still to be decided, but NATO is also planning to sign off on a revised command structure, including two new commands, one devoted to troop mobility and one to maritime security. There will be agreement on an enhanced NATO training mission in Iraq and on putting more effort into cyber warfare and counterterrorism.But if there is a repeat of the Group of 7 haranguing, with public criticism of the allies, the Europeans will be caught, one NATO official said, between smiling as they are attacked or choosing to challenge Mr. Trump, which they know will almost surely go badly and make them the target of his next Twitter blast.Julianne Smith, director of the Trans-Atlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said that \u201cEuropean officials are thinking about how to respond, about what it costs them politically at home and what it costs them bilaterally, with Washington.\u201dThe Europeans are also anxious about the fate of Mr. Mattis, who is an outspoken supporter of the NATO alliance and an aggressive stance toward Russia.With John Bolton as national security adviser and Mike Pompeo as secretary of state, Mr. Trump has rejected the defense secretary\u2019s advice on North Korea and on preserving the Iran nuclear deal.At the Group of 7 meeting, Mr. Trump approached some European leaders and asked them for their thoughts on Mr. Mattis, said Ms. Smith, who was deputy national security adviser to Vice President Biden.\u201cIt was awkward for them and might be the kiss of death,\u201d if they praised him, she said, \u201cso they said deliberately that he is being so tough on us on 2 percent defense spending, to try to save the guy.\u201dBut they worry about how heated, and how public, it might get. Mr. Trump\u2019s past comments suggest that he thinks that there is some NATO treasury to which members owe dues, and that allies are behind on their payments.\u201cSince January of last year, every member of NATO but one has increased defense spending,\u201d he said.\u201cThe number that will spend 2 percent of GDP on defense by 2024 has more than tripled (from five to 18). The number allocating at least 20 percent of their military spending to major equipment purchases has more than doubled (from 14 to 26). And the alliance as a whole has increased military spending by 5.2 percent (or $14.4 billion) \u2014 the largest one-year surge in defense spending in a generation.\u201dBut there are European concerns that Mr. Trump will try to tie military spending to trade issues at the meeting, especially with Ms. Merkel.\u201cIf Germany needed another wakeup call about Trump, the G-7 was it,\u201d said Daniela Schwarzer, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWith potential tariffs on European cars and the NATO summit, the pressure on Germany is growing,\u201d she said.Berlin is also concerned about potential American sanctions aimed at the Nord Stream II pipeline from Russia to Germany, bypassing Ukraine and Poland, new tariffs on foreign cars, and American secondary sanctions against European companies that might invest in Iran to try to save the Iran nuclear deal.So there are discussions in Germany and France about how to increase leverage on Washington, a new concept.\u201cWe\u2019ve been allies and partners, but now with Trump we are competitors, and he is implementing policies aimed against Europe,\u201d she added. That made it harder for politicians to sell increased military spending, she said, because it would look like giving in to Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent admiration for Mr. Putin is also raising concerns, said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, president of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and a French defense analyst.Mr. Trump \u201cmay act on his instincts and try to do a bilateral deal with strongman Putin and sacrifice NATO interests \u2014 he might lift sanctions on Crimea, cancel military exercises or withdraw American troops from the Baltics,\u201d Mr. Heisbourg said. \u201cWe saw it with Kim Jong-un.\u201dThere is also concern that because Mr. Putin objects to any new NATO member, Mr. Trump may try to block an invitation for the newly named Republic of North Macedonia.Ian Lesser, director of the German Marshall Fund and a former American diplomat, said that \u201cmeeting Putin in the wake of a symbolic and successful NATO summit is one thing, but a meeting against the backdrop of a summit that goes badly is quite another.\u201dBurden-sharing was important, Mr. Lesser said, \u201cbut it\u2019s wrong to suggest that the U.S. has no interest of its own in European security, as if it were some charitable gift. We\u2019re stakeholders in European security, with our own interests and reasons to spend money,\u201d he said, especially in the light of Russia\u2019s efforts to destabilize Western democracies and NATO.\u201cThe irony is that this should be a good NATO summit, with consequential improvements of deterrence,\u201d said Tomas Valasek, a former Slovak ambassador to NATO who now runs Carnegie Europe. \u201cBut with the memories of the G-7 fresh, the headlines will be all about the leaders and the mood of Donald Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As a Trade War With China Looms, the Fed\u2019s Powell Did Not Sound Worried", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made comments on Wednesday that are likely to go down well with supporters of President Trump\u2019s increasingly belligerent trade policies.At the news conference after the Fed\u2019s two-day meeting, a reporter asked Mr. Powell whether the escalating trade tensions were a risk to the United States economy and whether they might be having an impact on the investment decisions of companies.Mr. Powell said Fed officials had picked up on rising concerns about trade among business executives, and he said there were reports of companies holding off on investments. But Mr. Powell seemed to go out of his way to emphasize that there was no evidence that the trade frictions were weighing on corporate behavior. He said:\u201cSo, right now, we don\u2019t see that in the numbers at all. The economy is very strong, the labor market is strong, growth is strong. We really don\u2019t see it in the numbers. It\u2019s just not there. But \u2014 so I \u2014 I would put it down as more of a risk.\u201dOf course, Mr. Powell may have gotten carried away when he gave his response. But he said more or less the same thing minutes later.Mr. Powell is probably right that economic data shows no evidence that fears of a trade war are damping activity. But top Fed officials are often more circumspect when discussing threats to the economy, especially those that could soon become real. This Friday, the Trump administration is scheduled to announce a final list of tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, and impose them shortly after. China has said it will retaliate.How might Mr. Powell have done things differently? The Fed\u2019s top official might, after mentioning the lack of numerical evidence, have also stressed that trade battles can send chills through the economy and create hard-to-spot risks. Such an answer would have been less debatable and, perhaps, accurate.There\u2019s another possibility: Mr. Powell did not want worries over trade to muddy the main message of the meeting on Wednesday when the Fed announced that it was raising interest rates. Its monetary policy statement, along with many of Mr. Powell\u2019s comments, communicated that the United States economy was strengthening and that the central bank was ready to respond with a tap on the brakes.True, Mr. Powell should place much more weight on hard numbers, and trade battles may end up having little impact on the economy. But the lack of classic, central banker equivocation stood out. This is what Mr. Powell also said:\u201cThere is \u2014 there is concern that trade changes could be disruptive, and I also mentioned, we don\u2019t see it in the numbers yet.

{"Headline": "Senate Republicans Are Newly Hopeful About the Midterms. For Good Reason.", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After a turbulent first year confronting friendly fire from President Trump, Senate Republicans are entering the summer before the midterm elections feeling more hopeful about retaining their narrow majority than at any time since the president\u2019s election. And for good reason.This past week brought two developments that drew little attention for their Senate implications but could prove pivotal in November.\u201cThe Republican caucus in the Senate is feeling substantially more optimistic now than at this time last year,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, predicting his party will gain a handful of seats.But that Republicans are even discussing the prospect of gaining Senate seats, in the first midterm campaign of a president whose approval rating has never reached 50 percent, illustrates the wildly divergent electoral landscapes for the House and the Senate.While the fight for control of the House is playing out mainly in the affluent and highly educated suburban districts that have been hotbeds of anti-Trump fervor, many of them on the coasts, the Senate campaign is taking place on much more Trump-friendly terrain. Six of the most competitive Senate races are in states he carried by double digits: Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia. (Democrats hold all of those seats except Tennessee\u2019s.)A major question looming over the 2018 Senate contest is whether so-called wave election years \u2014 in which one party makes significant gains in both chambers of Congress, as happened in 1994 and 2006 \u2014 can still exist as the country grows more polarized and politics more shaped by hardening party preferences. With ticket-splitting fading, especially in federal races, voters are increasingly turning to lawmakers who reflect the presidential leanings of their state.That could spell trouble for Democrats representing largely conservative electorates and states where surveys show that, unlike in much of the country, the president is viewed more favorably than unfavorably.\u201cIn the middle of the country people are by and large center-right, and they see the national Democratic brand as really far left, which is a ball and chain those senators have to carry around,\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said.But Democrats argue that the well-cultivated reputations and financial advantages of party incumbents like Senators Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Jon Tester of Montana and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia matter as much as the red-leaning nature of their states.And they say that what passes for good news on the right \u2014 simply being competitive in states the G.O.P. otherwise dominates \u2014 underscores the Republicans\u2019 weakness in a year when the map is so favorable.\u201cWe\u2019re feeling very good about our chances,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, adding, \u201cAt a minimum, there\u2019s a 50-50 chance we\u2019re going to take back the Senate.\u201dThere are only nine Republican seats in play, but Democrats believe they have the chance to win in three: Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee.Yet even some Democrats concede that Republicans have seen their prospects brighten recently \u2014 thanks to their actions in some cases and their good fortune in others. \u201cThey are limiting their vulnerabilities,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, a Democratic strategist, conceding that \u201cit\u2019s entirely possible we lose two or three seats.\u201dThe sudden resignation of Mr. Greitens delivered immense relief to Republicans, and none more than Josh Hawley, the attorney general of Missouri. Mr. Hawley has been under fire for running a lackluster campaign against Senator Claire McCaskill, a wily political veteran trying to hang on in a state that has moved sharply away from Democrats.\u201cPeople will move very quickly to other issues that more normally would be part of a Senate campaign,\u201d Mr. Blunt said. He added wryly that \u201cif we have learned anything from President Trump, it\u2019s that people are willing to move on from a topic pretty quickly.\u201dEven if Mr. McCain were to vacate his office before November, Republicans believe that the governor would not be obliged to schedule a special election this year. They say that May 30 was the final day for candidates to submit petitions to run and that there is no mechanism in state law to add candidates to the ballot.Mr. McCain\u2019s presence does not just deny Democrats an opening to compete in two Arizona Senate races this fall \u2014 it may also strengthen Republican chances to retain Mr. Flake\u2019s seat.\u201cIt is a very low bar when you\u2019re celebrating the fact that a governor resigned because of a sex scandal and the candidate who had been criminally convicted in West Virginia is not your nominee,\u201d said Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who oversees the Senate Democratic campaign arm.But after watching Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating hover in the 30s for much of last year, and absorbing his frequent gibes, Republicans will take it.\u201cThat\u2019s a very big deal,\u201d Mr. Thune said with a chuckle about how Mr. Trump is turning his fire toward the Democrats. He said Mr. Trump had come to realize that \u201cattacking Republicans isn\u2019t helpful.\u201d But Mr. Thune also acknowledged that Mr. Trump could undercut the economic gains if he goes through with his tariff threats and \u201cretaliation is leveled against farm states.\u201dIndeed, even as they grow more optimistic, veteran Republicans know they are placing their fate in the hands of an unpredictable leader.\u201cWe\u2019re on the right track, things look pretty good today,\u201d Charles R. Black Jr., a veteran strategist, said. \u201cBut Trump is like a suicide bomber: He could still blow himself up the day before the election and ruin everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mhmm.DOUGLAS: Used to be so good.TAVERNISE: What was it like growing up in Baltimore as a kid?PARKER: Safe. Girl, we used to sleep on the front porch in the summertime. You know how in the summertime, it used to be 80 or 90 degrees at night? We used to sleep out on the porch. Had the door open all night. You could leave your house, leave the door open, won\u2019t nobody go in there. It was like one big happy family.TAVERNISE: It was the 1950s and 1960s in Baltimore, and the Fergussons were part of this rising black middle class. PARKER: Our whole neighborhood was considered middle-class, because we lived in a neighborhood, and our parents worked, and they had cars. And they all \u2014 everybody had a job. Everybody had a husband.TAVERNISE: A lot of the men found work in the steel mill and the factories in the city. PARKER: Let me tell you, my father had this black 1957 Buick.TAVERNISE: A black 1957 Buick? PARKER: Mhmm. Girl.TAVERNISE: Was it pretty?PARKER: It was gorgeous. [MUSIC]PARKER: Every Sunday, he would take us for a ride in the car. You know, you know how you do the Sunday family thing? We\u2019d be singing in the car. We\u2019d all be singing. Yeah, uh huh. My father always said, if you want something, you go out and you get it. You get it and you buy it, and it\u2019s yours. You don\u2019t have nobody buy it for you or take care of you, because when that\u2019s all done, whatever they got you, it\u2019s going with them. My parents had to work for their money, and they showed us we had to work for ours.TAVERNISE: So Davetta went out and got a job. She got a job at the public library. It was the first job she\u2019d ever had, and she took it really, really seriously.[SOUND OF BOOK CART ROLLING PAST]PARKER: When I first started working here, I was only making $5,000. And I thought that was a lot of money, because I was 18, and I was young! And I\u2019ve been here ever since. TAVERNISE: And what was it like being a black woman and working in the library?PARKER: And young. Hard, because people was mean! [SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS]PARKER: In here \u2014 this is where I first started working at when I first started here. Then they changed this whole floor around. But it wasn\u2019t as pretty as it is now. This is pretty. I want you all to see this. There you go! Ain\u2019t it gorgeous? Look at that ceiling! It is gorgeous. Don\u2019t you feel a sense of peace just looking at it, just standing here? Like you can \u2014 it\u2019s like looking at a museum. And all you see is peace. It just brings you peace. Yeah. And sometimes I just come and stand and look at the ceiling and look at where I first started, back in the \u201970s. Yep.[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: It was the early \u201970s. It was a really different time from her mother. [ANGELA DAVIS: Particularly, we\u2019re talking about a group of black women, determined, fighting black women, who are aware of their responsibility to keep the fires of liberation raging. To be black and a woman is to labor under the double handicap of racism and sexism.]TAVERNISE: It was a period of sexual experimentation. There was the birth control pill. And you had this real sense that things were changing in terms of social mores and what was expected of you as a woman.PARKER: I was just experimenting. I was like a scientist. I just wanted to see what it was all about. I was \u2014 I\u2019m serious! TAVERNISE: She was this kind of skinny, scrawny, well-raised young woman who was aching to just plunge into the wildness of the decade that was kind of unfolding around her. So she\u2019s experimenting with sex.PARKER: I was just trying to see who was who. And everybody was different in their own way, and everybody had their own thing.TAVERNISE: And bam, she gets pregnant. And she\u2019s not happy about it. At all.PARKER: I\u2019m about to become a mama now? Oh, man. That\u2019s exactly how I did \u2014 aw, man, naw. I asked my sister, you want this baby? I mean, because I don\u2019t feel like taking no baby.TAVERNISE: The man she gets pregnant with is a guy who lived across the street, who she had a relationship with \u2014 but, you know, didn\u2019t leave a huge impression.TAVERNISE: What did you like about him?PARKER: Um. [HUMMING] That\u2019s the \u201cJeopardy\u201d when you\u2019re thinking. You want to know the truth? I can\u2019t say that on the microphone! Thought I was gonna say it, didn\u2019t you? See?TAVERNISE: Well, come on, just say it!PARKER: O.K., O.K. Well, the sex was good. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say. That was it, that was it right there. Uh huh. I got caught, so, it is what it is. But once she was born, it was like a whole different story.TAVERNISE: And that is baby Toby. And she was born in 1974.PARKER: She was really cute and fat, and very smart and very girlie. DOUGLAS: All I hear is stories about how I was such a pretty little girl.TAVERNISE: Toby was followed by a little sister, and after that, by a brother. And she was essentially just, like, this really adorable little baby doll that Davetta said she just loved playing with.PARKER: I liked to take them out when I dressed them up so people could see them, right? And she\u2019d be like a little model. You know? Yeah. Yeah, but it was fun. We had fun.TAVERNISE: She was a really social little girl. She loved people.PARKER: Oh yeah, you know what? Lemme tell you. DOUGLAS: I always liked to be around a lot of people. PARKER: Right, you always had that thing where you just have to be around a lot of people. You can\u2019t be alone. DOUGLAS: Everybody is family. I think everybody is family. PARKER: Tell \u2018em, we used to cook \u2014 y\u2019all used to cook sloppy joes and peas every day, didn\u2019t we? DOUGLAS: Mhmm, and you embarrassed me. You made me turn the radio off and put everybody out. What else do I remember? The house caught on fire when Shenika and I was on our way to Lafayette Elementary.PARKER: Yeah! The man next door, let me tell you, the man next door, he had, his house \u2014 he was a hoarder, and he had all this paper in his house. And it caught on fire! I forgot all about that \u2026 [MUSIC]PARKER: \u201980s was, like, a calm year. You know? Like, the settling, the changing. This is when the change was coming over. You could feel the change, but you didn\u2019t know what the change was gonna be. And we went to sleep and we woke up, and our whole life just changed. Like, our whole life just changed. [MUSIC]DOUGLAS: O.K., so this is when? In the \u201980s? That\u2019s when the crack came. That\u2019s when the streets of Baltimore was flooded with drugs.TAVERNISE: It was mid- to late 1980s. Crack came in.DOUGLAS: I didn\u2019t know it was crack. I knew something was happening.TAVERNISE: Crack was this lava that just started oozing into neighborhoods, and it just devoured the ecosystems there.PARKER: It got the best of the neighborhood. It got the best of the people. Drugs just started coming out like that. It just started going down, like \u2014 crack cocaine and weed. They was snorting that cocaine real bad here in Baltimore. TAVERNISE: And there was something else happening.[MUSIC][MUSIC]TAVERNISE: And Davetta is seeing this unfold before her eyes. PARKER: And I would move from one neighborhood \u2014 when it looked like it was getting bad, I\u2019d move us out of there, move in to another neighborhood.TAVERNISE: From house to house, neighborhood to neighborhood, hoping to escape, really outrun, this epidemic that is smashing through all of these families, all around.PARKER: We lived on Pimlico, Elgin Avenue, Loyola Southway, McCulloh Street. We had three, four, five, like six houses. I just wanted my kids to be in an environment where I know that when I come to work, they would come home. They would be protected. I didn\u2019t want them in an environment where I thought that I\u2019d be at work and somebody would be breaking into my house. Because I know they was there by theyselves.TAVERNISE: But the outside getting in \u2014 that really didn\u2019t end up being the problem.DOUGLAS: I would always sneak out of the house once I got back home from school to go down to the playground of my elementary school, because that\u2019s where all the kids lived. And I just wanted to be around everybody. Because I told you, back then, more, your family was your neighborhood. Or at least I thought, because I didn\u2019t have a big family. TAVERNISE: So she went exploring, and she went exploring in the neighborhoods of West Baltimore in the early- and mid-1980s.DOUGLAS: As a child, I thought my friends had it good. Like, my girlfriend Patrisse, her mother never worked. Her mother was always home. And then when she got home from school, her mother would be making her chicken nuggets. And I thought that was the life \u2014 have a refrigerator full of Murry\u2019s steakhouse food, mother\u2019s always home with them. They doing something right, ma, you talk about those people \u2014 those people doing something right. That\u2019s because they had food stamps. I didn\u2019t know.TAVERNISE: And your mom didn\u2019t have food stamps.DOUGLAS: Mm-mm. My mama was making it the way that she was taught. The right way. And you ain\u2019t going to have a house full of food if you working for the city, because they\u2019re not going to give you no food stamps. I thought they was living the good life. I couldn\u2019t understand it. They seemed like the happiest people. And they lived in them tall buildings. I thought if you lived in a building \u2014 and an elevator, I thought that was good living. I don\u2019t know, I just \u2014\u2014TAVERNISE: What she was actually seeing was the government paying for housing for people who could not afford it. She thought that that was just privileged people who were able to live in tall buildings with elevators that went up into the sky.[MUSIC]DOUGLAS: I got accepted to Western. TAVERNISE: She got admitted to Western High School, which was a very prestigious all-girls high school \u2014 kind of college prep high school in Baltimore.DOUGLAS: You had to have a certain G.P.A. to go there.TAVERNISE: Did you have a good G.P.A.?DOUGLAS: Mhmm. It was, like, 3.8 back then.TAVERNISE: Did she like school \u2014 Toby?PARKER: No.DOUGLAS: I hated it.PARKER: She went, but she didn\u2019t like it. The whole thing: getting up early, going in, learning. The whole shabam.DOUGLAS: All girls. Proper.PARKER: She would go, and she would do what she had to do, but she didn\u2019t really want to be there, you know. TAVERNISE: The minute she\u2019d get out of school, she would race over to the regular public high school, which was where her boyfriend went.DOUGLAS: I did go to Western like my mother made me, but then after school, I\u2019m gonna get on that bus. I\u2019m going down to Douglass with my friends. I wanted that world! Because, see, I had this boyfriend.TAVERNISE: His name was Donald. He was popular. He was into drugs and really was from one of those families that Davetta was trying to keep Toby away from.DOUGLAS: She wasn\u2019t used to the fast money. She worked for the city, the library, where she still work at today.TAVERNISE: So all of a sudden, her best friend, who was 13, was pregnant. And Davetta panics, because her daughter is running in that same crowd. DOUGLAS: My mother didn\u2019t know what to do to save me, because she had to work, and she had to try to save her child. Because she didn\u2019t know what this world was turning into.PARKER: Lord Jesus, what am I going to do with this girl? Oh my God.DOUGLAS: Her mother was in North Carolina. Get this girl!TAVERNISE: So Davetta turns to her own mother, to Ida, who had moved back to North Carolina.DOUGLAS: They came to my school and got me out of school one day, my mother and her twin sister. They already had my clothes. They put me in the car and took me to North Carolina. TAVERNISE: So Davetta takes Toby out of school and drives her down there.TAVERNISE: Were you mad?DOUGLAS: Of course I was! They took me away from my boyfriend, my first everything. He used to beat the mess out of me. He used to beat me up bad. I\u2019m glad they removed me, because I was chasing that other world so bad.TAVERNISE: Why did you want it?DOUGLAS: Because they stuck together. TAVERNISE: And they put her in school in North Carolina, and she finishes high school there, in North Carolina, with honors. But as soon as she graduated, she made a beeline back to Baltimore.PARKER: So she came home. She came back to Baltimore, and been hell on wheels ever since.TAVERNISE: So did you \u2014 so what happened then?DOUGLAS: I became a Baltimorean.TAVERNISE: What does that mean?DOUGLAS: I came and jumped straight into the drug game.[MUSIC]PARKER: She was running the street. She would leave for two or three days, a week.TAVERNISE: Back to her boyfriend, Donald; the streets; and the absolute peak of the crack epidemic.DOUGLAS: Come back, O.K. My same first boyfriend. At this point, now we\u2019re 17. He was still selling drugs.TAVERNISE: And Donald, by that point, the early 1990s, was a really important person. He was rich. He had a car.DOUGLAS: Everybody he hang with got cars. TAVERNISE: He bought other people cars. He bought Toby a car.DOUGLAS: I had a car. I couldn\u2019t drive it, but he bought me a car.TAVERNISE: And she fell into life with him.DOUGLAS: He was so jealous. You know, at that age, you think that mean they love you. It started off he was so jealous. I thought it was cute \u2014 that mean he loved me so much. TAVERNISE: It was a very isolating life for her. He cut off all of her friendships, didn\u2019t allow her to see people, would even sometimes lock her in the house.DOUGLAS: And then he made it to where he was my only friend, because I couldn\u2019t have no friends. So that didn\u2019t turn out good.PARKER: Sometimes we wouldn\u2019t hear from her for months. You know how they have missing persons?[OPENING THEME FROM WBAL-TV]PARKER: I used to look at the news just to see if I seen something happen to her, because she wouldn\u2019t call us. Because back then, you know, we ain\u2019t have cellphones, so we had to have the house phone. So I would just wait for the call. The call never came. It worried me terrible. But after that first year, I had to get my life together. I was like, I can\u2019t sit here worrying myself to death, and she\u2019s not trying to get in contact. I don\u2019t know where she\u2019s at, what she doing or anything. How\u2019s she surviving? How\u2019s she living?DOUGLAS: Guess what? I\u2019m not going to not know if my child is in an abusive relationship or not because I\u2019m not spending that much time away from my child. So if she didn\u2019t know, she should\u2019ve known. You don\u2019t get no passes from me. Because I was your child. You were supposed to protect me. And that\u2019s why we don\u2019t get along. I love her, I respect her, I\u2019ll do anything for my mother. But I was raising my child different.DOUGLAS: So it was like nothing to go down there and get unemployment, like, just do what you have to do. I met this guy.TAVERNISE: Back in North Carolina, she meets another guy.DOUGLAS: Abusive.TAVERNISE: He\u2019s also pretty abusive. And at this point, she\u2019s wise to this type of behavior, and gets out of it pretty quickly, gets in her car, and drives back to Baltimore. And when she gets back to Baltimore, she finds out she\u2019s pregnant.DOUGLAS: So I called down to that boy and told that boy in North Carolina. He begged me to come back. I wasn\u2019t down there a week before he was fighting on me again. I\u2019ve been getting beat up by boys all my living life for having boyfriends. I\u2019m not letting my child see no man be no man. Everything was about that child from the day I found out I was pregnant with him. I got in my car, and I came back to Baltimore, and ain\u2019t looked back.[MUSIC]PARKER: Let me think when they started arresting everybody. Well, I\u2019m gonna say \u2014 how about in the late \u201990s? The \u201990s was hell broke loose. You know? And I think that\u2019s when it started, in the \u201990s, to occur, which is present \u2014 which is now. [MUSIC]TAVERNISE: So Toby comes back to Baltimore, and, in May 1998, gives birth to Nook. [MUSIC][REPORTER: In a city with only one serious political party, it\u2019s hard to get voters excited for a two-party election. But in its way, this is a pretty dramatic moment. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019re getting a new mayor in 12 years.][CLIP FROM MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY CAMPAIGN AD: Frustrated by what\u2019s happening in our neighborhoods? So is Martin O\u2019Malley.]TAVERNISE: And that\u2019s because one candidate in particular has promised the one thing that so many people in Baltimore were really, really, really craving: getting tough on drugs, getting tough on crime, and cleaning stuff up.TAVERNISE: And that candidate was a City Council member named Martin O\u2019Malley.[MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY: My campaign for mayor has been about uniting the people of our city, uniting every neighborhood to bring about the changes we need to move forward \u2014 changes to make our public schools the safest and smartest places to learn, changes to make neighborhood safety and closing down open-air drug markets a top priority.]TAVERNISE: Despite the fact that he was white, black Baltimore really embraced him. [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: On Tuesday I\u2019m thinking about character and integrity. That\u2019s why I\u2019m supporting Martin O\u2019Malley.]TAVERNISE: They wanted someone to get tough on these things, because they were tired of having to live with them every day.[MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY: It won\u2019t happen overnight. But with your vote and confidence, we can put Baltimore back on top.]TAVERNISE: But then, it turned out really differently.[MUSIC][WILLIAM J. BRATTON: We are taking back streets that we effectively de-policed in the 1970s. We\u2019re re-policing them. We\u2019re putting police back into them. But the police aren\u2019t just there. They\u2019re doing something.]SGT. LOUIS HOPSON: Martin went to New York City, and what they saw was \u201czero tolerance\u201d in its infancy stage.TAVERNISE: So New York, at that time, was experimenting with this thing called zero tolerance policy \u2014 essentially, widespread arrests for small, kind of routine crimes.[BRATTON: We\u2019re using police to control behavior to such an extent that we are now changing it, so that people who thought they could get away with drinking in public, people who thought they could get away with urinating in public, people who thought they could ride the subways without paying their fare are learning that somebody is going to challenge that behavior. And that somebody is the police.]TAVERNISE: And at that point, it really looked like it was working.HOPSON: And it looked good, you know, \u2018cause all the numbers and this and that.TAVERNISE: So O\u2019Malley wants to try this in Baltimore, but there are cops like Lou Hopson who really disagree. [MUSIC]HOPSON: And we realized that, you know, this zero tolerance is going to be a disaster. All you\u2019re going to do is put black marks on people\u2019s records. You know, I appealed to Martin myself and said, Martin, listen, if you bring zero tolerance here, in four or five years from now, I said, it\u2019s going to be so unbelievable. You\u2019re going to have corrupt police officers right and left. You can\u2019t give this kind of authority to a police department and just say, look, you guys go do what you want \u2014 not without some type of, you know, checks and balances on everything. Well, they did.TAVERNISE: So Martin O\u2019Malley brings someone down from New York City to run the Baltimore Police Force.HOPSON: You see, they went crazy. They were arresting people who had mental health problems. They were arresting people who were drunk. They were arresting people who were just standing on corners or walking down the street.TAVERNISE: They were arresting people on their way to work, even kids just out playing. PARKER: My son got pulled over quite a few times, but he was walking. He don\u2019t drive. TAVERNISE: Davetta\u2019s son was picked up by the police many times, not for having done anything illegal, but just stopped, walking down the sidewalk.PARKER: Anyway, they would just drive up in their car and stop in front of them like this, and pull \u2019em \u2014 tell them sit down, get on the floor, get on the ground, and they would \u2014 you know, or pull them over in their cars and stuff. That was around \u2019bout that time, yeah.TAVERNISE: Do you remember that happening to your son for the first time and being surprised?PARKER: When it first happened to him, yeah, I was surprised. But after my son told me it happened to him, like, three or four times \u2014 and they didn\u2019t find nothing on him, so they let him go. But the point was, couldn\u2019t no black young man walk down the street without being pulled over. TYRONE POWERS: The philosophy was arrest. Arrest, arrest, arrest. And people were saying, this is not focused, laserlike, to reduce crime. This is rounding up everybody.HOPSON: The cells were full. There is a wall outside of central booking, and at any given time during zero tolerance, there would be at least 200 people in line. Easily. The jails would be so full that you could get arrested, and they wouldn\u2019t know you were arrested \u2014 your family or friends, anybody, wouldn\u2019t know you were arrested for, like, a week or two weeks. Because they haven\u2019t even processed you.TAVERNISE: Arrests doubled from 1996 to 2003, and that effect was very, very apparent in the neighborhoods. Many young men were being rounded up. And this is the point at which police departments really all over the country, but also in Baltimore, became completely obsessed by statistics.POWERS: So the policies that were implemented \u2014 they were following the policies, and not so much connected to the people.TAVERNISE: Tyrone Powers was an F.B.I. agent. He grew up in Baltimore, and he\u2019s advised the Baltimore Police. POWERS: The policies is what kept them in their positions. It\u2019s what got them promoted, or it got them chastised if they were not making enough arrests. I mean, because you got promoted based on your stats. You were \u2014\u2014TAVERNISE: You got promoted based on your stats?POWERS: Right. They looked at your stats and your arrests, and if commanders didn\u2019t have enough arrests in their districts, then they could actually \u2014 many of them was actually removed from their command positions right at Comstat meetings.TAVERNISE: Oh my God. But that sets up this weird conflict of interest, no?POWERS: No, absolutely, in their districts. And so that\u2019s what they focused on. They focused on \u2014 no matter the consequences and repercussions it was having with police-community relations \u2014 they focused on the fact that this was the edict of the administration, and the administration said that if you want to keep your position, then you have to follow this. So that\u2019s all they would focus on. So there was a disjunct from the top down from the police in the community.POWERS: And the majority of the people, obviously, that were arrested were African-Americans, so now people are saying that this whole experiment has gone tremendously bad, because now everybody is the target.TAVERNISE: So this is a big change from earlier years. So for Davetta, you know, she remembers having conversations with police officers. She remembers them kind of being around in the neighborhood. She remembers them kind of walking around on foot. And you know, she doesn\u2019t have particularly strong memories of them one way or another, just kind of that they were this sort of, you know, not perfect but capable and basically trustworthy force. And if you called them because something bad was happening to you, like your house was getting broken into, you basically trusted that they would probably show up and probably try to help. You didn\u2019t have the sense that they were going to come after you if you hadn\u2019t done anything at all.PARKER: Policeman didn\u2019t harass people back then. They helped them. TAVERNISE: But weren\u2019t they more racist back then?PARKER: They was, but they wasn\u2019t as bad. I mean, they never plant drugs on us. They would lock us up. They would give us a hard time.TAVERNISE: So maybe it was like they were more racist, but they were also more fair, somehow?PARKER: Right, something like that, where the policemen of today \u2014 they breaking into your house without a warrant.DOUGLAS: I didn\u2019t know to hate police like I do now. I mean, like the kids do today. I didn\u2019t know you were supposed to hate the police. I hate the police. My son is 7 years old. Why are you pulling up on him asking him anything but where is his mother?TAVERNISE: And Toby was also seeing this happening. DOUGLAS: Listen, I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m not rich, and, you know, I have to live down here on Gorman Avenue, this one-way street. So now my son is seven years old out here on Gorman Avenue, playing basketball with all the rest of these kids. But you all keep hopping out of these cars with these guns. Leave these kids alone. Why are y\u2019all \u2014 y\u2019all are practicing on them.[SOUND OF SCREAMING FROM KEVIN MOORE\u2019S CELLPHONE VIDEO OF FREDDIE GRAY\u2019S ARREST]POWERS: And if you look at the whole Freddie Gray case, he ran from the police, and the police chased him and arrest him. No major crime, no major issue. The number of officers involved in that \u2014 I don\u2019t think people ever looked and dissected that, the number of people. It was kind of like they were responding to the robbery of a 7-Eleven or a convenience store. But they were responding to a guy who ran because he saw the police.[SOUND OF SIRENS AND YELLING][MUSIC]HOPSON: It was like the community was saying, I\u2019ve had enough. We\u2019ve had enough. And when you\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve had enough, that\u2019s it. You\u2019re not going to take it anymore. This wasn\u2019t the first time that something like Freddie Gray happened, you know what I mean? Everybody could understand, because they\u2019d seen it over and over. They\u2019d seen it in their families being beat up all the time. You know, you can only beat on somebody so much. You can only push somebody so far. So when those kids had enough \u2014 and remember, they cut the bus services. You left those kids with no way to get home but to walk. That means you had to walk clear across town. You had to try to find a ride. You had to see if your mother and father could get off early. And then they try to force those kids off that area. So kids do what kids do. You know, when you threaten them, they\u2019ll threaten you back. Kids picked up rocks, and started rocking them, you know?TAVERNISE: So when the protests first broke out in the spring of 2015, Nook was there with his friends. But they weren\u2019t just protesting, shouting at the police. They were also looting. A couple of his friends told us they were in a sports store looking at jerseys, taking some.

{"Headline": "Willie Lee Rose, Historian of Reconstruction, Dies at 91", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWillie Lee Rose, a historian who upended the scholarly consensus of her time by shifting the primary blame for the failure of Reconstruction after the Civil War from freed slaves and Northern interlopers to irresolute federal officials, died on June 20 in Baltimore. She was 91.Her death was confirmed by her niece and closest survivor, Vickie Sherertz.In 1970, she concluded in a report commissioned by the American Historical Association that colleges and universities should hire more women as faculty members, arguing that this would coincide with \u201cthe permanent interest of the historical profession.\u201dDr. Rose\u2019s greatest legacy was her recasting of the prevailing view of Reconstruction, when federal troops occupied the defeated South and a slave-owning society was grudgingly adapting to emancipation.\u201cShe looked at the ground level at how the end of slavery unleashed a tremendous set of conflicts over what should follow,\u201d the Columbia University historian Eric Foner, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cThe Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery,\u201d said by email.He added, \u201cHer book \u2018Rehearsal for Reconstruction\u2019 depicted Northern teachers, the Army, Treasury Department agents, Northern cotton planters and the former slaves themselves, battling over access to land, control of labor, access to education and political power.\u201d\u201cThat betrayal,\u201d he continued, \u201cis commonly acknowledged, or confessed, in general terms; it is one of the many merits of Willie Lee Rose\u2019s narrative that it provides us with a case study set forth with careful detail. It is an added merit that she does not pronounce easy moral judgments but is content to explain how the betrayal came about.\u201dIn that book, Dr. Rose explored the experience of 10,000 blacks in Port Royal, S.C., who were freed early in the Civil War when a Union flotilla captured the city in 1861 and plantation owners fled. She argued that even before the war ended \u2014 before it started, in fact \u2014 black people had already been shaping what the nation would look like after slavery.This experiment in emancipation had mixed results \u2014 an influx of altruistic volunteers known as Gideon\u2019s Band, the establishment of schools for the freed slaves, their conscription by the Union Army, and an economy that was self-sustaining but also undermined by capricious government decisions about distributing land \u2014 all of which foreshadowed the conflicts that would doom Reconstruction after the war.\u201cRehearsal for Reconstruction,\u201d Professor Commager wrote, \u201crevealed not a deliberate decision to repudiate the Negro but the absence of any sense of obligation and any imagination where the Negro was concerned.\u201dDr. Rose focused on what she described as \u201cthe folly of the federal government\u2019s granting voting rights without providing for national assistance to education, thrusting upon the impoverished South the responsibility for a public school system that it had not possessed in its flourishing days.\u201d\u201cThe North had plainly concluded that in granting the franchise, the national obligation to the freedmen had been fulfilled,\u201d she concluded. \u201cThe North was not so much indifferent as tired, and the nation seized simple excuses that left the Northern conscience easier.\u201d\u201cRehearsal for Reconstruction\u201d won two prestigious awards from the Society of American Historians: the Allan Nevins Prize for best dissertation and the Francis Parkman Prize for the best work of American history.Dr. Rose was born Willie Lee Nichols on May 18, 1927, in Bedford, Va., to Grady and Willie (Chafin) Nichols. Her father owned a farm supply store.She graduated in 1947 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history from Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Va. (then a women\u2019s affiliate of the University of Virginia and now the University of Mary Washington). In 1949 she married William G. Rose. He died in 1985.She taught high school English and history in Maryland before earning a doctorate in history at Johns Hopkins in 1962. In 1965 she was hired as a history professor at the University of Virginia, where she worked until 1973, when she returned to Johns Hopkins as a professor.Her advocacy for women in academia was notably expressed in 1970, when she was chairwoman of an American Historical Association commission that cited in a report \u201cthe necessity of vigorous steps to remove existing disabilities and to establish a genuine parity for women historians.\u201dIn 1991, the association presented her with its Troyer Steele Anderson Prize, awarded every 10 years to the person judged to have \u201cmade the most outstanding contribution to the advancement of the purposes of the association.\u201dIn 1977, succeeding Professor Commager and Professor Woodward among others, Dr. Rose became the first woman to be appointed the Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth visiting professor of American history at Oxford University.She published a collection of letters, diaries and other ephemera in 1976 titled \u201cDocumentary History of Slavery in North America.\u201dTwo years later, after her stroke, Dr. Rose gave up teaching but continued to edit a collection of her essays, \u201cSlavery and Freedom,\u201d published in 1982.Professor Durden was particularly admiring of her pithiness.\u201cIn one sentence,\u201d he wrote, Dr. Rose \u201cuntangles some of the most puzzling problems about the antebellum South and its peculiar institution: \u2018Still another characteristic of a domesticated regime was that plantations less harmful to the body (of the slave) could be more afflicting to the soul.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Shakes Up World Stage in Break With U.S. Allies", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rarely has President Trump\u2019s role as a disrupter on the world stage been starker. At a moment of tumult over trade and nuclear security, he is shaking up the international order to make friends with America\u2019s enemies and enemies out of America\u2019s friends.A businessman and entertainer with no diplomatic experience, Mr. Trump arrived at the White House nearly 17 months ago convinced that the economic and geopolitical alignments that have governed the world for seven decades were out of whack and biased against the United States.But after a year of being restrained to some extent by advisers who championed that global order, Mr. Trump has replaced much of his national security team with more like-minded aides and is finally acting on his \u201cAmerica First\u201d impulses in ways that are sending shock waves across Europe, Asia and North America.\u201cThere\u2019s no question it\u2019s a big moment,\u201d said Julianne Smith, once a national security aide to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cAll the fundamentals are being called into question. We\u2019re at a point where we have a U.S. president who doesn\u2019t value the rules-based international order, and I\u2019m not convinced he even knows what it is.\u201dWary leaders of European and Asian allies have spent much of the past year trying to assuage him through flattery, concessions and friendly persuasion, only to find their efforts collapse in recent weeks in a storm of tariffs and a broken nuclear agreement with Iran. Even the leader of the engagement strategy, President Emmanuel Macron of France, seems to have given up, publicly expressing deep frustration with Mr. Trump and warning that the United States will isolate itself.With no country has Mr. Trump\u2019s attitude been more opposite from the rest of American foreign policymakers than Russia. Speaking with reporters on Friday before leaving the White House for the Group of 7 meeting in Canada, the president proposed readmitting Russia. \u201cThey should let Russia come back in because we should have Russia at the negotiating table,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump offered no specific reasoning for why Russia should be let back in even though it retains control of Crimea and has not lived up to an international agreement to end its intervention in eastern Ukraine.Indeed, Mrs. May, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other leaders of the Group of 7 quickly rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion, although he won support from Italy, which has traditionally had a closer relationship with Mr. Putin.In Washington, lawmakers of both parties were either aghast or chose to ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion on the assumption that it was yet another offhand remark just to stir the pot, not a serious initiative.But some experts said that the critics were overreacting and that the Europeans should stop \u201cacting petulant,\u201d as James Jay Carafano, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, put it. \u201cFor all the sturm and drang, nothing has changed in the fundamentals of the trans-Atlantic community,\u201d he said. \u201cNATO is a necessity, not a nice to have. The trading and economic partnership between the U.S., Canada and Europe is reality that doesn\u2019t change with presidents.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s advocacy for Russian membership in the Group of 7 was in keeping with his against-the-grain attitude toward Moscow. He has repeatedly spoken in flattering terms about Mr. Putin and pushed for closer ties.During a telephone call after Mr. Putin\u2019s re-election, widely deemed a sham by the rest of the world, Mr. Trump congratulated him on his victory even though his staff had written \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d on a briefing document. He also suggested Mr. Putin visit him at the White House, to the chagrin of policymakers who have been trying to isolate Russia.At the same time, in recent months, Mr. Trump has allowed other members of his administration to voice sharp criticism of Russia. He authorized sanctions in response to cyberattacks and its intervention in the 2016 presidential election, although only after Congress forced his hand by voting nearly unanimously to pass new penalties on Moscow over his objections.In speaking with reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump insisted that he has been tough on Moscow, even more than Hillary Clinton would have been had she won the 2016 election. \u201cI have been Russia\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Hillary got in \u2014 I think Putin is probably going, man, I wish Hillary won.\u201dEven the Russians, however, did not think Mr. Trump\u2019s latest suggestion was serious.\u201cThe president\u2019s nature is so mercurial that it would be wrong for Russia to become an instrument in Trump\u2019s unpredictable statements,\u201d said Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research institution.\u201cThe G-8 belongs to a certain era, and that era is over,\u201d he added. \u201cThat project has failed. The integration of Russia into the Western system is over.\u201dAndrew Higgins contributed reporting from Moscow, and Emily Baumgaertner from Washington.Advertisement"}

The state has brought in 112,000 refugees in the last 15 years: 1,454 Syrian refugees. No other state has taken more Syrian refugees, Mr. Trump. It\u2019s a point of pride.\u201cThere was a guy running for re-election as governor by the name of Pete Wilson. Not too many years ago \u2014 1994. He was out there promoting Prop. 187: Xenophobia, nativism was front and center in our political debate. He was not only promoting his own candidacy for governor, he was on his way to announce his bid to be president of the United States. Pete Wilson wins his re-election walking way. Prop. 187 wins, overwhelmingly.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)As a travel destination, Sacramento gets no respect.But the state\u2019s oldest incorporated city \u2014 founded in 1849, the year before California joined the union \u2014 remains a lush oasis of bougainvillea and palms, prolific fruit trees and mighty oaks.It also has a thriving cultural scene and architectural character all its own, including neighborhoods of midcentury modern homes, Craftsman Bungalows and ornate Victorians.Unlike California\u2019s glittering, glamorous coastal cities, Sacramento, located in the Central Valley, has an earnest, small-town affect and a welcome lack of pretension.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Saudi Women Can Drive Now. Will That Hurt Saudi Women?", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Aldosari researches Saudi gender dynamics at Harvard.Concessions on women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia often appear during times of turmoil or transition.In the aftermath of the Arab Spring, when there were whispers about whether the wave of revolutions could reach Saudi Arabia, the king at the time, Abdullah, made some women full members to the Royal Advisory Council. He issued a decree declaring that women could now be employed in retail jobs, and he permitted them to participate in municipal elections and the Olympics.Prince Mohammed, in other words, has pursued a set of reforms aimed at making Saudi women good workers and consumers of recreation, while leaving the essential power structures that keep them second-class citizens untouched. By doing so, he\u2019s effectively furthered the development of two classes of women in Saudi society: one whose supportive guardians will enable them to put these reforms to use, and another, whose lives will still be shaped and determined by their conservative families.Small but visible concessions on women\u2019s rights come with political benefits too: They demonstrate that Saudi shares the values of would-be foreign investors, and send a message that this is a regime worth siding with against Islamists, including the Iranians.But little has changed when it comes to the legal and social strictures on women in Saudi society. And under Prince Mohammed, little seems likely to.In Saudi Arabia, the second-class status of women underlies the legitimacy of the monarchy as a custodian of religious and tribal values. The Saudi model of citizenship, in which men control women\u2019s movements and choices through the male-guardianship system, is one in which men are the primary political constituency, and women are citizens only by proxy.There have always been exceptions, of course. A minority of women from powerful political and business families have indeed benefited from the changes that have taken place in Saudi Arabia over the years. These women were the first to participate in chambers of commerce in Riyadh, Dammam and Jidda; they also put a good face on the kingdom by representing it on delegations and at conferences abroad. They\u2019ll likely enjoy a soccer game or two, and will probably drive come this summer \u2014 though if they happen to be detained for certain traffic violations, they can be released only into the care of a male guardian.Two years ago, Ms. Juaid recounted in a video she posted online last fall, she was forced to sign a marriage contract by her abusive father. She ran away from home and enlisted the help of activists to find a job and safe accommodation in another city. She managed to stay underground for months until she had to renew her national identification card. When she did so, the authorities arrested her for being absent from her father\u2019s home without his consent. Running away, even for adult women, is a crime for women in Saudi Arabia, punishable by imprisonment and flogging, with the woman then returned to the guardian from whom she fled.The crown prince\u2019s piecemeal approach to gender reforms can serve the interest of only a select group of women. It may even widen economic disparities by giving women from supportive families who are typically already members of the elite more opportunities than others from restrictive families. Worst of all will be if these small-scale reforms, and the silencing of feminists, slow the momentum for pushing the Saudi regime into making more meaningful change.Hala Aldosari is a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Good Is the Trump Economy, Really?", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt depends on whether you look at the level, the direction or the rate of change \u2014 three concepts that are often conflated.The Trump administration has become downright boastful about the state of the economy.But I also received some blowback from liberals. There were some similarly good months for job growth in the Obama administration, they noted. And my analysis was not nearly so effusive then.So which is it? Is the economy doing exceptionally well, or performing only about as well as it did in the late years of the Obama administration?The answer depends on precisely how you phrase the question, which in turn hinges on a crucial distinction that people often fail to make when talking about the economy. There\u2019s a big difference between the level of economic performance; the direction of change in the economy; and the pace of change.Think of the economy as a bathtub. The level of the water in the tub \u2014 how much economic activity there is \u2014 is one useful, interesting question. Whether the water level is rising or falling \u2014 is this an economic expansion or recession? \u2014 is a separate question. And how fast the water level is changing \u2014 what is the pace of growth? \u2014 is a third question.All might be useful information, but they capture different things. And too much of the debate over how the economy is doing conflates them.So how good is the Trump economy? It depends on which of these approaches you take.The economy looks strongest if you look only at the level of economic activity, not the rate of change. For example, per-person gross domestic product adjusted for inflation is at its highest level on record, as are other similar measures of output. That isn\u2019t very surprising. Over time, workers tend to become more productive thanks to improving technology and the nation\u2019s stock of machinery and other capital increases. So we expect G.D.P. to rise most of the time, and to fall only during the occasional recession. By this measure, 60 percent of the time since modern G.D.P. statistics began in 1947, a president could accurately claim that the economy is the best it has ever been. Other measures of the level of economic performance are also quite good, though not historically so. The 3.8 percent unemployment level is the lowest in 18 years, but it was lower in 1969. The lowest on record was 2.5 percent in 1953.And the very low jobless rate masks some weakness in the labor market. Among adults in their prime working years, 79.2 percent were working in May, which is still below that statistic\u2019s 80.3 percent recent high in early 2007 and its record high of 81.9 percent in 2000.Still, if you look only at the level at which the economy is performing, the Trump administration does have plenty to be excited about.Similarly, the direction of the economy looks to be positive by almost every measure. Employers are adding jobs; output is rising, as are incomes. Another term for a shrinking economy would be an economy in recession, and there is no reason to believe that a recession is currently underway.Then there\u2019s the growth rate. This is the measure by which the Trump economy looks very much like a simple, straightforward continuation of President Obama\u2019s second term. In 2016, for example, Mr. Obama\u2019s last year in office, employers added an average of 195,000 jobs a month. In the first 17 months of the Trump administration, the average has been 190,000.It shows up in G.D.P. numbers, too. What may look like a nice smooth line of steady improvement in per-capita G.D.P. growth in the chart above looks a lot more herky-jerky when you look at the same data in terms of percent change over the previous year.And looking at the growth rate instead of the level shows that the 2.09 percent improvement in the first year of the Trump administration is below a couple of the peaks of the Obama second term, including a 3 percent reading in the year ending in the first quarter of 2015.In talking about the economy, the level, direction and rate of change all matter. They just matter in different ways.The late 1990s, for example, featured both strong levels of economic activity and fast growth. In the aftermath of a steep recession in 1982, there was a different combination: a weak level of economic activity paired with fast growth. The 2010-2011 time frame featured weak economic activity paired with slow growth, a nasty combination.The reason my analysis was more effusive about the recent economic results than it was about similar growth numbers during the Obama administration is that strong growth numbers are more impressive \u2014 and unexpected \u2014 at a time when the level of economic activity is already high. When the jobless rate was, say, 7 percent, we needed strong job growth just to put the unemployed back to work. To get similar job growth rates with an unemployment rate below 4 percent is reason for a little more giddiness.So what is the most honest way of talking about the Trump economy? It goes like this: The president inherited an economy that had come a long way toward healing. During his administration, the economy has continued growing at about the same rate it did before he took office, pushing incomes, employment and output to yet higher levels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Pity the Tech B-List", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsI spent most of the week at the Code Conference, where the tech world\u2019s elite gathered to discuss the current state of the tech industry. It was a fascinating event, less in the sense of newsy product announcements (which there weren\u2019t many of) and more in the general finger-in-the-wind sense of how the tech industry is thinking about itself.Notable at this year\u2019s Code was that there seems to be a growing rift between the largest tech companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 and the rest of the industry.The shadow of the big tech companies loomed large over the conference, even if their presence was minimal. No executives from Apple, Amazon or Google spoke at Code, and when executives from Microsoft and Facebook did take the stage, they mostly talked about the past. (Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, offered some historical perspective on the company\u2019s antitrust woes from the late 1990s; Sheryl Sandberg and Mike Schroepfer from Facebook did yet another rote recitation of the company\u2019s post-Cambridge Analytica \u201cwe\u2019ll do better\u201d script.)Instead, much of the stage time went to leaders of companies just outside the tech A-list \u2014 large, popular companies that in any other era would be considered enormous success stories, but that have spent years locked in a fight for survival against their bigger, more entrenched rivals.From the perspective of the tech B-list, there are two huge fights to be won. First, you need to establish a foothold in a market, either by out-innovating old-line incumbents \u2014 taxis, hotels, music labels \u2014 or by creating a new market altogether. Then, once you\u2019re established and growing, a bigger worry emerges: What if one of the Big Five squashes you?A good example of a tech B-lister is Spotify, which appears to be winning its battle with its biggest suppliers \u2014 the three labels that provide the vast majority of Spotify\u2019s music \u2014 but lives in perpetual danger of being steamrollered by a tech giant. Onstage at Code, Spotify\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Ek, fielded several questions about whether he worried about competitors like Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which have their own music streaming services and, more important, control the hardware platforms (iOS, Android, Alexa) on which people consume music.Mr. Ek mostly deflected, saying that there are \u201cvery, very few opportunities that a billion-plus people around the world care about,\u201d and that the giants\u2019 interest in music streaming showed the attractiveness of the category.Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, sounded a similar note at the conference when asked about Facebook\u2019s habit of blatantly copying Snapchat\u2019s most distinctive product features. (Mr. Spiegel\u2019s sassy comeback \u2014 \u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also\u201d \u2014 was the best line there.)\u201cWell, I believe if you don\u2019t create a pure, vertical, integrated capability, vertically integrated capability \u2014 from distribution all the way through content creation and advertising models \u2014 you\u2019re going to have a hard time competing with these guys. And the statistic we throw out, and since we announced this deal in November of 2016, the FANG market caps have gone up over $1 trillion. You better figure out how to vertically integrate here if you want to compete with those players.\u201dIt\u2019s not unusual to see small firms complaining about the difficulty of breaking into established markets. It\u2019s more unusual to see those complaints coming from the leader of a $200 billion telecom giant. And it shows just how dominant the tech A-list has become, and how difficult overcoming its concentration of market power is proving to be.Here are a few other tech stories of note this past week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Fret About a Trade War, but They Aren\u2019t Fleeing the Stock Market", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a conference held by a top investment bank in Manhattan last week, attendees were asked to submit what they thought was the biggest risk to the global economy. When their concerns showed up on the conference screen, these words were the most popular: Trump, trade war and protectionism.Outside, meanwhile, the stock market was having another up day.In recent weeks, against the expectations of many on Wall Street, investors have not run for the exits as President Trump has stepped up trade brawls with China, Canada and the European Union. On Friday, when the Trump administration and China announced tit-for-tat tariffs on $50 billion of goods from each country, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index finished barely lower. The index has gained 2 percent since the end of February, when Mr. Trump began to take action on trade in earnest, and it remains up 30 percent since his election in November 2016.Why have the markets held up when the prospect of a trade war unnerves many on Wall Street? The United States economy appears to be a picture of health and corporate earnings are surging. That seems to have investors betting that the collateral damage will be manageable.The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta predicted that the United States economy could grow at 4.8 percent rate in the second quarter, which would be the second-highest quarterly growth rate in the past decade. Unemployment is at multiyear lows, retail sales are strong, consumer confidence is high and the inflation rate remains relatively subdued. This strong run could continue if tax cuts for businesses and consumers prompt higher spending.And, most important to investors, companies\u2019 earnings are set to rise at their fastest pace since the years immediately following the financial crisis. Wall Street analysts expect the profits of companies in the S.&P. 500 to surge 26 percent this year, after a 17 percent rise last year.Rising profits might explain why investors are putting more money in the United States stock market while getting out of other countries. In the past six weeks, a net $29 billion has poured into funds that invest in United States stocks, while $13 billion flowed out of those focused on European stocks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. At the start of this year, analysts expected solid growth around the world, but now Europe\u2019s economy is showing signs of weakness, and turbulence has returned to the markets of some developing countries.But there are few signs in the United States that anxiety about trade is causing a significant pullback in business spending. \u201cWe really don\u2019t see it in the numbers,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s just not there.\u201dEconomists are not forecasting big hits to the United States economy from the trade policies either in effect or imminent. Goldman Sachs\u2019s economists predicted that the $50 billion of tariffs against China would shave no more than two-tenths of a percentage point off gross domestic product after two years.Of course, the trade battles could escalate instead. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose an additional $100 billion of tariffs on China, which would most likely retaliate with its own tariffs. That would do more economic damage and cause some nervy days in the stock market, but not necessarily calamity, said Brad W. Setser, a fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. Countries, he said, have ways to soften the blow. \u201cYou would start to see some real disruption and higher short-term costs but not the sort of costs that would trigger a recession\u201d in either the United States or China, he said.Still, there are signs of fear lurking in the stock market.The S.&P. 500 remains below its peak hit in January, and some analysts say the trade tensions may be holding it back. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the overall market made a new high considering all the fiscal stimulus?\u201d David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, said. Stocks of technology companies and smaller companies have done particularly well in recent weeks, indicating that investors right now are drawn to companies that are less vulnerable to trade wars, Mr. Rosenberg added.Also, it is too early to conclude that the United States can mostly shrug off trade battles. Many American businesses have operations abroad or get a large share of their revenue from foreign markets. The retaliation by other countries has barely begun.Tariffs push up the costs for businesses, which in turns crimps their profits. If companies start to warn that profits will come in below expectations because of trade, the stock markets in the United States could decline sharply.The United States economy could start to disappoint. Interest rates are rising, in part, because the United States federal government is borrowing large sums to cover the fiscal shortfall that resulted from the recent tax cuts. Higher interest rates can quickly crimp growth. This may happen as the economies in Europe are wobbling and those of several large developing countries are showing signs of stress. \u201cThere is reason to suspect that we slow the pace of growth in the second half,\u201d said James W. Paulsen, a stock market strategist at the Leuthold Group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are So Many Political Parties Blowing Up? (Part 1)", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistIf you haven\u2019t already noticed, let me be the first on your block to point it out: The big mainstream political parties across the industrialized world are all blowing up at once. It\u2019s quite extraordinary.The U.S. Republican Party has blown up in all but name, going overnight from an internationalist, free-trade, deficit-hawk party to a protectionist, anti-immigrant, deficit-dove party \u2014 all to accommodate the instincts of Donald Trump and his base.As the former House Speaker John Boehner noted: \u201cThere is no Republican Party. There\u2019s a Trump party. The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s dead, but it\u2019s not alone in the cemetery.Italy\u2019s last election ended with its mainstream center-left getting crushed, bringing to power instead a coalition of far-left, far-right populists, whose focus ranges from guaranteeing minimum income for Italy\u2019s 11 percent unemployed to rebuffing immigrants and the European Union.Britain\u2019s Labour Party has gone from center-left to quasi-Marxist. And the Brexit-loving Tories, having pushed Britain to exit the E.U. without any plan, are now divided and paralyzed over how to implement the economic suicide they\u2019ve promised voters.The U.S. Democrats are fractured between a Bernie Sanders quasi-socialist wing and a center-left wing, but are glued together for now \u2014 thank goodness \u2014 by the overriding need to defeat Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel took four months to form a barely coherent governing coalition, after her ruling party got hammered in the last election \u2014 and that fragile coalition may soon implode over immigration tensions. And French President Emmanuel Macron leads a centrist party that did not exist three years ago.Lastly, we\u2019re going through a change in the climate of technology. Machines are acquiring most of the unique attributes of humans \u2014 particularly the ability to learn, analyze, reason, maneuver and drive on their own.These climate changes are reshaping the ecosystem of work \u2014 wiping out huge numbers of middle-skilled jobs \u2014 and this is reshaping the ecosystem of learning, making lifelong learning the new baseline for advancement.These three climate changes are also reshaping geopolitics. They are like a hurricane that is blowing apart weak nations that were O.K. in the Cold War \u2014 when superpowers would shower them with foreign aid and arms, when China could not compete with them for low-skilled work and when climate change, deforestation and population explosions had not wiped out vast amounts of their small-scale agriculture.Today, though, without those props, the most fragile nations are fracturing, like El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras south of us and in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East south of Europe. There is not enough order, sustainable land or industry to hold people on their farms or big cities. And this is creating the most relevant geopolitical divide in the world today: the divide between the World of Order and the World of Disorder. In Europe the boundary is the Mediterranean, and in the Americas it\u2019s the Rio Grande.And the number of people \u2014 now armed with cellphone pictures and directions from human traffickers \u2014 trying to get out of the World of Disorder into the World of Order is at all-time highs, producing nationalist/populist backlashes in America and Europe.This is all new and accelerating. But the big Western parties that dominated politics since World War II tended to be built around a set of rather stable left-right binary choices: the interests of capital versus labor; big government, high regulation versus small government, low regulation; a more closed national outlook hostile to free trade and immigration versus a more open internationalist outlook open to free trade and immigration; social norms to be embraced and social norms to be banned, like gay marriage and abortion; and economic growth versus environmental protection.Ruling and opposition parties tended to be combinations of these big binary choices. But nowadays they just can\u2019t contain and balance many of the new choices that parties, citizens, companies and communities have to make to thrive amid all these climate changes.If I work at a steel mill and am a member of the steel union Monday through Friday \u2014 but on Saturday I drive for Uber and on Sunday I rent out my spare bedroom on Airbnb \u2014 are my interests with capital or labor, with more government regulation or less?If I am a regional electric utility led by Republicans for decades \u2014 but am now investing in wind and solar because they\u2019ve become cheaper than new coal and my customers are demanding climate-protecting clean energy \u2014 am I for Trump\u2019s tariffs on the cheap Chinese solar panels and his efforts to force me to keep using coal?These old knee-jerk positions won\u2019t work anymore. We can\u2019t just wall ourselves off, and we can\u2019t just take in all the tired and poor who now want to come. Just as we had a Marshall Plan to stem the spread of Communism in Europe after World War II, we now need something similar to stem the spread of disorder coming from the south and help people stay at home. It will require wholly new ways of thinking about geopolitics, and neither of our traditional parties is doing that.One can see three different broad approaches playing out in response to these very new, complex political choices. One is leaders who want to build walls, against change and immigrants, who galvanize support by generating tribal solidarity.A second you can see in Macron or in Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign website. They offer a smorgasbord of technocratic-pragmatic solutions \u2014 many of which make a lot of sense but lack any emotional grip on voters.The third approach is the one that you can see emerging organically in certain towns and communities across America. It is highly pragmatic in its approach to problem-solving but fosters solidarity not by conjuring old party loyalties or a new tribalism. It generates its idealism and solidarity instead through the trust and bonds of friendship that come from doing big hard things together in the community.They are not waiting for Washington or their state governments, but are acting in their own local collective self-interest, nurturing adaptation from the bottom up.These efforts are the most hopeful things happening in America today.In next week\u2019s column I\u2019ll take you to one of the places the approach is working best: Lancaster, Pa.Advertisement"}

Americans\u2019 back. Justice Anthony Kennedy led a seven-member Supreme Court majority in a decision that superficially looks like a defeat for gay and lesbian people \u2014 but is, in reality, one more rung quietly added to the rising ladder of equality.For years, legal scholars and some of his fellow jurists have disparaged Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinions as muddled and vague. But the justice, to their frustration, has proved to be a brilliant politician, possessed of a seemingly infallible feel for how to nudge the court and public opinion in his direction.In the Masterpiece Cakeshop opinion on Monday, Justice Kennedy has shown his skill again, giving the religious side a tactical win while inconspicuously providing the gay side with a strategic victory.Religious-liberty advocates celebrated, and many on the L.G.B.T. side lamented. On balance, though, we believe it is the gay and lesbian side that has considerably more reason to be pleased.As commentators on both sides noted, the court\u2019s decision was very narrowly written. That in itself was a defeat for the baker and his supporters, because they had asked for a very broad ruling: that an expansively defined constitutional right to free speech trumps any nondiscrimination statute. Had the court plumped for such a maximalist theory, it would have imperiled anti-discrimination statutes \u2014 and many other statutes \u2014 across the land, while setting off a cascade of angels-on-pinheads litigation about how far free-speech protections extend into everyday commercial activities. (Is designing a bridal dress for a same-sex wedding protected speech? How about sewing one? Or dry-cleaning one?)Instead, the court found fault with the particular way in which the Colorado authorities had reached their conclusion. Yes, said the court, the civil rights commission violated the baker\u2019s rights \u2014 not by regulating the bakery, however, but by displaying animus and behaving inconsistently in applying the rules.Meanwhile, by ducking a broad, one-size-fits-all constitutional holding, the court effectively requires both sides, in Colorado and elsewhere, to go home and try to work out policy accommodations at the state and local levels.On the controversial, complex issue of gay rights and religious rights, almost any broad constitutional judgment the Supreme Court might reach would be greeted as either gutting anti-discrimination laws (and not just for gay people) or as gutting the First Amendment. Or, possibly, as gutting both.By ruling narrowly in Masterpiece Bakeshop, the Supreme Court declined an invitation to set off political dynamite. And by reaffirming its hostility to anti-gay discrimination (while also speaking emphatically against anti-religious animus), the court has shored up Justice Kennedy\u2019s legacy.Evan Gerstmann, a professor of political science at Loyola Marymount University, is the author of \u201cSame-Sex Marriage and the Constitution\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cCampus Sexual Assault: Constitutional Rights and Fundamental Fairness.\u201d Jonathan Rauch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But after President Trump\u2019s parting shots against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the day he left the Group of 7 summit meeting in Quebec, the country reacted with uncharacteristic outrage and defiance at a best friend\u2019s nastiness.\u201cIt was extremely undiplomatic and antagonistic,\u201d Frank McKenna, a former Canadian ambassador to the United States, wrote in an email. \u201cIt was disrespectful and ill informed.\u201d\u201cAll Canadians will support the prime minister in standing up to this bully,\u201d he added. \u201cFriends do not treat friends with such contempt.\u201dEven Mr. Trudeau\u2019s political foes rose to his defense.\u201cI can understand why President Trump, why the American people feel they need some better trade relationships,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cthis is the wrong target.\u201dAnd Peter Navarro, the president\u2019s top trade adviser, suggested on Fox News Sunday that \u201cthere\u2019s a special place in hell\u201d for Mr. Trudeau.Mr. Trump\u2019s ire appears to have been spurred after Mr. Trudeau said Canada would retaliate against United States tariffs on steel and aluminum products, calling them \u201ckind of insulting\u201d and saying that Canadians \u201care nice\u201d but \u201cwe will not be pushed around.\u201dThese were strong words from the telegenic, soft-spoken leader, who has spent the two-day summit trying to strike a precarious balance between being Canada\u2019s protector-in-chief but not inciting the mercurial American president. But Canadian officials said they were perplexed by Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction since nothing Mr. Trudeau said was new.From Singapore, where he is scheduled to meet with Kim Jong-un of North Korea for a historic summit, Mr. Trump again took to Twitter on Monday to assail Mr. Trudeau.\u201cFair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal. According to a Canada release, they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!),\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cMinimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out!\u201dMr. Trump is not exactly popular in Canada. And the Twitter tirade threatened to inflame already boiling resentment of the president, whose anti-immigrant stances and skepticism of climate change have infuriated many in a country that prides itself on its openness and social responsibility.Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, told reporters that Canadians should be insulted by Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum, imposed because, the president said, Canada poses a national security threat to the United States.\u201cThe national security pretext is absurd and frankly insulting to Canadians, the closest and strongest ally the United States has had,\u201d Ms. Freeland said.As to the biting comments made by Mr. Kudlow, she responded, \u201cCanada does not believe that ad hominem attacks are a particularly appropriate or useful way to conduct our relations with other countries.\u201dGet the Morning Briefing in your inbox. What you need to know to start your day, each weekday morning.She added, \u201cWe particularly refrain from ad hominem attacks when it comes to our allies.\u201dMs. Freeland said she planned to continue negotiating with the Americans over trade. \u201cWe are always prepared to talk,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the Canadian way: always ready to talk and always absolutely clear about standing up for Canada.\u201dBut for now, calling the American tariffs illegal and unjustified, she reiterated Canada\u2019s intention to impose retaliatory tariffs, starting July 1, \u201cwhich is Canada Day,\u201d she noted. \u201cPerhaps not inappropriate.\u201dFor Mr. Trudeau, the G-7 summit meeting has been an important test of his leadership, at home and on the global stage. On Sunday, he continued his schedule, meeting with world leaders and trying to rise above the Twitter insults from his neighbor.Canadian fury at Trump notwithstanding, analysts said it was difficult to overstate the damage that bad relations with him could cause to the Canadian economy. Canada relies on the United States as its only neighbor, its military ally and its largest trading partner.About 1.9 million Canadian jobs are tied directly to trade with the United States, which absorbs almost three-quarters of Canada\u2019s exports.Nevertheless, some analysts said Mr. Trump\u2019s attack could work to politically embolden Mr. Trudeau, a Liberal, whose popularity has been waning here after a series of missteps and the rise of populism, including Mr. Ford\u2019s recent election as the premier of Ontario.Mr. Trudeau has been philosophical about the limits of Canada\u2019s ability to placate Mr. Trump.\u201cIf the expectation was that a weekend in beautiful Charlevoix, surrounded by all sorts of lovely people, was going to transform the president\u2019s outlook on trade and the world,\u201d he said in his final news conference at the summit meeting before the tweet storm, \u201cthen we didn\u2019t quite perhaps meet that bar.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Ace in the Hole in Trade War: A Strong Economy", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy has picked up speed and is now on course to expand this year at the fastest rate in more than a decade. That acceleration gives President Trump a stronger hand as he contemplates more tariffs and takes an increasingly confrontational approach with China, Canada, Mexico and other trading partners.Economists have raised their growth estimates for the second quarter to an annualized rate of nearly 5 percent, more than double the pace of the previous period. Some economists say the figure could hit 3 percent for the full year, a level last reached in 2005.As growth slows in Europe, China, Japan and elsewhere, the United States finds itself at the top of the global economy. The United States is also less exposed to the fallout from an escalating trade war since it does not rely on exports as much as other countries. It all gives Mr. Trump leverage with world leaders, potentially forcing them to make concessions.But his threats could also backfire. Economists warn that the president\u2019s clout is limited and that his attacks on the trading system could dampen the outlook not just in other countries but also domestically.\u201cIf you have the strongest economy in years, then the trade shock appears manageable,\u201d said Gregory Daco, head of United States economics at Oxford Economics. \u201cHowever, with growth peaking, the trade shock will become more intense. With a global backdrop that is not improving anymore, we have to be careful about the back half of 2018 and 2019.\u201dIn July, the recovery will reach the nine-year mark, making it one of the longest in modern history. But for much of that time, the engines of the economy were rarely synchronized. When consumers were spending at a healthy clip in 2015 and 2016, business investment lagged as energy companies scaled back or abandoned projects in response to a sharp drop in oil prices.All that has changed in recent months. Now, the different parts of the economy appear to be operating as one well-oiled machine. Consumer spending rebounded after a soft start to the year, with retail sales in May rising by a robust 0.8 percent, double what analysts had forecast.\u201cWe have a very strong economy, and if the trade negotiations are successful, it\u2019ll be even stronger,\u201d said Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. He added that the president was \u201cimpatient to fix broken policies,\u201d with trade at the top of the list after last year\u2019s tax overhaul and deregulation effort.But the good news may not last. While Ms. Swonk expects a 3 percent expansion for the full year, she added, \u201cThis likely will be the peak growth for this cycle.\u201dContributing to that view is the rise in interest rates as the Federal Reserve gradually withdraws the easy credit that persisted for much of the recovery. \u201cThe headwinds are mounting,\u201d Ms. Swonk said.And then there are fears of an expanding trade war. Tariffs could hurt the American economy by stoking inflation without increasing wages.Trade wars won\u2019t sharply curtail economic activity, unless they cause businesses to lose confidence, said Spencer Dale, chief economist for BP, the energy giant. The bigger problem, he said, is that trade wars could \u201ceat away at trend growth\u201d by reducing G.D.P. by a fraction of a percent a year. That might not seem meaningful in any given year, but compounded over a decade or two, it could leave the economy noticeably short of what it might otherwise have achieved.The Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, has also noted those risks. \u201cChanges in trade policy could cause us to have to question the outlook,\u201d he said on Wednesday at a European Central Bank conference in Portugal.In the United States, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of G.D.P. And recent surveys and other data show that people are bullish about the economy\u2019s trajectory, according to Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. Owners of small businesses are also confident \u2014 about their own prospects and about the overall economy.When Mr. Shepherdson put out a note to clients on May 14 highlighting the possibility of 5 percent growth in the quarter, he was quick to add that his forecast looked outlandish. \u201cI was being tongue in cheek, looking at what would happen if everything goes right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s become more like the base case.\u201dDespite the improving consensus, Mr. Shepherdson said the quarter\u2019s pace \u201cis not sustainable,\u201d but he does expect consumer spending to be solid in the second half of the year.Sean McCartney, an executive vice president at Radial, a fulfillment and logistics business, agrees, and he\u2019s putting his money to work. Radial will hire about 24,000 temporary workers later this year for the company\u2019s fulfillment centers, call centers and warehouses to prepare for back-to-school demand and the holiday shopping season. That\u2019s up by roughly 1,000 from last year.\u201cThis year is shaping up to be strong, the strongest since the recovery began,\u201d Mr. McCartney said. E-commerce companies represent most of Radial\u2019s business, and the company has expanded its footprint to ensure faster deliveries.Many of its operations are in the middle of the country, in states like Ohio and Kentucky, with plentiful transportation links enabling them to reach both coasts.To attract new workers and keep existing ones, Radial has been offering spot raises of $1 an hour for temporary positions in some cities, on top of the typical $12-an-hour average for Radial\u2019s network of sites.\u201cWe have hundreds of open positions,\u201d Mr. McCartney said. \u201cWe definitely could hire more than we have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Shares of Starbucks have risen 21,000 percent since the company\u2019s initial public offering in 1992; an investor who had put in $10,000 then would have more than $2 million today.Microsoft\u2019s planned acquisition of GitHub, a software development company, is not close to the company\u2019s largest, and it will not have a big, immediate impact on profits.But the deal is a milestone because it reveals the degree to which the rise in Microsoft\u2019s stock has bolstered its heft as an acquirer.Microsoft\u2019s stock has gone up more than 200 percent since Microsoft agreed in 2013 to pay $7.2 billion in cash for Nokia\u2019s handset and services operations. That price tag amounted to 2.6 percent of Microsoft\u2019s total market value back then. The $7.5 billion Microsoft is paying for GitHub is just under 1 percent of Microsoft\u2019s current market capitalization. This lessens the financial hit if the acquisition falls short of expectations, but increases the upside if it outperforms.In recent years, Microsoft\u2019s valuation has also increased, making its stock even more potent as an acquisition currency. Microsoft\u2019s shares currently trade at around 24 times the earnings that analysts expect over the next 12 months, according to data from CapitalIQ. That\u2019s far higher than the 15 times it traded at in mid-2013.But it would be a mistake to conclude that Microsoft has not advanced in the market for acquisitions. Its soaring stock has made sure the company has remained a player in the deals game. The jump in its price-to-earnings ratio makes it more likely that a large deal would bolster earnings per share (after factoring in the extra shares issued to do the deal.) With its operations notching up strong organic growth, Microsoft probably does not need to do a big deal anytime soon. But if one were to crop up, shareholders may not balk.- Peter Eavis Satya Nadella happened, for one. (He succeeded Steve Ballmer as C.E.O. of Microsoft in 2014.) And the cloud, for another.Mr. Ballmer tried to target the flashier end of the consumer hardware market, with things like Windows Phone and the Zune music player. It didn\u2019t work. In contrast, Mr. Nadella has focused on enterprise applications \u2014 and in particular, found huge success in cloud computing.Since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, the cloud portion of Microsoft\u2019s revenue has soared from 3 percent to more than 21 percent this year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse. Microsoft finished 2017 with 13 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group, a gain of three percentage points during the year.The company lags only Amazon Web Services as a cloud provider.Preparing for the futureMr. Nadella is also gearing up for the next big thing to be put into the cloud: artificial intelligence.Because such software is computationally demanding, it makes sense to pay for someone else to run programs on huge servers rather than buying one\u2019s own hardware. But it\u2019s also complex, which means that there is going to be a huge market for user-friendly software that can be taken up by regular developers and not just people with A.I. Ph.D.s.That\u2019s why there\u2019s a big race right now \u2014 between the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others \u2014 to offer up tools in the cloud that can process huge data sets and provide useful insights about them.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeWhat Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O., said of the transaction:\u201cMicrosoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, a senior Microsoft executive, Nat Friedman, will become GitHub\u2019s C.E.O., while the coding hub\u2019s current chief, Chris Wanstrath, will become a Microsoft technical fellow. The acquisition is expected to close by year end.\u2022 GitHub: $7.5 billion\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore from Gabriel J.X. Dance, Nicholas Confessore and Michael LaForgia:Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing.Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, has been adamant that his company stringently protects its customers\u2019 data privacy. Two news stories raise some questions about that categorical claim.The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product. We\u2019ve elected not to do that.An Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Not too incriminating. But it\u2019s a reminder that Apple has made use of the data that passes across Facebook\u2019s platform.Over the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.Under the concept discussed internally and raised with potential partners, users searching in Pinterest\u2019s app for \u201cdrapes\u201d might turn up an ad distributed by Apple for an interior-design app, or Snap users searching for \u201cNFL\u201d might see an ad for a ticket-reseller app, one of the people said.None of this is to say that Apple doesn\u2019t act by its word. But it is an important reminder to continue asking whether it really does.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe latest installment in the movie franchise, \u201cSolo,\u201d had its second disappointing weekend, pulling in just $29.3 million in the U.S. (We use \u201cjust\u201d advisedly.) But perhaps more important, it raises questions about the future of what is supposed to be one of Walt Disney\u2019s biggest moneymakers.The trend hasn\u2019t been reassuring, though. Disney likely took about $1 billion from \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d after accounting for production and marketing costs. But \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d the next movie in the main series, showed a marked drop.

{"Headline": "FIFA Set to Make $6.1 Billion From World Cup", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 China\u2019s men\u2019s national team has played in just one World Cup, in which it finished 31st out of 32 teams. But the nation is playing an essential role in righting the financial ship of FIFA, the governing body for world soccer that has struggled to regain the trust of Western companies in recent years.According to FIFA financial documents reviewed by The New York Times, the 2018 World Cup that kicks off Thursday in Moscow is set to generate $6.1 billion in revenue \u2014 10 percent more than FIFA had estimated for the tournament and $1.3 billion more than the last World Cup produced in 2014 in Brazil.Revenue from television rights sales was 2 percent more than FIFA\u2019s $3 billion target, and FIFA\u2019s sponsorship deals generated $200 million more than the $1.45 billion it had projected, largely because of a slew of deals with Chinese companies. Seven of the 20 companies sponsoring the tournament are Chinese, up from just one at the last World Cup.FIFA also saw a 233 percent increase in annual royalties last year from EA Sports, the maker of the popular FIFA video game franchise. The company paid FIFA $160 million in 2017.China\u2019s renewed interest in soccer was spurred by President Xi Jinping\u2019s demand in 2015 that the country build a sports economy, with a particular focus on soccer. At the same time, Western companies were becoming increasingly hesitant of doing business with FIFA in the wake of a corruption investigation by the United States Justice Department. FIFA has not signed a new sponsor from a Western nation since 2011.FIFA plans to release the financial figures to its 211 members on Wednesday. The organization is reporting profits of just over $100 million for the four-year cycle ending after the tournament, with losses of $997 million during the preceding three years and an estimated profits of $1.1 billion this year.FIFA\u2019s losses in previous years are attributable to a new, more modernized accounting system, legal costs associated with the criminal corruption case in the United States and an expensive internal investigation that followed the indictments. FIFA has also significantly increased grants for member nations under President Gianni Infantino. In his two years in the position, Infantino has distributed $775 million; the administration of his predecessor, Sepp Blatter, spent $1.1 billion in the four years leading into the 2014 World Cup.FIFA expects to have $1.7 billion in cash and assets by the end of 2018.Speaking to the news media at FIFA\u2019s headquarters in Zurich before flying to Russia for his first World Cup as FIFA president, Infantino said the organization\u2019s finances had recovered enough to \u201cshow that FIFA is healthy.\u201d\u201cWhile people were predicting bankruptcies of FIFA or other very dark visions, I think the vision is very bright based on figures coming from different parts of the world, including Asia,\u201d he said.And Infantino promised before his election to the presidency to quadruple the amount that FIFA gives away to its members, meaning the overall increased revenue may not be enough for Infantino. That may explain why he is exploring a controversial $25 billion deal with a group of investors, including Japan\u2019s SoftBank, for two new tournaments. Infantino said last week that almost half of FIFA\u2019s entire membership relies on the organization\u2019s cash disbursements for the entirety of their budgets.FIFA has also demanded more documentation from the national soccer federations that receive the disbursements. That has led to delays in paying some associations, and a change in approach from FIFA. Now many associations are allowed money on the condition they provide detailed reports, documentation and bank statements that correspond with the payments made.\u201cCan we exclude that something strange is going to happen with some of the money that is paid out?\u201d Infantino said. \u201cNo, we cannot exclude it. But we do everything that we can to make sure that somebody thinks he can take money away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Economy Was Humming Nicely. Then Came Trump.", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGIOIA TAURO, Italy \u2014 From its headquarters in Calabria, the poorest, least-developed region in Italy, Gruppo Ventura looked out on the world and spotted a potentially lucrative growth opportunity \u2014 Iran.The family-owned company installs railroad tracks. The Italian economy was sluggish, while Iran was poised to develop rapidly, having promised to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions.Along the way, the Italian political system served up the sort of agita-inducing drama for which it is rightfully famous, sowing worries that all of Europe could be vulnerable to a fresh crisis.So much for Europe\u2019s improved fortunes. So much for Gruppo Ventura\u2019s international expansion.\u201cWe were expecting to expand in Iran, build rails,\u201d said Gruppo Ventura\u2019s chief financial officer, Alessandro Ventura. \u201cWe are not expecting to do these things anymore.\u201dAcross Europe \u2014 and especially within Italy \u2014 recent times have produced a series of bewildering, potentially expensive events that have conspired to replace a spirit of optimism with deepening concern.Only a few months ago, Europe was the leading example of the vigor the global economy was gaining after the trauma of a world downturn. Even Italy, Europe\u2019s traditional problem child, was growing.But Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to walk away from the Iran nuclear deal threatens to cost European companies billions of dollars in lost sales, with German, Italian and French players especially exposed. The reimposition of sanctions on Iran stands to limit the flow of its oil to world markets. This prospect has lifted fuel prices, applying pressure to European economies.Gruppo Ventura presents itself as relatively insulated against such shocks, given that the Italian government pays it to service rail tracks \u2014 the sort of activity that must continue. Still, company executives are concerned that the cost of rail tracks will climb along with the price of steel.\u201cEverything is a bit more complicated,\u201d said Gruppo Ventura\u2019s chairwoman, Maria Antonietta Ventura.This trifecta of troubles \u2014 higher oil prices, American steel tariffs and a crisis of confidence in the government \u2014 has turned Italy into a leading export of an unwanted commodity: worry.\u201cAll three of those are going to have quite a big impact on sentiment this year, and probably add to quite a big slowdown,\u201d said James Nixon, chief European economist at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very pretty combination.\u201dOn the afternoon when word broke that Mr. Trump would not exempt Europe from his metals tariffs, Claudio Capponi was struggling to calculate the impact.He is the commercial director of IRON, a publicly traded company that makes industrial parts. Its factory sits in Assisi, in the central Italian province of Umbria. Until the moment that the American president rendered his decision, Mr. Capponi was confident the Continent would be spared.\u201cEurope is too good of a trade partner for the United States for President Trump to do this,\u201d he said.Giant coils of steel shipped from mills in France were spread across the concrete floors of his factory. As the sound of pounding metal echoed through the cavernous plant, machines sliced steel into customized shapes \u2014 arms for earth movers destined for the United States, silos to hold wind turbines, decks of cargo ships.Given that IRON is a buyer of steel, the company might benefit from the American tariffs. Steel now shipped to the United States from mills within Europe might stay here to avoid the tariffs, raising the supply and lowering prices locally even as they increase in much of the world. Chinese producers that export to American shores could divert their product to Europe, amplifying this trend.But Mr. Capponi was banking on none of this. Even if he pays less for steel, his customers are likely to squeeze him for lower prices. More broadly, the American tariffs \u2014 justified by the Trump administration as a defense of national security \u2014 reverberated as a blow against world trade.\u201cWe depend on access to a global market,\u201d Mr. Capponi said. \u201cIt\u2019s the uncertainty that is driving us mad. We are looking out the window at what is going on outside of our factory. We\u2019re worried about the precedent of these tariffs. We are worried the forces of protectionism are being set loose. The landscape is so unclear.\u201dBefore the 1979 revolution in Iran, Italian companies were key players there, building a port at Bandar Abbas, on the Persian Gulf. After the revolution, and before the advent of international sanctions, Italian energy and construction companies were a significant presence.Last year, Italy exported more than 1.7 billion euros (nearly $2 billion) worth of goods to Iran, up from \u20ac1.2 billion in 2015, according to the European Union. Only Germany exported more, sending nearly \u20ac3 billion worth of goods to Iran.Invitalia, an Italian government agency that promotes trading opportunities, created a company focused on expanding investment in Iran. The new entity was authorized to provide loan guarantees to support Italian ventures in Iran.Invitalia was soon inundated with proposals from Italian companies. The agency was mulling which to back when the United States announced the resumption of Iran sanctions, asserting this would pressure Tehran to curb its support for terrorism and its development of advanced missiles. The Trump adminstration gave companies three to six months to wrap up activities there.\u201cThis project is on pause,\u201d said Domenico Arcuri, chief executive officer of Invitalia. \u201cWe are waiting for the situation between the United States, Europe and Iran to be clarified. In this condition, these projects will be suspended for a long time.\u201dAmerican sanctions not only bar domestic companies from doing business in Iran but also threaten foreign businesses with being frozen out of the American financial system. Given that the American dollar remains the dominant means of global exchange, that prospect has halted most transactions.Before Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, Giorgio Meniconi, owner of a small factory in Tuscany, was preparing plans to expand in Iran. His company, Tecon, makes a tool used to slice leather into shoes, jackets and bags.For years, counterfeit versions of his product have circulated in Iran, the handiwork of Chinese factories. He took the nuclear deal as impetus to register his company trademark in Iran and forge a relationship with a local distributor.But last month, the distributor called and canceled the deal. Since Mr. Trump opted to reinstate sanctions, Iran\u2019s currency has plunged against the euro, making Tecon\u2019s products too expensive.\u201cI had great hopes for Iran, because I saw it as a gateway to other markets in central Asia,\u201d Mr. Meniconi said. \u201cThe hopes we were building were shattered.\u201dIn the years before Gruppo Ventura secured its Iran venture, Mr. Ventura traveled there some 20 times. In March 2017, he signed a \u20ac2 million contract (about $2.3 million) to service a section of rail outside Tehran.He shipped two locomotives used to tamp down the rocks below railroad tracks. They went out on a freighter from Gioia Tauro, a port on the Tyrrhenian Sea that has long been notorious as a Mafia-run conduit for cocaine trafficking.In August, Mr. Ventura stood at the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas in 122-degree heat, watching a crane hoist the locomotives onto the docks.Now, those machines are effectively marooned, the business halted. Gruppo Ventura has lost its appetite for adventurous expansion.\u201cWe are wary of going into markets that America dislikes, because we never know what they will say,\u201d said Ms. Ventura, the chairwoman.Five company technicians dispatched to Iran to maintain the locomotives have returned here, to the company\u2019s warehouse.\u201cIt was a beautiful thing that our company would go,\u201d the head mechanic, Renato Tocci, said. \u201cOur hope was that our business would grow. Now, it\u2019s a time where everything is stalled.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He previously served as the chairman of a media conglomerate that is controlled by King Salman\u2019s branch of the family, but resigned to become minister.Ahmed bin Suleiman al-Rajhi, a private-sector businessman, was named minister of labor. The kingdom\u2019s economy has been shaken by the decline in oil prices, which has undermined the state budget. That could make it harder for the hundreds of thousands of young Saudis entering the job market every year to find jobs.Crown Prince Mohammed has spoken of increasing the role played by the kingdom\u2019s private sector, where Mr. Rajhi has spent his career. He is an heir to a Saudi banking empire founded by his father and has been active in a number of other businesses.Abdullatif Al Sheikh, a former head of the country\u2019s religious police, was named as minister of Islamic Affairs.

He said he was not stepping down from his current medical and other duties to take the job.The choice of Dr. Gawande, a highly respected doctor and writer on health care, was met with surprise because he has little hands-on experience running a large health care organization, unlike some of the boldface names that have been floated as possible candidates.\u201cHe\u2019s such a well-known health care luminary and keen observer, but this is a big leap,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Bielamowicz, a co-founder of Gist Healthcare, a consultancy in Washington. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t led a huge team or company.\u201dThe three companies represent roughly 1.2 million employees scattered across different markets, giving them little immediate leverage with health plans and hospitals.\u201cWe said at the outset that the degree of difficulty is high and success is going to require an expert\u2019s knowledge, a beginner\u2019s mind, and a long-term orientation,\u201d Mr. Bezos said on Wednesday. \u201cAtul embodies all three, and we\u2019re starting strong as we move forward in this challenging and worthwhile endeavor.\u201dThere is little doubt that Dr. Gawande will be able to outline what he has said he believes are the system\u2019s failings. \u201cTapping Atul Gawande to head the new venture is a very positive sign,\u201d said Brian Marcotte, the chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. \u201cHe is a thought leader, thinks outside the box, and is passionate about fixing what ails our health care system.\u201dDr. Gawande is a professor at the Harvard T.H.

My plan is to transition from executive director of Ariadne to chairman, while remaining a surgeon on staff at the Brigham and professor at Harvard. I will also continue to write, including for The New Yorker magazine.\u201dWhile Dr. Gawande does not have business experience, he has spent his career focusing on how to improve care for the sickest patients, said Dr. Bob Kocher, a venture capitalist who advised President Obama on health care policy. He pointed to Dr. Gawande\u2019s ability to attract other individuals to the venture.\u201cHe understands the health care system as an insider,\u201d Dr. Kocher said. \u201cHe has been a truth-teller.\u201dBut Dr. Kocher said that Dr. Gawande\u2019s public health experience in emphasizing preventive care is unlikely to yield the immediate savings companies like these three want. \u201cHe is going to have to come up with a whole new tool kit,\u201d he said.The challenge he and the rest of the country face is how to overcome the pricing power of big hospital groups that dominate certain markets, and drug companies, Dr. Kocher said.

{"Headline": "For Trump, Power and Values Matter Less Than Dollars and Cents", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisSINGAPORE \u2014 President Trump\u2019s eager embrace of Kim Jong-un of North Korea this week, on the heels of an acrid falling-out with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, raised an obvious, if confounding, question: Why would an American president offend allies and cozy up to adversaries?If there was an answer in Mr. Trump\u2019s tumultuous week on the global stage, it may be that he disregards the traditional preoccupations of American foreign policy \u2014 power and values \u2014 in favor of a more narrow worldview shaped by his experience as a businessman.\u201cThe theme that comes up, over and over, is money,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, a diplomat who advised President Barack Obama on China.\u201cWhat that means is that Trump, like a lot of businessmen, doesn\u2019t pay much attention to Canada, or Europe, or Japan,\u201d Mr. Bader said. \u201cBusinessmen pay attention to the growth markets: Vietnam, Brazil, India, China.\u201dOr, as was on vivid display in Singapore this week, North Korea.That does not mean Mr. Trump is necessarily interested in North Korea as a trade partner or an investment opportunity for the United States. But his view of the challenges posed by the Korean Peninsula are colored \u2014 and perhaps limited \u2014 by his background in business.In Mr. Trump\u2019s meetings with Mr. Kim \u2014 the first for a sitting president and a North Korean leader \u2014 he soft-pedaled traditional American concerns like regional security and human rights. Instead, he celebrated North Korea\u2019s economic potential and pitched Mr. Kim like a property developer proposing to build condominiums on a reclaimed Superfund site.A slick promotional video that Mr. Trump showed Mr. Kim sketched out a gleaming vision of a prosperous, nuclear-free North Korea, with swooping construction cranes and high-speed trains. Though it also framed the life-or-death nature of North Korea\u2019s nuclear showdown with the United States, the four-minute film had the inspirational tone of a Chamber of Commerce testimonial.\u201dThey have great beaches,\u201d Mr. Trump said to reporters. \u201cYou see that whenever they\u2019re exploding their cannons into the ocean, right? I said, \u2018Boy, look at the view. Wouldn\u2019t that make a great condo behind?\u2019 And I explained, I said, \u2018You know, instead of doing that, you could have the best hotels in the world right there.\u2019\u201dNorth Korea may consider its position between China and South Korea, with Japan across the water, as reason to be worried about military security. But Mr. Trump considers it a prime location amid booming economies. \u201cThink of it from a real-estate perspective,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump brought a similarly bottom-line view to the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, as well as to the military exercises the United States conducts with the South. He reiterated his desire to bring the troops home and announced he was halting the exercises \u2014 much to the surprise of the Pentagon and the South Korean government, neither of which had been warned.\u201cWe save a fortune by not doing war games, as long as we are negotiating in good faith \u2014 which both sides are!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter.The president expressed particular spite at the B-52 bombers that the United States has flown over South Korea in missions from Guam. These planes, which can carry nuclear weapons, are a potent manifestation of the American commitment to protect its Asian allies. But to Mr. Trump, they burn a lot of fuel and serve little purpose circling in the skies over the Korean Peninsula.\u201cI know a lot about airplanes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s sense of economic injustice runs even deeper when it comes to Canada and the European Union. Asked on Tuesday about his clash with Mr. Trudeau after the Group of 7 meeting in Quebec, he answered with a long list of grievances \u2014 some based on erroneous data \u2014 about the trade deficits the United States runs with Canada, Germany, and other allies.\u201cWe are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey don\u2019t take our agricultural products, barely. They don\u2019t take a lot of what we have and yet they send Mercedes into us. They send BMWs into us by the millions. It\u2019s very unfair.\u201dThe president made no reference to the wars that Canada and European allies have fought alongside the U.S.; the counterterrorism operations they have coordinated; the world trade system they have managed; or the democratic political systems and respect for human rights that they share. If anything, experts said, this common history is a red flag to Mr. Trump.\u201cA consistent theme of the Trump administration has been to downgrade the value of allies and alliances,\u201d said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cTo the contrary, they tend to be judged as military free-riders or economic rivals or both. That many are assertive, independent-minded liberals that regularly challenge the president only makes it worse.\u201dThe widening fissures in America\u2019s Pacific and Atlantic alliances, experts said, carry implications that go beyond bruised feelings or potential trade wars. In his single-minded focus on economic gain, sometimes poorly defined, critics say Mr. Trump risks undermining an international order built by the United States to bolster American security and values as well as prosperity.In Europe, Russia could feel emboldened to bully its neighbors, confident that a divided West will do little to stop it. In Asia, the fraying of America\u2019s nuclear umbrella could encourage China to increase its military adventurism in the South China Sea.The paradox of Mr. Trump\u2019s transactional approach to statecraft is that the joint statement he signed with North Korea looks like the kind of deal he once derided. It does not commit the North to the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization that his administration has long demanded. It does not address the North\u2019s fleet of ballistic missiles. It does not even set a deadline for next steps.\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d said Daniel R. Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs now at the Asia Society, \u201cis that President Trump paid retail for a few warmed-over promises and appears to have given away both leverage and deterrence.\u201dOr, as Mr. Haass put it in a tweet on Tuesday, \u201cThe containment doctrine has given way to the condominium doctrine.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Expected to List China Tariffs, Potentially Reigniting Trade War", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is expected on Friday to release a final list of Chinese goods that it plans to subject to tariffs and could soon begin putting some of those levies into effect, potentially reigniting a trade war that had been on the back burner while President Trump engaged in delicate nuclear diplomacy with North Korea.The Trump administration has vacillated between threatening tariffs on China and putting the trade war \u201con hold\u201d as it tries to negotiate a deal with Beijing that would give American companies greater access to the Chinese market. Those negotiations have produced little in the way of a firm commitment, however, with China offering to purchase nearly $70 billion in energy, agricultural and manufactured products from the United States, but only if the White House suspends tariffs on Chinese products.So far, the White House has given no indication that it plans to back away from its threat of tariffs, which President Trump and his advisers see as giving the United States leverage in negotiations with Beijing. But while the administration is expected to detail on Friday the final list of goods that it plans to subject to the tariffs, it may phase those in to allow for continuing discussions, according to people familiar with the administration\u2019s plans.Trump administration officials have been engaged in vigorous internal debates in recent weeks over how to proceed with China. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, have been pushing for a more modest agreement that satisfies Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to reduce the trade deficit. Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade adviser, and Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, have urged deeper structural reforms to China\u2019s industrial policy.But negotiations with China have been complicated by Mr. Trump\u2019s diplomatic dance with North Korea, given the involvement of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in helping facilitate the nuclear talks. Some observers said the fact that the talks with North Korea appeared to have gone well might give Mr. Trump more leeway to punish China now.\u201cKey administration officials reportedly have reached a consensus that some sort of penalties are now justified, given the lack of progress in negotiations, and that China is unlikely to derail the ongoing process on North Korea because it is so consistent with their security interests,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Mr. Trump has tried to remain unpredictable in the negotiations with China, ordering up to $150 billion in proposed tariffs and calling on the Treasury Department to develop a plan for restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States.However, Mr. Trump has also offered concessions. He directed his Commerce Department to offer a lifeline to ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications company that was on the brink of shutting down, the result of harsh penalties for violating American sanctions. At the request of Mr. Xi, the Commerce Department agreed to a settlement with ZTE that included a $1 billion fine and the installation of a new compliance team.Business groups have protested that tariffs on products from China would disrupt their supply chains, and that retaliation from Beijing could put valuable markets at risk.\u201cTariffs are the wrong answer to China\u2019s ongoing discriminatory and damaging trade practices,\u201d said Dean Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents some of the country\u2019s largest tech firms. \u201cBy imposing tariffs on consumer goods and key components of such goods, the president would needlessly take money out of Americans\u2019 pockets \u2014 harming the very people he hopes to help, not punishing China.\u201dNo formal trade meetings between the United States and China are currently scheduled, but talks have continued to take place.Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, met on Thursday in Beijing with Wang Yi, China\u2019s foreign minister, to discuss the situation with North Korea, and he said that they also spoke about trade.\u201cOur deficit with China is still too high,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cI stressed how important it is for President Trump to rectify that situation so that trade becomes more balanced, more reciprocal and more fair, with the opportunity to have American workers be treated fairly.\u201dIn an interview on Fox News that was broadcast on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump suggested that China had loosened its border with North Korea because it was frustrated with how strongly he is clamping down on trade. Mr. Trump said that within the next two weeks his hawkish approach to dealing with China on trade would be evident.\u201cThey understand what we are doing,\u201d Mr. Trump said.But fanning the trade dispute with China comes with big risks, given that the United States is waging separate trade fights with Europe, Canada and Mexico over its imposition of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum. Those countries have threatened to retaliate with tariffs of their own, and Mexico is already hitting $3 billion worth of American products with tariffs.On Thursday, the European Union\u2019s 28 member states unanimously endorsed a plan to impose import duties on 2.8 billion euros\u2019 worth of American products, according to Kinga Malinowska, a spokeswoman for the office of the European commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmstrom.Canada is prepared to put retaliatory tariffs on an array of American products on July 1 if the United States does not back down from its metals tariffs.On Thursday, Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, met with Mr. Lighthizer to discuss the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is in doubt given disagreements between the United States and Canada and Mexico.At a speech on Wednesday evening, Ms. Freeland offered a stark rebuke of America\u2019s protectionist trade policy and said that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs were \u201ca naked example of the United States\u2019 putting its thumb on the scale, in violation of the very rules it helped to write.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colombia Elects Iv\u00e1n Duque, a Young Populist, as President", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 Iv\u00e1n Duque, a populist young conservative who tapped into dissatisfaction with the economy and a contentious peace deal with rebels, won Colombia\u2019s presidential vote on Sunday.Mr. Duque, a former senator from the right-wing Democratic Center party, won about 54 percent of the vote in the second and last round of elections, election officials said. He defeated Gustavo Petro, a former guerrilla member and onetime mayor of Bogot\u00e1, the capital, who got about 42 percent.Mr. Duque\u2019s showing capped a remarkable political rise. Buoyed by charm and a conservative upwelling in Colombia, he secured the presidency in an election where many who voted for him did not even know his name a year ago. At 41, he will be one of the youngest presidents in the country\u2019s history.Far better known is Mr. Duque\u2019s longtime mentor, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, a firebrand ex-president who delivered pummeling blows against the country\u2019s main rebel group and drug traffickers over his eight years in office, from 2002 to 2010.Mr. Duque rebuffed suggestions that Mr. Uribe would govern through him were he to win. But it was clear Sunday that the close relationship between the men helped Mr. Duque get many of the votes that were cast.\u201cI don\u2019t know why people say they fear Uribe,\u201d Delia de Rojas, 75, a widow who receives a military pension, said after casting her vote for Mr. Duque. \u201cHe was the one that put order in the country,\u201d she said. \u201cNow with Duque, we will have that another time.\u201dThe election was the first to be held since the end of Colombia\u2019s war with its main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC.For generations, the conflict was the center of presidential politics. Yet how the peace deal signed by Mr. Santos was to be put into effect was not often discussed in the campaign, and sometimes appeared to be an afterthought.But the war carries a long shadow, and the peace deal affected the fortunes of both men on the presidential ballot.Mr. Duque was aided by his party\u2019s long opposition to the peace deal; it argued that it was too lenient on drug traffickers. Many who voted the deal down after a referendum in 2016 gave their votes to Mr. Duque.The end of the war with the FARC appeared to help Mr. Petro, too, as the first serious left-wing candidate for president in years. Some analysts said peace may have softened the stance of many Colombians against ex-rebels, allowing a former guerrilla to make headway.The campaign may offer some hints as to how Mr. Duque will govern.He published a book called \u201cThe Future Is at the Political Center\u201d this year and backed off some of his party\u2019s more right-wing stances. And while he has expressed doubts about the peace deal agreed to in 2016, he has not asked to overturn it. He has, though, suggested some modifications.\u201cIt strikes me as odd that they box him in as someone with positions that are radical,\u201d said Felipe Buitrago, a friend of Mr. Duque, who worked with him at the Inter-American Development Bank before he entered politics.On combating drugs, his stances have appeared closer to his mentor, Mr. Uribe. Mr. Duque has supported a return to aerial spraying of coca crops. The Santos government had banned spraying over health concerns about the chemical used. Mr. Duque also is against considering the legalization of some drugs, a growing trend among Latin American countries.\u201cHe will return to the iron fist of coordination with the U.S.,\u201d said Arlene Tickner, a political scientist at Del Rosario University in Bogot\u00e1.Mr. Petro, for his part, ran a campaign in which he denounced the corruption of top politicians and said that for both economic and environmental reasons he would phase out coal and oil exports, saying the country relied too much on hydrocarbons.As mayor of Bogot\u00e1, he had success reducing prices for public transportation and gave subsidized water to the poor, but he was also briefly impeached after a standoff with officials over city garbage collection.Mr. Petro\u2019s history as a fighter appealed to Jairo Montoya, 20, a hotel student in Bogot\u00e1 who was one of many young people who turned out to vote for him on Sunday. He said he saw the former guerrilla as a catalyst for structural changes in the country.\u201cIt\u2019s time to bring down those who have always been in power,\u201d he said, referring to politicians like Mr. Duque and Mr. Uribe. \u201cIt\u2019s time to have another kind of government.\u201dSuch sentiments, however, may have been against the tide in a country which ranks among the region\u2019s most conservative. Many of the biggest debates now center on the hot-button culture wars that have consumed politics in other countries.\u201cI am not for abortion, not for same-sex marriage \u2014 and Petro is,\u201d said Carlota Jaimes, 42, an accountant. \u201cI don\u2019t think to protect women, young people and Christian values, it\u2019s all right to be in favor of these things.\u201dMs. Jaimes cast her vote for Mr. Duque, and headed out of the polling booth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Concession Over Military Drills Blindsides Many South Koreans", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the optimism was quickly tempered by a shocker.Hours after the summit meeting with Kim Jong-un in Singapore was over, Mr. Trump said he planned to end annual joint military exercises with South Korea, emphasizing their expense.Mr. Trump suggested that he was ending the \u201cvery provocative\u201d war games as an incentive for North Korea to denuclearize, granting the North one of its most avidly sought objectives even before the country has begun dismantling its nuclear weapons.North Korea has long insisted that it would not relinquish its nuclear weapons program unless the United States removed its \u201chostile policies.\u201d The North has cited military drills between the United States and South Korea as a prime example of American hostility, calling them rehearsals for invasion. Washington and Seoul have always dismissed such accusations as propaganda.\u201cWe will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should,\u201d Mr. Trump told a news conference in Singapore. \u201cUnder the circumstances we are negotiating a comprehensive and complete deal. It is inappropriate to have war games.\u201d\u201cNo. 1, we save money. A lot,\u201d he said. \u201cNo. 2, it is really something they very much appreciated.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s remarks apparently blindsided South Korea. The office of President Moon Jae-in and the Defense Ministry in Seoul said they were both scrambling to \u201cfigure out the exact meaning and intentions in President Trump\u2019s comments.\u201dEnding the joint military exercises could help Mr. Kim persuade his people, especially hard-line generals, to agree to denuclearize and focus on building the country\u2019s poor economy, said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement stunned many South Koreans.\u201cHe sees everything in terms of money but there are values other than money in an alliance,\u201d he added.But the South Korean government has always considered the American military presence and joint drills an integral part of its security in the region, regardless of the North\u2019s nuclear intentions.Many South Koreans and Japanese fear that North Korea and China will turn talks over denuclearizing the North into regional disarmament negotiations aimed at undermining the American military influence in Northeast Asia.The United States military in South Korea \u2014 also apparently blindsided by Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 said it had received \u201cno updated guidance on execution or cessation of training exercises,\u201d including the annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian joint exercise scheduled for this fall.But Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks fed fears among many South Koreans that his \u201cAmerica-first\u201d diplomacy will leave them fending for themselves, with no sure sign that North Korea is bargaining away its nuclear weapons anytime soon.Mr. Trump has repeatedly unsettled South Koreans by threatening to withdraw the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, accusing Seoul of not paying enough for their presence. On Tuesday, he again said that he wanted to bring soldiers home but that a troop withdrawal was \u201cnot part of the equation\u201d in current negotiations with North Korea.His announcement on ending joint military exercises indicated intense bargaining that had not been reflected in the broadly worded joint statement Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim signed.Although vaguely worded, the joint statement contained a rough road map for ending the North Korean nuclear crisis that Mr. Moon\u2019s government in Seoul has been advocating.In their statement, Mr. Kim made a \u201cfirm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d while Mr. Trump promised to provide \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d for the North.Both leaders also agreed to establish \u201cnew\u201d relations between their countries and build a \u201clasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d They said they would implement the agreement \u201cexpeditiously.\u201d Aides for both will start negotiations as early as next week.Mr. Moon called the agreement \u201ca historic event that has helped break down the last remaining Cold War legacy on earth.\u201d\u201cI would like to pay my respect to President Trump who achieved a feat that no one else has ever delivered,\u201d Mr. Moon said.The lack of such details in the Trump-Kim statement suggested that despite many rounds of lower-level talks before the summit meeting, wide mistrust persists between the two sides.\u201cThe joint statement is not the end but just the beginning\u201d of what could be a bumpy road toward denuclearizing North Korea, said Kim Dong-yub, an analyst at the Seoul-based Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. \u201cBoth sides probably realized that they needed to build confidence first rather than making excessive demands.\u201dOfficials said the Tuesday statement was more likely to succeed because it had been signed and endorsed personally by two strong-willed heads of state.But critics said Mr. Trump gave away too much too soon to Mr. Kim, helping the dictator debut as a major international diplomat and implicitly recognizing North Korea as a de facto nuclear weapons state while failing to commit Mr. Kim to a specific timetable for denuclearization.In North Korea, the video images of Mr. Kim with Mr. Trump will be a propaganda bonanza for the young North Korean leader, they said.\u201cThe whole summit was a big win for Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul.Advertisement"}

American Airlines had taken that step a little over a month ago, when it estimated that the higher prices would cost it $2 billion this year.A growing economy and an increasing reliance on fees, for everything from baggage to premium economy seats, have spurred several years of strong profits for airlines, and they still expect to be profitable this year. But \u201cprobably not at the levels we were anticipating in December,\u201d said Alexandre de Juniac, the head of the International Air Transport Association.And with newer, more efficient planes, fuel now accounts for 17 to 22 percent of airlines\u2019 operating costs, down significantly from the last time fuel costs spiked, an industry consultant, Robert W. Mann, said.Brent crude, the global benchmark, closed at more than $75 a barrel on Wednesday, up about $20 over the past year. In two weeks, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is set to discuss whether to relax the oil production limits that have helped raise prices.When oil prices hit record highs a decade ago, airlines added fuel surcharges to tickets. When oil prices dropped a few years later, those extra charges were slow to disappear, as the carriers chose to use the revenue to reinvest in their business, pay dividends to shareholders or raise employee pay.More recently, the positive economic environment led airlines to add flights in response to strong ticket sales, said Patrick DeHaan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, web- and app-based fuel-tracking platform.\u201cSome of the big legacy carriers have been vocal about their plans to add capacity this year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what you\u2019re seeing is some pretty healthy demand for jet fuel as the economy continues to grow.\u201dMr. DeHaan said he did not expect any immediate action by the airlines.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on fares right now, and it\u2019s going to be a challenge raising fares, especially in the summer,\u201d he said. If current jet fuel prices emerge as a new norm, he added, \u201cI would look for more increase in the fall.\u201dAnd eventually, the high price of fuel could put newly added routes on the chopping block, said Patrick Surry, chief data scientist at the travel app Hopper. \u201cIf it continues to rise, we\u2019ll start to see a knock-on effect on pricing and consolidation, maybe some shrinkage of capacity and routes,\u201d he predicted.George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog, said investors\u2019 concerns would add a sense of urgency to how and when airlines responded.\u201cWall Street is just going to slam them if they don\u2019t increase prices or reduce capacity,\u201d he said.This might not mean higher base fares, thanks to greater competition from low-fare carriers, Mr. Hobica said, but travelers might see fuel surcharges become common again, or have to pay higher fees for checked bags, Wi-Fi and other ancillary services.In particular, industry experts predicted that travelers flying internationally, booking business-class and premium-economy seats, and flying less competitive routes \u2014 especially to or from smaller airports \u2014 could expect to pay more in the fall. They may also have fewer flights from which to choose.\u201cThis summer may well be the last time you\u2019re going to get a great price to Europe,\u201d Mr. Surry said.Zach Wichter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The Food and Drug Administration disbanded its Food Advisory Committee, which provided guidance on food safety.Government-funded scientists said in interviews that they were seeing signs that their work was being suppressed, and that they were leaving their government jobs to work in the private sector, or for other countries.The larger matter, though, is the president\u2019s lack of a close senior adviser at the White House level, someone who has Mr. Trump\u2019s trust and his ear, said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a time in the post-World War II period where issues as important as nuclear weapons are on the table, and there is no serious scientist there to help the president through the thicket,\u201d he said. \u201cThis reverberates throughout policy.\u201dHis own agency, he said, has found it \u201cextremely likely that human activity is the dominant cause of global warming, and I have no reason to doubt the science.\u201dMr. Bridenstine described his views as an \u201cevolution.\u201dThe most pressing geopolitical need may be in the realm of nuclear diplomacy. \u201cThe materials that have gone to the president ahead of the negotiation reflect the work of more than a dozen people at the Ph.D. level in relevant fields,\u201d he added, including \u201cat least one\u201d in nuclear engineering.A State Department spokeswoman referred questions to the National Security Council.\u201cThere is going to be the requirement for trade-offs, and that judgment is best made by people with technical expertise who are also very senior politically,\u201d Mr. Moniz said. \u201cThat just does not exist in this administration.\u201dAs for Mr. Kim\u2019s advisers, \u201cThe North Korean nuclear scientists are very, very competent and I would expect them to advise their government well,\u201d said Siegfried S. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico and an expert on North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.In Washington, the administration\u2019s excising of science is particularly evident at the Environmental Protection Agency.However, his more enduring legacy may be in diminishing the role of academic, peer-reviewed science at the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s not Pruitt\u2019s exorbitant spending, but rather a lot of these less sexy things they\u2019re quietly doing on science that will cause the real long-term damage,\u201d said Gretchen Goldman, the research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group.The new rules would require that the data from all scientific studies used by the E.P.A. to formulate air and water regulations be publicly available. Mr. Pruitt has touted that as a step toward increasing scientific transparency. \u201cThe era of secret science at E.P.A. is coming to an end,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe ability to test, authenticate and reproduce scientific findings is vital for the integrity of rule-making process.\u201dHowever, the change could sharply limit the research available to the E.P.A., because health studies routinely rely on confidential data from individuals.These and other changes \u201cwill diminish the characterization of pollution as risky,\u201d said William K. Reilly, who headed the E.P.A. under the first President George Bush. \u201cThis tolerance for more exposure to pollution is altogether different from anything we are used to.\u201d In a statement defending the changes to the committees, Jahan Wilcox, an E.P.A. spokesman, said that the agency \u201csought a wider range of voices\u201d and \u201cwas thrilled with the response of over 700 applicants.\u201d The boards, he said, are not only highly qualified but also \u201cindependent and geographically diverse.\u201dThis year, Mr. Pruitt sent a memo to the E.P.A.\u2019s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee ordering steps that could effectively diminish the role of scientific evidence in air pollution enforcement. The committee is required by law to prioritize the health effects of pollution, but Mr. Pruitt\u2019s memo orders it to consider potential economic consequences of meeting tighter clean-air rules \u2014 for example, the possibility that tougher pollution standards could make air-conditioning more expensive, leading to more deaths from heat.\u201cThis memo flouts the clear evidence of medical science,\u201d said John Walke, an expert in clean-air policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy organization. \u201cPruitt wants to set a definition of clean air that is medically unsafe.\u201dA little-noticed change at the Justice Department could have far-reaching impact on the role of science in federal policy across the government.Putting the management of food safety under the aegis of trade, rather than science, \u201cundermines the whole history that the U.S. has for science-based standards for food,\u201d said Catherine E. Woteki, a former chief scientist at the agency from 2010 to 2017.A department spokesman said the decision to move the office, known as Codex, came in response to aggressive trade measures by other countries, and that food safety would not be affected.The agency \u201cmakes decisions based on sound science, data and evidence,\u201d said the spokesman, Tim Murtaugh. \u201cUnfortunately, we have seen other nations use food safety standards as weapons in trade relations, manipulated for protectionist purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cMoving Codex to the mission area where U.S.D.A. coordinates all international activity simply makes sense.\u201dHer organization reached out to other possible donors to continue funding it, said Dr. McNutt, but was unable to find takers. \u201cIf the government didn\u2019t want to know the answers, it was hard to justify funding this,\u201d she said.Several Interior Department scientists have resigned to protest actions like these that are perceived as undermining research.\u201cThe reassignment letter seemed clearly retaliatory,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a top climate adviser, and they reassigned me to collect money from oil companies \u2014 come on.\u201dHeather Swift, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said, \u201cThe president signed an executive order to reorganize the federal government for the future and the secretary has been absolutely out front on that issue.\u201d She said that Mr. Clement and others took their jobs \u201cknowing that they could be called upon to work in different positions at any time.\u201dMs. Swift did not respond to other questions about the agency.Beyond the Interior Department, government scientists say they are feeling a rising indifference to their work, as well as occasional open hostility, that is triggering a brain drain.\u201cThe French program was offering an opportunity to work on climate impacts \u2014 the work that\u2019s at the core of my research,\u201d Dr. Sanderson said. That kind of science, he said, \u201cis increasingly difficult to do in the U.S.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So why is the stock market moving higher, while relations between the United States and its largest trading partners are deteriorating?The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up on Monday, the first day of trading after Mr. Trump\u2019s pugnacious stance rattled the summit meeting of the Group of 7 nations that was held over the weekend.The calm makes some sense. Investors think that trade skirmishes could be outweighed by two major reasons to be bullish.First, economic growth in the United States, which has been relatively strong for some time, may now pick up even more. Recent tax cuts might encourage businesses and consumers to spend more. Wall Street analysts expect profits of the companies in the S.&P. 500 index to surge by 26 percent this year, which is a remarkable amount. And companies with top-performing stocks, such as Netflix and Microsoft, sell products and services that are unlikely to be the direct target of hostile trade actions.Second, when Wall Street analysts do drill down to try to discern the impact of specific tariffs on companies, their conclusions are not that worrisome. Take Mr. Trump\u2019s levies on steel and aluminum, which are now in effect. These have enraged other countries and will no doubt push up costs for many United States companies that use the metals. But the overall impact on corporate earnings might be muted.The stock prices of Ford and General Motors \u2014 two companies that should be hurting from the rising metal prices \u2014 have risen since mid-February, when it became clear that the Trump administration was intent on imposing its metals tariffs.Mr. Trump, of course, is threatening more than just metals tariffs. On Friday, the United States is scheduled to release its final list of products from China that will be covered by a further $50 billion of tariffs. The Trump administration said it would impose the tariffs soon afterward. China has threatened to retaliate.Yet investors, even though they know a trade war is looming, have not dumped stocks in some of the companies that look particularly vulnerable. Computer chip makers like Qualcomm have a large proportion of their sales in China, but Qualcomm\u2019s stock has recently rallied.Investors may be less bullish about the overall market than they look. The S.&P. 500 is up only 2 percent since mid-February, when the recent trade tensions began in earnest \u2014 and that small increase has relied heavily on a rally in technology stocks. If it wasn\u2019t for concerns over trade, Wall Street\u2019s recently upgraded earnings expectations might have pushed stocks to much higher levels than they are at right now.The imposition of $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods is likely to lead to some rocky days for the stock market. But unless investors believe that profits are going to get whacked, they appear willing to tolerate Mr. Trump\u2019s trade measures.Advertisement"}

Our strong banking system is frequently credited with having helped Australia survive that upheaval.The government\u2019s broad argument had been that the system works. Our banks are \u201cthe best run, the most prudentially supervised and the most well capitalized in the world,\u201d as the former prime minister and Liberal Party doyen John Howard put it.In 2014, the coalition slashed the securities regulator\u2019s funding by almost $90 million over four years, eliminating some 200 jobs. As the calls for the royal commission gathered momentum, the Turnbull government quickly returned some of those funds, but that only underscored how the government had refused to acknowledge the state of the banking system.Ultimately, this story is about not only the banks\u2019 collective reputation but also the collapse of the government\u2019s trickle-down economic worldview.The Turnbull government\u2019s most central policy is a corporate tax cut justified on the basis that the cuts will ultimately be passed on to people in the form of higher wages. There has long been a paucity of solid evidence for this proposition \u2014 in the United States, for instance, tax cuts are flowing overwhelmingly to shareholders.In the absence of either compelling data or lived experience, the government\u2019s plan rests on a trust that businesses have some interest in their staffs\u2019 well-being and will reward them with higher wages if they can.It is an awful time to be selling that theory. If the banking royal commission symbolizes anything, it is an egregious lack of concern among banks for the well-being of ordinary Australians. Trust in the benevolence of corporations is thin.And the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of a government that placed its faith in a supine regulator, that tried to convince us that all was well and that championed the institutions it must now recognize as villains means there is also precious little political trust left.Waleed Aly is a columnist and broadcaster and a politics lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Judge in California Halts Splitting of Migrant Families at Border", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge in California issued a nationwide injunction late Tuesday temporarily stopping the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the border and ordered that all families already separated be reunited within 30 days.Judge Dana M. Sabraw of the Federal District Court in San Diego said children under 5 must be reunited with their parents within 14 days, and he ordered that all children must be allowed to talk to their parents within 10 days.\u201cThe unfortunate reality is that under the present system, migrant children are not accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property,\u201d the judge wrote.The American Civil Liberties Union had filed a lawsuit to stop the separations before the president\u2019s executive order. In his order, Judge Sabraw said that children may be separated at the border only if the adults with them present an immediate danger to the children.He also said that adults may not be deported from the United States without their children.\u201cThe facts set forth before the court portray reactive governance \u2014 responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the government\u2019s own making,\u201d the judge wrote in the opinion. \u201cThey belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our Constitution. This is particularly so in the treatment of migrants, many of whom are asylum seekers and small children.\u201dA federal judge in California issued a nationwide injunction temporarily stopping the Trump administration from separating families at the border, and he ordered that all families already separated be reunited within 30 days.In a statement, Lee Gelernt, the lead lawyer in the case for the A.C.L.U., hailed the judge\u2019s order.\u201cThis is an enormous win and will mean that this humanitarian crisis is coming to an end,\u201d Mr. Gelernt said. \u201cWe hope the Trump administration will not think about appealing when the lives of these little children are at stake.\u201dThe A.C.L.U. lawsuit was initially brought on behalf of two cases in which the children of immigrants were taken from them after they crossed the border.In one case, a woman entered the United States legally at a port of entry, fleeing persecution in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The lawsuit says that her 6-year-old daughter was taken from her and sent to a facility in Chicago, where she stayed for nearly five months.In another case, a woman from Brazil, identified as \u201cMs. C,\u201d crossed the border illegally with her 14-year-old son, who was separated from her and also sent to a facility in Chicago. The mother and son were apart for nearly eight months, according to the lawsuit.\u201cDuring the five months she was detained, Ms. C. did not see her son, and they spoke on the phone only \u2018a handful of times,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cMs. C. was \u2018desperate\u2019 to be reunited with her son, worried about him constantly and did not know when she would be able to see him.\u201dEarlier Tuesday, seventeen states sued Mr. Trump for his administration\u2019s practice of separating immigrant parents from their children, saying that the tactic is causing \u201cdevastating harm,\u201d even as a top official said the government was struggling to reunite families fractured by the policy.The states, including Washington, California and New York and joined by the District of Columbia, branded the forcible separation of immigrant families unconstitutional, \u201ccruel and unlawful,\u201d calling it a violation of the principles of due process and equal protection. They requested that the court halt it and immediately compel the government to reunite parents with their children.The Trump administration says it is trying to do just that, but success has proved vexing. The administration has appeared unprepared for the fallout from its decision to prosecute every immigrant apprehended entering the country without authorization \u2014 including those who are seeking asylum \u2014 without exceptions for parents.Even after Mr. Trump reversed course last week and moved to detain migrant parents facing charges of unlawful entry with their children, the challenge of reuniting families already torn apart has morphed into a crisis of its own.Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, told senators on Tuesday that his department \u2014 which is charged with taking custody of undocumented unaccompanied minors \u2014 was having trouble figuring out how to care for the children it was holding who had been separated from their parents.Some of them, he said, were in federal custody even though their parents had been sent back to Central America after trying to enter the United States illegally.\u201cAs to any parent who\u2019s deported, the child has independent rights,\u201d Mr. Azar said during a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee, where his plan to discuss prescription drug pricing was upended by a grilling over the separated families. \u201cWe often do find, when a parent is deported, that they ask the child to remain separate and remain in this country.\u201dRaj Shah, a White House spokesman, conceded that the process of reuniting families would be difficult. \u201cThis is a complex situation,\u201d Mr. Shah told CNN in an interview. \u201cOur goal is to fully reunite as many families as possible, as quickly as possible.\u201dYet in the lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court in Seattle, the attorneys general for the states noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s order last week did not apply to families already broken apart, nor did it prevent the tactic from being used in the future.The president, emboldened by the Supreme Court\u2019s validation of the travel ban, continued on Tuesday to rail against immigration laws that afford those fleeing danger and persecution in their home countries the chance to have their asylum claims adjudicated by a judge. \u201cIf they step on our land, they have judges \u2014 it\u2019s insane,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He said the United States should adopt stricter laws that send an unmistakable message that only immigrants who have special skills to boost the American economy should be allowed into the country.\u201cIt\u2019s called, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, you can\u2019t come in. You have to go in through a legal process,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said of his approach, during a lunch at the White House with Republican members of Congress. \u201cI have to let people come in, but they have to come in through a merit. They have to be people that can love our country and help our country.\u201dVice President Mike Pence, traveling in Brazil, implored would-be immigrants not to attempt to cross the United States border without authorization.\u201cDon\u2019t risk your lives or the lives of your children by trying to come to the United States on the road run by drug smugglers and human traffickers,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t come legally, don\u2019t come at all.\u201dThe lawsuit filed Tuesday took aim at the administration\u2019s hostility toward asylum seekers, maintaining that officials at the border were violating the law by turning them away before they could reach a port of entry to lawfully make their claim or, in some cases, before detaining them and taking away their children.\u201cBy criminalizing the pursuit of asylum, this policy runs counter to established immigration and refugee laws,\u201d the lawsuit said.White House officials did not respond to requests for comment about the legal challenge.Yet even as Mr. Trump vented his anger about the current state of immigration laws, his on-again, off-again push for a legislative overhaul of immigration policy appeared headed for defeat. The House was poised to reject a broad immigration bill slated for a vote on Wednesday, a result that is likely to prompt lawmakers in that chamber to shift their focus to narrower legislation meant to ensure that families are kept together at the border.The bill would provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, while keeping migrant families together at the border and providing billions of dollars for Mr. Trump\u2019s promised wall on the southern border with Mexico. Democrats are expected to broadly oppose it, and many conservative Republicans are also expected to vote against the measure, which has been criticized from the right as \u201camnesty.\u201dSpeaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin reiterated Tuesday that he wants migrant families to be kept together. But he held back from previewing how the House might take action if the broad legislation fails on Wednesday.\u201cI want to lean into that vote,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, adding, \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t succeed, then we\u2019ll cross that bridge. But the last thing I want to do is undercut a vote on what is a great consensus bill.\u201dWith the bill\u2019s defeat all but certain, Republicans in the House appear ready to pursue a narrower measure on the issue of family separation.\u201cWe want to make sure that\u2019s addressed regardless,\u201d said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative members.With the Fourth of July looming, it was not clear how quickly the House might be able to take action on that subject. The chamber is scheduled to finish its work for the week on Thursday and not return until July 10. Senators have also been pursuing stand-alone legislation intended to keep families together.The broader immigration overhaul had first been scheduled for a vote in the House last Thursday. But Republican leaders delayed the vote until Friday, and then pushed it to this week, as they tried to grow its support in the chamber.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans Dislike Separating Families. But They Like \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 More.", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCASTROVILLE, Tex. \u2014 In the three years since Donald J. Trump began his presidential bid by maligning Mexican immigrants, Representative Will Hurd, a Texas Republican in a Democratic-leaning district, has faced voters of all stripes who were angry about Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive style.But Mr. Hurd, who represents a heavily Hispanic region that stretches across 800 miles of the Mexican border, could not recall a moment when people were as appalled as they were over the images of anguished children separated from their migrant parents.\u201cAll the calls and emails I\u2019ve gotten in my office are from constituents saying: \u2018Why are we doing this, this is against our values,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hurd said. The president\u2019s policy had damaged the Republican brand, he said, because \u201cnobody understands why you would take children out of their parents\u2019 hands.\u201dYet many rank-and-file Republican voters in border states see it differently, creating another kind of pressure for lawmakers like Mr. Hurd. Whatever sympathy these voters feel for the children is complicated, they say, by their intense frustration over the flow of migrants from Mexico.In interviews across the Southwest and Florida on Wednesday, many Republicans said that they appreciated President Trump\u2019s emphasis on \u201czero tolerance\u201d for illegal border crossings, and wished there were as much furor over those immigrants as there was over the separation of parents and children \u2014 an administration policy that Mr. Trump reversed under pressure from Republicans like Mr. Hurd.\u201cYou don\u2019t ever want to be separating families, but at least the president focused attention on all the people crossing the border illegally,\u201d said Helen Delavan, 79, a retired school secretary in Castroville, Tex., and a supporter of both Mr. Trump and Mr. Hurd.Marcella Lagleder, 65, a retired software developer who runs an arts and crafts shop in Castroville, said the political turmoil over migrant families left her wondering \u201cwhy we\u2019re still being so open to the illegals.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re mistreating them,\u201d Ms. Lagleder said. \u201cIt\u2019d be different if they were put in a doghouse or something like that.\u201dFrom Arizona and New Mexico to Texas and Florida, conservative-leaning voters were divided over how to handle the families and on immigration policy more broadly, a reflection of the Republican fissures that have stymied immigration legislation for over a decade. Interviews with these voters in some of the most hotly contested, heavily Hispanic states and congressional districts illustrate the bind Republicans find themselves in: They need to retain support from voters who have little sympathy for undocumented immigrants and also win over more moderate voters horrified by Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about Hispanics.Republican lawmakers and strategists said the president\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy had created a political crisis for the party at a time when Republicans badly want to be taking credit for the improving economy. Instead of talking about the second-quarter economic growth that could near 5 percent, Republicans worry they are handing Democrats a potent line of attack for the midterms.Yet while the searing photographs of children locked in cages left many Democrats and independents deeply dismayed, many Republicans were less sympathetic about the plight of migrants who knowingly broke the law.Julio Martinez, 74, who headed Mr. Trump\u2019s Miami-area campaign, defended the president\u2019s hard-line approach.\u201cIt hurts my heart to see it, but the culpable ones are the parents who subject their children to crossing the border, or who send them by themselves,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cIf we start breaking laws ourselves, what is this country going to become? All of those multimillionaires who live in Hollywood, why don\u2019t they let all those illegals live in their houses?\u201dBut Michelle Garcia, 42, a cafe owner in Los Lunas, N.M., where there is an open House seat in a district that is majority-Hispanic and likely to be highly competitive, said the family separations had been \u201cmerciless and counterproductive.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a conservative and I don\u2019t believe that this is the solution,\u201d she said.But what\u2019s especially worrisome for Republicans in states like Florida, where there are hard-fought races for governor, Senate and a handful of House seats this year, is that the president is not just alienating voters with his policies. Equally troubling is his use of harsh and demagogic language when describing Latinos, a tone he seemed to amplify in a series of tweets and speeches as pressure on him grew this week.Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that unauthorized migrants \u201cinfest our country,\u201d for example, has left some Hispanic Republicans angry and concerned that he\u2019s driving away up-for-grabs voters.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a veteran Florida Republican who is of Cuban descent. \u201cThat kind of divisive language hurts us.\u201dRepresentative Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican locked in a highly competitive re-election fight, said Mr. Trump\u2019s warnings about the threat of migrants had \u201cbeen dehumanizing.\u201dThere are few House Republicans who are as frustrated with the Trump administration over immigration as Mr. Curbelo, who represents one of the most Democratic-leaning districts of any Republican in the country and has been working for months on a compromise for \u201cDreamers,\u201d those brought to the country illegally as children.In an interview, he complained that the family separation policy was \u201ca unilateral decision by Jeff Sessions,\u201d adding that the hard-line attorney general has \u201cfreelanced on a number of issues.\u201dWhat is clear from the interviews with voters, however, is that Mr. Trump\u2019s warnings about the peril presented by immigrants are being heard \u2014 and echoed by some of his supporters.\u201cThe last thing I want is this place to end up like Germany or Europe, where they\u2019re blowing up stuff and knife attacks and things like that,\u201d said Ryan Farnsworth, 44, who works in the construction industry in Phoenix and voted for the president.The steps taken once families are apprehended by agents at the United States-Mexico border, and how adults and children are processed differently.Mr. Farnsworth was sounding the same note Mr. Trump did this week, when he falsely claimed that crime in Germany had spiked and said Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition was at risk because of permissive refugee policies.Standing next to a bank of Spanish-language newspapers outside the Maricopa County Courthouse, Mr. Farnsworth said that he saw the president\u2019s family separation policy as an unfortunate but practical deterrent that could have helped secure the borders.\u201cDo I like seeing families pulled apart? Absolutely not,\u201d he said, just as a Hispanic woman and her young son scooted by, hand in hand. \u201cBut it is no different than if I were to go commit a crime, I went to jail, I\u2019d lose my children, too; they\u2019d be stripped from me.\u201dIt is voters like Mr. Farnsworth who have created pressure on Republican politicians like Representative Martha McSally, who is running for Senate in Arizona and trying to accommodate the hard-liners who dominate the Republican Party\u2019s overwhelmingly white base there without offending the broader, more racially diverse electorate.And the challenge is even more acute on the border, where Lea M\u00e1rquez-Peterson is running for Ms. McSally\u2019s seat in a district that includes both staunch border hawks and recent immigrants.\u201cIt\u2019s a very split district,\u201d said Ms. M\u00e1rquez-Peterson, a Republican who previously ran the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe should have passed a comprehensive immigration bill years ago.\u201dIn New Mexico \u2014 which has the highest percentage of citizens with Hispanic ancestry in the country \u2014 voters more frequently expressed discomfort with the separation policy.\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d said Andrew Baca, 28, a Belen, N.M., barber and former soldier who is Latino. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants, bro. America is made of immigrants.\u201dBut the challenge for Democrats in this sprawling and heavily rural New Mexico district currently held by Representative Steve Pearce, a Republican, is that voters who may not like Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies are uneasy with the liberal line on guns and abortion rights.\u201cMy vote wouldn\u2019t necessarily change because of the separation only,\u201d Mr. Baca said.Back in Mr. Hurd\u2019s district \u2014 which includes the Tornillo holding facility where some of the children have been detained \u2014 his Democratic opponent, Gina Ortiz Jones, suggested the incumbent\u2019s outrage was inspired by his re-election bid.\u201cIt took kids in cages for him to speak up,\u201d said Ms. Ortiz Jones, a former Air Force officer, arguing that the Republican\u2019s voting record suggested fidelity to Mr. Trump.But the good news for Mr. Hurd, a former C.I.A. officer who survived 2016 even as Hillary Clinton carried the district, is that many voters here say they intend to support him, no matter their view on the separation of children from their parents.Robert Belitz, a Democrat selling melons from the back of his truck on the main road cutting through Castroville, expressed disgust at the policy.\u201cThis isn\u2019t some authoritarian state,\u201d he said, before adding he would still back Mr. Hurd, whom he deemed \u201ca good man who delivers on what he says.\u201dFor Mr. Hurd to win again along the Rio Grande, he would need such voters to remain in his corner \u2014 and for Mr. Trump to not make that task more difficult.\u201cWhenever we\u2019re not able to talk about how the economy is doing well, how unemployment is low, and instead we\u2019re talking about taking babies from their mothers \u2014 that\u2019s not an environment that\u2019s going to be helpful,\u201d Mr. Hurd said.Simon Romero reported from Castroville, Tex., and Jonathan Martin from Washington.

{"Headline": "Trump Touts Jobs Report Before Official Release, Breaking Protocol", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump broke years of presidential protocol on Friday morning with a tweet that signaled a strong jobs report was on its way from the Labor Department, an hour before the report was released.While the White House brushed off any notion that Mr. Trump had crossed a line, legal experts said the tweet raised possible insider trading concerns and economists said it was a blatant misuse of presidential power.The Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely releases its monthly employment report on the first Friday of the month. The night before, under longstanding tradition, the president and several senior administration officials \u2014 including the Treasury secretary and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 are briefed on the numbers, which they are not supposed to disclose until the report is made public at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time the next morning.But Mr. Trump, who was briefed on the numbers Thursday evening, appeared to foreshadow the strength of the latest report on Friday morning on Twitter.\u201cLooking forward to seeing the unemployment numbers at 8:30 this morning,\u201d Mr. Trump posted at 7:21 a.m.White House officials downplayed the president\u2019s tweet. Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the National Economic Council, said that he had shared the jobs report on Thursday evening with the president but expressed no concern with Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet on Friday morning.\u201cI don\u2019t think he gave anything away, incidentally. I think this is all according to routine, law and custom,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on CNBC.But economists criticized Mr. Trump for breaking a longstanding practice, and possibly a federal regulation.Because it is widely known that presidents have early access to jobs numbers, and because Mr. Trump has never before tweeted that he was \u201clooking forward\u201d to a report release, \u201cI would be willing to bet that some people traded off of this,\u201d said Thomas O. Gorman, a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement official who is now a partner at the law firm Dorsey & Whitney.\u201cThe fact of the matter is, he knew it was good, it was good, and he signaled it,\u201d Mr. Gorman said, referring to the number in the jobs report. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say, by the way, company A is going to buy company B. You can just signal it. The word selection is very clear. He knew exactly what he was doing.\u201dA spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission would not comment on whether the agency was aware of any unusual market activity before the report was released. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission did not respond to a similar request for comment.On Wall Street, where the 8:30 a.m. release on Jobs Friday is a major event for the markets each month, traders disagreed on whether the tweet actually moved prices, which fluctuate constantly and make it difficult to determine if any single event pushed them in one direction or another.But observers also said it is clear that watching the presidential Twitter feed is now being incorporated into the ritual of preparing for the Bureau of Labor Statistics update.\u201cI think the markets certainly paid attention,\u201d said Aaron Kohli, a government bond market strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York, of the president\u2019s Friday tweet. \u201cAnd will do so next month should there be a tweet, or lack of one.\u201dMany trading firms already use computers to keep track of social media traffic in the hope of garnering trading signals.\u201cMost sophisticated firms these days are following Twitter, and in the age of Trump, a lot of firms have trading models that are following him,\u201d said Larry Tabb, founder of the Tabb Group, a financial markets research and advisory firm.Still, some expressed concern that the president could turn one of the most important signals about the health of the economy into a trading game that could destabilize financial markets by prompting a rapid sell-off in advance of future jobs reports if Mr. Trump did not tout the upcoming release.Washington has long tried to prevent market-moving data like the employment numbers from being prematurely released. In 1985, the White House Office of Management and Budget issued a regulation governing the release of embargoed federal data like the jobs report, including a requirement that employees of the executive branch not comment publicly on the data until an hour after its release.It is unclear whether the regulation applies to Mr. Trump, some legal experts said. \u201cI would be very cautious about assuming this applies to the president, who is generally not considered an employee\u201d of the executive branch, said Adam Scales, a law professor at Rutgers University who teaches administrative law.The Republican National Committee responded to the criticism of Mr. Trump on Friday afternoon by flagging an evening speech by President Barack Obama on Feb. 5, 2009, the night before the first jobs report release of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency.The economy was shedding jobs rapidly in the depths of the Great Recession and Mr. Obama, pushing for passage of an economic stimulus bill, told a congressional Democratic retreat that \u201cTomorrow we\u2019re expecting another dismal jobs report, on top of the half a million jobs that were lost last month, on top of the half a million jobs that were lost the month before that, on top of the 2.6 million jobs that were lost last year.\u201dEven before the numbers were released on Friday, economists said they were stunned at the prospect that Mr. Trump was giving hints about the report\u2019s content, which fast-acting traders in financial markets could seize on to place bets on an optimism-fueled market surge.Austan Goolsbee, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for a year during President Obama\u2019s first term, called Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet \u201ctotally inappropriate\u201d. If he or another official had sent a tweet like the president\u2019s, he said, he would have been investigated.\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a breakdown of a norm, this is really an abuse of the office,\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said.Other economists went further, raising the possibility that if Mr. Trump was willing to give Twitter users a premature hint at the strength of report, he could also have shared the numbers with a more select group even earlier.\u201cPresident Trump was sent the jobs numbers in advance,\u201d said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government who was Mr. Obama\u2019s final chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cSharing them with the public is destabilizing and inappropriate. A bigger concern is if he was bragging about them privately to his friends last night \u2014 friends who could make millions on the information.\u201dMr. Furman said during his tenure, he briefed the president in person in the early evening if Mr. Obama was in Washington, and usually gave him the numbers over a secure phone line if the president was traveling. Mr. Obama also received a paper summary of the next day\u2019s major economic releases around 7 p.m.Mr. Furman said he and other officials took the security of the numbers seriously. When he started at the White House, Mr. Furman said, he signed a memorandum of understanding with the Labor Department agreeing only to share the numbers with the handful of people authorized to see them. He said he did not believe the information was formally classified, but the staff treated it that way, discussing it via a secure line.Letting the numbers leak, Mr. Furman said, risked undermining public confidence in the integrity of economic data.Jim Tankersley reported from Washington and Matt Phillips from New York.

{"Headline": "The Snake Oil of the Second-Act Industry", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe in America believe in starting over \u2014 and over and over.Take Sheri, who was a 47-year-old stay-at-home mom when I spoke with her. In her previous job as a customer support representative at a hospital, the Massachusetts mother of three spent her time paging doctors and in return made a very modest hourly wage. But in midlife, she decided to retrain in the hopes of making a better salary to help cover her kids\u2019 college tuition. She said that she was easily lured by the promises of a for-profit college offering an advanced degree in health care management.\u201cThey sucked me in, telling me I could study in my own time, when my kids were asleep,\u201d Sheri told me. \u201cThey said that I didn\u2019t have to pay money up front. It was very appealing.\u201d That all changed when she got an injury halfway through the program and could no longer use her computer keyboard to type her papers. The school administration told her she would have to drop out and reregister. The school wouldn\u2019t apply her credits or the money she had already spent to future course work. So she left.When I last spoke to her, she and her family owed $16,000 in student loans.Over the past few years, I\u2019ve spoken to a number of middle-aged people who, like Sheri, retrained in midlife and accrued new student debt. Some started their attempt at a professional upgrade after taking a pause from the work force to have kids \u2014 a story so familiar to many of us that it could serve as an omnipresent soundtrack. One middle-aged father of four went back to school to study tech. His degree from the ITT Technical Institute, a for-profit college that is now defunct, left him $59,000 in debt and employed at close to the same earning capacity he was before he started the program.The idea behind the second-act industry is that it\u2019s never too late; you\u2019re never too old.The industry appeals to anxious and sometimes underqualified middle-aged students who are enticed by a constellation of websites, special programs, self-help books and gurus. Ann Rankowitz, the founder of Second Act Coaching, promises, \u201cYour own second act can actually be the most exciting, freeing and empowered era of your life.\u201dAt the very high end, some companies guide professionals age 50-plus on their second act to the tune of $20,000 to $90,000 a year, counseling them on how to present themselves to new employers. One such coach calls himself a \u201ccareer designer.\u201d There are virtual conferences with names like Mega Reinvention and Age Busters Power Summit. Websites assure us that \u201cby learning the essential ways to focus on your added value, you can turn your age into an advantage.\u201dGenerally, for-profit schools and coaches targeting unemployed and underemployed older workers are marketed for maximum revenue. \u201cThey inflate the promise of what you might get from all of these training workshops, books, coaching or schools,\u201d said Ofer Sharone, a University of Massachusetts, Amherst, sociologist and a founder of the Institute for Career Transitions.Though much of that debt went to education for children and grandchildren, a significant percentage of people were paying for their own education \u2014 their attempts to \u201creboot.\u201dAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 33.5 percent of job-seekers age 55 and older are long-term unemployed people, and long-term unemployment rates for people over 55 are triple the rates for those 25 and under.There is a psychological and physical toll from the pressure to recreate ourselves in midlife. To survive as workers, we have to deny, on some level, the realities of our bodies \u2014 bodies that age and give birth. While more people are working later in life because of happy things like longer life expectancy, they are also doing so because of very sad things, like a lack of Social Security benefits or retirement plans.It is also a story, though, that hews to a troubling belief in human perfectibility: a national makeover mentality about identity. It is one prong of the way American parents and aging workers are being squeezed, and how we have been taught to seek only individual solutions for problems that are often collective or systemic in nature.The real problem is that middle-aged people are unlikely to have pensions or savings because of inadequate federal social support in this country. Unfortunately, individual ambition \u2014 midlife \u201cleaning in\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t always do the trick.Yet we continue to believe. Perhaps it\u2019s because the roots of our faith in second acts are long. F. Scott Fitzgerald was just one of the many novelists who had trust in it, writing, \u201cI once thought that there were no second acts in American lives, but there was certainly to be a second act to New York\u2019s boom days.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t always work that way. And people blame themselves for their unemployment and for accruing debt after trying for a career, when attempts at reinvention have led them to a proverbial hall of mirrors.The lack of a safety net that sometimes forces people into these second-act \u201csolutions\u201d is also what tends to make their situations even worse.To be sure, some second-act employment counseling can be useful, and there are workers who manage to obtain their coveted second acts. In Boston, I attended an impressive program called RE:Launch for middle-aged job-hunters, where they were taught about creating better r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, for instance, but weren\u2019t hectored for their failure to brand.Self-reinvention is an encouraging conceit.It is simply not always a possible one.We should look to create fixes for middle-aged workers that are not solely reliant on private inspirations or pricey new degrees. We need public solutions for midlife career atrophy and joblessness so that people don\u2019t get into even deeper debt and blame themselves for their failures.The truth of the second act may not, after all, be found within ourselves, but without.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s Contemporary Art Market Makes a Cautious Comeback", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA decade ago, when the market for Indian contemporary art suddenly plummeted after a few years of exuberant sales, a lot of galleries switched to the seemingly safer realms of well-established Indian modern artists. But not Sunitha Kumar Emmart.She had opened her GallerySKE in Bangalore in 2003, devoted entirely to younger, living artists and those who used multidisciplinary media such as sound and video art. Although she felt the reverberations of the crash, her gallery was young enough to be resilient. \u201cI was still running it like a family foundation or something,\u201d she said. \u201cSo to me, I was just happy we were paying our bills and that we continued to pay our bills.\u201dInterest in contemporary Indian art has begun to rise again, led by younger Indian buyers who are far more cautious than their speculative counterparts a decade ago, and by international museums and private collectors interested in diversifying their collections.Exhibitors at the 2018 edition of Art Basel in Switzerland include GallerySKE, Chemould Prescott Road of Mumbai and Experimenter of Kolkata. And Mr. Shetty will appear in the Unlimited sector of the fair.But by 2008, with the collapse of the global economy, it was all over. Works that had sold for millions couldn\u2019t be sold for a tenth of the price, she said.\u201cThere was a lot of froth in that market at the time, and people were trying to take advantage of that market, but the foundations at the time weren\u2019t very strong,\u201d Ms. Mehta said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat you\u2019d see was that because there was such a demand for the work, they\u2019d be sold right away, and then sold on almost immediately. People started to wonder, is this art any good if nobody wants to keep it?\u201dThe market retrenched. International auction houses halted their dedicated sales, Indian buyers pulled back and many Indian art galleries shifted their focus to selling blue-chip modern art that was considered to be less of a financial gamble than contemporary work.\u201cWe feel honestly \u2014 and it\u2019s not only because I\u2019m an eternal optimist \u2014 but I feel like 2018 is the year it will turn around,\u201d he added. \u201cOne of the reasons is because of the India Art Fair, and there certainly is a new generation of Indian buyers whose fingers were not burned by that correction.\u201dAt Art Basel, in the Statements sector of the fair, Experimenter will be presenting a solo exhibition by the Kolkata-based sculptor Rathin Barman, who creates architectural works using construction materials such as wood, concrete, firebrick and iron. His current sculptures were created after conducting in-depth interviews with residents and migrants in North Kolkata, and the result is \u201ca collective recollection of a place and its people,\u201d explained the co-director Prateek Raja.\u201cI think we are pretty confident about how the work will be received at Basel,\u201d Mr. Raja said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest now in emerging Indian and South Asian artists across the world, from international collectors who already have works from India and from collectors who haven\u2019t yet made their foray into contemporary Indian art.\u201dJagdip Jagpal, the director of the India Art Fair in New Delhi who oversaw her first edition in February, said that her fair still emphasized modernist art this year, because a lot of collectors still felt safer buying works by established artists, but now they\u2019re beginning to explore outside that category.\u201cObviously the face of things is still the modern market, but things are changing,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t necessarily looking to buy only blue-chip paintings as assets anymore; there\u2019s a diversity of buyers and what they\u2019re prepared to look at and investigate is changing.\u201dMs. Mehta of Sotheby\u2019s says this is only partly true.\u201cYes, the modernists make up the bulk of the value of the Indian art market, but you can say the same thing about three artists in the international contemporary art market \u2014 Basquiat, Picasso and Warhol,\u201d she said. \u201cThe news from our recent sales was good: There are more people wanting diverse collections. I see that some of those collectors who are buying those big names are branching out and buying other artists of the same generation but who didn\u2019t necessarily get their due at that time.\u201dMs. Emmart of GallerySKE said that part of the change had come from Western museums, which had taken an interest in Indian and South Asian art and created collection budgets for art from the region. In the last three or four years, she said, she has seen more acquisition committees and patron councils recruiting Indian experts to help make acquisition decisions.\u201cWhen I started really selling in the gallery after the first three years, a lot of my clientele was outside of India,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people in India didn\u2019t understand what I was doing. Like, my second show was purely sound art. I think I was extremely na\u00efve about the market, and in a way I\u2019m kind of thankful about that. I only did what I thought was valid and had to be shown.\u201dToday, she said, about half of her buyers come from within the Indian subcontinent and the other half from across the globe. \u201cAcross the board there\u2019s been a much bigger acceptance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to generalize, because my program includes about 16 artists, and there can be a huge difference between one and another in terms of the market, so it\u2019s very hard to say this is a trend.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Helps Putin", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Rice was the national security adviser during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.Imagine if Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, had also written a letter to Mr. Trump, somehow inserting it in the top drawer of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. What advice would Mr. Putin have offered his American counterpart, the man whom Mr. Putin tried to help elect, according to the American intelligence community?Mr. Putin\u2019s objectives are plain: to restore Russia to global greatness at the expense of the United States and to divide Europe by weakening NATO and the European Union. In Mr. Putin\u2019s zero-sum calculus, when the United States and Europe founder, Russia benefits. The Russian leader knows that America\u2019s global power rests not only on our military and economic might but also on our unrivaled network of alliances from Europe to Asia. For some seven decades, our alliances have ensured that America\u2019s strength and influence are magnified. Accordingly, Mr. Putin seeks to drive wedges between the United States and its closest partners, to strain and ultimately rupture its alliances.If Mr. Putin were calling the shots, he would ensure that America\u2019s reliability is doubted, its commitments broken, its values debased and its image tarnished. He would advise the new president to take a series of steps to advance those aims:Second, criticize NATO and cast doubt on America\u2019s willingness to defend its allies on the grounds that they haven\u2019t paid their bills (when that\u2019s not how NATO works). Simultaneously, corrode the European Union by: lauding Brexit; sending Stephen Bannon to stoke European anti-establishment movements; and undermining Europe\u2019s most powerful country, Germany, most recently through installing a right-wing flamethrower as ambassador.Third, for the coup de gr\u00e2ce: start a trade war with our closest allies. Impose steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the European Union with the threat of auto tariffs to follow so that, according to reputable economists, both the United States and its allies\u2019 economies will suffer. Justify the penalties on the preposterous grounds that allies threaten United States national security. Do so after withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, following months of stringing along our European partners with the hope that we might agree to augment aspects of the pact. Then threaten sanctions on European companies for abiding by the deal, which has worked as intended.With the sum of these actions, President Trump has deeply angered our closest allies and offended almost every member of the international community, except Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates \u2014 and Russia. Meanwhile, Russia is ascendant in the Middle East. The European Union is reeling \u2014 with Italy, Slovenia, Austria and Hungary now led by populist nationalists who embrace Mr. Putin and wish to terminate sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. NATO\u2019s unity is similarly strained, provoking concern about its collective will to counter any new Russian aggression.All good for Mr. Putin and no one else.Four years ago, after the Ukraine invasion, the United States led the charge to throw Russia out of the G-8. Now, as leaders of the Group of 7 nations gather in Quebec, President Trump says he thinks Russia should be readmitted. The climate is so bitter that the French finance minister termed the meeting the \u201cG-6 plus one.\u201d In reality, it\u2019s the \u201cG-7 minus one,\u201d since President Trump has so alienated the United States from its core partners that we have effectively absented ourselves.America stands alone, weakened and distrusted. Without United States leadership, the G-7 can accomplish little. And, when next we need our allies to rally to fight terrorists, place sanctions against North Korea, combat a pandemic or check China and Russia, will they join with us after we have so disrespected them?There is no evidence that Mr. Putin is dictating American policy. But it\u2019s hard to imagine how he could do much better, even if he were.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How One Conservative Think Tank Is Stocking Trump\u2019s Government", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "FeatureBy placing its people throughout the administration, the Heritage Foundation has succeeded in furthering its right-wing agenda.Supported byThe job of staffing the government is the first, and in many ways defining, challenge faced by every president. As the size of the government has grown to accommodate the nation\u2019s economy, frequent military interventions and increasingly complex geopolitical obligations, so have the scale and gravity of the task. In 1933, there were just over 200 presidential appointees in the executive and legislative branches. At the end of the Barack Obama\u2019s second term, there were 4,100.Filling enough of these jobs in time to get the government off the ground on Jan. 20 is difficult in the best of circumstances, which is to say when the president-elect has some sort of pre-existing political infrastructure to draw upon. Even Ronald Reagan, who, like Trump, campaigned as a Washington outsider, relied on both his inner circle from the California Statehouse and a kitchen cabinet of mostly self-made millionaires who helped finance his political rise. Trump would be coming to the White House with little more than the remnants of a campaign staff that included his daughter and son-in-law, a contestant from his reality-TV show and his longtime bodyguard. What is more, in the days after his election, Donald Trump replaced the head of his preliminary transition operation, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and purged Christie\u2019s allies from the team, throwing away months\u2019 worth of their work recruiting and vetting personnel; a senior Trump aide, Stephen K. Bannon, made a show of gleefully dumping binders filled with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s into the trash.The Trump team may not have been prepared to staff the government, but the Heritage Foundation was. In the summer of 2014, a year before Trump even declared his candidacy, the right-wing think tank had started assembling a 3,000-name searchable database of trusted movement conservatives from around the country who were eager to serve in a post-Obama government. The initiative was called the Project to Restore America, a dog-whistle appeal to the so-called silent majority that foreshadowed Trump\u2019s own campaign slogan.In some ways, Trump and Heritage were an unlikely match. Trump had no personal connection to the think tank and had fared poorly on a \u201cPresidential Platform Review\u201d from its sister lobbying shop, Heritage Action for America, which essentially concluded that he wasn\u2019t even a conservative. (\u201cDespite his rhetoric, Trump\u2019s history suggests a reluctance to engage in debates over protecting civil society from the imposition of left-wing values,\u201d it read in part.) After Trump mocked John McCain\u2019s P.O.W. experience in Vietnam, Heritage Action\u2019s chief executive, Michael Needham, called the candidate \u201ca clown\u201d on Fox News and said \u201che needs to be out of the race.\u201d Trump claimed to want to shake up the Washington establishment. The Heritage Foundation is a Washington institution. Its large, stately headquarters sits just a few blocks from Capitol Hill.And yet Heritage and Trump were uniquely positioned to help each other. Much like Trump\u2019s, Heritage\u2019s constituency is equal parts donor class and populist base. Its $80 million annual budget depends on six-figure donations from rich Republicans like Rebekah Mercer, whose family foundation has reportedly given Heritage $500,000 a year since 2013. But it also relies on a network of 500,000 small donors, Heritage \u201cmembers\u201d whom it bombards with millions of pieces of direct mail every year. The Heritage Foundation is a marketing company, a branding agency \u2014 it sells its own Heritage neckties, embroidered with miniature versions of its Liberty Bell logo \u2014 and a policy shop rolled into one. But above all, Heritage is a networking group. It has spent decades fashioning itself into the hub of a constellation of conservative individuals and organizations united by their opposition to government regulations \u2014 from taxes to gun control to environmental protections \u2014 and socially progressive causes like same-sex marriage.Today it is clear that for all the chaos and churn of the current administration, Heritage has achieved a huge strategic victory. Those who worked on the project estimate that hundreds of the people the think tank put forward landed jobs, in just about every government agency. Heritage\u2019s recommendations included some of the most prominent members of Trump\u2019s cabinet: Scott Pruitt, Betsy DeVos (whose in-laws endowed Heritage\u2019s Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society), Mick Mulvaney, Rick Perry, Jeff Sessions and many more. Dozens of Heritage employees and alumni also joined the Trump administration \u2014 at last count 66 of them, according to Heritage, with two more still awaiting Senate confirmation. It is a kind of critical mass that Heritage had been working toward for nearly a half-century.Heritage was born in the spring of 1971 in the basement cafeteria of the United States Capitol. Feulner had just turned 30 and was working for Representative Philip Crane, an Illinois Republican who had written a book, \u201cThe Democrat\u2019s Dilemma: How the Liberal Left Captured the Democratic Party,\u201d arguing that left-wing radicals inspired by the Fabian Society, a socialist group in Britain, were secretly trying to turn America into a socialist state via the Democratic Party. As an undergraduate at Regis College, Feulner had been drawn to an emerging conservative movement that saw as its enemy not only Democrats but also moderate Republicans who threatened to do to their party what they believed the Fabians had done to the Democrats. In 1964, as a graduate student at the Wharton School, he organized a campus group to support the insurgent presidential candidacy of his political hero, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona.Over breakfast at the Capitol, Feulner and another Hill aide, 28-year-old Paul M. Weyrich \u2014 later credited with coining the phrase \u201cmoral majority\u201d \u2014 commiserated over a recent study from the American Enterprise Institute, an established conservative think tank, about a proposed supersonic transport plane. The report could have helped buttress their argument that the government should continue to fund the plane as part of its effort to win the Cold War, but A.E.I. had withheld it until after the Senate voted on the issue so as not to bias the debate. This was, to their thinking, the wrong approach. What if they could create a new sort of think tank, one that would actively seek to cultivate and influence politicians, and in the process advance the cause of movement conservatism?Soon after, they made their pitch to Joseph Coors, the highly motivated Colorado beer baron who would later, at the suggestion of the Reagan White House aide and future National Rifle Association president Oliver North, wire $65,000 to a Swiss bank account to buy a cargo plane for Nicaraguan rebels. Coors had come to Washington in search of a conservative institution in which to invest. The meeting was held in the office of the irreverent ex-newspaperman and Nixon aide Lyn Nofziger. Weyrich had heard that Coors was also considering investing in A.E.I., which gave Nofziger the idea for \u201ca little artifice,\u201d as the official history of the Heritage Foundation describes it. Before Coors arrived, Nofziger sprinkled some cigar ashes on a thick American Enterprise Institute study resting on his bookshelf. When Coors asked about A.E.I., he took the book off-the-shelf and blew off the ashes. \u201cA.E.I.?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re good for \u2014 collecting dust.\u201dCoors invested $260,000 in the new venture, and within a few years, Heritage had taken its place at the center of the growing conservative counterestablishment. Its initial fund-raising success foreshadowed the rise of the Republican donor class as a political force: Another early and generous giver was the banking and oil heir Richard Mellon Scaife, who went on to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in conservative media outlets and nonprofit organizations that, among other projects, targeted the Clintons during the 1990s. (Heritage trustees used to joke that Coors gave six-packs; Scaife gave cases.)Feulner packaged his fledgling think tank\u2019s ideology into five basic principles: free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional values and a strong national defense. They would guide Heritage\u2019s agenda, which would be set by Feulner and his senior leadership team. Feulner also anticipated the danger of his new think tank\u2019s being dismissed as a tool of rich Republicans. To build a Heritage member base that would assert the foundation\u2019s anti-establishment identity, he turned to Richard Viguerie, the conservative marketing pioneer known for his high-quality mailing list and his uniquely apocalyptic warnings of imminent national collapse.Think tanks are sometimes referred to as universities without students, suggesting intellectual diversity within a general philosophical orientation. Heritage, by contrast, was strictly results-oriented. Feulner once likened his strategy to Procter & Gamble\u2019s approach to Crest toothpaste: \u201cThey sell it and resell it every day by keeping the product fresh in the consumer\u2019s mind.\u201d One way to promote Heritage\u2019s brand was to inundate Congress with an unending barrage of bite-size \u201cbackgrounders\u201d; another was by networking. Heritage hosted weekend retreats for lawmakers, study groups for young congressional staffers and semester-long internships for college students, complete with Heritage housing. In its early years, Heritage took up numerous political battles: It published papers advocating making Social Security voluntary, argued against giving striking workers access to food stamps and warned parents about the danger posed by the advancement of \u201csecular humanism\u201d in public schools. To Feulner, they were all worthy fights, but they were just a prelude to what Heritage\u2019s official history calls \u201cthe Big Gamble\u201d \u2014 its decision to invest in the presidential candidacy of the 68-year-old Ronald Reagan.Feulner saw something in Reagan long before he became president. \u201cWe had met with him when he was governor in California; we had visited his ranch and seen copies of Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek with marginal notes in the book,\u201d Feulner told me. \u201cSo we knew that he was one of us.\u201d In the run-up to the 1980 election, Heritage spent $250,000 to assemble a comprehensive guidebook for conservative rule that it called \u201cMandate for Leadership\u201d and aggressively marketed it to members of Reagan\u2019s transition team, in particular Edwin Meese, who was Reagan\u2019s chief of staff in California and later became his attorney general in Washington. The big gamble paid off: Meese told me that Reagan asked that the 1,093-page document be distributed at his first cabinet meeting. Reagan also turned to Heritage and Feulner to help staff and organize his administration. An enduring, mutually beneficial friendship was born. Meese wrote a letter on White House stationery stating that members of Heritage\u2019s President\u2019s Club \u2014 at the time, donors of $1,000 or more \u2014 would \u201cprovide a vital communications link between policymakers and those key people who made possible Reagan\u2019s victory,\u201d as Sidney Blumenthal reported in his 1986 book \u201cThe Rise of the Counter-Establishment.\u201d The relationship worked both ways. When Reagan\u2019s second term ended, Meese joined Heritage as its first Ronald Reagan Fellow in Public Policy, with an annual salary of more than $400,000. Now 86, he remains at the think tank as distinguished fellow emeritus of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies.Reagan\u2019s image is everywhere at Heritage, the informal poses and settings \u2014 on a horse, on a putting green, relaxing at his ranch \u2014 suggesting less a political actor than a beloved family member. But Heritage had its complaints about Reagan at the time. On the first anniversary of his presidency, the think tank issued a report characterizing his tenure as a disappointment to conservatives. Heritage laid much of the blame on personnel who were insufficiently committed to the president\u2019s agenda. \u201cThey were looking for competent people,\u201d Nofziger, who had gone on to become a key political strategist for Reagan, later recalled. \u201cI tried to explain to them that the first thing you do is get loyal people, and competence is a bonus.\u201dOver the following decades, Feulner continued to pursue his dream of turning the counterestablishment into the establishment. The prospects had perhaps never looked bleaker than they did in 2012, when Obama was easily elected to his second term. Having just turned 70, Feulner decided that it was time to retire. At that moment in conservative history, it was not difficult for him to see where the future of the think tank lay: the Tea Party. Heritage had helped organize and underwrite the anti-tax, anti-government \u2014 and, most of all, anti-Obama \u2014 movement, even creating a lobbying organization, Heritage Action, to help harness the energy it unleashed.A couple of years earlier, in 2010, Feulner heard a talk given by one of the movement\u2019s leading figures, Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, at a meeting of a conservative dinner group in Georgetown. \u201cWhen it was over, Richard Viguerie said to Jim: \u2018That was such a fantastic speech. Why don\u2019t you run for president?\u2019\u2009\u201d Feulner told me, recounting the events of the evening. \u201cDeMint locked eyes with me and said, \u2018The only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted to be president of is the Heritage Foundation.\u2019\u2009\u201dFeulner decided DeMint was someone to watch, and the next year, the senator earned the highest possible rating on Heritage Action\u2019s new congressional scorecard, which evaluated lawmakers\u2019 voting records on the think tank\u2019s principles \u2014 higher than Michele Bachmann and much higher than Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell. (\u201cWith each vote cast in Congress, freedom either advances or recedes,\u201d Needham said when Heritage Action unveiled the new rating system.) DeMint had fought the federal bailouts of the banks and carmakers, supported school prayer and opposed abortion and Obamacare. No less important, DeMint, who had an M.B.A. from Clemson University, shared the Heritage belief that politics was as much about sales and recruiting as it was about legislating or governing. Before running for office at the age of 47, he had operated his own marketing company; as a senator, he created a political-action committee, the Senate Conservatives Fund, to raise cash for select conservative candidates. He was clearly a skilled fund-raiser, which was a big part of the Heritage job. He would have to be willing to give up his Senate seat to run a think tank, which was maybe not as far-fetched as it sounded. In addition to influence, Heritage offered something the government couldn\u2019t: money. Without even having to taint his reputation by becoming a lobbyist, he would get a roughly 400 percent raise from his government salary, to nearly $900,000 in his first full year.While Feulner and his senior staff had reserved the right to review policy papers, they generally avoided intervening in the research and publication process. DeMint and his leadership team were much more aggressive. Papers were heavily edited or even withheld from release altogether. Several scholars quit. DeMint replaced them, bringing in as Heritage\u2019s chief economist Stephen Moore, a Wall Street Journal editorial writer and a founder of the Club for Growth, a lobbying group that advocates cutting taxes.DeMint intensified the think tank\u2019s marketing efforts, targeting Obamacare in particular. A Heritage billboard went up in Times Square \u2014 \u201cWarning,\u201d it read, \u201cObamacare may be hazardous to your health\u201d \u2014 and DeMint led a \u201cDefund Obamacare Tour\u201d across the country. In Congress, he had been something of a one-man ideological enforcer. Now he had at his disposal the power of an $80 million institution whose name was a one-word shorthand for movement conservatism; the backing of some of the country\u2019s richest, most politically engaged Republicans; and a significant slice of the conservative base. Within months of his arrival, he was pressing House Republicans to send the president a spending bill that wouldn\u2019t fund the Affordable Care Act, thus inviting a government shutdown. \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that I have more influence now on public policy than I did as an individual senator,\u201d he said in an interview with National Public Radio in 2013.But his most audacious bid for influence came the following year, when he inaugurated the Project to Restore America. \u201cWhat we learned from talking to Heritage folks who had been in the Reagan administration was that we needed to be in the game early,\u201d Ed Corrigan, one of DeMint\u2019s Capitol Hill hires, told me. With its focus on staffing, the new effort was the logical extension of his fixation on recruiting the right conservatives for Congress, not to mention the concept at the very heart of Feulner\u2019s vision for Heritage. To lead the project, DeMint turned to a woman who had spent decades building Heritage\u2019s network and knew just how to staff a government: Becky Norton Dunlop, a former deputy personnel director for Reagan. \u201cI know this is going to be hard to believe, but he said \u2014 and I agreed \u2014 that it was highly likely that a conservative would be elected president,\u201d Dunlop told me, recalling her first conversation about the effort with DeMint. \u201cWe needed to be prepared.\u201dDunlop\u2019s name may be unfamiliar to most Americans, but she is something of a legend among movement conservatives. She came to Washington in 1973 straight from college to work for the American Conservative Union, the lobbying group best known for organizing the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, and later married an aide to Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who gave her away at their wedding. (Her father, a Baptist minister, officiated.) Congress eventually pushed her out of the Interior Department for trying to demote or fire several National Park Service employees and replace them with political appointees. Years later, after a controversial stint as Virginia\u2019s secretary of natural resources \u2014 \u201cGunning for the Environment?\u201d was the headline of a 1997 Washington Post profile in the Style section \u2014 she landed at Heritage as its vice president for external relations and has been there ever since.Dunlop tapped her extensive network, groups like the Family Research Council, Liberty University and the Council for National Policy, an organization that brings together advocates of various conservative causes. \u201cI talked to them all,\u201d Dunlop said. \u201c\u2009\u2018You need to think about this, and you need to spread the word. If you\u2019re interested, get your house in order, talk to your spouse and get ready, because we need to save our country.\u2019\u2009\u201dNot only was Trump an awkward fit for a staunch conservative like DeMint, but the Heritage president had strong ties to two of his primary opponents. His PAC had raised close to $600,000 for Marco Rubio\u2019s 2010 Senate campaign, and he and Rubio were both associated with the C Street house, a group residence on Capitol Hill affiliated with the Fellowship Foundation, the nonprofit organization that sponsors the National Prayer Breakfast. Ted Cruz \u2014 to whom DeMint\u2019s PAC had given nearly $1 million for his 2012 Senate run \u2014 had been a featured speaker on DeMint\u2019s \u201cDefund Obamacare\u201d tour. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to punish American companies that export jobs were anathema to Heritage\u2019s 45-year history of support for free trade, not to mention the interests of some of its biggest donors. Even as Trump was gaining momentum, some senior staff members continued to resist the idea of embracing him, arguing that it would damage Heritage\u2019s reputation, but DeMint decided to get out ahead of the rest of his party and work with Trump\u2019s insurgent campaign.DeMint understood better than most what lit up the conservative base; after all, he had spent years stoking its anger at the Republican establishment. At a private dinner on Capitol Hill in January 2016, two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, DeMint was the only one of a group of a dozen conservatives, including Yuval Levin of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard, who predicted that Trump would win the nomination.Trump\u2019s political views were less important than his approach to hiring. With DeMint\u2019s guidance, he could bring in trusted conservatives who supported a Heritage agenda that included opening offshore drilling on federal lands; opposing mandatory labeling of genetically engineered food; reducing regulations on for-profit universities; revoking an Obama executive order on green-energy mandates for federal agencies; phasing out federal subsidies for housing; and opposing marriage equality and nondiscrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. \u201cThe watchword of personnel is: Get people who you want on the bus, and then figure out what seat you want to put them in,\u201d Dunlop said.Later that month, Trump\u2019s campaign lawyer (and future White House counsel) Donald McGahn convened a gathering of conservative leaders at the Capitol Hill offices of his law firm, Jones Day. Only a small group attended: Newt Gingrich, Senator Jeff Sessions, a handful of other sitting lawmakers who were supportive of Trump \u2014 and DeMint. \u201cAt that time,\u201d Gingrich told me, \u201cTrump\u2019s views were so unknown to the average conservative the concern was, is he going to be reliable?\u201d As the conversation evolved, an idea emerged: What if Trump could present to the public a list of Supreme Court nominees? DeMint enthusiastically volunteered to help provide one. When he returned to Heritage\u2019s offices, though, some senior staffers balked. One concern they raised was that it would be counterproductive for Heritage to explicitly endorse possible judicial appointees: Because the think tank was considered to the right of the Republican mainstream, its approval of candidates could make them toxic in the confirmation process. But DeMint was adamant, insisting that this was an opportunity Heritage should not pass up. The head of Heritage\u2019s Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, John Malcolm, ultimately wrote the list in the form of a post for Heritage\u2019s news and commentary website, The Daily Signal. By then, Trump had already singled out Heritage at a news conference, announcing that it was one of the groups he was working with on a Supreme Court list.Feulner, still active at Heritage as a member of its board, was the first from the think tank to join the Trump transition after the Republican National Convention. \u201cAugust 2016, Christie calls, and then candidate Trump calls to confirm: Would I take over the domestic side?\u201d Feulner told me. As he saw it, Trump held even more promise for Heritage than Reagan had. \u201cNo.1, he did clearly want to make very significant changes, and No.2, his views on so many things were not particularly well formed,\u201d Feulner said. \u201cAnd so if he somehow pulled the election off, we thought, wow, we could really make a difference.\u201dYet even as he was drilling further into the Trump team, DeMint was running into trouble inside his own building. Over the summer, complaints about his heavy-handed management style started to reach some members of Heritage\u2019s 22-person board. DeMint and his loyalists rejected the criticisms of his leadership, suggesting that they were the work of Mike Needham, the 36-year-old chief executive of Heritage Action. Needham came from a different world than DeMint. He grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and joined the think tank straight out of Williams College, beginning as Feulner\u2019s research assistant and rising to become his chief of staff. He left in 2007 to work on the presidential campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani and then went on to attend Stanford Business School but returned after he graduated. As DeMint and his allies saw it, Needham was trying to orchestrate a palace coup, turning a handful of isolated complaints about his hiring practices and handling of Heritage\u2019s research into a major case against DeMint as part of his own campaign to take control of the think tank. They knew, too, that Needham and Feulner were close and were convinced that Needham was trying to undermine DeMint with Heritage\u2019s founder.By early November, the tension between DeMint and Needham had escalated, and the senior staff was divided by their respective loyalties. It was just the sort of factionalism that would soon come to define the nascent Trump administration, with its personnel conflicts and firings. As the election approached, it seemed to some at Heritage that DeMint\u2019s future was uncertain. The Republican Party appeared to be headed for defeat and years of soul-searching, which might present a natural occasion for new leadership at the think tank.Corrigan had been in close contact with the Trump campaign for months. Now he told the assembled crowd of about 200 people what Heritage had been doing for the campaign and previewed the opportunities ahead. There were thousands of jobs to fill, and the priority was to fill them with \u201cchange agents,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to personnel decisions, that is the most frequently asked question, even before \u2018Are they qualified?\u2019 \u2018Are they a change agent?\u2019\u2009\u201d In the coming days, employees were encouraged to join the transition and were assured that as long as they were working as volunteers, Heritage could continue to pay their salaries and hold their jobs for them.The Trump transition offices quickly filled with Heritage staff members recruiting and vetting hires for the administration. The upheaval inside the transition caused by Christie\u2019s firing worked to DeMint\u2019s advantage: Pence was an old friend and conservative ally on Capitol Hill. Christie\u2019s departure also opened the way for Rick Dearborn to take control of the daily decision-making. Dearborn, the longtime chief of staff to Jeff Sessions, had already been a strong presence on the transition team. He went back years with Corrigan, who was the director of the Senate\u2019s conservative caucus for nearly a decade before joining Heritage with DeMint. Corrigan had been informally feeding Dearborn names for months.Matthew Buckham, a project administrator in Heritage\u2019s communications department who joined the transition to vet ambassadors and diplomats, told me that he and the rest of Heritage\u2019s staff on the transition tried to put forward every Heritage employee who wanted to work for the administration, whether in policy, administration or management jobs. \u201cAny list we touched we made sure had as many Heritage people as possible,\u201d he said. One of Heritage\u2019s labor economists, James Sherk, an advocate of rolling back labor rights, joined the White House domestic-policy council; another, David Kreutzer, who was a co-author of a Heritage policy paper arguing that \u201cno consensus exists that man-made emissions are the primary driver of global warming,\u201d joined the Environmental Protection Agency. Roger Severino, the director of Heritage\u2019s DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, who has opposed extending civil rights protections to gay, lesbian and transgender people, joined the Department of Health and Human Services to run its Office for Civil Rights. Sean Doocey, a former Heritage employee who had worked at the think tank\u2019s Training and Recruitment Center, joined the Presidential Personnel Office \u2014 the little-known agency responsible for recruiting and vetting appointees for the executive branch \u2014 as its deputy director.In the spring of 2017, just a few months into his tenure, President Trump expressed his gratitude to both DeMint and Heritage in a speech at the National Rifle Association: \u201cThose people have been fantastic; they\u2019ve been real friends.\u201d And yet even in this moment of triumph, DeMint was losing the battle to keep his job. Emboldened by Trump\u2019s victory, he asked for a new contract on the eve of the inauguration. (He earned $1.2 million the previous year.) Heritage\u2019s three-person leadership team \u2014 Barb Van Andel-Gaby, a member of one of the families that founded the multilevel-marketing company Amway; Thomas A. Saunders III, a private-equity executive; and Nersi Nazari, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur \u2014 were noncommittal. Soon after, they came to Washington for a few days to perform their own internal investigation of the personnel problems, interviewing various staff members about DeMint\u2019s leadership.By the time the foundation\u2019s largest donors \u2014 $10,000 or more a year \u2014 gathered in April 2017 for their annual retreat at the Fairmont Grand Del Mar in San Diego, Heritage\u2019s senior management, like that of the administration it was staffing, was consumed by chaos, confusion, resentments and infighting. DeMint, by now, was blaming Feulner as well as Needham; he was certain that Feulner still effectively controlled the board and was turning it against him. Shortly after DeMint and his management team returned to Washington, he was stripped of his power while his severance package was negotiated. Many of the people he had brought in, including Corrigan, James Wallner (a research executive), Wesley Denton (a communications executive) and Buckham, soon left, too. Rumors swirled that Stephen Bannon would be taking over. He was still at the White House at the time, but he was close to Mercer, and it was no secret that Trump was turning on his power-hungry, attention-seeking chief strategist.Amid the upheaval, Saunders, the board\u2019s chairman, issued a statement on the ouster. \u201cHeritage is bigger than any one person,\u201d it read. In his first address to the staff, the think tank\u2019s new interim president, Ed Feulner, assured them that Heritage would continue to be \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s favorite think tank.\u201dJames, who is 69, is an almost total anomaly in the political world: a black female Republican who supports Donald Trump. In her first address to the Heritage staff, she spoke about her difficult childhood in Richmond, Va., with an absentee father and a mother on welfare. The hiring of a black woman as its president seemed like a coup for an institution that has been widely accused of representing only the interests of white men. \u201cShe did not get the job because of her gender or race,\u201d Feulner told me. \u201cShe got it because she\u2019s such an extraordinary individual. My only regret is that she\u2019s not 10 years younger.\u201dIn many respects, James does have the perfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for Heritage. She served under Reagan and George Bush and was the director of the office of personnel management for George W. Bush. Along the way, she worked for several conservative organizations, including Pat Robertson\u2019s Regent University, and served on the board of Focus on the Family, the evangelical group known for its opposition to abortion, premarital sex and gay and transgender rights. In 2005, she did a brief stint with a defense contracting firm whose founder, Mitchell Wade, pleaded guilty a year later to bribing a congressman with more than $1 million in return for favors and earmarks. James went on to start her own nonprofit, the Gloucester Institute, which describes itself as a leadership training center; it offers mentoring and networking programs to black and Latino undergraduate and graduate students. According to Gloucester\u2019s 990 tax form, she earned $50,000 as president of the organization in 2016, the year before she became president of Heritage.James worked on the Trump transition, overseeing the White House\u2019s budget and personnel management offices. In March, on a Politico podcast, she said that she had been eager to join the administration to work on the president\u2019s \u201curban agenda.\u201d She was blocked by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the former \u201cApprentice\u201d villain and director of communications for the White House Office of the Public Liaison, who during the campaign was charged with African-American outreach. \u201cThe way it was described to me is she approached the whole thing like it was \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019\u2009\u201d James said on the podcast. \u201cSo she looked around Washington and said, \u2018O.K., who do I need to get rid of first?\u2019\u2009\u201d (Newman herself was pushed out last year.)I met James, who has short, graying hair and favors colorful blazers, in May in her new Heritage office, which is enormous and looks out at the Capitol. After we settled onto a large, comfortable couch, she described her new job at Heritage as \u201cthe crown jewel\u201d of her career in the conservative movement. I asked James how she thought Trump was doing. \u201cPeople are focused up here on the trouble and all of the noise that you hear in Washington,\u201d she said, gesturing at eye level. \u201cBut down here, the bass notes are strong and loud. There\u2019s a lot of good that is going on, but we are in such a partisan, vitriolic atmosphere in this town right now that very often we overlook the bass notes.\u201dIn recent months, James has applauded Trump\u2019s tax cuts and deregulatory agenda; his crackdown on illegal immigration; his choice of the hard-liner John Bolton as national security adviser; his effort to rescind funding for a variety of federal programs, including the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program; and an executive order that will curtail the amount of time that federal union representatives can spend helping colleagues file claims for workplace grievances, including sexual harassment. Part of her task at Heritage, James told me, will be to expose a more diverse audience to the think tank\u2019s ideology. \u201cIf you talk to anyone about shaping the future of this nation, they will tell you that there are certain demographics that must be touched \u2014 millennials, women and minorities,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I tell people that unless our ideas are reaching those demographics, then we are going to be looking at a shrinking minority view in this country.\u201dA few weeks later, on a rainy morning in Washington, Heritage held a party for the dedication of a new dormitory for its interns, a gift from the family of E.W. Richardson, a World War II bomber pilot who went on to become a successful Ford dealer. Donors ate finger food and drank mimosas under a tent on Heritage\u2019s rooftop. Some wore name tags on their lapels and dresses identifying them by their level of giving; those who had added Heritage to their wills wore an extra ribbon: \u201cLegacy Society.\u201d James was the only person of color I saw in a crowd that easily exceeded 200 people.Forty-five years after its founding, Heritage may finally be the establishment, but its self-image remains fixed in time. It is, as ever, the nation\u2019s last line of defense against the advancing forces of progressivism, perpetually in need of financial reinforcements. Speaking to the gathered group of donors and Heritage staff members, James, standing beside an American flag and a large portrait of Richardson in his flight gear, described the new intern dorm as an expansion of the think tank\u2019s \u201cbase of operations\u201d against what she characterized as a \u201cvery determined and very well-resourced foe. They want to change America into something she was never intended to be. And they might succeed if we don\u2019t fight every single day of our lives.\u201dThe president and his favorite think tank continue to draw closer. Administration officials speak regularly at Heritage and give frequent interviews to The Daily Signal. In April, Pruitt and Attorney General Jeff Sessions were both scheduled to speak at a Heritage donor conference in Palm Beach, Fla. (Sessions, under fire from the president because of the Russia investigation, dropped out.)Even with DeMint gone, Feulner is enjoying unique access to the Trump administration. During one of our conversations, he told me he had recently accompanied the vice president on Air Force Two to Hillsdale College, a Christian stronghold of conservative thought in Michigan. And last year, he was the lone think-tank head invited to a White House dinner for the conservative movement\u2019s \u201cgrass-roots leaders.\u201d He was seated right beside the president. Feulner\u2019s dream had finally been fulfilled. I asked him if he believed the Trump presidency would be transformative for the country. \u201cI think we\u2019re very, very optimistic,\u201d he said.There is still a huge number of vacancies across the administration. At this point in their presidencies, Obama had filled 584 of his politically appointed, Senate-confirmed positions, and George W. Bush had filled 652; Trump has filled just 450. The Presidential Personnel Office was portrayed in a recent Washington Post article as a frat house, with widespread workplace vaping and happy-hour drinking games involving Smirnoff Ice.The turnover rates have also been historic. In March, The New York Times reported that nine of the top 21 White House and cabinet positions have been emptied and refilled at least once; neither Obama nor Bush had lost a single cabinet member by that point in their administrations. Since taking office, Trump has replaced more than half of his 65 most influential advisers, according to a tracker created by the Brookings Institution. Christie recently laid the blame for the turnover on what he described as a \u201cbrutally unprofessional\u201d transition, saying that proper vetting would have caught a lot of Trump\u2019s most problematic appointees. A number of other senior advisers seem to be on shaky ground with the president, and an exodus is anticipated after the November midterm elections.Churn is a central feature of this administration, even for its unofficial staffing agency. Paul Winfree, a Heritage economist who helped draft Trump\u2019s first budget, is back at the think tank. So are Stephen Moore, who worked on the Trump tax cuts; David Kreutzer, who played a key role in dissolving a White House working group that was studying the monetary costs associated with climate-warming carbon dioxide; and Hans von Spakovsky, who helped run the now-defunct voter-fraud commission, which was created to find evidence to support Trump\u2019s baseless claim that millions of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton.In a sense, the transition is still going, and as long as Trump remains in office it may never end. \u201cI get calls from people every day who still want to go in,\u201d Dunlop told me. \u201cOr I\u2019ll hear from the White House, or I\u2019ll run into someone at a reception or over coffee, and I\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019ve got a name for you. I\u2019ll send it along.\u2019\u2009\u201dAn earlier version of this article did not fully identify two employees who left the Heritage Foundation soon after the departure of Jim DeMint, its president. They are James Wallner, who was a research executive, and Wesley Denton, who was a communications executive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Reaches Deal on Migration at Summit, but Details Sketchy", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Italy\u2019s new populist government threatened to block progress on other, uncontroversial issues until the migration text was addressed to its satisfaction, European leaders thrashed out the topic for nine hours before finally reaching an agreement around 5 a.m.While details were sketchy, the leaders agreed in principle, at least, on how to shore up their external borders and create screening centers for migrants, to decide more quickly whether or not they are legitimate refugees.\u201cWe still have a lot of work to do to bridge the different views,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said after the discussions, which a senior European official described as sometimes virulent.The leaders agreed to establish voluntary screening centers on European soil, to ease the burden on countries like Italy, Spain and Greece where migrants first arrive and are registered. They also agreed to study setting up similar centers outside Europe, in North Africa, for example, to screen migrants before they arrive.Ms. Merkel had even more at stake than the Italians, under pressure from within her own government to solve the problem of migrants coming into Germany after having registered in other countries. The Italian concern has been to stop migrants from coming to Europe in the first place.Inside Europe, the proposed centers would house migrants until they are screened, with the idea of deciding their fate more efficiently and sending back those who do not qualify as refugees. But no country has so far volunteered to host such a center.Outside Europe, centers would be designed to reduce the number of migrants who risk the sea voyage to the Continent and to disrupt the black economy of people-smuggling. Those rescued at sea could be returned to those centers for screening, not brought to Europe. But again, it was not clear which African countries might agree to house such platforms, or whether they would be compatible with international law.Addressing the concerns in Germany about registered migrants moving within Europe to try to settle there, the European leaders simply promised to \u201ctake all necessary internal legislative and administrative measures to counter such movements.\u201d The intent is to prevent the setting up of internal borders within the Schengen free-travel area, which could destroy the principle of borderless movement of people and goods.Whether that would be enough to satisfy Ms. Merkel\u2019s critics at home remained to be seen.France was instrumental in trying to broker the agreement with Italy, which said it would block all agreements reached at this summit meeting until its concerns about migration were addressed. Early Friday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that \u201ctoday Italy is no longer alone. We are satisfied.\u201dOne potential hurdle for the deal is the fact that the European Union has no uniform rules or procedures for asylum, making it unclear what rules would be applied in a screening center, whether inside or outside Europe. But setting up any such center would be a significant change from the current system, under which migrants must be screened in the European country where they first arrive and are registered.Before arriving in Brussels, Ms. Merkel warned that the issue of migration could make or break the European Union, delivering a passionate address to her Parliament.\u201cEurope faces many challenges,\u201d said Ms. Merkel. \u201cBut that of migration could become one that determines the fate of the European Union.\u201dThe new Italian government played hardball on Thursday, with Mr. Conte refusing to agree to joint conclusions on issues like digital innovation or defense cooperation until migration was dealt with.Italy has insisted on changing the regulations that govern migration into the European Union, saying that as a country of first landing, it has had enough. Italy has started to turn away ships that rescue migrants from the sea.Immigrants have often delivered economic benefits to the countries taking them in, but they have also upended the politics of the industrialized world \u2014 where the native-born often exaggerate their numbers and their needs.At the same time, Ms. Merkel faces an internal rebellion by Bavarian conservatives over immigration that threatens to bring down her government. Her Bavarian interior minister has warned that he will disobey her and establish a hard border with Austria unless she strikes a deal with European leaders to stem the flow of migrants into Germany.That standoff reflects the fraught politics of migration, with Bavarian conservatives facing a strong challenge from the far-right, anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany in state elections in October.So Ms. Merkel came to Brussels to reach the kind of accord on limiting migration that has slipped the grasp of European Union leaders for years.If she failed to reach an agreement that would allow her to turn back certain groups of migrants at the German border, the Bavarians could quit her government, a move that would most likely put her out of a job after almost 13 years as German leader and usher in months of uncertainty in the European Union\u2019s most influential country.In front of a rowdy Parliament on Thursday, she essentially conflated her own fate with that of the union. Either Europe masters this challenge of migration, she said, and proves to other countries that \u201cwe are guided by values and that we rely on multilateralism, and not unilateralism,\u201d or \u201cno one will believe any more in our value system that made us so strong.\u201dThe president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said before the summit meeting that the leaders should \u201cfocus on the E.U.\u2019s external borders,\u201d including screening centers, since the flow of migrants had slowed. Since 2015, Mr. Tusk said, \u201cwe have managed to stem the migration flow by 96 percent only because we decided to cooperate with third countries and to block illegal migration outside the E.U.\u201dThe alternative, he said, \u201cwould be a chaotically advancing closure of borders \u2014 also within the E.U. \u2014 as well as growing conflict among E.U. member states.\u201dBut given the tough stance on migration being taken by countries like Italy, Austria and Hungary, Mr. Tusk suggested, Europe needed to act. \u201cSome may think I am too tough in my proposals on migration, but trust me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t agree on them then you will see some really tough proposals from some really tough guys.\u201dMs. Merkel agreed, rejecting the idea of unilaterally turning back migrants at the border. Such a move would have ripple effects far beyond Germany, she warned, endangering the European project of border-free travel.Ms. Merkel\u2019s pro-European stance and her decision to open Germany\u2019s borders to more than 1.4 million migrants since 2015 have earned her a reputation as a defender of liberal values, while also making her the main target of far-right and populist forces across the Continent.Her address in Parliament on Thursday was unusually combative, and it was frequently interrupted by heckling from representatives of Alternative for Germany. The noise level was so high at one point that Ms. Merkel stopped and said: \u201cMy God. Really?\u201dIn Brussels, the Hungarian prime minister, Victor Orban, was characteristically harsh.\u201cI think the people really request two things: First is, no more migrants in,\u201d he said. The second, he said, would be the deportation of those who are already in Europe but do not qualify as refugees.\u201cSo that\u2019s what the people want,\u201d Mr. Orban said. \u201cSo I think in order to restore the European democracy, we have to move to that direction.\u201dBut there were words of support for Ms. Merkel from other leaders, including those of Spain and Luxembourg, whose prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said: \u201cIf we have countries saying this and that is a red line, we will never get an agreement. Legal immigration has to be the rule.\u201d\u201cThere are so many people who arrived in different countries and then made their way to Germany,\u201d Mr. Bettel continued. \u201cI understand Germany says, \u2018Why do we have to deal with everything?\u2019\u201dCharles Michel, the prime minister of Belgium, said that the discussion was a \u201cvery important moment\u201d for Europe.\u201cDo we or do we not want to protect the Schengen zone by finding solutions together in a European context to manage the refugees and migrants?\u201d he asked, referring to the system that allows passport-free travel through much of Europe.Steven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Katrin Bennhold from Berlin.

{"Headline": "China Offers to Buy Nearly $70 Billion of American Goods if U.S. Halts Tariffs", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 China offered to purchase nearly $70 billion of energy, agricultural and manufactured products from the United States in the first year of a deal that would require the Trump administration to suspend tariffs on Chinese products, a person familiar with the talks said.The offer, which came during a meeting this weekend in Beijing between Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the Chinese economic adviser Liu He, would go only partway toward President Trump\u2019s initial demand that China reduce its $375.2 billion trade surplus with the United States by $200 billion annually. And it leaves untouched other American requests, including that China allow American companies more access to its markets and end practices that the Trump administration and business executives say force companies to transfer valuable intellectual property.The proposal could fizzle quickly. Chinese officials have said publicly that any agreements would be void if the United States continued with plans to impose tariffs and other restrictions, and American officials have given no indication so far that they intend to halt the tariffs.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, would not comment on whether the Chinese proposal would pass muster with Mr. Trump, saying on Tuesday that \u201cwe\u2019re in the negotiation process\u201d and that \u201cour focus is to make sure we get good deals.\u201dThose plans have led to a bitter turf war within the administration as officials try to reach a deal with China that would allow Mr. Trump to claim victory in a brewing trade dispute.Negotiators like Mr. Ross and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have pushed China to agree to a package of purchases that would benefit American businesses and forestall the possibility of a trade war between the economies. But that approach has drawn ire from hard-liners like Peter Navarro, a trade adviser, and Robert E. Lighthizer, the top trade negotiator, who argue that the White House needs to hold out for bigger concessions from China in terms of reforming its economy and reducing its trade surplus with the United States.The recent round of discussions in Beijing was more narrowly focused on potential Chinese purchases of American products, a goal that has angered some China critics who fear that Mr. Ross and Mr. Mnuchin are sacrificing the bigger concessions by China that many feel are needed. That includes Democrats, who have also pressed Mr. Trump to push China to open its markets and have criticized the president for focusing on the trade deficit at the expense of other goals.Economists have also expressed skepticism about China\u2019s potential to purchase tens of billions of dollars of additional products from the United States, arguing that the American economy is already operating near its full potential. If China does ramp up purchases of energy and agricultural goods, they say, it would simply displace those purchases from other nations, making little lasting impact on the overall trade deficit or the American economy.As that round of talks concluded in mid-May, the White House said that China had committed to buying more agriculture and energy exports, but noted that American officials would travel to China to work out the details of their agreement.The United States had banned the Chinese firm from buying American technology components for seven years as a punishment for violating United States sanctions against Iran and North Korea. The prospect of lifting those sanctions had provoked a backlash from lawmakers across the political spectrum, who saw the issue as a law enforcement matter and ZTE\u2019s expansion in the United States as a potential national security threat.The trade conflict with the Chinese could escalate in coming months, putting at risk multinational businesses that depend on China to source and sell products. China has threatened to retaliate by placing its own tariffs on roughly $50 billion of American products, and Mr. Trump responded by threatening tariffs on an additional $100 billion of Chinese goods.The administration\u2019s efforts to coax China into purchasing more American products may be a peace offering to farmers, who are heavily dependent on exports and have found themselves in the cross hairs of several of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade conflicts, including his push to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement and global steel and aluminum tariffs that have prompted retaliation on American goods.\u201cFarmers have not been doing well for 15 years,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter on Monday. \u201cMexico, Canada, China and others have treated them unfairly. By the time I finish trade talks, that will change. Big trade barriers against U.S. farmers, and other businesses, will finally be broken. Massive trade deficits no longer!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade War and Canadian Pride Mix in Retaliatory Tariffs Against U.S.", "Date": "2018-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 This year on Canada Day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will visit a former Heinz ketchup plant in Ontario and, later Sunday, meet steelworkers in Saskatchewan.\u201cWe\u2019re living in a brand new world,\u201d said Debra Steger, a law professor at the University of Ottawa who is a former senior trade negotiator for Canada and a onetime official at the World Trade Organization. \u201cIt has been pretty messy, and it\u2019s not going to get better soon. We really are in a very difficult time.\u201dAdding to concerns about escalation, Mr. Trudeau and his officials have vowed further action if the White House follows through with threatened duties on Canadian-made autos and auto parts. They are the keystone of Canadian manufacturing, and have been covered by various trade agreements with the United States for more than 50 years. Similarly, Mr. Lighthizer vowed on Tuesday to \u201ctake all necessary actions\u201d against countries retaliating against American trade actions.Like many in Canada, Mr. Trudeau seems at a loss when it comes to Mr. Trump\u2019s motive for turning the United States\u2019 neighbor and largest trading partner into a target.\u201cI\u2019m not in a position to opine on motivations of the president,\u201d he said at a recent news conference. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay focused on the relationship that we\u2019re building, on defending Canada\u2019s interests, on looking for ways to further push the benefits of improving and modernizing Nafta.\u201dBut the plant\u2019s savior, Sam Diab, who is president and chief executive of Highbury Canco, said the trade battle was not all good news. The new Canadian tariffs will also affect the price of steel cans, bottle caps and jar lids he imports from the United States and for which there is no viable alternative source in Canada.More worrying, Mr. Diab said, are the broader implications for the company, which also exports to the United States.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an environment anybody really likes, the uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve operated and succeeded in a free-trade environment, and in a closed market we could probably adapt. It\u2019s this in-between situation \u2014 that\u2019s the problem.\u201dThe list of Canadian tariffs includes aluminum and steel in various forms. But it also targets a wide variety of consumer products from American states that the Canadian government believes are important to Mr. Trump\u2019s political fortunes. For example, chocolate bars, which largely come from Hershey in Pennsylvania, are on the list.For other items, like \u201codoriferous preparations used during religious rites,\u201d the political significance in the United States is unclear.The government said it had created its list to include only products for which alternatives made in Canada or third countries are readily available. Some industries, however, dispute that.Peter Hanna is a regional sales manager in Shawinigan, Quebec, for Regal, a motorboat maker based in Orlando, Fla. He said he met on Tuesday with Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, the international trade minister, to deliver the message that his dealers in Quebec and other Atlantic provinces rely on American companies for 95 percent of their boats and that Canada\u2019s relatively small boatbuilding industry cannot replace that supply. (The Canadian pleasure-boat industry\u2019s trade group estimates that across all categories of boats, it gets 65 percent of what it needs from American builders.)\u201cI made it loud and clear: They can\u2019t supply all of our dealers. It\u2019s impossible,\u201d said Mr. Hanna, who once led a large Canadian boat maker, Doral, that succumbed to the combination of free trade with the United States followed by an economic slump in 1990.Despite the possible effects on his industry, Mr. Hanna backs the government\u2019s decision to retaliate. \u201cIt\u2019s right not to get pushed around,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to pick your spots.\u201dIn addition to the tariffs, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government said on Friday that it had set aside up to 2 billion Canadian dollars (about $1.5 billion) for assistance to the steel and aluminum industries. It will take a variety of forms, including loans, worker retraining and programs to help reduce layoffs.Clifford Sosnow, a trade lawyer in Ottawa who previously worked for the foreign affairs department and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, said it was impossible for Canada to inflict significant economic pain on a neighbor about 10 times its size. He compared the Canada Day tariffs to \u201ca pinprick.\u201dMs. Steger, the law professor, agreed. She added that if the tit-for-tat escalated, Canada would soon run out of products to target without bringing widespread price increases for Canadian consumers \u2014 and potentially a political cost. But its current tariffs, she said, will be amplified by the actions of other countries.The Canada Day retaliation, Mr. Sosnow said, appears largely intended for the home crowd more than for the White House. \u201cThe prime minister needs to be seen to be responding,\u201d he said.But he said it remained unclear to him exactly what Canada\u2019s plans were for ending the tariffs and, more important, reaching a new Nafta deal.And if Mr. Trump takes on the auto industry, sparking another round of retaliation, the threat to Canada\u2019s economy will become even more perilous, Mr. Sosnow said.\u201cThis is a high-stakes game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe run the risk of going back to power-based trade rather than rules-based trade. With power-based trade, smaller economies like Canada will hurt.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And He\u2019s Part of the Trouble.", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, all he needs to do is deliver.\u201cHe won on a knife-edge,\u201d said Ugur Gurses, a former banker who writes for the daily newspaper Hurriyet. \u201cBut now he has in his lap all the problems.\u201dMr. Erdogan is contending with an array of economic troubles, an increasingly disgruntled populace and deteriorating relations with Turkey\u2019s Western allies. Among the many problems Mr. Erdogan faces is one fundamental roadblock: His foreign policy is fighting with his economic needs.The economy is Mr. Erdogan\u2019s most pressing problem, but analysts express doubt that he will be able to perform the necessary surgery and introduce needed austerity measures with municipal elections looming in March 2019.\u201cNow the first challenge is the deterioration of the economy, and he has no means, no perspective to change the course of events,\u201d said Kadri Gursel, a columnist for the newspaper Cumhuriyet, who was imprisoned by Mr. Erdogan for 11 months.After years of strong growth, the economy is languishing in recession, economists say, with rising foreign debt levels, double-digit inflation, the sagging lira and paltry levels of foreign investment, compared with past years. An increasing government role in the economy has led to charges of cronyism and corruption, with critics complaining of insiders becoming fabulously wealthy on government contracts and sweetheart deals.As the election results underscored, Mr. Erdogan still maintains the strong backing of the newly prosperous Islamists who were long marginalized under the secular republic founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk; people who, like Mr. Erdogan, as the historian Soner Cagaptay has written, were \u201cborn on the wrong side of the tracks.\u201dThe transfer of power and wealth to those newcomers over the past 15 years represents a transfer of capital that is permanently changing Turkey, said Bekir Agirdir, director of the polling firm Konda.\u201cThe government subsidizes them and they come up and become so successful,\u201d Mr. Agirdir said of the newcomers. \u201cIt is social and political engineering.\u201dAnd while ordinary Turkish citizens are hurting financially, they evidently still trust Mr. Erdogan. Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States said in an interview, \u201cThere is this worry that, \u2018What would happen if Erdogan goes?\u2019 \u201d\u201cThe economy is suffering, there is an issue of performance in some areas, but those were not reflected in the vote,\u201d he added.Economists say Mr. Erdogan needs to cut public spending, including expensive subsidies for gasoline and electricity. Turkey borrowed heavily in recent years on international markets, and now faces a bill of $250 billion a year to finance the debt and the country\u2019s current account, which is also deteriorating. This could force it to seek help from the International Monetary Fund.But few say they think he will take the necessary measures. \u201cErdogan must do a surgical operation on the economy,\u201d Mr. Gurses, the Hurriyet correspondent, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will be able to do it since municipal elections are coming in March 2019, but Turkey cannot sustain the situation any longer.\u201d\u201cThe Turkish economy cannot stay on hold,\u201d he added.In light of the growing economic gloom, it would seemingly behoove Mr. Erdogan to moderate his foreign policy, dialing back the anti-Western policies and language. But he comes across as a prideful man and seems reluctant to back down, especially now that he is relying to some extent on the Nationalist Movement Party, or M.H.P., which preserved Mr. Erdogan\u2019s majority in the Parliament.The leader of that party, Devlet Bahceli, has made it clear that he will demand concessions for his support, and that he will push an agenda that is anti-Syrian, anti-Kurd and anti-Western, at least rhetorically. He has indicated he would not agree to Mr. Erdogan reaching out to any of the opposition parties after the election.Mr. Bahceli\u2019s party is strongly opposed to the presence of over three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, and Mr. Bahceli has said he will push for policies to make them return home. Mr. Bahceli has also supported further operations against Kurdish militants inside Turkey and in neighboring Iraq and Syria.On that issue, Mr. Erdogan promised in his victory speech that he would act decisively against terrorist organizations and work toward liberating more Syrian land from Kurdish militants so that Syrian refugees in Turkey could return home.That is likely to lead to more demands from Turkey for the United States to end its cooperation with Kurdish militias in Syria that it has been using in the fight against the Islamic State.And it bodes ill for the Kurdish minority in Turkey. Even as the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party won representation in the Parliament, crossing the 10 percent threshold, nine party members from the last Parliament remain in jail along with dozens of local political officials and student activists.For now, Turkey\u2019s Western allies seem prepared to give Mr. Erdogan the benefit of the doubt. Going into the NATO summit next month, \u201cat least there will be clarity about the political situation in Turkey,\u201d said Amanda Sloat, who dealt with the country for the State Department during the Obama administration.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s warming relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia remain a potential point of contention, particularly the negotiations with Russia over the S-400 air defense system, problematic for a NATO member.But the Trump administration will not regard the sale as complete until it \u201cphysically takes place,\u201d Ms. Sloat said, and the Turks emphasize that they are also negotiating with an Italian-French military consortium.The NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has already congratulated Mr. Erdogan on his victory, and Ms. Sloat said she expected Washington quickly to follow suit.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s drift toward authoritarianism so strained relations with Europe that he was not welcomed in any European country to campaign among Turkish expatriates, except in Bosnia. And the process for Turkey to become a member of the European Union is at a standstill.Nevertheless, Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, said that while the state of Turkey\u2019s democracy had to improve, Mr. Erdogan should be given the chance to do that. At a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, she also said that the issues with Turkey\u2019s large Kurdish minority and the country\u2019s economic development were \u201chuge challenges.\u201dAnalysts held out the meager hope that despite an unfair campaign, Turks did vote freely and enthusiastically on Sunday. \u201cWith a turnout of more than 90 percent, and the very high mobilization of the opposition, Turkish society still holds its dynamism,\u201d Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. \u201cIt gives hope for the future.\u201dSteven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

Murphy, who took a brief break from a budget standoff.\u201cThe budget does take priority, let there be no doubt about it,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, adding that he remained confident that a budget deal would be made in time for the end of the World Cup. \u201cI still remain optimistic that you\u2019ll be watching soccer on June 30.\u201dMr. Murphy and Mr. Costa watched the game at Sport Club Portugu\u00eas in Newark, where about 200 fans, fueled by liters of sangria, pints of Portuguese lager and plates of chouri\u00e7o, a Portuguese sausage, cheered raucously behind the politicians assembled in the front row.The governor was noticeably excited as he grabbed a red and green Portugal scarf and draped it around his neck, settling next to Mr. Costa, who was gesticulating with the same exasperated extended arm of a soccer fan whose team just blew a chance, or the same wincing grimace when the opposing team scores.It is a bit of a trope in politics to turn a passion into a political asset, though nothing helps offset the whiff of pandering like a verifiable devotion that brings a sense of authenticity.Chris Christie had Bruce Springsteen. Mr. Murphy has soccer.Never quite the player \u2014 the governor stopped in ninth grade, admitting simply that \u201cI was not good\u201d \u2014 he nevertheless retained an adoration for the game. He is the majority owner of Sky Blue FC, a professional women\u2019s team; a former board member of the U.S. Soccer Foundation; and the father of four soccer players, including his eldest son, who played at Tufts University. Mr. Murphy also attended some 2006 World Cup matches in Germany, and he has been to more than 100 professional matches in Europe.When Mr. Murphy was a newly appointed ambassador to Germany, with no elected or political experience besides serving as finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee, he turned to soccer to help forge relationships. Almost every week, he found himself in the stands at a professional match.\u201cAngela Merkel is a big soccer fan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was something we knew we could find common ground in. When you\u2019re overseas, the assumption is that the American isn\u2019t going to be a deep, well-versed fan.\u201dMr. Costa was clearly an equal, if not more exuberant, soccer fanatic. Just before the start of the match, he held up his smartphone, attempting to take a selfie with the crowd, which erupted into syncopated chants \u2014 \u201cPor-tu-gal! Por-tu-gal!\u201d \u2014 with arms extended.\u201cI\u2019ve come back to share the pleasure and the suffering of this game with our community,\u201d Mr. Costa said at halftime. (At that moment it was pleasure, since Portugal led, 2-1.) He said he would be heading to Russia to watch Portugal\u2019s third match in the first round, but had decided to come to Newark for the first.It was the first time Mr. Murphy had hosted a foreign head of government in New Jersey, and the two talked the requisite business. After all, this was meant to be about work and not merely a chance for two soccer die-hards to watch one of the most anticipated of the early World Cup matches.They talked about potential trade (there was a discussion about how they could expand trade in the \u201clogistics economy,\u201d Mr. Murphy said). They talked politics (\u201che asked me my sense of the midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Murphy said). And they talked about President Trump (Mr. Costa said he would not be visiting the White House).But, mostly, they talked soccer.\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think if I wanted to talk about business we could get much done,\u201d Mr. Murphy said with a laugh as he glanced over at a transfixed Mr. Costa, who was leaning on one knee and nervously chewing on his index finger as Spain repeatedly threatened to score midway through the second half.Then disaster struck. Nacho Fernandez, a defender on Spain\u2019s team, unleashed a long shot from about 25 yards that caromed off the post and into the net, giving Spain a late 3-2 lead. (The match ended in a 3-3 tie.)\u201cGoalie had no chance,\u201d Mr. Costa said to Mr. Murphy, sighing and leaning far back in his chair.\u201cNo chance,\u201d Mr. Murphy repeated. He glanced over at his three sons a few seats away, eyebrows raised and clearly impressed by the skillful volley.He sat back in his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful game.\u201d\u201cI also said to them, \u2018Hey, listen, no one is asking me to say this, don\u2019t worry about the politics in America,\u2019\u201d he recalled, adding later that the Trump administration should be credited for its efforts to win the World Cup. \u201cWhen it comes to soccer and this tournament, we\u2019ll figure this out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Greece Ends a Decade of Bailouts, Problems Linger for Europe", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEuropean Union officials will unveil a blueprint in Brussels on Thursday to help the beleaguered country stand on its own once it comes off its third financial bailout in August. They have heralded Greece\u2019s revival, and pointed to the closing of its bailout as a symbolic end to a ruinous financial crisis.Although European leaders are marking the country\u2019s apparent success, new problems are lurking elsewhere in the region, putting pressure on Greece\u2019s still fragile economy. Britain is plowing ahead with its withdrawal from the European Union. A trade war with the United States appears in the offing. The election of an anti-austerity government in Italy has revived fears about the euro, and jittery financial markets are again starting to target the currency union\u2019s weakest links.\u201cThe eurozone is most definitely not out of danger,\u201d said Simon Tilford, chief economist for the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in London. European governments still have not agreed to reforms that would insulate the eurozone economy if a new crisis arises, whether in Italy, Greece or over other issues like trade. \u201cIf the recovery peters out or there is shock of some kind,\u201d he said, \u201cthe outlook will be much darker.\u201dFew places know tumult better than Greece. It had to impose capital controls in 2015, as millions of people protested in the streets. Twice, it nearly crashed out of the euro. The economy shrank significantly, joblessness skyrocketed and many were driven into poverty. The country has had to rely on three bailouts since 2010, totaling 320 billion euros, or about $375 billion, overall.While Athens will no longer officially depend on other people\u2019s money, it faces an uphill battle to revive credibility in financial markets and restore growth.Greece\u2019s debt has ballooned to 180 percent of economic output \u2014 the largest in the eurozone. Though the economy is expanding, it is still only three-quarters of its pre-crisis size. And the governments, banks and institutions to whom Greece still owes staggering sums are bent on getting their money back, a feat that they say will require them to look over Athens\u2019 shoulder for years to come.\u201cGreece\u2019s debt has actually become too big to fail, and too big to bail out again,\u201d said Jens Bastian, a financial consultant in Athens and a former member of the European Commission\u2019s task force on Greece. \u201cThe most important thing is that the creditors declare Greek debt sustainable, otherwise financial markets will take notice.\u201dThe issue is particularly pressing because the recent tumult in Italy has shown that the euro\u2019s problems have not been laid to rest. After Italy formed a new anti-euro government last month, investors punished Greece\u2019s bond yields, a measure of creditworthiness. Officials in Athens are cleareyed on the impact that Italy has on perceptions of their own recovery.Greece is the last country to exit financial bailouts extended by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 known as the troika of lenders. The rescues were intended to prevent the 19-country euro area from breaking apart when Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis started in 2010.Greece remains weak, a point not lost on the commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, and the I.M.F. They are expected to require Athens to submit to a surveillance program and report four times a year on its finances and the economy.To play it safe, Greece won\u2019t start selling bonds until well after it exits the bailout. Instead, the government, which is being advised by Paris-based Rothschild & Company, will pick a moment in the next two years when market conditions seem favorable. A cash buffer of up to \u20ac18 billion, funded by creditors, may help Greece secure the liquidity it needs in the meantime.Much also depends on how Greece\u2019s recovery unfolds. The economy has expanded modestly since last summer, and protests are now fewer and farther between as glimmers of a rebound emerge. In Athens and on the sunny Greek islands, tourists are packing hotels, bars and tavernas. Chinese and Russian investors are plonking money down on discounted residential and commercial real estate. Exports are rising, mainly on the back of refined oil products.As part of his growth plan, Mr. Tsipras has vowed to reverse some of the harshest austerity after August. He wants to raise the minimum wage and possibly restore unions\u2019 collective bargaining power, which was cut under the terms of the bailouts.Throughout, Greece\u2019s creditors will be watching to make sure it doesn\u2019t backslide.\u201cAs long,\u201d Mr. Regling added, \u201cas it sticks to the agreed economic reforms even after the end of the third memorandum.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans, Don\u2019t Let Trump Bully You on Tariffs", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Ikenson\u00a0researches international trade and investment policy.For several months, President Trump has been vandalizing the global economy and subverting the rules of international trade with his wrecking ball of tariff indiscretions. Finally, someone in Congress is doing something to stop this menace. Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, introduced legislation on Wednesday that takes back some of the authority President Trump has been abusing under the guise of protecting national security.Mr. Corker, who is retiring, attracted six Republican co-sponsors for the bill, which would amend the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to require the president to get approval from Congress for any tariffs proposed on national security grounds. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he would not allow the legislation to come to the floor as a stand-alone bill. House Speaker Paul Ryan seems similarly uninterested in a bill likely to be vetoed by Mr. Trump. \u201cYou would have to pass a law that he would want to sign into law,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cYou can do the math on that.\u201dWhy don\u2019t the president\u2019s trade transgressions elicit meaningful resistance from party leadership? His trade views are disdainful of freedom and informed by economic fallacies, yet Republican leaders have watched quietly from the sidelines as Mr. Trump misappropriates his authorities to disrupt global supply chains, inflict pain on American trade partners, generate enormous amounts of domestic collateral damage and make the United States an international scofflaw.The United States Constitution vests authority in Congress to collect duties and to \u201cregulate commerce with foreign nations.\u201d But over the course of the 20th century, Congress delegated some of its authority to the president. In most cases, the statutes giving the executive branch the authority to raise tariffs require that certain conditions be met and that any actions taken be subject to limitations, as well as judicial review.President Trump has found a way to weaponize these statutes to advance his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. Since taking office, he has initiated six investigations under three highly contentious laws. Five of those investigations \u2014 on steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panel components and Chinese technology products \u2014 have led to the president imposing or announcing tariffs on imports of more than 1,500 products valued at about $100 billion. A new investigation of whether imports of automobiles and parts constitute a national security threat could raise the value of sanctioned imports to $400 billion. Factoring in the likelihood of retaliation against American exporters, about 20 percent of total goods trade could find itself in the cross hairs by year\u2019s end.For more than 80 years going back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, American presidents viewed trade as a win-win proposition, fostering mutual economic growth and better relations among nations. Those presidents supported the rules and institutions that helped reduce protectionism and made trade more affordable, seamless and predictable. Between 1947 and 2006, average global tariffs fell to 4 percent from 40 percent in developed countries, trade flourished, and economies expanded rapidly.Mr. Trump\u2019s actions risk reversing these gains. He has invoked laws that were passed under the assumption that the president, reflecting a broader national consensus, would always be more circumspect and less likely to impulsively raise tariffs than a parochially minded Congress. Lawmakers failed to contemplate the possibility of a president as cavalier about the consequences of protectionism and as impervious to the lessons of history as Mr. Trump.Last year, the excuse for the Republican leadership\u2019s acquiescence to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade assault was their desire for tax and regulatory reform. Done. Then the excuse was that opposing Mr. Trump on trade would invite a primary election challenge. With three months to go until the last state primaries, that concern is becoming moot. Loyalty to the president over the Constitution speaks volumes about a party that was once committed to free markets and the rule of law.In fairness, a few Republican senators who aren\u2019t retiring have shown some courage. Senator Mike Lee of Utah has proposed legislation that would effectively bring back to Congress most of the authorities it delegated to the executive over the years by requiring votes before any presidential trade proclamations can take effect. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is exploring how to give more legal weight to the arguments and concerns of American companies adversely affected by tariffs.Mr. McConnell and Mr. Ryan have done nothing. At a minimum, they should be whipping up support for Mr. Corker\u2019s bill to make sure they have two-thirds of both chambers ready to override Mr. Trump\u2019s inevitable veto.Republican leadership should also introduce \u201csense of the House\u201d and \u201csense of the Senate\u201d resolutions making clear that each chamber values the relationships America has with its allies and will work to repair and strengthen them. These measures are a promise to the American people and a signal to our allies that Congress will continue to support the global trading system and its rules and institutions, and that it will do all that is in its power to prevent the president from continuing to trample on both Republican and republican principles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harley-Davidson, Blaming E.U. Tariffs, Will Move Some Production Out of U.S.", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump pursues a protectionist trade policy, he has pointed repeatedly to Harley-Davidson, the iconic American motorcycle manufacturer, as a company that will ultimately benefit.Instead, it is getting caught in the crossfire.The Wisconsin company said on Monday it would shift some production of its bikes overseas to avoid stiff retaliatory tariffs imposed by the European Union in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade measures. The company said the move \u201cis not the company\u2019s preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the E.U. and maintain a viable business in Europe.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s trade war is beginning to ripple through the United States economy as companies struggle with a cascade of tariffs here and abroad. While Mr. Trump says his trade policy is aimed at reviving domestic manufacturing, Harley-Davidson\u2019s move shows how the White House approach could backfire as American companies increasingly rely on overseas markets for materials, production and sales.The White House is waging several trade wars at once, engaging in fights with China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, which have each responded with their own retaliatory measures. The trade spats have triggered a range of unintended consequences, including a profit warning last week by Daimler, which blamed retaliatory Chinese tariffs for a slump in the sales of the S.U.V.s it builds in Tuscaloosa, Ala.With United States sales slowing and Europe an increasingly vital market, the company said it would shift production to its overseas facilities to avoid raising costs.Mr. Trump has frequently championed the company as a success story in domestic manufacturing. Soon after taking office in 2017, Mr. Trump hosted Harley-Davidson executives at the White House, where he called the firm a \u201ctrue American icon\u201d and thanked it \u201cfor building things in America.\u201dHarley-Davidson did not specify how many jobs it might shift to its overseas facilities as it ratchets up European production, and a spokesman for the company said it was \u201cstill evaluating\u201d the need for job cuts in the United States. The company has been consolidating its United States operations, eliminating hundreds of jobs in the process.Shares of Harley-Davidson fell nearly 6 percent in afternoon trading.But that was before Mr. Trump followed through on his plans to impose tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, a move he says will force other countries to lower their trade barriers. So far, the opposite has happened, as the European Union, Mexico and Canada respond with their own levies, many of which are aimed at products from politically important states that supported Mr. Trump, like Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said on Monday that Harley-Davidson\u2019s decision was evidence that raising trade barriers was a bad idea.\u201cThis is further proof of the harm from unilateral tariffs,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThe best way to help American workers, consumers and manufacturers is to open new markets for them, not to raise barriers to our own market.\u201dChad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that he expected more companies to follow Harley-Davidson\u2019s lead as they wrestled with higher production costs from tariffs on raw metals and levies on the finished products they sell overseas.\u201cThis is incredibly self-defeating,\u201d Mr. Bown said. \u201cThere may be some increased domestic production of aluminum and steel because of the tariffs, but now there is going to be less motorcycle production in the United States for exports.\u201dHe added: \u201cI think we can expect to see this same kind of activity every time that President Trump tries to impose new tariffs.\u201dA labor union representing Harley-Davidson employees condemned the move on Monday and accused the company of seizing on Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policy as an excuse to move jobs offshore.\u201cHarley-Davidson\u2019s announcement today is the latest slap in the face to the loyal, highly skilled work force that made Harley an iconic American brand,\u201d said Robert Martinez Jr., the international president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. \u201cThis latest move is in keeping with Harley\u2019s past decisions to open plants outside of North America.\u201dSharon Zackfia, an analyst with William Blair, estimated that fewer than 10 percent of Harley-Davidson\u2019s motorcycles were manufactured abroad. She said that it was hard to predict what the shift might mean in terms of lost jobs, but that the company would be under pressure to spur more domestic demand with its new lines of motorcycles to keep workers at its American plants busy.The best solution, she said, would be for a truce to be called to avert the trade war.\u201cUltimately everyone is hoping that these tariffs or trade wars are transitory, that what happened can be reversed,\u201d Ms. Zackfia said.At the White House press briefing on Monday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, rejected the idea that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies were hurting American businesses and blamed the European Union for punishing American workers with its \u201cunfair trade practices.\u201dAnd Mr. Trump has shown no signs that he will back down. In a tweet on Sunday, he threatened even more tariffs, saying the United States would retaliate \u201cwith more than Reciprocity\u201d if \u201cartificial\u201d trade barriers were not removed.Amie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For All His Deals, Trump Has Never Faced an Adversary Like Kim Jong-un", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisSINGAPORE \u2014 President Trump has imagined himself at the center of high-stakes nuclear negotiations since at least the mid-1980s, when he tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade the Reagan administration that it needed a New York real estate deal maker to lead arms-control talks with the Soviet Union.When, in 1989, he ran into the man who filled that job for President George H.W. Bush, he had a bit of negotiating advice: Arrive late, poke your finger into your adversary\u2019s chest and swear at him with a vulgar insult, he told Richard R. Burt.Now, Mr. Trump finally has a nuclear negotiation of his own to conduct, not with the Russians, but with a North Korean leader half his age, Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s volatile, repressive leader.Mr. Trump has arrived in Singapore bringing offers of a peace treaty, an American diplomatic presence in Pyongyang and economic aid, including burger joints in the North, rather than jabs and threats.And for all his boasts about his deal-making prowess, Mr. Trump has never been in a face-off with an adversary like this one, a ruthless dictator who has imprisoned huge numbers of his citizens in brutal gulags and summarily executed or assassinated challengers.He has also never been in a negotiation with the risks of failure so stark.Get the Morning Briefing in your inbox. What you need to know to start your day, each weekday morning.Neither has Mr. Kim, who, until this year, had never met with another world leader nor left his country as head of state. He will be surrounded, however, by officials who have worn down the United States in one stalemate after another for decades.Both his father and grandfather agreed, as far back as 1994, to trade away their country\u2019s atomic ambitions for energy, aid and the North\u2019s reintegration with the world. All those agreements started with immense promise, and ultimately failed.How Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim \u2014 both thin-skinned and eager never to show weakness \u2014 will interact is the great drama of the summit meeting.Over the past year, to gain leverage, they have both shown themselves adherents of the \u201cmadman\u201d theory of negotiation, expressing a willingness to take extreme action to get what they want.Despite all the bellicose rhetoric, including the exchange of personal insults, both men seem determined to declare the encounter a success, no matter how vague the outcome.Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim are heavily invested at home in declaring a positive result, reached on their terms, even if the details are left to others.Most experts believe that standard is unattainable in the case of North Korea, and that insisting on it sets up the Trump administration for failure. But Mr. Pompeo has repeatedly doubled down on this objective, as recently as Friday, and so it has become the only measure of success.And as this negotiation plays out, attaining that goal is pretty much the only way that Mr. Trump can plausibly claim he got more out of North Korea than President Barack Obama got out of Iran.For Mr. Trump, the looming question now is whether his bet that Mr. Kim wants economic development more than nuclear weapons is right.\u201cI understand why the administration is offering so many carrots, but I\u2019m afraid Trump thinks Kim is a businessman,\u201d said Jung H. Pak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who oversaw North Korea analysis for United States intelligence agencies until a year ago.\u201cWhat he\u2019s forgetting is that Kim isn\u2019t looking for wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has all the wealth in the country. He\u2019s looking for legitimacy.\u201dAnd Mr. Kim is on his way to obtaining that stature as a global statesman, having met twice now with the presidents of China and South Korea. At 9 a.m. Tuesday in Singapore, he can add Mr. Trump to his list.Some of those who have prepared Mr. Trump for dealing with Korea, who insisted on anonymity to speak about their briefings with the president, say they worry that he is so supremely confident in his negotiating skills that he has eschewed detailed briefings on how Mr. Kim thinks about the world.When Mr. Trump said over the weekend that he would know \u201cin one minute\u201d after talking with Mr. Kim whether the North Korean was ready to denuclearize, it was a declaration that negotiating instinct, rather than deep study of the topic, was the way to success.\u201cJust my touch, my feel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201dThe North Koreans have their own style of negotiating, too. When the United States was discussing an armistice to halt the 1950-53 Korean War, the chief North Korean delegate embarrassed his American counterpart by showing up for talks in the American ambassador\u2019s car \u2014 which his invading troops had seized as they rampaged through Seoul at the war\u2019s start.The North Koreans had also secretly sawed several inches off the American delegate\u2019s chair so their negotiator could look down on him during the haggling.None of that gamesmanship is likely to happen Tuesday. But the opening minute may say a lot.When Mr. Kim met the president of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, at the Demilitarized Zone in late April, he took his hand and guided him over into North Korean territory, an unexpected power play. There will be no equivalent border on Tuesday, but Mr. Kim will surely be looking to use whatever edge he can get.And he has two primary sources of leverage: his newly acquired capabilities to put San Francisco, and maybe Chicago, within reach of his nuclear weapons, and North Korea\u2019s longstanding ability to destroy Seoul with conventional artillery arrayed along the Demilitarized Zone.While Mr. Kim may see utility in giving up some of those capabilities in return for economic benefits, he knows his nuclear arsenal is his best bet to stay in power.The question is how Mr. Trump broadens his repertoire of incentives to Mr. Kim that go beyond the economy.He could dangle the withdrawal of tens of thousands of American forces in the South, whose presence he has long argued should be ended anyway because of overextended American defense commitments and the South\u2019s trade surplus.He could volunteer to keep American bombers and nuclear-capable submarines and ships from brandishing their weapons on visits to the South \u2014 knowing that if needed, in the most extreme nuclear emergency, an American missile could hit the North from Nebraska.But each side faces the issue of how much it can trust the other.The few South Korean officials, including Mr. Moon, who have met with Mr. Kim say they have all come away with a conviction that the North\u2019s leader is sincere in his commitment to strike a deal and that he has a broader vision of his security than his father did.\u201cChairman Kim once again clearly expressed his firm commitment to a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Mr. Moon declared after his second meeting with Mr. Kim last month.South Korea\u2019s president added, \u201cWhat is not so clear to him is how firmly he can trust the United States\u2019 commitment to ending hostile relations and providing security guarantees for his government should it denuclearize.\u201dRegardless of the outcome of the Singapore meeting, Mr. Kim has already won a lot. Becoming the first North Korean leader to meet with a sitting American president, Mr. Kim has proved to his people that he is a force the Americans have to reckon with.That may be enough, at least for now.Advertisement"}

Look at eBay", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThere was a time when eBay was practically synonymous with buying and selling things online. Now it\u2019s surprisingly easy to forget that it exists, until you need to buy something you can\u2019t find anywhere else or clear some space in the attic. Or until someone like Elon Musk, made fabulously wealthy when PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002, muscles his way back into your consciousness by, for example, launching rockets into space or burrowing tunnels under major American cities. Where did he come from, exactly? As with a surprising number of tech heavyweights, the answer is complicated, but it runs through eBay.None of this is to say that eBay has gone away \u2014 in 2017, more merchandise changed hands over the platform than in any earlier year. It\u2019s just ancient in tech terms. It went public in 1998. But perhaps more than any other tech giant of its era \u2014 excluding Amazon \u2014 eBay has shaped the tech industry of 2018. Depending on how you look at it, this is an assignation of credit or blame. EBay\u2019s influence can be felt in both trivial and fundamental ways in companies like Facebook, Google and Uber.EBay is a platform that connects buyers and sellers. It does not itself sell goods; it lists and sorts and processes, providing shelves for its users\u2019 inventory and aisles for their prospective customers. It mediates as little as possible, and it takes a cut. Its problems, in the early days, felt new, at least at eBay\u2019s scale: managing disputes among significant numbers of users, dealing with bad actors of various sorts, addressing scams and fakes, establishing not just a framework for mass human interaction but systems through which to codify trust and resolve conflict.To its credit, eBay has ameliorated many of its problems, through public trial and error, over the course of nearly two decades. \u201cAll the linchpins on which modern platforms rely, at least at a very high level, eBay pioneered,\u201d says Andrei Hagiu, a visiting associate professor at M.I.T. and a longtime researcher of online platforms. \u201cWe use it in almost every paper we do.\u201d EBay, in obvious and subtle ways, has served as a model well beyond the world of commerce, inspiring the systems that play host to discourse, media, culture and communication online. It was among the first true megaplatforms \u2014 the sort that establishes itself as something like online infrastructure. And it may be, to date, the last one we truly understand.This basic approach to seller vetting has been adopted, and adapted, for much wider use, often with far less remove. In 2001, an eBay user might have given an eBay seller a low rating for an unsatisfactory packaging job; in 2018, an Uber driver might be dinged if a rider doesn\u2019t like his personality or choice of music. Facebook recently began ranking publishers by trustworthiness, based on feedback from users. Upon discovering a problem, a platform company\u2019s first instinct is to find a way to expose it to the wisdom of a market, or at least the will of a crowd.EBay users\u2019 participation in the site\u2019s governance is best understood as large-scale offloading of labor, and is basically limited to snitching on one another; users have some recourse against one another and somewhat less against the site itself. That imbalance doesn\u2019t bother us because eBay is eBay. \u201cIt\u2019s a transactional platform; the transaction is very clear to both sides,\u201d Hagiu says. \u201cBy and large, buyers and sellers are aligned on eBay.\u201d A seller banned for counterfeit sunglasses hasn\u2019t lost any rights, just his ability to use eBay. Crucially, to most ears, a scammer\u2019s claims to the contrary would sound ridiculous.But quite often it\u2019s managed like one, because in many ways, that\u2019s exactly what it is: a giant, multisided marketplace for buying and selling, in which the largest party \u2014 the users \u2014 doesn\u2019t do the buying or the selling. A social network\u2019s profitable transactions involve everyone but the users. Ad rates are even determined, in many cases, by auction. If eBay is a machine for finding the right price for a pair of shoes, Facebook \u2014 behind the veneer of enabling human connection \u2014 is a machine for discovering the right price for a pair of eyeballs. Your eyeballs.When the biggest platforms seem to be flailing or punting on problems, it\u2019s often because they\u2019re trying to address broad social issues with market solutions. They\u2019re rediscovering, at scale and at great expense to their users, the ways in which a society is more than a bazaar, and the pitfalls of allowing human attention to be sold and resold as a commodity. If a platform is addressing a collective problem in a maddeningly strange way, consider that it might see itself, or only know to govern itself, like an eBay. If it can\u2019t keep bad actors from using the service to exploit other users, that\u2019s because it\u2019s modeled after a system in which finding the highest bidder \u2014 or the biggest sucker \u2014 is gamely understood to be the point.There are more lessons for the new internet to learn from the old, and eBay\u2019s more recent trajectory might likewise give us clues about where its successors will go next. EBay was once a world-beating company, destined to totally remake commerce. While its legacy is powerful, it has, over the years, discovered its limits. Amazon, not eBay, is now most synonymous with online shopping. The site has also undergone some more fundamental changes. Auctions, for example, have become less popular over time, as sellers and buyers have favored the site\u2019s other buying styles, with fixed or suggested prices. And in many categories, large sellers have become entrenched, functioning more like stores themselves than desperate participants in a giant open-air market. EBay\u2019s final lesson to the next generation of platforms is that nothing is inevitable. Or lasts forever.Even still, eBay and PayPal\u2019s alumni are now immensely wealthy and unusually influential, and are using that power to reshape the world around them: Musk, with his electric cars and rockets and flamethrowers; Pierre Omidyar, with his investments and media ventures; Peter Thiel \u2014 an early Facebook investor and board member \u2014 with his funding of lawsuits against media companies and his eclectic and severe right-wing politics. It is worth considering what sort of initiatives might be spawned by the beneficiaries of today\u2019s much larger platform companies. EBay invited us onto an auction floor and dared us to compete with one another; millions did. Social-media companies found a more lucrative approach, with an even bigger payoff, by building the auction floor right under our feet.John Herrman is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Makes a Risky Bet on Banks", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.That banks can\u2019t be completely trusted to judge the risks they take was a painful lesson regulators learned from the Great Recession. Or so it seemed.Under the rule, in force since 2015, any security held for less than 60 days is deemed a proprietary trade \u2014 speculation with the bank\u2019s accounts. More important, banks had to demonstrate to regulators that such trades were for permitted purposes and were not the product of some clever trader\u2019s hunt for enhanced returns.In other words, trust them, they\u2019re risk-taking experts.There\u2019s no question that the banks have had to function within a more cumbersome regulatory harness under Dodd-Frank. Including the Fed, five agencies are involved in enforcing Dodd-Frank and its Volcker component: the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. And all must approve the proposed revision.That\u2019s a sea of bureaucracy, but the scope of the damage committed by financial institutions a decade ago \u2014 consider the hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts \u2014 required a vigorous response. It still does. And there\u2019s no good reason to end it.If banks are overly burdened by this regulatory load, it\u2019s not apparent in their robust results.Yet they have successfully argued that the rule has restricted liquidity, and choked their ability to trade in complex products such as derivatives, which are often used by banks and their clients to offset risk.When markets got more volatile earlier this year, though, there seemed to be more than adequate liquidity available. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a financial services firm, reported that revenues from stock trades increased 37.5 percent for the median American bank in the first quarter of 2018.\u201cTotal revenue for the U.S. banks was the highest since 2009,\u201d KBW noted.Mr. Volcker, a truly wise man who conquered rampant inflation as Fed chairman from 1979 to 1987, said he had faith that proprietary trading would still be amply regulated and \u201cthe final rule will strongly maintain that position by, as intended, facilitating its practical application.\u201dForgive us for being less trusting, Mr. Chairman. There\u2019s a saying that the time to fix a leaky roof is when the sun is shining. And our economy is, if not shining, certainly sunny. The fear is that, when it comes to our financial system, both our Congress and our regulators are now loosening the shingles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Data Has Done to Capitalism", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I\u2019m regularly frustrated by the process of searching for hotel accommodations for my family of five. We know what we want: a basic suite, like at a Residence Inn, with four beds, two bedrooms and a bathroom off the common area. But we struggle to find it, because hotel search engines make it surprisingly difficult to figure out the specifications of rooms.Lacking that information, I sometimes end up calling a hotel reservations agent, who typically can\u2019t tell me much more than I can read online. Then I go back to the search engine, make a decision based on price and hope for the best. If someone \u2014 either a hotel chain or an aggregator \u2014 built a better search engine, I would happily use it. I would also be willing to pay a bit more for the kind of room my family wants, rather than shopping almost exclusively by price.After reading this new book by Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Thomas Ramge, \u201cReinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data,\u201d I now have a name for what I\u2019m looking for: a data-rich market. And I\u2019m optimistic that it will one day come to the hotel business. Data-rich markets are sweeping across the global economy. \u201cUntil recently, communicating such rich information in markets was difficult and costly. So we used a workaround and condensed all of this information into a single metric: price,\u201d they write. \u201cIn data-rich markets, we no longer have to condense our preferences into price and can abandon the oversimplification that was necessary because of communicative and cognitive limits.\u201dAmazon, with its many product specifications and customer reviews, is often a data-rich market. So are Spotify, Netflix, Lyft, StubHub, Rent the Runway, Tinder and Airbnb (which provides a much better search for lodging than hotels do). These markets aren\u2019t just about first-world convenience, either. In the Indian state of Kerala, among other places, a data-rich market has transformed the fishing business. Fishermen no longer have to guess which seaside market needs their catch. They can use their mobile phones to tell them which markets have a gap between supply and demand.All in all, the move to data-rich markets is for the good. It is of a piece with the ideals of Francis Bacon, Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Immanuel Kant. Knowledge spreads, and people are able to act on it. Fishermen sell more fish. Fish eaters have more choice. In one realm after another, people are able to find products and services they want, rather than having to settle for something less useful.Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the University of Oxford, and Ramge, a writer for The Economist, explain all of these advantages. To their credit, though, they spend more time in their book on the downsides of data-rich markets. These include the potential to put people out of work and to concentrate corporate power among a small number of firms that control the most valuable data. The book echoes some of the themes of Tim Wu\u2019s 2010 history, \u201cThe Master Switch,\u201d which documented the tendency of information technology to produce cartels and monopolies. The only way to avoid this fate, all of these authors agree, is a smart, activist government dedicated to protecting its citizens\u2019 interests.This new book starts its story with the ancient idea of human coordination. \u201cIf there is a single crucial thread that has persisted through human history,\u201d the authors write, \u201cit is the importance of coordination.\u201d Coordination allows communities to accomplish tasks that individuals working alone cannot. People can build on one another\u2019s strengths and make up for one another\u2019s weaknesses. Coordination made possible the library of Alexandria, the Great Wall of China, the Suez Canal and the moon landing. Coordination, in turn, depends on communication \u2014 the exchange of information that allows people to work together.In modern times, the most effective way to coordinate behavior, other than through government, has been through a company, also known as a firm. Firms tend to follow a top-down approach to coordination. A canonical example is Henry Ford\u2019s automobile firm. There, workers were divided into specialized groups. Information flowed up from these groups through a tightly controlled management structure that culminated with an imperial chief executive. Decisions came down from the top.But the firm is not the only way for the private sector to coordinate. The market offers a different model for doing so, one that both complements and competes with the firm\u2019s hierarchical approach. The market is decentralized. It has no top-down authority. Participants come and go with ease.In the market, the dominant mechanism for coordination and communication has long been price. It\u2019s simple to understand, often too simple. It is one-dimensional. That\u2019s why firms have long provided a more efficient way for people to coordinate, because they could better synthesize a rich stream of information and then act on it. Today, however, the explosion of computing power has enabled many more people to gather information and analyze it quickly, which has allowed the lingua franca of the market to become more sophisticated. In response, many firms are reorganizing themselves to mimic markets. They have become less strictly hierarchical and spread decision-making power to a larger number of people.For all their differences, the firm and the market do share a central flaw. They often are not self-correcting. Early winners can use their strength to beat back competition, amassing yet more strength \u2014 and ultimately hurting the public interest. It happened with the railroad trusts, Standard Oil and AT&T, and it is beginning to happen with the big winners in today\u2019s data-rich, market-oriented economy. Superstar companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google earn enormous profits, while employing a surprisingly small work force relative to their scale. They are adept at avoiding taxes. And they continue to amass data about human behavior that will help them grow even stronger.Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Ramge offer several intriguing ideas for limiting the excesses of data-rich capitalism. One idea is a \u201crobo tax\u201d as a partial replacement for the payroll tax \u2014 machines would be taxed more and human employment less. Another idea is mandated data sharing \u2014 an echo of the patent system, which also depends on disclosure, the authors note \u2014 to allow new entrants a fair chance to compete.These ideas won\u2019t get much of a hearing in today\u2019s Washington. But the shift toward an information-based economy will outlast the current administration. Eventually, this country will have a government interested in encouraging the best parts of modern capitalism while restraining the worst.David Leonhardt is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jordan\u2019s Prime Minister Quits as Protesters Demand an End to Austerity", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 Escalating economic pressures on Jordan threatened to turn into a political crisis on Monday, as the prime minister resigned amid nationwide protests against proposed tax and price increases in a country that has suffered through years of declining living standards.Prime Minister Hani Mulki stepped down after two years in office, but there was no sign that his departure would mollify the protesters or change unpopular austerity policies proposed by the government and backed by the International Monetary Fund.The replacement of a prime minister is a tactic frequently used by King Abdullah II, Jordan\u2019s ruler, in an attempt to placate the populace when discontent threatens the stability of the kingdom. But behind the recent protests is a collision of international factors that are far less easy to manage.Western lenders are demanding painful measures to balance the budget and liberalize the economy even though Jordan\u2019s standard of living has been declining for years. And at the end of 2017, the petroleum-rich Persian Gulf monarchies cut off $1 billion a year in aid that had covered many of Jordan\u2019s big expenses for the previous five years.Recent signs of distance between King Abdullah and some important Persian Gulf rulers have raised questions about whether they are holding back aid solely because the falling price of oil has squeezed their own budgets, or also partly because of political differences.The king, who appoints the prime minister, the cabinet and members of the upper house of Parliament, appointed Omar Razzaz, a former World Bank official and education minister, to replace Mr. Mulki and lead a new government. It was not clear whether Mr. Razzaz would pursue the proposal to increase the tax rate on workers by at least five percentage points and on businesses by 20 to 40 percentage points.The loss of $1 billion in annual support from the gulf states hit Jordan particularly hard, said Ibrahim Saif, an economist who studies the region. \u201cIt had covered much of the government\u2019s capital expenditures and many initiatives to try to develop the economy and create jobs,\u201d Mr. Saif said.Jordan has increasingly charted a course independent of its gulf patrons. While Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have cut off trade and diplomatic ties with neighboring Qatar, King Abdullah has refused to follow their lead. He has also pushed back far more vocally than other Arab monarchs against President Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, rather than wait for its status to be resolved in peace talks with the Palestinians.Many residents of Jordan trace their origin to the Palestinian territories, so anything involving those talks is politically delicate. The Persian Gulf monarchs have shown more interest in building a common front against Iran with Washington \u2014 and, tacitly, Israel \u2014 than in confronting Israel over the Palestinians.Economics alone could also explain the decision of the Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to discontinue aid to Jordan, Mr. Saif said; the gulf kingdoms have raised their own taxes and prices in an effort to move their economies away from dependence on oil.\u201cThey are trying to consolidate their own budgets,\u201d he said.A day later, the government increased the price of fuel by more than 5 percent and electricity by 19 percent. The strike turned into daily nationwide protests by thousands of people, the largest in the country since the Arab Spring in 2011.King Abdullah ordered the government to suspend the energy price increases, but the demonstrations continued.The protests have drawn diverse crowds \u2014 unemployed youths, women, store owners, families, Bedouins and employees of high-tech companies. They have been eager to show that they do not come from any particular political or demographic group, but represent a broad spectrum of poor and middle-class Jordanians.The only banner flying in the crowds has been the national flag, and protesters have gone out of their way to say that they were standing up for police officers, as well.\u201cDo you hear us?\u201d crowds chanted in Amman, addressing the government. \u201cHear us now. We came to say you have left us with nothing. We are broke. The people want the downfall of the government.\u201d\u201cThe protesters also want a changing social contract,\u201d said Sean L. Yom, a professor of political science at Temple University who studies Middle Eastern governments. \u201cThe Jordanian state is asking citizens to pay more and live more frugally, but in return offers little political concessions or more democracy.\u201dPolls show a significant decline in public confidence in government, particularly in the past year, Dr. Braizat of NAMA Strategic Intelligence Solutions said.David D.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Yield Curve? \u2018A Powerful Signal of Recessions\u2019 Has Wall Street\u2019s Attention", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou can try to play down a trade war with China. You can brush off the impact of rising oil prices on corporate earnings.But if you\u2019re in the business of making economic predictions, it has become very difficult to disregard an important signal from the bond market.The so-called yield curve is perilously close to predicting a recession \u2014 something it has done before with surprising accuracy \u2014 and it\u2019s become a big topic on Wall Street.Terms like \u201cyield curve\u201d can be mind-numbing if you\u2019re not a bond trader, but the mechanics, practical impact and psychology of it are fairly straightforward. Here\u2019s what the fuss is all about.The yield curve is basically the difference between interest rates on short-term United States government bonds, say, two-year Treasury notes, and long-term government bonds, like 10-year Treasury notes.Typically, when an economy seems in good health, the rate on the longer-term bonds will be higher than short-term ones. The extra interest is to compensate, in part, for the risk that strong economic growth could set off a broad rise in prices, known as inflation. Lately, though, long-term bond yields have been stubbornly slow to rise \u2014 which suggests traders are concerned about long-term growth \u2014 even as the economy shows plenty of vitality.At the same time, the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term rates, so the yield curve has been \u201cflattening.\u201d In other words, the gap between short-term interest rates and long-term rates is shrinking.The gap between two-year and 10-year United States Treasury notes is roughly 0.34 percentage points. It was last at these levels in 2007 when the United States economy was heading into what was arguably the worst recession in almost 80 years.As scary as references to the financial crisis sound, flattening alone does not mean that the United States is doomed to slip into another recession. But if it keeps moving in this direction, eventually long-term interest rates will fall below short-term rates.When that happens, the yield curve has \u201cinverted.\u201d An inversion is seen as \u201ca powerful signal of recessions,\u201d as the president of the New York Fed, John Williams, said this year, and that\u2019s what everyone is watching for.Even if it hasn\u2019t happened yet, the move in that direction has Wall Street\u2019s attention.\u201cFor economists, of course it\u2019s always been traditionally a very good signal of directionality of the economy,\u201d said Sonja Gibbs, senior director of capital markets at the Institute of International Finance. \u201cThat\u2019s why everyone is bemoaning the flattening of the yield curve.\u201dSure, it seems like a strange time to be worried about recession. Unemployment is at an 18-year low, corporate investment is picking up steam, and consumer spending shows signs of rebounding.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see what\u2019s going to goose the economy further from these levels,\u201d Ms. Gibbs said.And the financial markets can sometimes sniff out problems with the economy before they show up in the official economic snapshots published on G.D.P. and unemployment. Another notable yield curve inversion occurred in February 2000, just before the stock market\u2019s dot-com bubble burst.In that sense, the government bond market isn\u2019t alone. Stocks have been in a sideways struggle since the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index last peaked on Jan. 26. Returns on corporate bonds are negative, as are some key commodities tied to industrial activity.An important caveat to the predictive power of the yield curve is that it can\u2019t predict precisely when a recession will begin. In the past the recession has come in as little as six months, or as long as two years, after the inversion, the San Francisco Fed\u2019s researchers note.In other words, there\u2019s a reason to look at the yield curve skeptically, despite its prowess at predicting recessions.As in all market moves, perceptions of its significance mean the yield curve can sometimes become a feedback loop.If enough investors begin to grow concerned about a recession, they will most likely put more and more money into the safety of long-term government bonds. That buying binge would likely help flatten, or invert, the yield curve.Then people will write articles about the curve\u2019s sending a stronger signal on recession. And that could, in turn, drive even more people to buy into long-term bonds. Rinse. Repeat.But it\u2019s not just psychology. The yield curve helps determine some of the decisions that are the most crucial to the health of the American economy.Specifically, the flattening yield curve makes banking, which is basically the business of borrowing money at short-term rates and lending it at long-term rates, less profitable. And if the yield curve inverts, it means lending money becomes a losing proposition.Either way, the flow of lending is likely to be curtailed. And in the United States, where borrowed money is the lifeblood of economic activity, that can slam the brakes on economic growth.There is an argument to be made against reading too much into the yield curve\u2019s moves \u2014 and it hangs on the idea that, rather than the free market, central banks have had a big influence on both the long-term and short-term rates.Since the last recession, central banks bought trillions of dollars of government bonds as they tried to push long-term interest rates lower in order to lend a helping hand to the economy.Even though they\u2019re reversing course now, central banks still own massive amounts of those bonds, and that may be keeping long-term interest rates lower than they would otherwise be.Also, the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates since December 2015 and has indicated it will keep doing so this year.So if long-term rates were pushed lower by central bank bond buying, and now short-term rates are being pushed higher as the Fed tightens its monetary policy, the yield curve has nowhere to go but flatter.\u201cIn the current environment, I think it\u2019s a less reliable indicator than it has been in the past,\u201d said Matthew Luzzetti, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boston Grapples With Faneuil Hall, Named for a Slaveholder", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 The national wave of renamings of statues, monuments and parks that recall the days of slavery is lapping at Faneuil Hall, the historic Georgian brick meetinghouse in downtown Boston that is synonymous with revolutionary fervor and among the country\u2019s most visited tourist attractions.Since the 1740s, rabble-rousers \u2014 rebellious colonists, abolitionists and suffragists among them \u2014 have met in the building\u2019s Great Hall. Susan B. Anthony, Frederick Douglass and John F. Kennedy have all spoken from its stage, and political rallies, debates and civic events still take place within its walls, making Faneuil Hall \u2014 pronounced \u201cFAN-yul\u201d \u2014 a living monument.But its namesake, Peter Faneuil, one of the richest merchants in 18th century New England, was a slave owner. And he traded not only in sugar, molasses and timber, but in humans.That has drawn the attention of some faith leaders and others who want to remove Faneuil\u2019s name from the iconic landmark.\u201cFaneuil Hall insults the dignity of blacks and all Americans who believe in the civic dignity of all,\u201d Kevin C. Peterson, founder of a group called the New Democracy Coalition, said in a statement.Against this backdrop, the New Democracy Coalition submitted a petition this week to the Boston City Council to start the process of renaming Faneuil Hall, which is owned by the city but operated as a visitor center and historic site by the National Park Service.City officials have not said what they intend to do, though Mayor Martin J. Walsh says he does not support changing the name.\u201cIf we were to change the name of Faneuil Hall today, 30 years from now, no one would know why we did it,\u201d the mayor said in a statement to The New York Times.\u201cNot many people know about the history of that man,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd over the years, Faneuil Hall has become a place where good things have happened,\u201d he said. He noted that Douglass called for an end to slavery from the hall and that every year, hundreds of people gather in the hall to take their oath of citizenship.\u201cWhat we should do instead is figure out a way to acknowledge the history so people understand it,\u201d the mayor concluded. \u201cWe can\u2019t erase history, but we can learn from it.\u201dTourists visiting Faneuil Hall this week, many of whom were white, were overwhelmingly against changing the name.\u201cI don\u2019t like to tinker with history,\u201d said Matt Birch, 32, an online editor who is white and lives in Washington, D.C., and was browsing in a bookshop in the building. \u201cThis is our country\u2019s roots and it helped form our national identity.\u201dHis mother, Nina, 64, a retired accountant, felt the same. \u201cIt is what it is because of what it was,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201dThat ceremony was held at Faneuil Hall, where Mr. Faneuil\u2019s own involvement in slavery was just starting to reach the public consciousness.About 20 million people visit Faneuil Hall every year, many of them seeking a touchstone of the American Revolution. Many know that patriots met at the hall to organize against British oppression, earning Faneuil Hall the moniker \u201cthe cradle of liberty.\u201dBut in a random sample of a dozen visitors this week, no one knew who Mr. Faneuil was \u2014 or that some of the treasure he spent to build the hall in the 1740s derived from the slave trade.When told about his past, most said they did not see a reason to remove Mr. Faneuil\u2019s name. Erasing it, they said, would be tantamount to wiping away part of history, which, they said, should be remembered, despicable as it was.\u201cI don\u2019t condone slavery, but this is a historical landmark,\u201d said Angie Musil, 41, who is white and works as an office assistant at an elementary school in Minnesota. She said her family had recently visited Monticello, the Virginia home of Thomas Jefferson. Although Jefferson owned slaves, she said, \u201cthey haven\u2019t shut down Monticello.\u201dBut Alex King, 20, a black student visiting with his class from a school outside of Boston, said he thought changing the name seemed like a good idea.\u201cYou can create better harmony in your community, so people aren\u2019t offended or triggered in a certain way,\u201d he said.Jeremy Snow, 46, a white law enforcement officer who was visiting Faneuil Hall from Florida, said he disagreed with this movement to take down historical markers.\u201cAfrican-Americans were treated so wrong and so badly over the years,\u201d Mr. Snow said. \u201cBut instead of tearing down our history, we should be making new monuments for new reasons.\u201dHe and his family were also planning to visit Salem, Mass., scene of the 17th-century witch trials, \u201cwhere again, people were done wrong,\u201d he said.\u201cIt seems like when people are done so wrong, it becomes history,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do away with it. We need to learn from it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the occupation of a tourist who was asked to comment on the proposal to rename Boston\u2019s Faneuil Hall.

In it, citing a famous prediction by the economist John Maynard Keynes, he argued that technology should have made workers more productive, leading to a 15-hour workweek, but instead has been used to make people work more, in pointless jobs they hate.American work has indeed undergone a fundamental shift in the past century. Where workers once made things, the bulk of them now serve people instead. The increase in service jobs involves not just the type of work people do at restaurants or clothing stores; service-sector employees include administrators, consultants, accountants and call-center representatives. Between 1910 and 2000 in the United States, the share of people in professional, managerial, clerical, sales and service jobs grew from one-quarter to three-quarters of total employment, Graeber says.The idea of office ennui is nothing new \u2014 in 1853, Melville wrote of Bartleby, the clerk who one day decided he preferred not to do his job anymore. But Graeber argues that there are more useless office jobs than ever before. He blames this largely on the rise of the financial and information sectors and on what he calls \u201cmanagerial feudalism,\u201d in which companies keep adding supervisors and white-collar workers, rather than sharing with blue-collar workers the fruits of their increased productivity. Companies do not get rid of these useless positions, he says, because economic policy is premised on the idea that creating more jobs should be a top priority. A case in point: President Obama, Graeber argues, supported private health care instead of single-payer because he did not want to destroy the millions of jobs at insurance companies like Kaiser that a single-payer system would make obsolete \u2014 jobs that Graeber says are clearly \u201cunnecessary.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say that Graeber\u2019s argument is not without merit \u2014 in my own unscientific research, I encountered a few friends who said that their jobs fit his description perfectly. And Graeber\u2019s anthropological eye and skepticism about capitalism are useful in questioning some parts of the economy that the West has come to accept as normal. Why do preschool teachers make so little money, for example, while the people who design annoying banner ads do pretty well for themselves? Why do people take so much pride in working so hard they barely have time outside the office, while harboring so much resentment toward people who aren\u2019t as dedicated to their jobs? Why do so many people have to squeeze doing the things they love \u2014 like writing novels or woodworking \u2014 into their free time, while spending grim hours under the fluorescent lights of an office doing pointless tasks? If nothing else, this book asks readers whether there might be a better way to organize the world of work. That\u2019s a question worth asking.Alana Semuels is a staff writer at The Atlantic, where she covers labor and technological disruption.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jared Kushner Criticizes Abbas, Questioning His Ability to Make Peace", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and top adviser on the Middle East, said the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, was afraid to make peace with Israel, bore responsibility for the deteriorating situation in Gaza and was prioritizing his own political survival at the expense of his people\u2019s needs.He appeared to be attempting to goad Mr. Abbas into talks the leader has vowed to boycott, while doing considerable pre-emptive damage control in the event that Mr. Abbas does not relent.But Mr. Kushner offered little in the way of enticements to Mr. Abbas. Asked what the leaders of other Arab nations wanted to see in an Israel-Palestinian settlement, the White House aide mentioned nothing about a sovereign Palestinian state or of Palestinian refugees.He also did not mention Israeli settlements on the West Bank or using the 1967 lines as a starting point to draw borders; and nothing about East Jerusalem serving as the Palestinian capital. He instead spoke of a potential Palestinian capital \u201cin East Jerusalem.\u201dMr. Kushner alluded to Arab nations\u2019 desire that Al Aqsa Mosque \u201cremain open to all Muslims who wish to worship\u201d \u2014 but said nothing about its being in the custodianship of a Palestinian state, suggesting it could remain under Israeli control in the administration\u2019s plan.Mr. Kushner\u2019s interview, published on the website of Al Quds after Mr. Kushner met twice over two days in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, was replete with criticism of Mr. Abbas, the aging, unhealthy and highly unpopular Palestinian leader. A translation of the interview was released by the White House.Asked by the newspaper\u2019s editor, Walid Abu-Zalaf, about an Abbas spokesman\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Kushner\u2019s trip as a \u201cwaste of time\u201d that was \u201cbound to fail,\u201d Mr. Kushner said he believed Palestinian leaders were \u201csaying those things because they are scared we will release our peace plan and the Palestinian people will actually like it.\u201dMr. Kushner questioned Mr. Abbas\u2019s flexibility and capacity to make peace, and said the \u201cglobal community\u201d was frustrated with Mr. Abbas. \u201cHe has his talking points, which have not changed in the last 25 years,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. He added: \u201cTo make a deal, both sides will have to take a leap and meet somewhere between their stated positions. I am not sure President Abbas has the ability to do that.\u201dMr. Abbas has raged at the Trump administration, Mr. Kushner observed, but he questioned whose interests that served.\u201cThere are a lot of sharp statements and condemnations, but no ideas or efforts with prospects of success,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. \u201cThose who are more skeptical say President Abbas is only focused on his political survival and cementing a legacy of not having compromised, than on bettering the lives of the Palestinian people.\u201dMr. Kushner said the Trump administration was determined to find solutions to the \u201ccore issues\u201d of the conflict \u2014 including Jerusalem, borders and refugees \u2014 \u201cthat both sides can live with.\u201d But he said that \u201cwithout creating a pathway to better life,\u201d no solution would be durable.To that end, he said his team had \u201cspent our time focusing on the people and trying to determine what they actually want,\u201d which he said was \u201cmore and better-paying jobs and prospects for a better life.\u201dHe suggested that could involve \u201cmassive investments in modern infrastructure, job training and economic stimulus,\u201d could allow the \u201cindustrious, well-educated\u201d Palestinian population to leapfrog to the forefront of the \u201ctechnological industrial revolution\u201d and said Palestinians would particularly benefit from integrating their economy with that of Israel, \u201cthe Silicon Valley of the Middle East.\u201d\u201cIsraeli\u2019s prosperity would spill over very quickly to the Palestinians if there is peace,\u201d he said, and Egypt and Jordan would also see a windfall.Dennis Ross, a veteran Middle East peace negotiator, said Mr. Kushner\u2019s conjuring of an economic leap forward for Palestinians could be \u201cappealing,\u201d but he warned that leaders of neighboring Arab countries would require a political compromise between Israel and the Palestinians to be able to support an American-led deal.\u201cArab leaders need to be able to justify their position by pointing to what the Palestinians would be getting and what is important to Arab audiences,\u201d he said. \u201cThat certainly suggests something credible from their standpoint on Jerusalem and a Palestinian state.\u201d\u201cThere is a challenge to Abu Mazen here,\u201d Mr. Ross added, referring to Mr. Abbas and the overall tone of Mr. Kushner\u2019s remarks. \u201cBut the door is open to him, as well.\u201dNotably, Mr. Kushner did not mention Mr. Abbas\u2019s counterpart, Mr. Netanyahu, or offer any criticism of the Israeli side. Mr. Abbas and his advisers have complained that the Trump administration has dispensed with any pretense that the United States can be a neutral mediator of the conflict and has essentially taken Israel\u2019s side.Indeed, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinians\u2019 chief negotiator, said that Mr. Kushner\u2019s description of the American plan could have been drafted by the right-wing Israeli government. Mr. Erekat said in an interview, \u201cThat is verbatim what we heard from Netanyahu.\u201dMr. Erekat said that he had repeatedly asked Mr. Kushner to facilitate direct talks between the Palestinians and Israelis, but that Mr. Kushner had rebuffed him.\u201cThey want to dictate a solution, not negotiate it,\u201d Mr. Erekat said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to blame us, that\u2019s it \u2014 he\u2019s trying to show that the Palestinians want away from the table. They\u2019re preparing the ground for finger-pointing and assigning blame on us.\u201d\u201cThe political dysfunction, greatly exacerbated by the P.A.\u2019s salary cuts, has made Gaza ungovernable,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Palestinian Authority and Hamas to stop using the people of Gaza as pawns.\u201dMr. Kushner welcomed the idea of a referendum on a peace plan as a way to bypass recalcitrant leaders in both the West Bank and Jerusalem. \u201cThat\u2019s something that the leadership of both sides should consider doing,\u201d he said.Rhetorically, at least, he spent much of the interview appealing to ordinary Palestinians to give the Trump administration\u2019s proposal a fair hearing.\u201cDon\u2019t let your leadership reject a plan they haven\u2019t even seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world has moved forward while you have been left behind.

{"Headline": "By Taking a Bullet, a Muslim Woman Finds Her Calling", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileBERLIN \u2014 Seyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living. A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women\u2019s center in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.\u201c \u2018I want to go back,\u2019 I told God,\u201d Ms. Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women\u2019s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. \u201cI still have a mission.\u201dMore than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side-by-side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque \u2014 the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered \u2014 are recognized as imams. Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shiite, transgender, gay or straight\u201cWe want to send a signal to political Islam,\u201d Ms. Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshipers. \u201cWe want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.\u201dOver the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members \u2014 many of them women. They help Ms. Ates organize weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Against the backdrop of these debates, Ms. Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.She recently extended the lease on the room where the mosque is housed for two more years, defying those who foretold a swift demise for the project.\u201cA couple of days after we opened the mosque, a young man showed up and told us, \u2018You won\u2019t be here long. The Arabs will never allow it,\u2019 \u201d she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services. Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as 500 euros, or about $580, Ms. Ates said, emphasizing that the mosque receives no public funding.\u201cEven atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,\u201d she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. \u201cI had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.\u201dThe criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats. \u201cMay Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,\u201d someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book \u201cIslam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u201d in 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community. \u201cI want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, \u2018She\u2019s just a lawyer,\u2019 \u201d she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II. Ms. Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ms. Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realization that because of her gender she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counselor in a women\u2019s center. In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the center, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her; the other struck Ms. Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack. She returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin\u2019s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fund-raising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the United States, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.Meriam Yabir, an 18-year-old Muslim from Munich, had heard about the liberal mosque and sought it out while she was visiting Berlin. In a story similar to that of Ms. Ates, she said she grew up in a conservative household, but with her bright blue hair, pierced nose and miniskirt, she said she has struggled to find a congregation where she feels welcome.\u201cIt is hard to find a mosque where I fit in, so I normally pray at home,\u201d said Ms. Yabir, adding that she wished there were more liberal mosques. \u201cWhere I can be like this,\u201d she said, gesturing to her clothes, \u201cand still be a Muslim.\u201dWhile several hundred Muslims visit the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque each month, Ms. Ates said, like Ms. Yabir, many are just passing through. Ms. Ates said she would like to see her congregation grow among the city\u2019s Muslims.\u201cThere are still many who are afraid to come, because the rumor that we are a terrorist organization persists,\u201d she saidNevertheless, she said she believed that she would be able to live without 24-hour protection one day, although it might take 10 or 15 years. \u201cThe more liberal mosques exist in Germany and across Europe, the less there will be this fixation on one individual.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very confident of it,\u201d she said, adding, with a nod to the muscled officer on the other side of the room, \u201cYou\u2019ll soon be out of a job,\u201d she laughed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Asks U.S. for an Exemption From Sanctions on Iran", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 In a letter to senior Trump administration officials, European foreign and finance leaders this week tacitly acknowledged that their efforts to preserve the West\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran were failing.\u201cIn their current state, U.S. secondary sanctions could prevent the European Union from continuing meaningful sanctions relief to Iran,\u201d said the letter, signed by the finance and foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany, all signatories to the 2015 accord with Tehran, and by Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign-policy chief, who oversaw the negotiations.Without that sanctions relief, Iran has threatened to pull out of the deal. That \u201cwould further unsettle a region where additional conflicts would be disastrous,\u201d the ministers argue, asserting that the deal was \u201cthe best means through which we can prevent a nuclear-armed Iran,\u201d and that there appeared to be \u201cno credible alternatives at this time.\u201dThe letter was reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal and was then obtained by The New York Times.The plea is considered unlikely to produce the relief the Europeans want, since the Trump administration\u2019s stated intention is to pressure Tehran into agreeing to an entirely new set of negotiations that would encompass its ballistic missile program and its support for hard-line regimes and militias throughout the Middle East.The Europeans have been working with the State Department for some time to try to persuade Mr. Trump to remain in the nuclear agreement, which he has consistently called \u201cthe worst deal in history.\u201dThey proposed discussing parallel new sanctions on Iran for its missile program, its support of the Syrian government and its backing of the Houthi rebels in Yemen and of groups like Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad elsewhere in the Middle East. But the Europeans failed to convince American officials that they could fix the so-called sunset provisions in the original deal, which allow Iran to resume various nuclear activities after a period of years.Tehran has always denied that it ever intended to build a nuclear weapon, though Western intelligence agencies said Iran tried to do just that before abandoning the effort in 2003. While Iran continued to work on ballistic missiles, there has been no evidence found of a nuclear weapons program since that date.On Tuesday, however, Iran announced that it was preparing its nuclear facilities to resume large-scale uranium enrichment and had built a factory for constructing advanced centrifuges should Europe fail to preserve the deal.On Wednesday, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said that Iran\u2019s announced intention to increase its enrichment capacity still left it within the limits set out in the agreement, but, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s always dangerous to flirt with the red line.\u201d So far, he told Europe 1 radio, the deal remained intact.Iran\u2019s leadership is divided, but some would prefer to stay in the deal even without the Americans, to avoid possible military strikes from Israel and from the United States and to try to upgrade the economy. But that prospect seems unlikely if European companies are denied a waiver from the \u201csecondary\u201d sanctions.Iran negotiated the 2015 deal in order to get relief from those crippling secondary sanctions, which Washington is now reimposing and which would deny access to financial systems in the United States to any company doing business with Iran.It is very difficult to persuade large companies with interests in the much larger American market to violate the sanctions or to act as guinea pigs in a trans-Atlantic scuffle over legal mechanisms when there is no certain outcome.Without special exemptions from the secondary sanctions, French companies like the energy giant Total and the PSA Group, which makes Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn vehicles, have already announced that they will pull out of Iran.The European ministers asked the Americans for specific exemptions for companies, individuals and banks who invested in Iran after the deal went into effect on Jan. 16, 2016; for \u201ckey sectors,\u201d like health care, pharmaceuticals, energy, autos and civil aviation; and for banking with the Central Bank of Iran. They also asked for extended periods to wind down their projects for companies that choose to leave Iran, and they made it clear that other requests would be forthcoming, including from individual companies.The ministers say that their countries \u201cshare most of the concerns expressed by the U.S. regarding the status of Iran\u2019s nuclear program after 2025, Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles program and its destabilizing actions in the region.\u201d But they assert that \u201cpreserving\u201d the deal \u201cis the best basis on which to engage Iran and address these concerns,\u201d adding that, \u201cAs allies, we expect that the United States will refrain from taking action to harm Europe\u2019s security interests.\u201dUnfortunately for the Europeans, perhaps, Mr. Trump does not seem to share their views on Iran, and he has proved not to be much swayed by appeals based on trans-Atlantic relations.\u201cThis action reversed an ill-advised and dangerous policy and set us on a new course that will address the aggressive and hostile behavior of our enemies,\u201d he added, \u201cwhile enhancing our ties with partners and allies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Is Changing, but Not in Ways Trump Thinks", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 President Trump says his decision to leave the nuclear agreement is already having a huge impact on Iran. He is right, Iranians say, but for the wrong reasons.Mr. Trump said this month that Iran is changing its behavior in the region, implying that its leaders had been chastened or cowed by the American move and were pulling back.But analysts say there has been little or no change in Iran\u2019s regional posture. The real impact to date has been on internal politics, with a repression on the slightest hints of dissent, and the economy, after the reimposition of sanctions.\u201cA good economic and political process was underway in Iran,\u201d said Mirzababa Motaharinezhad, a spokesman for Mardomsalary, a moderate political group. \u201cUnfortunately, after Trump pulled out from the deal openness ended here and a crackdown on activists resumed.\u201dIn the region, though, it seems to be business as usual. Last week an Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps commander, Hossein Salami, noted that Iran\u2019s ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah, has 100,000 missiles ready to destroy Israel. In Syria, where Iran has played a crucial role in keeping President Bashar al-Assad in power, three Iranian soldiers were killed this month during battles. For the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Israel is still a \u201ccancerous tumor\u201d that must be removed.\u201cTrump has this illusion that because he left the nuclear agreement, we are forced to change our behavior in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine,\u201d said Hossein Sheikholeslam, a special adviser to Iran\u2019s foreign minister on regional issues. \u201cNo way we are doing that. If we ever change our policies, it will have nothing to do with Trump or anyone in the White House or elsewhere.\u201dMost Western analysts largely agree with that assessment. \u201cIran is rethinking its role in the region, but not because of Mr. Trump directly,\u201d said Walter Posch, a Middle East expert at the National Defense Academy in Vienna. \u201cTehran is becoming overstretched. Iran thought it could hold the ground easily: getting strong in Syria, putting pressure on Israel indirectly but not provoking it to attack. But it is getting more difficult by the day.\u201dFar away from the conflict zones in the Middle East, in the small alleyways of Tehran\u2019s bazaars and the luxury car dealerships in the affluent northern parts of the city, Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear agreement has definitely added to economic woes, which are contributing to political tensions.On Monday, protesters gathered outside the Parliament building in Tehran to complain about the economy, and the police fired tear gas to disperse them. On Sunday, the Grand Bazaar had to close because of protests.Iran\u2019s economy already was in a bad state. In less than a year, the rial, Iran\u2019s currency, has declined by 50 percent in value against the dollar. The International Monetary Fund reported that a record amount of capital, $27 billion, was taken out of the country last year. Ayatollah Khamenei, in a sermon recently celebrating the end of Ramadan, called upon Iranians to stop taking leisure trips abroad, to make sure no more foreign exchange leaves Iran.The currency crisis has led to a sharp increase in the prices of imported goods. In an effort to shield their savings, many people are buying real estate, gold and cars, driving up prices of those assets.\u201cFinding a safe place for my savings has become nearly impossible,\u201d said Asgar Kouhpaee, 55, a tradesman who for years made his living as an egg wholesaler. He said he always kept his savings in cars, but this year he missed his chance. A Toyota RAV4, a midscale SUV model that costs around $25,000 in the United States and sold for $68,000 here last August, now costs around $100,000.\u201cEverything has gone up, even locally produced cars are now 40 percent more expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only am I unable to purchase a new car, but who can afford to buy it from me with these prices?\u201dThe prospect of new sanctions and pressure are terrifying him. \u201cIt just feels as if everything is spinning out of control,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must do something to stop this.\u201dSuch feelings are widely shared. Many people seem to be blaming their leaders, rather than President Trump or others, for most of the problems, making the government hypersensitive to expressions of dissent.\u201cThe impact of Trump\u2019s pullout from the nuclear deal is very very low, said Reza Khandan, the husband of Nasrin Sotoudeh, a prominent human rights lawyer who was arrested last week. \u201cEven if the nuclear agreement was fully implemented, and all the money reached here and the banking system was not under sanction, the mismanagement inside the country would have squandered the oil revenue and other transactions. We are in bad economic and social states, and it has nothing to do with Trump and sanctions he imposed or will impose.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not buy anything from the market for a month, neither gold, nor cars nor anything that\u2019s gotten more expensive,\u201d Mr. Karimi wrote. \u201cAll of you support this until the hands of the middle men and the thieves are cut off from this country.\u201dMr. Karimi, who has criticized the authorities for their policies of barring women from soccer stadiums, was promptly hauled into court that handles media-related matters to explain his call for a boycott. His case is still under review.Numerous editors, journalists and prominent figures have been summoned before the same court for questioning.The judicial authorities have also ramped up pressure on dissidents, most notably with the arrest of Ms. Sotoudeh.A man was hanged last Monday, convicted of killing three police officers by running over them with a bus during a protest last winter. The driver, Mohammad Salas, denied the charge, saying his confession was coerced. His lawyer, Zeynab Taheri, was arrested the day after her client\u2019s execution for undisclosed reasons.Meanwhile, anticipating fresh protests over the economy and rising political dissatisfaction, the government has allocated four stadiums and six parks across the capital as locations for legal protest rallies.Mr. Khamenei, the supreme leader, in his recent speech, insisted all is well. \u201cThe people are awake. They are motivated and they are not tired,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who promote the idea, following the enemies\u2019 propaganda, that the people are tired and exhausted are tired themselves. They themselves are exhausted!\u201dAdvertisement"}

In Giarre, a small town off the Ionian Coast, he met his friend and sometime collaborator Claudia D\u2019Aita. She knew the area well and led Masu to the edge of town where a large, empty polo stadium rose above the coastal plain. Masu was astonished by the monumental scale of the sun-bleached, concrete arena \u2014 built to hold 20,000 in a city of just 27,000 \u2014 and how it seemed suspended in time. There was no green turf on which to play, and dry grass poked up between the seats of the bleachers. No polo match had ever taken place there.At the end of World War II, Italy was in ruins \u2014 reduced to rubble by months of heavy bombing. But an infusion of cash, first through the Marshall Plan and later through the European Economic Community, touched off a period of rapid reconstruction. \u201cThe local governments thought of these public projects as an activator of the local economy,\u201d says Masu, \u201cbut so many of them were completely disconnected from the communities.\u201d Construction continued through the 1980s, which Marchi calls the \u201cgolden age\u201d of the Incompiuto, characterized by clean-lined, poured concrete construction.For various reasons \u2014 design errors, disregarded regulations and bankruptcies among them \u2014 hundreds of these buildings were never finished. \u201cSome of them are almost ready to be opened, others are just holes in the ground,\u201d says Masu. In the decades since work ceased, nature has reclaimed many of the structures. Others have been put to creative reuse as storage, skate parks and even temporary housing for Italy\u2019s growing migrant populations. In the Tuscan province of Massa-Carrara, the group discovered the Marble Hotel, empty and still veiled with scaffolding. A section of the basement, left open to the air, was filled with crystalline water in which thousands of lobsters swam \u201clike a Dali painting or a Louis Vuitton texture,\u201d says Masu. They were kept by locals to feed the posh Russians vacationing nearby.The book documents the poetic \u201cmistakes\u201d of the Incompiuto: the four-story carpark with no exit, the escalator rising absurdly out of an empty field, a causeway where two stretches of road approach each other, only to stop short \u2014 slightly misaligned \u2014 and never meet.

{"Headline": "The Class Struggle According to Donald Trump", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.If only.As Adam Cobb, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, put it in an email conversation:Life doesn\u2019t operate so cleanly and the fact that a worker\u2019s wealth and well-being is much more dependent upon her employer than the employer is on a given worker tilts things in the employer\u2019s favor.The trend in recent years has been an inexorable shift of bargaining power to employers at the expense of employees.Worker power has already suffered death by a thousand cuts, some political, others judicial and regulatory; some at the hands of a changing domestic workplace, others stemming from relentless global forces.Corporate America recognized these trends early on and capitalized on them ruthlessly. Labor organizations were ill equipped to do so and have been on the defensive for the past four decades.In response to my query, Martha McCluskey, a professor of law at the University at Buffalo, emailed:The decline in worker bargaining power in the United States is the cumulative effect of numerous small and large changes over recent decades reaching into almost every area of law and policy. This combines with a decline in the enforcement of existing laws that could protect workers\u2019 bargaining power \u2014 laws protecting unions, laws against wage theft, nondiscrimination laws, and more.The \u201csmall and large changes over recent decades\u201d to which McCluskey refers increase the clout of corporate management and reduce the power of workers over wages, benefits and job security.Among these changes is the requirement that employees sign what are known as \u201cnoncompete\u201d and \u201cno-raid\u201d agreements, both of which restrict workers\u2019 ability to extract pay hikes by threatening to take similar jobs at competing companies.When entry-level workers at fast food restaurants are asked to sign two-year non-competes, it becomes less plausible that trade secrets are always the primary motivation for such agreements.The treasury report estimated that 30 million American workers have signed noncompete agreements.New practices have emerged to facilitate employer collusion, such as noncompete clauses and no-raid pacts, but the basic insights are the same \u2014 employers often implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, act to prevent the forces of competition from enabling workers to earn what a competitive market would dictate.Nearly 1 in 5 labor force participants were bound by noncompetes in 2014, and nearly 40 percent had signed at least one noncompete in the past.These included what the authors decried asJust as companies have weakened employee power through agreements like these, they have capitalized on the increased use of mandatory arbitration of employment disputes to limit their obligations to workers.fueled employer use of mandatory arbitration clauses to cover individual employment disputes, including allegations of workplace discrimination and sexual harassment.If these untoward consequences stemmed from legislative choices, I would be obliged to accede to them. But the edict that employees with wage and hours claims may seek relief only one-by-one does not come from Congress. It is the result of take-it-or-leave-it labor contracts harking back to the type called \u201cyellow dog,\u201d and of the readiness of this Court to enforce those unbargained-for agreements. The Federal Arbitration Act demands no such suppression of the right of workers to take concerted action for their \u201cmutual aid or protection.\u201dThese developments may be masked for a while when unemployment declines, but not forever.By exchanging direct employment for contract work or outsourcing, David Weil, dean of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis, writes in his book \u201cThe Fissured Workplace: Why Work Became So Bad for So Many and What Can Be Done to Improve It,\u201d major corporations succeed insubstantially reducing costs and dispatching the many responsibilities connected to being the employer of record.This shift, in turn,creates downward pressures on wages and benefits, murkiness about who bears responsibility for work conditions, increased likelihood that basic labor standards will be violated.The percentage of workers engaged in alternative work arrangements \u2014 defined as temporary help agency workers, on-call workers, contract workers, and independent contractors or freelancers \u2014 rose from 10.7 percent in February 2005 to 15.8 percent in late 2015.That\u2019s roughly 24 million workers.In addition, Katz and Krueger found that \u201cworkers in alternative work arrangements earn considerably less per week than do regular employees with similar characteristics and in similar occupations,\u201d that \u201cworkers in alternative work arrangements work fewer hours per week\u201d and that alarger share of alternative workers are involuntary part-time workers compared with employees in traditional jobs.Perhaps more significant, Katz and Krueger found:A striking implication of these estimates is that 94 percent of the net employment growth in the U.S. economy from 2005 to 2015 appears to have occurred in alternative work arrangements.The growing emphasis on \u201cshareholder value\u201d has provided additional justification for all of these anti-worker developments.Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at Wharton, wrote me that \u201cthe shareholder value movement starting in the late 1980s and now institutionalized through industry analysts\u201d was crucially important in the devaluation of employees:Accounting in business is mainly about costs. Finance people hate fixed costs because of the challenges they raise to share price valuation when there is uncertainty, and the biggest fixed costs are labor. Simply moving the same labor costs from employees to outside staffing companies moves it from one part of the accounting ledger to another and makes analysts happier.This mentality, in turn, encourages \u201cthe use of temps and contractors\u201d to fill high-wage jobs because \u201cthat way the employer doesn\u2019t have to raise wages for all their employees.\u201dHirsch, of the University of North Carolina, explained that the automobile industry provides the classic example of these trends:When that industry was dominated by the Big Three in Detroit, union organizing was relatively easy. The U.A.W. could organize all of the competitors by controlling most of the relatively generally homogeneous, geographically tight work force.Once \u201cautomakers in other countries, and now the South, made more inroads, the UAW\u2019s task became far more difficult,\u201d Hirsch argued, becauseCompanies could outsource work to areas with cheaper labor and less of a union presence. This both weakened the union and ramped up competitive pressure on the companies that were unionized. The result was fewer unions. This has obviously played out in many other industries.In addition, Hirsch pointed out,many union jobs are simply no longer in the U.S. Entire industries (e.g., textiles) were essentially moved offshore.The result is a \u201cdeath spiral effect,\u201d according to Hirsch:As membership declines unions are able to exert less influence. Moreover, as fewer employees have experience with unions or know others who have, it becomes harder to organize.The end of labor-management d\u00e9tente \u2014 and the emergence of a merciless assault by business and the Republican Party on workers\u2019 pay, security and bargaining strength \u2014 have been especially cruel to workers without college degrees.In their book, \u201cThe Second Machine Age,\u201d Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, both economists at M.I.T., don\u2019t hold out much hope for this broad class of workers:Rapid and accelerating digitization is likely to bring economic rather than environmental disruption, stemming from the fact that as computers get more powerful, companies have less need for some kinds of workers. Technological progress is going to leave behind some people, perhaps even a lot of people, as it races ahead.For those with special skills or the right education, they write, \u201cthere\u2019s never been a better time.\u201d For those \u201cwith only \u2018ordinary\u2019 skills and abilities to offer,\u201d however, \u201cthere\u2019s never been a worse time to be a worker.\u201dIn many cases, machines both substitute for and complement human labor. Focusing only on what is lost misses a central economic mechanism by which automation affects the demand for labor: raising the value of the tasks that workers uniquely supply.At a more concrete level, Krueger and Posner, in their Brookings paper, offer a series of well-thought out legal and regulatory reforms aimed at improving the bargaining power of workers.First, they would alter antitrust enforcement to require consideration of the likely effect of mergers on concentration in the labor market, in order to prevent \u201ctoo high a risk of wage suppression.\u201dIn the case of \u201cno-raid\u201d agreements between companies that bar participating businesses from making job offers to employees of competitors, Krueger and Posner would ban no-poaching arrangements altogether:We propose a per se rule against no-poaching agreements regardless of whether they are used outside or within franchises. In other words, no-poaching agreements would be considered illegal regardless of the circumstances of their use.The reality, of course, is that the Krueger-Posner proposals have no chance with President Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of both houses of Congress.For the time being, at least, the problems of the least skilled workers in the labor market will fester.In the 2016 election, Trump profited from the conviction of rural and working-class voters that they were on a downward trajectory. If anything, Trump appears to be gambling that letting those voters\u2019 lives continue to languish will work to his advantage in 2020.Trump campaigned as the ally of the white working class, but any notion that he would take its side as it faces off against employers is a gross misjudgment.His administration has turned the executive branch, the federal courts and the regulatory agencies into the sworn enemy of workers, organized and unorganized. Trump is indisputably indifferent to the plight of anyone in the bottom half of the income distribution: look at his appointments, look at his record in office, look back at his business career and look at the man himself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scorned Migrant Boat Exposes Raw Feelings Among European Allies", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 A boat crowded with hundreds of Africans sailing across the Mediterranean after being turned away by Italy this week has exposed anew the shaky fault lines in Europe\u2019s approach to the migrant crisis.On Sunday, Italy\u2019s new far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, ordered the Aquarius, a rescue ship operated by humanitarian groups, to stop 35 nautical miles off the coast of Italy, refusing to let it dock.The ship is now on its way to Spain, which showed up its neighbors by solemnly announcing that it would \u201crespect its international engagements\u201d and accept the boat after Malta, too, refused it, and France stood idly by.Brussels, the seat of the European Union, looked on in relative silence. There was no common policy to receive the Aquarius and no authority to impose one if there were.The imbroglio was \u201csymptomatic of the lack of coordination of a managed migration policy at the European Union level,\u201d said Imogen Sudbery of the International Rescue Committee in Brussels.The Italian refusal to offer safe harbor to a ship loaded with what aid groups described as 629 migrants \u2014 including 123 minors, 11 small children and seven pregnant women \u2014 was intended to underscore a long-simmering grievance.The Italians have bridled for years that they have been left alone by their European Union partners on the front line on the Mediterranean with an unmanageable burden of migration that Mr. Salvini pledged to reverse in his recent election campaign.But his refusal to accept the boat did more than pit humanitarian necessity against political expediency. It roiled tensions with European allies in ways that made President Trump\u2019s performance at the G-7 summit last weekend look almost diplomatic by comparison.By Tuesday, the Aquarius affair had erupted into full-blown sniping among allies, as four European governments traded mutual recriminations, reproaches and comeuppances.President Emmanuel Macron of France accused Italy of \u201ccynicism\u201d and \u201cirresponsibility\u201d for refusing to receive the boat.Coming from the French, the remarks amounted to a white-glove slap in the face. The Italians were having none of it.The office of the Italian prime minister pushed back against \u201chypocritical lessons\u201d from France, which has taken in a mere fraction of the tens of thousands of Africans arriving in Italy \u2014 some 120,000 arrived by sea in 2017 \u2014 and did not offer to take any of the latest.France regularly forces migrants back across the Italian border, deports dozens of others and gives only grudging aid to the relative handful who make it through the first filter. This time, again, the French stood by, refusing to take in the Aquarius.The Italians, disgusted with the French position, summoned France\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Rome on Wednesday, an unusual diplomatic move between two usually friendly neighbors. Italy\u2019s economy minister, Giovanni Tria, canceled a meeting with his French counterpart, Bruno Le Maire, in Paris.Mr. Salvini appeared to be relishing the mayhem he was causing. \u201cWe reawakened Europe,\u201d he told Corriere della Sera in an article on Wednesday.\u201cIronically, one day we may discover that we were the ones to save Europe,\u201d said Mr. Salvini, who has a history of euroskepticism and advocacy for leaving the euro.On Wednesday morning, Mr. Salvini fleshed out his position in his first official address to Parliament, saying that Italy\u2019s history of generosity did not deserve criticism from the French, who he hoped would offer their official apology as soon as possible.Under a 2015 European Union migrant plan, France was to have accepted 19,174 migrants from Italy and Greece. In all it took only 4,677.Mr. Macron tried to tamp down the flames on Wednesday, saying that France was \u201cworking hand in hand with Italy\u201d to manage the migrant flow. But there was little sign of that, and less sign that he had mollified the Italians.In Parliament, Mr. Salvini noted that from Jan. 1 to May 31, France had turned back 10,249 people, including women, children and the handicapped, at the border between the countries.Mr. Salvini added that France had accepted only 640 out of the 9,816 migrants agreed upon in 2015 and said he looked forward to Mr. Macron\u2019s accepting 9,000 migrants the next morning.That seems unlikely. But the travails of the Aquarius have created the sharpest rifts yet in Mr. Macron\u2019s governing party, with parliamentary deputies expressing anger at the government\u2019s silence and inaction.The French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, merely said that France would \u201chelp\u201d the Spanish. Without saying it, France this week seemed to make its policy on migrants clear: rejection.\u201cThe French government has missed an opportunity to distinguish itself in this affair,\u201d said S\u00e9bastien Nadot, a parliamentary deputy in Mr. Macron\u2019s Republic on the Move political movement. \u201cGiven the situation in France and Europe, I would have wished that for once we would be on the side of what is just.\u201d\u201cItaly\u2019s political situation is the result of the European Union\u2019s egotistical approach to migration,\u201d he added. \u201cItaly is forcing us to face our responsibilities.\u201dOthers tweeted their displeasure with the French government. \u201cIt should have been France\u2019s duty to agree to accept the 600 men, women and children who are in danger,\u201d said Sa\u00efd Ahamada, another deputy in Mr. Macron\u2019s movement.Corsica, a French region struggling for some measure of autonomy from Paris and always looking to mark differences with it, stepped in with an offer to help, but too late.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a vision of Europe and the Mediterranean, and we can\u2019t accept that it\u2019s only a zone of tension and fracture, and a cemetery,\u201d said Gilles Simeoni, the head of Corsica\u2019s executive council.But how far that vision extends in Europe is precisely the issue.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany insisted this week that it makes no sense for individual European countries to tackle illegal migration independent of one another, given the lack of borders within the core countries of the European Union.She rejected her own interior minister\u2019s tough migration plan, which would have allowed the police to reject migrants at the border if they were already registered in another European Union country.\u201cIt is an issue that we must resolve at a European level,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cThat is very important to me.\u201dUnderscoring the imperative, Ms. Merkel spoke to reporters on Tuesday after meeting with Sebastian Kurz, the chancellor of Austria, who, like Mr. Salvini, was elected on a pledge to stop illegal migrants.She and other leaders in the European establishment, including Mr. Macron and those in Brussels, know well that the longer the policy chaos goes on, the wider the opening for the far right and populist forces to exploit the migration issue.In fact, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front in France, expressed support for the Italian stand. \u201cSalvini\u2019s reaction is salutary,\u201d she said in a tweet. \u201cThey have got to go back where they came from.\u201dAdam Nossiter reported from Paris, and Jason Horowitz from Rome.

{"Headline": "Trump Threatens Tariffs on $200 Billion in China Goods, Escalating Fight", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump further escalated his trade fight with China on Monday, saying his administration was prepared to impose tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and potentially even more if Beijing continues to fight back.Mr. Trump\u2019s threat, in response to retaliatory measures by China, was the latest volley in a dizzying trade dispute that has pitted the world\u2019s two largest economies against each other and resulted in a seemingly endless game of one-upsmanship. The president called it punishment for what he said was an attempt by Beijing to keep the United States \u201cat a permanent and unfair disadvantage.\u201d\u201cChina apparently has no intention of changing its unfair practices related to the acquisition of American intellectual property and technology,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cRather than altering those practices, it is now threatening United States companies, workers, and farmers who have done nothing wrong,\u201d he added, calling China\u2019s response \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\u201cThe administration is essentially saying it is willing to bring a substantial amount of commercial activity in the Asia-Pacific to a screeching halt,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.On Monday, Mr. Trump raised the ante even further, saying that he had directed Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, to pursue another $200 billion worth of tariffs.China\u2019s Commerce Ministry responded swiftly to Mr. Trump\u2019s threat, issuing a statement on its website that warned that if the Trump administration followed through, China would \u201chave to adopt comprehensive measures combining quantity and quality to make a strong countermeasure.\u201dThe rapid succession of trade threats has left little time for negotiations that could potentially defuse tensions between the two countries.Whether President Xi Jinping of China agrees to bend to Mr. Trump\u2019s demands remains an open question. With his latest move, Mr. Trump has escalated his trade threats to such a level that China can now no longer issue a proportional response. Last year, the United States exported only $130.4 billion of goods to China in total.But trade experts say there are plenty of ways beyond tariffs that the Chinese government could retaliate \u2014 including slowing approvals for acquisitions made by American companies or stalling products at its ports. And Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive challenges may have left the Chinese president with little room to back down without looking weak to his own population.\u201cMr. Trump seems to be counting on the fact that China will soon run out of room to retaliate with its own tariffs on U.S. exports,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a trade expert at Cornell University. \u201cThis could prove to be a miscalculation since China has other effective levers it can use in a trade war, including disruptions of American businesses\u2019 sales operations and their supply chains that run through China.\u201dThe White House imposed the tariffs as punishment for what the administration said was years of unfair trade practices by the Chinese government, including pressuring American companies to hand over valuable trade secrets in order to operate in that country.Mr. Trump has been betting that the tariff threats will satisfy his supporters, who cheered his tough-on-China statements on the campaign trail. But China\u2019s retaliation could come back to bite some groups, especially American farmers, who are bearing the brunt of China\u2019s tariffs. And it is generating opposition within his own party among business-friendly Republicans who favor free trade and are increasingly concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s approach.Lawmakers of both parties have criticized the president\u2019s trade threats, but few have advocated taking direct action against him. Last week, Senate Republicans blocked a vote on legislation introduced by Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, which would have given Congress the ability to overturn certain tariffs. Senate leaders said such a bill would have simply been vetoed by the president.The trade conflict with China comes as the administration wages several trade conflicts at once. Rather than forming a coalition of countries to pressure China to change its trade practices, as some foreign leaders and trade officials have urged, the president has put allies on edge with tariffs on metal from Europe, Canada and Mexico and threats to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement.If they do go into effect, the tariffs would greatly increase the disruption for international companies, which are already anxious about the prospect of higher costs on many goods that move between the United States and China.Kip Eideberg, the vice president of public affairs and advocacy at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, which represents major American exporters like Caterpillar and John Deere, said the additional tariffs were \u201cterrible news\u201d for his industry.\u201cIt will effectively wipe out all of the gains that our industry has seen from tax reform and regulatory relief,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be creating more jobs, not wiping them out.\u201dThe Trump administration had said it intended its initial list of tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese products to have as little impact as possible on American consumers who purchase Chinese-made televisions, clothes and electronics. But ratcheting up the level of tariffs would eventually start to pinch consumers.However, there\u2019s a chance Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs may have a limited impact on China\u2019s nearly $13 trillion economy, which no longer depends as much on exports and can find other places besides the United States to sell its products.Some American buyers of Chinese goods may simply choose to pay the newly imposed tariffs rather than find new suppliers elsewhere. Brad Setser, a Treasury official in the Obama administration who is now an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China\u2019s exports to the United States in the listed categories could easily be halved by the tariffs. But they would not disappear entirely, as some Chinese products would still be competitive in terms of cost.Some of the same goods could probably be sold to other countries at slightly lower prices, further limiting the effect on the Chinese economy, Mr. Setser said. Moreover, China\u2019s exports could grow in other areas to offset any drop.The tariffs could have a longer-term effect on China, however.Devised as essentially a pre-emptive strike against China\u2019s enormous program to bolster high-tech industries, the Trump tariffs could limit eventual sales from China\u2019s emerging technologies. With the European Union also protesting the program called Made in China 2025, exports to Europe could suffer, too.For both sides, the issue has become far more than a struggle over nuts-and-bolts economics. It has become a battle over which country will dominate the high-wage, high-skill industries of tomorrow. Washington and Beijing alike see those industries as essential to protecting national security and to creating jobs.The Trump administration is pushing hard for curbs on the Made in China 2025 program. Beijing aims to make the country a leader in the manufacturing of advanced products, including computer microchips and commercial aircraft. The Trump administration\u2019s statement announcing tariffs managed to mention the Chinese industrial policy program no fewer than five times.But China appears just as determined to preserve the program. And the trade issue has become so prominent that the Chinese public has come to expect that Beijing will push back hard against the Trump administration\u2019s trade measures.\u201cThis pressure will be high,\u201d said Tu Xinquan, the director of the China Institute of World Trade Organization Studies in Beijing. \u201cThere is no way to move back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kim Jong-un Returns to China, This Time With Leverage", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, arrived in Beijing on Tuesday amid an escalating trade conflict between China and the United States, one that gives him an opening to play the powers against each other as Washington presses him to dismantle his nuclear arsenal.\u201cThis could be regarded as an intuitive response to Trump\u2019s escalation of the trade war,\u201d Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said of China\u2019s invitation to Mr. Kim.This time, Mr. Kim arrived much as any other foreign leader might, landing at Beijing\u2019s international airport and taking a stretch limousine to the city center.Analysts said Mr. Kim was likely to deliver a personal briefing about what happened behind closed doors during three hours of talks with Mr. Trump last week, the first meeting ever between leaders of the United States and North Korea. On Tuesday night, Mr. Xi gave a banquet for Mr. Kim and pledged that their two countries\u2019 relationship would continue to improve, according to Chinese state television.Andrei Lankov, a Russian expert on North Korea who has lived in the North and still has ties there, said Mr. Kim would be seeking to take advantage of the trade conflict between the United States and China, deepening their rivalry to ensure they do not join forces against him, as they did last year on the United Nations sanctions over his weapons program.\u201cHe wants to further disrupt the united China-U.S. front, which somewhat surprisingly emerged last year, but now is in critical condition due to the trade war,\u201d Mr. Lankov said.Mr. Kim is turning out to be a \u201cvery good diplomat,\u201d Mr. Lankov said. \u201cLike his late grandfather, Kim Il-sung, he might even learn how to outsmart the Chinese. The Americans under Trump was an unbelievably easy job.\u201dFor its part, China would like Mr. Kim to pull back a bit on the bonhomie he showed Mr. Trump in Singapore, analysts in Asia said.China, they said, sees the trade dispute with Washington as a more serious threat than Mr. Kim\u2019s nuclear arsenal. When Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump were threatening each other\u2019s countries with destruction last year, it gave China, as the North\u2019s main ally and trading partner, leverage with Mr. Trump on trade.Now, the analysts say, China would like Mr. Kim to be a little less cooperative with the United States \u2014 enough so that Mr. Trump might ease up on the tariffs, in the interest of keeping China in his corner where Pyongyang is concerned.\u201cChina will try to use Kim to restore leverage over Trump, but there is no reason for Kim to play along and throw away all the things he has gained in Singapore, including direct talks with the U.S.,\u201d said Bilahari Kausikan, a former foreign secretary of Singapore. \u201cKim wants to talk directly with the U.S.; why should he let China back into that equation?\u201dEssentially, Mr. Kausikan said, Mr. Trump is using Mr. Kim against China, and Mr. Kim is using China against the American president. \u201cIt\u2019s a triangular relationship, with Kim in the middle,\u201d he said.Mr. Kim\u2019s visit Tuesday seemed to indicate that relations between the neighboring states were warming, after recent years of strain as the young leader accelerated the country\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.China has backed United Nations sanctions against North Korea, but it has also recently indicated it is willing to offer economic assistance \u2014 a move some see as intended to anger Washington.In the joint declaration they signed in Singapore, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim pledged to move ahead with the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But the wording of the agreement was vague and included no clear timelines. The Americans insist that international sanctions will remain in place until Pyongyang completely dismantles its nuclear program.But China has suggested that the Singapore meeting alone was a good-will measure that should prompt the easing of those penalties.Mr. Lankov said that in his visit this week Mr. Kim would be trying to find ways to defuse the sanctions\u2019 pressure without openly flouting them. This could be done by sending North Korean workers to China on nonworkers\u2019 visas, for example.Mr. Kim has promised his people dramatic economic growth, and China is well positioned to advise the North on how to transform a rural economy into a modern one, experts said. A delegation of North Korean provincial leaders visited China recently to inspect major cities, where they saw glimmering skyscrapers and high-speed trains.Mr. Kim has yet to visit most of China, but even its most advanced cities might pale in comparison to Singapore, where he spent a night inspecting the skyline and visiting a high-end casino complex.But China should not risk its international reputation by going too far, Professor Kim said. \u201cSanctions were designed to bring the North to the negotiating table, and they came, but it\u2019s not clear whether they want to negotiate or buy time,\u201d Professor Kim said.\u201cIf China wants to let up pressure on North Korea now, that would be a bad move,\u201d he added. \u201cThey agreed to sanctions for the purpose of denuclearization. If they provide resources now, that is incompatible with their role at the U.N.\u201dAfter six years of never venturing abroad, and rarely accepting foreign visitors to his capital, Pyongyang, Mr. Kim almost appears to be making up for lost time.In addition to his Singapore meeting with Mr. Trump, he has been to South Korea twice this year. President Vladimir V. Putin has asked him to visit Russia in September, and after Mr. Trump said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d planned to invite Mr. Kim to the White House, North Korea\u2019s news media said Mr. Kim would accept.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified which two countries are engaged in a trade conflict. They are China and the United States, not China and North Korea.Luz Ding contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Moves to Shore Up Economy as Slowdown and Trade Fight Loom", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina in essence told the country\u2019s banks on Sunday that they do not have to sock away as much for a rainy day, allowing them to lend the money instead. The central bank said that, effective July 5, it would reduce by half a percentage point the share of overall deposits that commercial banks and other savings institutions are required to deposit at the central bank, a measure known as the reserve requirement ratio.It came with a catch: The banks must use the money to help heavily indebted companies or lend more to small businesses with little or no collateral to offer. It is the second time in just over two months that China has freed up money but given banks specific instructions on how to lend it.A further expansion of credit now could weaken confidence in China\u2019s currency, which has already slid in value against the dollar over the past week because of worries about a possible trade war with the United States.China has been cautious in the past about cutting the reserve ratio during times when its currency appears to be under strain. The move on Sunday \u201cmeans the People\u2019s Bank of China has put internal economic development as the priority,\u201d said Deng Haiqing, an economist at the China Finance 40 Forum, a Beijing research group.For 17 of the country\u2019s biggest banks, the rules announced on Sunday will free up $77 billion for lending. But the central bank said that this money had to be used as part of programs in which banks obtain shares in deeply troubled companies in exchange for writing off some of these companies\u2019 debts.Banks have been cautious about entering into these debt-for-equity programs, to the annoyance of government regulators. The regulators see the programs as a way to stabilize the balance sheets of heavily indebted companies.But the big banks have been wary of holding very large blocks of stock in troubled companies. They have tended to keep lending to these companies, often in the hope that government agencies might bail out the companies and help them pay off their bank debts.For the rest of the banking system \u2014 a hodgepodge of smaller commercial banks, postal savings banks and other savings institutions \u2014 the central bank\u2019s move frees up $31 billion. They were instructed to lend more to small businesses.Chinese-owned banks hold more than 98 percent of the Chinese banking market, and they operate under tight government control. But just in case any might not be inclined to follow closely the instructions on how to use the money from the reserves being freed up, the central bank also included a warning in its statement on Sunday evening: Government bank examiners would include compliance with Sunday\u2019s instructions in their compliance assessments.Officials in Beijing have taken other steps in recent months to tackle China\u2019s mountain of debt. They ordered bank auditors to use tougher standards by June 30 in labeling loans as overdue and nonperforming. Those instructions have put pressure on the banks to find solutions for deeply indebted borrowers instead of continuing to wait and hope that the government will offer bailouts.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War Spooks Markets as White House Waits for China to Blink", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration remained unmoved by those concerns, with a top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, insisting that China has more to lose from a trade fight than the United States. He also declared that Mr. Trump would not allow Beijing to simply buy its way out of an economic dispute by promising to import more American goods.\u201cPresident Trump has given China every chance to change its aggressive behavior,\u201d Mr. Navarro said in a call with reporters on Tuesday. \u201cChina does have much more to lose than we do.\u201dIn threatening tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods, the administration is betting that Beijing will blink first. It\u2019s a risky gamble by a White House that appears ready to forgo diplomatic negotiations in favor of punishing tariffs that could pinch consumers and companies on both sides of the Pacific.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he was ready for a fight, saying China would no longer take advantage of the United States.\u201cChina has been taking out $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuilding China,\u201d the president said during a speech in Washington before the National Federation of Independent Business. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken so much. It\u2019s time folks, it\u2019s time. So we\u2019re going to get smart, and we\u2019re going to do it right.\u201dMarkets sank on Tuesday in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement late Monday that his administration was preparing to impose even more tariffs than he originally threatened if China continued with its plan to retaliate against the United States.The benchmark Dow Jones index, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite all fell on Tuesday, following stock markets in Frankfurt, London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo and mainland China. Investors moved money into assets that are considered safe havens, like 10-year United States Treasury bonds and the Japanese yen.Shares of Boeing and Caterpillar, which are among America\u2019s leading exporters to China, fell sharply on Tuesday, along with soybean futures. China is the world\u2019s largest importer of soybeans, a key livestock feed, and Beijing has targeted American soybeans for retaliation with its own tariffs.Soybean prices dropped more than 7 percent at times during the morning before stabilizing in afternoon trading. Prices are at their lowest level in more than two years, creating a politically delicate issue for Mr. Trump, who has strong support from rural voters in farm states but whose trade policies have angered farmers and lawmakers who represent them.Senator Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement, \u201cThese aggressive trade actions will continue to have damaging consequences, including an impact on our commodity prices and farm futures, and increasing anxiety among the agricultural and business communities in Iowa.\u201d\u201cI think that the other side may have underestimated the strong resolve of President Donald J. Trump,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cIf they thought that they could buy us off cheap with a few extra products and allow them to continue to steal our intellectual property and crown jewels, that was a miscalculation. We hope going forward there are no more miscalculations.\u201dMr. Navarro said a trade clash would hurt China much more than the United States, given that the value of China\u2019s exports to the United States was nearly four times the value of what the United States exports to China.For weeks, the United States and China had appeared close to a deal that would have forestalled tariffs. Top advisers like Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, had advocated a deal that could avoid the devastating effects of a trade war, and spent hours in negotiations with Chinese officials.But after the Chinese refused to commit to a target for reducing their trade surplus with the United States or limit industrial subsidies, Mr. Trump rejected those proposals. And his resolve only hardened after lawmakers, including Democrats, criticized him as being weak on China when he agreed to help ease penalties on ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company accused of violating American sanctions.The president\u2019s approach has irritated some of Mr. Trump\u2019s own advisers, including Mr. Mnuchin, who has been frustrated by the process of the China talks, according to an official familiar with his thinking. Mr. Mnuchin has tried to explain in recent meetings how China is likely to respond to America\u2019s threats and the impact that retaliation could have on financial markets and the economy.He has also been trying to persuade Mr. Trump not to proceed with harsh restrictions on Chinese investment that would limit China\u2019s ability to do business in the United States. The Treasury Department is expected to release a proposal this month. Mr. Mnuchin, who is leading the effort, has been trying to convince Mr. Trump that the restrictions are unnecessary, given pending legislation that would expand national security reviews performed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.In late May, Mr. Mnuchin helped orchestrate a meeting between the president, top White House advisers and Republican lawmakers, where the Treasury secretary asked lawmakers to help make the case that legislation would be a more targeted way to police Chinese investment, three people with knowledge of the meeting said. But Mr. Navarro and Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who were also in the meeting, objected to that approach. The president ultimately overruled Mr. Mnuchin, saying that he supported the congressional legislation but that it alone wasn\u2019t enough.The decision to proceed with tariffs is a victory for hard-liners in the administration, like Mr. Navarro and Mr. Lighthizer. They had argued that the United States should not back down from trying to force China to make more fundamental changes to its economy, even if such measures would cause short-term pain for American businesses and consumers.On Tuesday, Mr. Navarro minimized the divisions between administration officials, saying the United States\u2019 negotiating process had not wavered and was \u201clinear.\u201d He said the idea of dropping the trade case in exchange for purchases \u2014 something the Chinese had offered the Americans in negotiations \u2014 had always been a \u201cnonstarter.\u201dIn his remarks Tuesday morning, Mr. Navarro took aim at China\u2019s internal plan to develop cutting-edge industries like robotics, new-energy vehicles, advanced rail and shipping, and aerospace. He said the country could not be allowed to dominate technologies that would be an important source of jobs and growth for the United States in decades to come.China has engaged in unfair practices, including cybertheft and \u201cinformation harvesting,\u201d to obtain technological secrets from the United States that would allow China to pull ahead in these industries, Mr. Navarro said.\u201cIt is important to note here that the actions President Trump has taken are purely defensive in nature,\u201d he said.There is broad agreement that China has engaged in unfair trade practices that have hurt American companies. But Mr. Trump\u2019s resort to tariffs as his primary negotiating tool has prompted swift condemnation from retail, technology and manufacturing companies, who said the approach could hurt American consumers and companies more than the White House realized.Jose Castaneda, spokesman for the Information Technology Industry Council, called the escalation of trade tensions with China \u201cirresponsible and counterproductive.\u201d\u201cWe appreciate President Trump\u2019s efforts to protect the United States\u2019 \u2018crown jewels,\u2019 but tariffs are simply the wrong way to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe White House needs to work with our allies to create lasting change with China. Too many jobs and livelihoods are at stake to get this wrong.\u201dMatt Priest, the president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said it was difficult to see how tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods wouldn\u2019t \u201cnegatively impact all Americans of every walk of life.\u201d\u201cThe president claimed that trade wars are easy to win, but what our industry has always known is coming true: Trade wars are costly, unnecessary and do harm to the American economy,\u201d he said.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington, Prashant S.

{"Headline": "Israel Charges a Former Minister With Spying for Iran", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The Israeli physician already had an extraordinary history: former legislator, agriculture expert, government minister and ex-convict imprisoned for having tried to smuggle 32,000 Ecstasy tablets disguised as M&M\u2019s into Israel.On Monday, another entry was added to the record of the convicted Israeli, Gonen Segev, minister of energy and infrastructure in the mid-1990s. The Israeli authorities announced that he had been charged with spying for Iran and had been operating as an agent for Iranian intelligence.Mr. Segev, 62, who has been living in Nigeria in recent years, was arrested in May \u201con suspicion of having aided the enemy in wartime and spied against the state of Israel,\u201d the Israeli police and the Shin Bet internal security agency said in a joint statement.He was arrested after he had traveled to Equatorial Guinea, where he was refused entry, having been declared wanted by Israel, and was held until the Israeli police could take him into custody. Mr. Segev was transferred to Israel and immediately detained for questioning.The counterespionage operation was directed by the Shin Bet and carried out with the cooperation of the Mossad, which is Israel\u2019s national intelligence agency, and Israel\u2019s military intelligence.On Friday, following an investigation, state prosecutors charged Mr. Segev in a Jerusalem court on counts related to passing information to the enemy. The court allowed publication of some details of the case on Monday, but other details remain classified.While not denying the accusations, Mr. Segev\u2019s lawyers said the details approved for publication portrayed the case in a much harsher light than the more comprehensive picture that emerged from the complete charge sheet.The tidbits released by the police and the Shin Bet read like something from a classic spy novel. In 2012, they said, contact had been made between Mr. Segev and people from Iran\u2019s embassy in Nigeria. The first contact was with Iran\u2019s agricultural attach\u00e9 in Nigeria. Mr. Segev\u2019s biography on the website of the Israeli Parliament lists his profession as \u201cagriculturalist.\u201dAccording to the Shin Bet, he was recruited to work as an agent for Iranian intelligence.Mr. Segev is said to have traveled to Iran twice to see his handlers and met them in hotels and apartments around the world. He received secret communications equipment for encoding messages between him and his handlers, according to the statement by the Israeli authorities.\u201cSegev transferred to his handlers information on \u2014 inter alia \u2014 the energy economy, security sites in Israel, and diplomatic and security personnel and buildings,\u201d the statement said. Explaining how Mr. Segev may have gained access to up-to-date information, despite his criminal record and sojourn in Africa, the Israeli authorities said he had maintained contacts with Israeli citizens in the foreign affairs and security fields and worked to put some of them in contact with Iranian intelligence agents by \u201cmisleading the former and presenting the latter as innocent Iranian businessmen.\u201dMr. Segev may be the most prominent Israeli to date to be publicly suspected of espionage for the Iranians. But it is not clear that Mr. Segev had much to offer.Eli Zohar and Moshe Mazor, lawyers who are representing Mr. Segev, said in an emailed statement: \u201cWe have been accompanying Mr. Segev since the date of his arrival in Israel about a month ago. An indictment was recently submitted, the details of which are overwhelmingly classified at the state\u2019s request. At this preliminary stage one can already say that the publication that was approved lends a very severe semblance to the affair, even though the indictment, the full details of which are classified, as noted, paints a different picture.\u201dMr. Segev, a medical doctor, had made a career for himself in the top rungs of Israeli public life. He was elected to Parliament in 1992 as a member of Tzomet, a right-wing party led by Rafael Eitan, a former chief of staff of the Israeli military. Breaking away with a few other legislators to form a new party, Yiud, he joined Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s Labor-led government and served as minister of energy and infrastructure. He remained in the post for months after Mr. Rabin\u2019s assassination, in the government led by Shimon Peres, until the 1996 election that first brought Benjamin Netanyahu to power.His career went downhill from there.Mr. Segev became a businessman but was convicted of credit card fraud and attempting to receive benefits fraudulently. In 2004 he was arrested after being accused of trying to smuggle dangerous drugs from the Netherlands into Israel.According to reports at the time, he stashed 32,000 Ecstasy tablets in bags in a locker at Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport and tried to use an expired diplomatic passport with a falsified date to avoid airport security. Some of the drugs were hidden in M&M\u2019s boxes.His lawyer at the time was quoted as saying a friend had asked Mr. Segev to take a gift of chocolates back to Israel.Convicted in 2005 of drug smuggling, forgery and fraud, the former minister received a five-year prison sentence as well as a $27,500 fine. He was granted early release from prison in 2007 after his sentence was cut for good behavior.More recently Mr. Segev worked as a doctor in Nigeria, where he treated the Israeli Embassy\u2019s staff and members of the Jewish community. Hahadashot News said that while in Nigeria, Mr. Segev married a diplomat from the German Embassy, which may help explain how he obtained the foreign passport that had allowed him to travel to Iran. Mr. Segev and his German wife have since divorced.Ronen Bergman contributed reporting from Tel Aviv.Advertisement"}

With each erosion of individual liberties, with every election gone awry, the commentariat disgorges a fresh flotilla of analyses of the world\u2019s ailments and favored prescriptions for fixing them.Some fret about the slide toward absolutism in central European countries ranging from Poland to Turkey. Others cast a wary eye on the wave of populist tremors that fringe parties in mature nations like France and Germany have tried to ride. Brexit was a Code Red alert.And of course, the most energetic hand-wringing is reserved for what has befallen the United States \u2014 not just the election of a president with little visible respect for democratic norms but the seeming ease with which Russia cyberburrowed into email systems and social media networks. Such is the state of fear \u2014 Freedom House declares democracy to be facing \u201cits most serious crisis in decades\u201d \u2014 that even economists are leaping across customary academic boundaries into political science in order to opine.To take a vivid example, the United States has seen its rate of expansion slide from 4 percent in the late 1990s to a bit more than 2 percent at present. At the same time, the gap between rich and poor has exploded, leaving many of those near the bottom enduring lower standards of living than they faced decades ago.As Moyo notes, left to its own devices, capitalism produces income inequality. This, however, is within the power of governments to redress. While inequality has risen in Europe as well, progressive taxation and robust social safety nets have kept the gap there manageable.Moyo ticks off seven headwinds \u2014 from aging societies to limited natural resources \u2014 as impediments to growth. In the United States, for example, educational attainment is a major cause for concern; on a 2015 math test administered globally to 15-year-olds, the United States came in 30th out of 35 major countries.While many of these are, indeed, scary prospects, her most vexing fear \u2014 with much justification \u2014 is the rising tide of protectionism. Partial blame goes to the financial crisis and ensuing recession, but globalization advocates must also be held responsible for the drift (perhaps now, a scramble) toward more protectionist policies. They failed to recognize that for all the winners (think of how many products we buy that are better and cheaper because they are made elsewhere), there are also losers (think of the shuttered factories throughout the industrial heartland).However, rather than question capitalism and globalization, Moyo mounts a vigorous and welcome defense of both. She argues that they are the most likely avenues to high economic growth, which she pronounces to be the holy grail.She is surely correct that capitalism and globalization have done more to improve living standards than any other economic arrangement. But is democracy a necessary ingredient? China\u2019s mixed system of state-directed capitalism has produced stunning results: In just one generation, China has moved 300 million people out of poverty.Moyo is appropriately respectful of China\u2019s accomplishments and appropriately concerned that if proponents of liberal democracy don\u2019t figure out how to fix what\u2019s broken, systems like China\u2019s could become more prevalent, with severe implications for individual liberties.Moyo is not all darkness. She recognizes the vast improvements that have been made around the globe in public health and even in economic well-being, particularly in emerging nations. Indeed, she doesn\u2019t always seem sure whether the glass is half empty or half full. At one point, she mourns incomes that have remained flat in the United States since 1970, after adjusting for inflation. At another, she extols the success of democratic capitalism in generating a 30-fold rise in earnings throughout the 20th century.And then there\u2019s the matter of productivity. Amid the near hysteria over the future of work, even thoughtful commentators often get twisted up in its complications. Uncharacteristically for an economist, Moyo is among them.She rightly pronounces improved worker efficiency to be the key to economic growth and laments its current sluggish rate of improvement across the developed world. But then she goes on to climb a familiar wall by expressing worry about robots and automation when, in fact, significantly greater productivity can occur only by supplementing workers with machines \u2014 yes, with robots and automation.There are other problems as well. She muddles the concept of change versus rate of change, declaring global productivity to be on the decline, though what she means is that the rate of growth of global productivity has been waning.In any book so crammed with facts and figures, small errors are bound to creep in. The United States and Europe together have many more than 10 cities with populations above one million. India, with its sparkling 7 percent growth rate, can hardly be considered a laggard nation (as Moyo declares three times). Lastly, there\u2019s the occasional infelicitous phrase, like \u201cthe leaders of leading nations.\u201dTurning to politics, Moyo documents how trust in government has fallen as polarization and gridlock have risen. For this, she blames \u201cshort-termism.\u201d Eager to win elections, politicians make decisions to maximize voter support rather than those that would do the most for long-term growth. Meanwhile, in Washington, gridlock has slowed action to a crawl.It was not always thus and Moyo takes a valiant stab at explaining why. She cites the move in recent years toward more laissez-faire capitalism, the rise of the 24-hour news cycle, the emergence of social media and a shift in power toward corporations and wealthy philanthropists. Gerrymandering and an avalanche of political money, for both electoral campaigns and lobbying, are additional (and related) flaws.These and other villains dance across her stage before Moyo unveils her proposed fixes, all designed to reform the American political system so that capitalism can flourish. They number 10, from the incontrovertible (getting money out of politics) to the incredible (imposing what amounts to literacy tests on would-be voters and weighting voting toward \u201cthe best-informed segment of the electorate\u201d). Her other ideas include longer terms for elected officials coupled with term limits, less gerrymandering and mandatory voting. There are oddities as well, like restricting the ability of successor governments to modify long-term agreements entered into by their predecessors and setting minimum qualifications for officeholders.Helpfully, Moyo includes as an appendix a chart showing how 14 leading countries rank in terms of her goals for reforming democracy. By her tally, unsteady Mexico ranks at the top (having achieved five of Moyo\u2019s milestones) while Europe\u2019s economic engine, Germany, ranks at the bottom, with a goose egg.That may leave readers scratching their heads.Steven Rattner was counselor to the secretary of the Treasury in the Obama administration.

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26.The rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain. Fears of a trade war have made investors anxious; emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies have all sold off; and economic data in some regions has softened in recent weeks.\u201cIn an uncertain world with significant downside economic tail risks, technology has been seen to be, correctly, relatively stable,\u201d Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson, strategists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.Such economic uneasiness in the years since the financial crisis had caused investors to pour money into the sector. The likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have come to be viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver growth in most economic conditions. With interest rates at historic lows and economic growth lackluster, investors have found that appealing.In March, some of the best-performing tech stocks began to struggle. Facebook\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech companies and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms.The pullback was a rare dip for a sector that had risen consistently for the past several years. Since stock markets in the United States bottomed out in March 2009, shares of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet have all gained more than 500 percent; Netflix is up 6,500 percent. The S.&P. 500 has risen about 300 percent over that period.How long can the biggest tech stocks dominate the market? For a while, Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson said. They pointed out that earnings and sales growth, not a speculative increase in valuations, have driven the post-financial crisis run-up.\u201cUnlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson wrote.Advertisement"}

Greeks Who Fled Are Staying Put.", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Mr. Kakoyiannis raised a glass of pilsner beer, he toasted his girlfriend at a German cafe in D\u00fcsseldorf, alongside 40 of their friends. The group, part of a club of expatriate Greek engineers, was welcoming several newcomers who had fled Greece in just the last few months.\u201cThe situation isn\u2019t getting better,\u201d Mr. Kakoyiannis said. \u201cWhen you realize that your country has become a cemetery of dreams, you need to find dreams elsewhere.\u201dAnd they are still leaving.Yet for many Greeks who escaped their fractured economy, the optimism seems premature. A fifth of Greeks are still unemployed, and the economy remains smaller than it was a decade ago. And the political uncertainty in Italy, with the pall it casts over the fate of the euro, has the potential to undermine the progress that Greece has achieved.So many Greeks have descended on D\u00fcsseldorf in recent years that a mini-Athens is thriving. Near the central train station, Greek tavernas and cafes are filled with cosmopolitan young Greeks sipping frapp\u00e9 coffee and puffing on rolled cigarettes, a scene reminiscent of any Athenian square.A boutique, run by Greeks from the wave of guest workers in the \u201950s, offers white taffeta baby dresses and sugarcoated almonds, traditional symbols of Greek Orthodox baptisms. At the Cafe Byzantio, Greeks savor baklava desserts while playing backgammon. Tickets for trains, planes and buses headed home are sold at a busy Greek travel agency festooned with nostalgia-inducing posters of the Parthenon and the sunny Aegean Islands.\u201cEngineers are connected to the development of a country,\u201d said Martha Ouzounidou, a chemical engineer from Thessaloniki who came to D\u00fcsseldorf in October after landing work at a German maker of electric car batteries. \u201cBut there is no development happening in Greece.\u201dEngineers who stay behind tend to be supported by parents, or are finding mainly low-paying jobs working on hotel construction linked to tourism, one of the country\u2019s few growth sectors, Mr. Kapoglou said.At the cafe where his club gathered on a recent Saturday, there were at least five new Greek engineers who had moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in recent months. They quickly landed jobs. The club now counts nearly 900 members.\u201cThe Germans have welcomed us,\u201d Mr. Kapoglou said. \u201cThey want highly skilled people.\u201dBefore that, he made ends meet with three research jobs that barely paid the rent. Over family objections, he sent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s outside Greece and was soon offered two jobs in Silicon Valley. To stay closer to home, Mr. Kakoyiannis opted for a job near D\u00fcsseldorf, where he works for a German technology firm with 180 other engineers, designing antennas for cellphones and other wireless devices.\u201cIn Greece, it was a mess,\u201d Ms. Rapti said. \u201cIn Germany, their approach is, \u2018If we help you make money, you\u2019ll pay taxes.\u2019\u201dStill, while many Greeks are planning careers and even families in Germany, the transition isn\u2019t always easy.D\u00fcsseldorf\u2019s drizzly skies, the direct demeanor of the Germans and the difficulty in making German friends \u2014 even after learning the language \u2014 can be a struggle. Nevermind homesickness, broken dreams and a gradual acceptance that the lives they wanted to build in Greece may materialize only elsewhere.Mr. Kapoglou and his wife, Katerina, an environmental engineer, are among the few who might dare to return. Although they have little faith in the Greek government, they are betting that they can parlay their engineering experience and international business exposure in Germany into a profitable business.Yet it may take years, or even another generation, before a groundswell follows them.In their tidy brick apartment complex outside D\u00fcsseldorf, Mr. Kakoyiannis and Ms. Rapti settled down after the engineering club meeting and made a Sunday lunch of traditional Greek souvlakia, pita and garlicky tzatziki.Mr. Kakoyiannis let drop that his mother had been pressing him on when they would return to Greece.\u201cGo back to what?\u201d he recalled replying. \u201cTo no job and no future?\u201dSweethearts since they met in university, the couple had put off having children during the Greek crisis. Now, they are planning on having a baby \u2014 though not, as their parents wished, back in Greece.\u201cIn Germany, we have hope for the future,\u201d Ms. Rapti said. \u201cAnd so will our child.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labor Unions Will Be Smaller After Supreme Court Decision, but Maybe Not Weaker", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWith the Supreme Court striking down laws that require government workers to pay union fees, one thing is clear: Most public-sector unions in more than 20 states with such laws are going to get smaller and poorer in the coming years.The court\u2019s decision is the latest evidence that moves to weaken unions are exacting a major toll. Beyond the dropout campaigns aimed at members, conservatives are bringing lawsuits to retroactively recover fees collected by unions from nonmembers.In May, President Trump signed three executive orders making it easier to fire government workers and reining in the role of unions representing federal workers.Dropping out of a union is a more attractive proposition now that workers no longer have to pay a so-called agency fee, typically about 80 percent of union dues, if they choose not to belong to a union. (Those doing so generally account for a small fraction of the workers whom public-sector unions represent.)In the five years after Michigan passed a law ending mandatory union fees in 2012, the number of active members of the Michigan Education Association dropped by about 25 percent, according to government filings, a much faster attrition rate than before. Its annual receipts fell by more than 10 percent, adjusting for inflation.Still, the more interesting question is whether the unions, whatever the blow to their ranks and finances, will be substantially weaker.Union leaders insist that they won\u2019t \u2014 that the crisis posed by the case, Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, has brought more cohesion and energy to their ranks.\u201cNo one wanted this case,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cBut the gestalt around the country has been to turn an existential threat into an opportunity to engage with our members like never before.\u201dThere are reasons to believe that the claim is not merely desperate bravado.One parallel to the current development is a 2014 Supreme Court ruling known as Harris v. Quinn, which struck down mandatory union fees for home-based workers who serve private individuals but are paid through government programs like Medicaid.As of late 2013, the Service Employees International Union represented about 60,000 public-sector home care and child-care workers in Illinois, about 40 percent of whom were union members. (The rest paid agency fees.)Receipts for the service employees union local representing home-based workers in Illinois dropped significantly in the four years after the decision. But an aggressive membership campaign largely offset the loss of members.It also built and reinforced personal relationships with members, who could be summoned to make demands of politicians in nearly every legislative district.\u201cOur members go and meet Sam McCann,\u201d said Keith Kelleher, who until last year was president of the local representing these home-based workers, referring to a Republican state senator. \u201cHe says yes most of time because he\u2019s got hundreds of members in his district.\u201dIn anticipation of the Janus ruling, major public-sector unions have invested heavily in recent years in reaching out to current members \u2014 an effort known as internal organizing \u2014 and to prospective members to keep their numbers from dropping precipitously and to create a more activist culture. They plan to continue funding these initiatives even if it requires cutting spending elsewhere.Mary Kay Henry, the international president of the service employees union, said the union used projections derived from its experience after the Harris decision to cut its budget by 30 percent shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. She said the union, which represents about two million workers, roughly half of them in the public sector, was focusing its spending on recruiting members and mobilizing workers to face down employers and elect pro-labor politicians.\u201cWe intend to prioritize the political and organizing work,\u201d she said.Government filings show that the union has cut contributions to organizations that it had traditionally supported, including the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, People for the American Way, and the National Immigration Law Center. (The union says it provides nonmonetary support to some of these groups.)Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said that his union\u2019s two highest priorities going forward would be its internal outreach and helping to organize nonunionized workplaces, and that the union would probably \u201chave to make adjustments\u201d to fund these programs. The union spent more than $15 million during the 2016 campaign cycle supporting political candidates, parties and committees.Mr. Saunders said the union, which represents over 1.2 million workers, had held one-on-one conversations with nearly 900,000 members since 2013. Among the goals of these conversations, he said, is to inoculate members against campaigns by conservative groups to urge them to quit.\u201cIf someone knocks on their door talking about how you can get out of the union \u2014 \u2018it would be so easy, you don\u2019t have to pay union dues\u2019 \u2014 our folks are prepared to tell them to get the hell off their doorstep,\u201d he said.Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a political scientist at Columbia University who studies corporate and conservative efforts to weaken labor, said organized interest groups had traditionally had the greatest impact on elections by educating members about candidates and through on-the-ground canvassing rather than large campaign contributions. \u201cIt\u2019s doubly so for unions,\u201d he said, adding that the focus \u201cseems like a wise decision, but the effectiveness has to be weighed against what happens to membership and overall revenues.\u201dThere is also a substantial wind at their back: a rising energy on the left during the Trump era. Workers in particular appear more willing to take to the streets and state capitols, including tens of thousands of teachers who walked off their jobs this year in conservative states to protest the underfunding of public education.\u201cWe\u2019ve had many, many folks calling: \u2018I heard about this legislation you helped design. How do we make this happen?\u2019\u201d said Deborah Axt, co-executive director of Make the Road New York, an advocacy group pushing the measure. Ms. Axt said the group planned to campaign for the legislation\u2019s enactment this summer.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a 13 percent jump in membership because of the walkout,\u201d said Ed Allen, president of the Oklahoma City American Federation of Teachers. \u201cWe have over 300 people signed up to work in political campaigns. We\u2019ve never seen those kinds of numbers before.\u201dJack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If the Robots Come for Our Jobs, What Should the Government Do?", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLots of smart technologists and futurists are convinced that we are on the cusp of a world in which artificial intelligence, robotics and other technologies will make a large portion of today\u2019s jobs obsolete.Some of the potential answers are big, bold ideas that have gained traction in particular ideological circles. A universal basic income \u2014 the idea that the government simply give each citizen enough money every month to support basic needs \u2014 has fans among both free-market libertarians and socialists.But other ideas starting to percolate in economic policy circles may have advantages in terms of cost and political viability.As an example, he says the Federal Reserve and other policymakers should commit more energetically to pursuing a \u201cmaximum employment\u201d goal set in federal law, even if it means being willing to tolerate a bit more risk of inflation.Mr. Paul argues for overhauling intellectual property law so that the companies that develop valuable patents and trademarks don\u2019t have such a lengthy monopoly on their innovations. Over time this would probably mean that more of the benefits of technology would accrue to labor rather than capital. And he sees promise in work-sharing programs like those that have been used to help keep unemployment low in Germany even during economic downturns. The idea is that if a company needs to cut 20 percent of its work force because of new innovations, it is better for society if it cuts each worker\u2019s hours by 20 percent rather than laying off 20 percent of its staff.Mr. Paul argues that rapid shifts in the skills and technologies demanded by the modern economy strengthen the case for publicly funded higher education and training to help workers adapt.This set of proposals is based on the idea that the emerging wave of digital disruption won\u2019t result in a permanent loss of demand for workers, but rather shifts in what types of work the economy needs. It\u2019s not unlike early 20th-century America\u2019s shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial one, or its shift from an industrial to an information economy over the last half-century.While these ideas are coming from a decidedly left-of-center place, it\u2019s striking how some of them overlap with the goals of centrist business interests and even some conservative thinkers.\u201cLifelong learning accounts would be interesting,\u201d Ms. Lund said, \u201cand they could be federally funded or they could be funded by employers, but what you want is for people to be able to avail themselves of a two-month leave to take courses so that they can keep up with change.\u201dMs. Lund and her McKinsey colleagues also recommend new approaches to making job benefits like health insurance and retirement funds more \u201cportable,\u201d so that people who work as independent contractors or who change jobs frequently can have more stability.To the degree that many of these ideas imply a more activist government role, conservatives tend to be more leery. But Michael Strain, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says the risks of disruption are high enough that some flexibility may be needed.In particular, we could be headed toward a bifurcated labor market, where people with advanced skills earn higher wages but where workers without those skills see technology drive down demand for their services, depressing their pay.By expanding the earned-income tax credit or creating similar programs, for example, the government could increase the effective pay of jobs that otherwise would pay so little that Americans might choose to sit at home rather than take them.The unemployment rate is currently at its lowest level in 18 years, and the bigger challenge for the economy now is that productivity is too low, not that technology is causing productivity to be so high as to drive people out of jobs.So this discussion over potential policy responses to a future that may or may not arrive remains speculative \u2014 all the more so in an era of congressional dysfunction.But there\u2019s a recent lesson worth learning from. Globalization and automation caused upheaval in the manufacturing industry from the 1980s through the early 2000s, and millions of factory workers lost their jobs. The disruption to communities is still being felt, and is arguably at the root of a lot of the biggest social and economic problems of this era. If a similar technological wave is about to wash over millions of service workers, we would all do well to try to keep history from repeating itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Mexico Could Elect First Native American Woman to Congress", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 For Deb Haaland, the New Mexico community activist seeking to make history in her bid to become the first Native American woman elected to Congress, proclaiming defiance to the Trump administration has echoes in the brutal history of the Southwest.In an explicitly progressive campaign emphasizing her criticism of Mr. Trump on matters ranging from immigration to tribal sovereignty, Ms. Haaland, 57, shook New Mexico\u2019s political establishment by sailing to a primary victory on Tuesday over five Democratic opponents in a district encompassing Albuquerque.Some voters attributed Ms. Haaland\u2019s win, which may position her favorably in the general election against Janice Arnold-Jones, a Republican, to her pioneering effort to frame issues from a Native American perspective in a state long dominated by Anglo and Hispanic politicians.\u201cDeb has been forceful in challenging a president known for his discriminatory remarks about native peoples,\u201d said Cheryl Fairbanks, executive director of the Native American Budget and Policy Institute, a group in Albuquerque seeking to empower indigenous communities.\u201cWe\u2019ve endured federal policies aimed at terminating and marginalizing us, so it\u2019s unifying to have someone to speak with such pride of her native background,\u201d Ms. Fairbanks said. \u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of a historic moment if she wins.\u201dMs. Haaland said her great-grandfather was taken in the 1880s from his family that was part of Laguna Pueblo, one of New Mexico\u2019s 23 Indian tribes, and sent to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. Ms. Haaland said her grandmother was similarly separated from her parents and placed in a Santa Fe boarding school at the age of 8.\u201cIt was shameful and inhumane then to separate families and it\u2019s shameful and inhumane now,\u201d said Ms. Haaland, emphasizing that she supports defunding the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.Mr. Trump, she said, has shown hostility toward Native Americans, most publicly with his repeated use of the slur \u201cPocahontas\u201d to describe Senator Elizabeth Warren, the prominent Democrat from Massachusetts. But it has also been demonstrated in policy, she said, with the administration\u2019s recent contention, during a discussion of Medicaid benefits on tribal lands, that Native Americans should be considered as a racial category \u2014 a move that some tribes believe could impinge on their treaty rights as sovereign governments.Ms. Haaland\u2019s perspectives seem to have resonated with voters in the Albuquerque-area district, which was a Republican bastion for 40 years after its creation in 1969. The last Republican to hold the seat was Heather Wilson, who was replaced by a Democrat in 2009 and now serves as Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of the Air Force. Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Democrat currently representing the district, won the Democratic nomination for governor in Tuesday\u2019s primary.The race against Ms. Arnold-Jones, a conservative former state representative who ran unopposed in Tuesday\u2019s primary, is expected to largely turn on issues such as immigration, gun laws, policies aimed at strengthening New Mexico\u2019s weak economy, and criticism or support of Mr. Trump. The district has favored Democrats, giving Ms. Haaland a presumed edge, but Ms. Arnold-Jones is emphasizing her record promoting transparency in government in the State Legislature and her credentials as a former small-business owner and volunteer.Ms. Haaland is benefiting from years in Democratic politics in New Mexico, running unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2014 and being elected as chairwoman of the state Democratic Party in 2015. A graduate of the University of New Mexico School of Law, she has been involved as an activist here for more than a decade, working to boost voter turnout.In recent years, a variety of factors, including increased revenue from casino gambling in Indian country, have begun to draw some Native American candidates more prominently into New Mexico\u2019s political landscape.But Ms. Haaland is not seen as a niche candidate. Political analysts here say her resounding win in the primary \u2014 she defeated the closest of five challengers by nearly 2 to 1 \u2014 involved cobbling together a coalition of liberal voters drawn to her support for issues such as gay rights, renewable energy projects and expansion of public health care.But others point to how her policy views as a Native American woman \u2014 forged by working her way through law school and raising her daughter as a single mother \u2014 resonate with a broad section of voters.\u201cHer candidacy could finally give us a voice on the inside,\u201d Ms. Gatewood said. \u201cFor us, that\u2019s critical.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "First Canada Tried to Charm Trump. Now It\u2019s Fighting Back.", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "FeatureInside Justin Trudeau\u2019s campaign against the American trade war.Supported byAmerican ignorance about Canada has long been a fact of life \u2014 and an eye-rolling joke \u2014 for Canadians. But with the election of Trump, Americans\u2019 lack of knowledge suddenly appeared to the inner circle of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government to be a geopolitical threat. What was most troubling was less that Trump lacked a sophisticated understanding of Canada-United States relations but that he apparently deliberately didn\u2019t care to develop one. He seemed to treat facts as negotiating tools, as if conducting diplomacy with an ally was the same as a brass-knuckled, zero-sum Manhattan real estate transaction. At a closed-door fund-raiser, Trump bragged about this tactic, gleefully recounting a White House meeting with Trudeau in which he insisted, against Trudeau\u2019s protestations, that American had a trade deficit with Canada. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d He then doubled down on his fact-challenged assertion via tweet: \u201cP.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn\u2019t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S. (negotiating), but they do ... they almost all do ... and that\u2019s how I know!\u201dTrump\u2019s deficit claim was based on measuring trade in goods, but trade balances are commonly measured by goods and services, and by that score, the website of the United States trade representative acknowledged that rather than having a trade deficit with Canada, the United States had a relatively small but substantial trade surplus of $8.4 billion in 2017. Canada is the second-largest trading partner with the United States, with commerce of $673.9 billion in 2017; Canadians buy more goods from the United States than from China, Japan and the United Kingdom combined; nearly nine million jobs in America depend on trade with Canada. No nation is more deeply entwined with the United States, the weave so complex that it is no exaggeration to say that each country depends on the other for economic well-being, civil order and survival, though of course the United States has a much, much larger economy and Canada is more at the mercy of its neighbor.This interdependent relationship raised difficult questions for the Canadian government in light of Trump\u2019s evident animosity and imperviousness to facts. How to politely make the case for free trade and Nafta in a way that didn\u2019t insult the thin-skinned president? How to make an evidence-based argument in a post-truth political environment? How to respectfully, firmly but subtly, preferably attracting as little attention as possible \u2014 qualities that Canadians understand well \u2014 guide Trump to change his mind about Canada? Put another way, how to engage in a covert propaganda campaign aimed at Trump, without upsetting his elephantine ego?Soon after the election, an elite unit known as Team Canada was established inside the prime minister\u2019s office to forge connections with the new administration; Freeland was promoted to minister of foreign affairs and put in charge of the most consequential portfolio in generations for a nation suddenly in peril. She and a select few of Trudeau\u2019s senior aides quietly made their way to New York to meet with Jared Kushner and other top transition officials, always away from the press and Trump Tower to avoid giving any impression of grandstanding during the chaotic early days of the transition.Scores of Canadian officials subsequently fanned out across America, from cabinet ministers to consuls general, meeting with more than 300 members of Congress and 65 governors and lieutenant governors. Informally, aides discreetly but systematically set out to establish relationships with incoming senior White House officials, the soft-power ingratiation efforts methodically assigned, including the prime minister\u2019s accompanying Ivanka Trump to the Canadian feel-good Broadway musical \u201cCome From Away.\u201d Freeland, whose portfolio included befriending her three counterparts \u2014 the secretary of state, the commerce secretary and the United States trade representative \u2014 placed on her desk a quote from President Reagan about Canadian-American relations that began: \u201cWe\u2019re more than friends and neighbors and allies; we are kin.\u201dFreeland was uniquely qualified to take the lead in Canada\u2019s attempt to sway the president and the United States to respect its longstanding alliance with Canada. Trump was busily selecting plutocrats to populate his cabinet, and Freeland had written a best-selling nonfiction book titled \u201cPlutocrats,\u201d a close study of the excesses of the superrich in the age of growing inequality. As trade minister, she successfully concluded a new free-trade pact with the European Union in 2016, a rare instance of openness prevailing in recent times. From her time as a highly connected expat business journalist in New York City, Freeland was at home in the wealthy real estate and media circles of Manhattan. (Freeland\u2019s husband is a reporter for The Times.) She brought a level of sophistication and familiarity with the American elite at the absolute highest level that was unparalleled in the Canadian government. And so, suddenly, the political neophyte was a geopolitical asset.During our conversation, Freeland \u2014 who insists that everyone call her Chrystia \u2014 came off as acutely conscious of the perils of the moment, of how a provocation or an insult, perceived or real, could damage Canada\u2019s relationship with the United States, or at least with the current president. What has been the most durable and reliable alliance on the planet for the past century now seemed to hang on one man\u2019s easily excited sense of grievance. The minister carefully chose her words as she described how Canada had responded to the repeated threats from Trump and explained the thinking behind a series of \u201creport cards\u201d the government had commissioned to educate American leaders on trade with Canada.\u201cWe should be clear from the outset that a core point of the Trump administration\u2019s view of trade is to view a deficit or a surplus as a \u2018report card\u2019 on whether the relationship is working,\u201d she said.The Canadian report cards were simple and easy to understand; with primer-like graphic illustrations and pie charts, the two-page presentations aimed at the level of sophistication of a slightly dim fifth-grade student. \u201cCanada is Ohio\u2019s #1 CUSTOMER,\u201d the Ohio-specific report shouted, further noting that 308,700 jobs in Ohio depend on Canada, with $18.9 billion in annual exports in goods from Ohio to Canada, compared with $12.2 billion of goods imported from Canada. \u201cCanada buys more goods from Ohio,\u201d the report card concluded, \u201cthan its next eight largest merchandise export markets combined.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to the economic relationship between Canada and the United States, I\u2019m optimistic because it is a balanced, mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d Freeland said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the numbers say. That\u2019s not rhetorical flourish. The numbers reflect a deep economic reality. Our labor standards are comparable; if anything, labor standards are higher in Canada. Environmental standards are comparable; if anything, they\u2019re higher in Canada. So if you\u2019re worried about jobs getting outsourced to a country that is cheating because of lower wages or undercutting labor or environmental standards, that\u2019s something we understand on behalf of Canadian workers.\u201dThe obvious implication, regarding Nafta at least, was that if Canada wasn\u2019t the problem, then Mexico was. But the minister didn\u2019t say so, and what remained unspoken was telling. Many people in the United States, she allowed, are upset about the abusive trade practices of other countries: \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t apply to how Americans think about Canadians.\u201dLast June, Freeland gave a speech to Parliament that was met with near universal praise, not a few tears and the jubilant and grateful embrace of Trudeau. Freeland had, as always, done her homework for the speech, carefully reading keynote addresses on foreign policy by past prime ministers, including the Nobel laureate Lester Pearson, who initiated the idea of blue-helmeted United Nations peacekeepers during the Suez Crisis in the 1950s \u2014 the kind of enlightened leadership that is fundamental to Canada\u2019s self-image as a good global citizen.Freeland spoke emotionally about her grandfather\u2019s fighting \u2014 and her great-uncle\u2019s dying \u2014 in the Second World War and laid out Canada\u2019s geopolitical strategy in the Trump era of American retreat from world leadership. Canada needed to \u201cset our own clear and sovereign course,\u201d she said. Maintaining international institutions as a form of protection against American strong-arming was never spoken outright, of course, but it was impossible to miss the meaning: \u201cCanada has a huge interest in an international order based on rules. One in which might is not always right. One in which more powerful countries are constrained in their treatment of smaller ones by standards that are internationally respected, enforced and upheld.\u201dAfter Freeland graduated from Harvard in the early \u201990s and before going to Oxford, she traveled to Ukraine and turned herself into a stringer journalist, reporting on the implosion of the Soviet Union, giving her a close view of the fast-moving and unpredictable spectacle of an empire collapsing. She has said that she thinks a lot about the \u201cfraught moment\u201d we now find ourselves in and how it resembles the period immediately after the First World War, when the hyperglobalized rule of the British Empire ended and resulted in the rise of fascism and the catastrophe of World War II.\u201cI think there are two related megaproblems in the world right now,\u201d she told me in her office. \u201cThe first problem is that the rules-based order is under more strain than any time since it was invented after World War II. The other very related issue is authoritarianism is starting to make gains on democracy. They\u2019re not the same thing. The second is as much about domestic policy as it is about international politics. But they are closely related. I worry that we \u2014 and I mean Canadians, but I think this applies broadly to citizens of Western democracy \u2014 take for granted these great institutions and liberal democracy because we\u2019ve had them for a while.\u201d\u201cI believed a comprehensive free-trade agreement with the United States would give us privileged access to the largest and richest market in the world,\u201d Mulroney, now 79, told me. \u201cThere is more than one way to skin a cat.\u201dWhen trade negotiations stalled, Mulroney reached out to President Reagan with a simple message: If he could strike a deal on nuclear weapons with America\u2019s archenemy, the Soviet Union, why couldn\u2019t America make a deal on trade with its best friend, Canada? The ploy worked; within 20 minutes word came back that the logjam was broken, and the first Canada-United States trade agreement was signed in 1987, a pact that was virulently opposed on the political left in Canada as a concession of sovereignty but that Mulroney delighted in describing three decades later as a wild success. Trade exploded by 300 percent over the next 20 years, he said, creating the largest trade relationship in history.In the early 1990s, George H.W. Bush decided that the United States-Canada deal was so beneficial that he wanted a similar treaty with Mexico. Always eager to tag along with America, Mulroney instantly said that Canada wanted in on that deal, too \u2014 and thus was born Nafta. This was a massive leap in logic and faith. Canada and America are similar countries, in myriad ways, while Mexico has a much different history, political landscape and, most important, economy; lower wages in Mexico instantly began incentivizing companies to move factories from both the Canadian and American industrial heartlands. But even as thousands of good industrial jobs migrated south, over time a consensus emerged across the political spectrum in Canada that Nafta was a desirable part of the fabric of the nation. \u201cHistory has had its say about Nafta now,\u201d Mulroney said. \u201cThere are two vital things for any Canadian prime minister to get right. The first is national unity. The second is U.S.-Canada relations.\u201dThis was precisely the mantra I heard repeatedly from Freeland and other top Canadian officials, and that was no coincidence. A true America-phile, Mulroney had known Trump for decades, having lunched with him in Manhattan in the mid-\u201990s and encountered him often over the years, as they both have residences in Palm Beach and move in the same moneyed conservative social circles. Mulroney often dined at Mar-a-Lago.Mulroney\u2019s connection to Trump was known in political circles in Ottawa, and in the bewildering days after the election, access to the new president was at an absolute premium. Trudeau had enjoyed a close friendship with Barack Obama, and the Canadians had deep ties to Hillary Clinton and her people, but now they realized with horror that they had no relationship with Trump. One way Trudeau defeated his hawkish neoconservative predecessor in 2015 was by pointing out that he had a terrible relationship with Obama, because of ideological differences; the center-left Trudeau knew it was vitally important that he get along with Trump, no matter their political points of view. Trudeau\u2019s aide Gerald Butts reached out to Mulroney for help, and in short order the former prime minister was advising Trudeau; one was conservative, the other liberal, but both were Canadian leaders and understood that the gravity of the situation at hand far outweighed any partisan consideration; the fate of the nation was at stake.\u201cI worked on a way to make certain that the prime minister got to Washington very early to start to build a relationship with President Trump on a personal basis,\u201d Mulroney said. \u201cThat worked for me with Reagan and Bush and Clinton and helped Canada through many storms.\u201dThere was no magic formula or trick to dealing with Trump, according to Mulroney. It was a matter of establishing rapport, being a reliable partner and exhibiting a special understanding of the burden of world leadership the United States carries and avoiding any hint of sanctimony or disrespect \u2014 qualities that too often infect Canadian thinking about America. \u201cAnyone who tells you that personal friendship doesn\u2019t count in the conduct of foreign affairs \u2014 that nations only have interests and nothing else \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a clue what he is talking about,\u201d Mulroney said.Trudeau\u2019s first phone call with Trump went surprisingly well, with the president-elect recalling how he met the former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau (Justin\u2019s father) in Manhattan at an awards ceremony in the early 1980s and liked him a lot. An idea was quickly hatched to find, frame and give to Trump a portrait of him with the elder Trudeau, a gesture that met with great success during the younger Trudeau\u2019s first encounter with the president in Washington a few weeks later. Trudeau practiced how to personally parley with Trump, down to perfecting a judo-like maneuver to counter the president\u2019s domineering handshake style. The prime minister had been schooled by Mulroney on a quote that would be sure to gain the attention of the president, who had just put a bust of Winston Churchill back into the Oval Office. During a joint news conference, Trudeau turned Trump\u2019s head by saying, \u201cWinston Churchill once said that the long Canadian frontier from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans guarded only by neighborly respect and honorable obligations is an example to every country and a pattern for the future of the world.\u201dA week after the Trudeau-Trump meeting, Mulroney was at a charitable fund-raiser at Mar-a-Lago when he was invited onstage to sing \u201cWhen Irish Eyes Are Smiling,\u201d a tune he famously sang with Ronald Reagan and their wives during the \u201cShamrock Summit\u201d in 1985 that celebrated the leaders\u2019 shared Irish heritage and close bond. The shovel-chinned Mulroney can\u2019t be described as a particularly gifted singer, but he has blarney galore. Just as Mulroney started singing, Trump and his wife, Melania, entered the packed ballroom and walked to Mulroney\u2019s table, leading the standing ovation as he finished.Mulroney told me the president then had a quiet word with him: \u201cYou know, Brian, you were right about Justin. I was told he\u2019s a good guy, and he is. I think we can do good business together.\u201d Mulroney passed the remark along to a relieved Trudeau.\u201cI tell Chrystia and the others that when they say Nafta is the worst deal ever, remind them of what it has done,\u201d Mulroney told me. \u201cThere are 500 million people who are 7 percent of the world\u2019s population producing 29 percent of the world\u2019s wealth. Trade has allowed America to reach high levels of prosperity and a historically low unemployment rate of 3.9 percent. How can you argue that trade treaties are bad for you when unemployment is so low? I tell them to take it easy, keep your head down and don\u2019t say anything \u2014 don\u2019t take the bait. Prepare, prepare, prepare. The Americans will figure out it would be very foolish to kill Nafta. They know a good deal when they see one. There would be a pitchfork revolution in the Midwest when the farmers realized what would happen to their markets.\u201dOn May 31, the Trump administration announced that the United States would impose steep tariffs on Canadian exports of aluminum and steel, even though the United States runs a trade surplus in the latter commodity. World Trade Organization rules allow nations leeway to override restrictions on tariffs when national security is at stake, and so that was the justification the administration used: that Canadian steel posed a threat to the national security of the United States; the same argument was applied to Mexico and Europe. The United States also announced that it had instigated an investigation into the national-security implications of the importation of cars and automobile parts, with the final decision lying in the thumbs-up-thumbs-down hands of the president, creating a much larger and far more dangerous threat to Canada, Mexico and the European Union.\u201cEverything will be a lot more expensive,\u201d said Kristin Dziczek, a vice president of the Center for Automotive Research, an independent industry analysis group, anticipating how tariffs that hit multiple products will affect the market. \u201cI don\u2019t know how consumers can take a 25 percent tariff on vehicles and parts. Think about all the things people buy that have steel and aluminum in them. It\u2019s cumulative. Working people who buy anything will be impacted.\u201dA few days after the tariff announcement broke, I met again with Freeland, this time at the Canadian Embassy on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, in a large sixth-floor room decorated with Inuit soapstone sculptures and iconic paintings of the northern wilderness. Freeland said she heard about the impending tariffs only the morning they were announced, while American officials waited for the president to reach his final conclusion. She said that Canada has learned not to be shocked by anything this administration does, but that this move was still astonishing. \u201cIt is an illegal act,\u201d Freeland said. \u201cThat is extremely problematic between any two allies. What adds insult to injury is the national-security pretext, which is absurd and insulting.\u201dTrudeau immediately announced sweeping dollar-for-dollar tariffs not only on American steel and aluminum but also on specific products like bourbon from Kentucky (targeting the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell) and Wisconsin gherkins (the House speaker, Paul Ryan). \u201cWe were very prepared,\u201d Freeland said. \u201cWitness our list. We made a decision not to talk about what our appropriate response would be in detail ahead of time, partly to keep our powder dry and partly because we\u2019ve felt that might increase tension unnecessarily at a time when we were trying to drive toward a deal.\u201dThe paradox was that in feigning a national-security threat to the United States, Trump had created a real one for Canada. America didn\u2019t grasp, or pretended not to grasp, the Canadian response. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said the economic impact was only a \u201cblip.\u201d Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said Canada was \u201coverreacting.\u201d But for Canadians, the tariffs broke fundamental matters of trust, respect and the rule of law, and seemed to signal the beginning of the end; Nafta wouldn\u2019t die in one day, it appeared, but in a series of humiliating and bewildering tweets and diktats that would ultimately harm millions of Canadian working families.\u201cIt hurt our feelings, it\u2019s very emotional,\u201d Freeland said. \u201cIt\u2019s not exclusive to our government. It\u2019s a feeling that all Canadians have. I\u2019ve had hundreds and hundreds of emails in the past week. The sentiment expressed is that they can\u2019t believe the Americans are doing this to us.\u201dJim Balsillie, a former chief executive of Research in Motion (creator of the Blackberry), is an adviser and friend of Freeland\u2019s \u2014 one with a contrarian view about Canada-United States relations. \u201cBusiness isn\u2019t personal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard-edged. People do these things to their neighbors. We need to manage our strengths and vulnerabilities. Trump\u2019s behavior is unfortunate, but it has underlined that it\u2019s really important to change our economy. We don\u2019t want to be here again.\u201d Balsillie believes Canada needs to move away from overreliance on commodities like timber and oil and canola and into high-margin businesses that sell intellectual property, which is much more valuable and impervious to the predation of America.Freeland takes Balsillie\u2019s point about diversification. But she argues that using the analogy of business as the paradigm for government is dangerous. \u201cI believe we have been more than transactional,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe have alliances rooted in a \u2018never again\u2019 view of the horrors of the past and also in a conviction that we had profoundly shared values. By working together we could support each other and make the world safe for those values.\u201dThe optimism Freeland displayed only weeks earlier was now mostly gone. With the United States imposing tariffs and threatening the legally binding Nafta treaty, Freeland believed much larger and more troubling issues had been raised. She was worried that Western nations were forgetting the lessons of history from the 20th century and taking for granted the institutions of a rules-based global order constructed over decades under the leadership of the United States. America\u2019s closest friend and ally and a country that might see America more clearly than it sees itself now offered a dire warning about the perils to liberal democracy in this \u201cfraught\u201d era. Freeland said she had recently come across a \u201cterrifying\u201d quote from Adolf Hitler, explaining his rise to power in Germany in a time of economic uncertainty and grievance. \u201cI will tell you what has carried me to the position I have reached,\u201d Hitler had said. \u201cOur political problems appeared complicated. The German people could make nothing of them. ... I, on the other hand ... reduced them to the simplest terms. The masses realized this and followed me.\u201dShe leaned forward, a look of concern in her eyes. \u201cHow do you attract voters and public support compared with the flashiness of exciting, chaotic, fact-ignoring populism?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe reason Hitler won was because all of the other politicians were giving complicated and difficult explanations about difficult things. Hitler just told people simple things that they wanted to hear.\u201d\u201cWorthwhile Canadian Initiative\u201d was the title of a column that ran in The Times in 1986 on the topic of Canada\u2019s campaign to forge a free-trade deal with the United States. The headline was declared by Michael Kinsley, then the editor of The New Republic magazine, to be the most boring imaginable. Freeland herself referenced the much-ridiculed headline back in 2010 when she was a journalist, but now she cited it to make a far more serious point.\u201c\u2009\u2018Worthwhile Canadian Initiative\u2019 can seem so boring,\u201d Freeland said. Decades ago, at the dawn of Nafta, it was easy to ridicule the earnestness of \u201cworthwhile\u201d Canadian ideals like free trade, a rules-based international order and the strategic importance of United States-Canada relations. But now a bewildering and belligerent new reality seemed to have dawned, one that inspired a final question for Freeland. It was a question that not so long ago would have seemed unthinkable to have to ask: If Canada can\u2019t rely on the United States, then what country can?She considered for a moment before replying, speaking slowly, cautiously, but with resolve. \u201cAmericans should be asking themselves that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good question.\u201dThe image of President Trump and Prime Minister Trudeau in this article did not credit its source. Meant as a homage, it was based on an iconic photo illustration by Bob Gill, which was published on the cover of the Art Directors Club Annual in 1986.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Mnuchin Keeps a Steady Grip in a Tug of War on Trade", "Date": "2018-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Two weeks ago, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, declared that the trade war with China was \u201con hold\u201d and that the United States would temporarily holster its tariffs. The reassuring comments calmed markets and raised hopes that Mr. Mnuchin, one of President Trump\u2019s most enduring and trusted advisers, was winning the internal trade battle that has gripped the White House.Then Mr. Trump weighed in. In a one-two punch last week, the president doubled down on the trade war with China and threw in ones with Canada, Mexico and Europe for good measure.This weekend, some of those countries hit back, as finance ministers from the six other nations attending the Group of 7 meeting in Canada issued an unusual rebuke over America\u2019s trading practices and the use of tariffs against allies. The statement said that tariffs \u201cundermine open trade and confidence in the global economy\u201d and called on Mr. Mnuchin to make their worries known to Mr. Trump.The scolding laid bare the uncomfortably familiar spot that Mr. Mnuchin finds himself in: trying to be a voice of moderation and a statesman in an administration that sees diplomatic norms and protocols as signs of weakness.He has so far managed to stay in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces while advocating a more free-trade approach, but that balancing act is showing signs of strain.Mr. Mnuchin, unflappable in public, is privately making his case with a president who campaigned on blowing up trade agreements and surrounded himself with hard-line advisers who continue to toe that line.\u201cYou have an intellectual slugfest going on in the White House,\u201d said Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201cSometimes Mnuchin has victories and sometimes he has failures, but he is clearly one of the strongest voices for the free-trade position.\u201dThe internal tensions boiled over in May during a trade mission Mr. Mnuchin led to China, when he got into an argument with Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump\u2019s hawkish trade adviser, by reminding him where he stood in the administration\u2019s pecking order after Mr. Navarro confronted him about his sidelining of the rest of the team from the talks.On the plane ride home, Mr. Navarro sat in a separate cabin from Mr. Mnuchin and remained publicly silent for days about the trip while Mr. Mnuchin declared the talks a success and said the trade war was on hold.The victory was short-lived.\u201cHe didn\u2019t say it was on hold indefinitely,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said last week as the White House announced that the China tariffs and investment restrictions would be coming, after all.\u201cAnd look, the president ultimately makes the decisions on trade,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd when he does, we announce them. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s taken place in this process.\u201dMr. Mnuchin has managed to remain in Mr. Trump\u2019s good stead by rolling with the punches, avoiding the fate that has befallen Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign managers, chiefs of staff and cabinet secretaries by pleasing a president who prizes the unpredictable and governs by whim. That has given Mr. Mnuchin a key role inside the West Wing and the president\u2019s ear.Current and former White House and Treasury officials say Mr. Mnuchin has managed to thrive by employing a mix of assertiveness and obsequiousness, staking out his position to the president but quickly changing course to carry out Mr. Trump\u2019s marching orders, even if his message did not win the day.\u201cHe\u2019s kept the focus on the president\u2019s agenda, rather than himself,\u201d said Jason Miller, a former campaign spokesman for Mr. Trump who worked closely with Mr. Mnuchin. \u201cHe\u2019s managed to do it without elevating his profile too high.\u201dThat skill was on display in mid-May, when Mr. Trump tweeted that he was going to find a way to help put back in business a Chinese telecommunications company that had been punished for violating American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. The decision blindsided administration officials and lawmakers, including Democrats who publicly criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s decision and said the president was caving to China.Mr. Mnuchin, along with the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, was dispatched to Capitol Hill to try to calm angry Republican lawmakers and explain the rationale behind allowing the company, ZTE, to remain in business. Several of the lawmakers appeared unconvinced and, according to a person who was in the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin advised them to take their concerns directly to the president.He has also learned when to fight and when to toe the president\u2019s line. While colleagues describe Mr. Mnuchin as someone who believes in free markets and views trade barriers as a last resort, those close to the secretary say he has learned to appreciate Mr. Trump\u2019s use of the threat of tariffs as a negotiating tool.In talks with China, he has been focused on the president\u2019s desire to see the bilateral trade deficit reduced, rather than emphasizing some of the other trade barriers that many lawmakers and executives say put American companies at a disadvantage.Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former top strategist, has said that Mr. Mnuchin is in over his head in the negotiations and that he is letting Mr. Trump\u2019s leverage slip away by failing to force China to make major changes to its industrial policy.David Loevinger, the Treasury Department\u2019s senior coordinator for China from 2009 to 2012, said it was apparent that the Chinese government was trying to elevate Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s role in the negotiations because they see him as the American official most likely to cut a deal.\u201cAmong the possible choices, they see Mnuchin as being less hawkish than some of the other counterparts,\u201d Mr. Loevinger said.Mr. Trump dispatched Mr. Ross to Beijing to continue talks through Monday, but the president has expressed wavering confidence in his deal-making abilities. The China hawks within the administration, Mr. Navarro and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, continue to have sway with Mr. Trump. And populist voices outside the administration have already been heckling Mr. Mnuchin as inept amid reports that the United States was on the verge of making an agreement with China that was viewed as merely symbolic.Mr. Mnuchin has at times found himself the subject of derision, characterized as a fawning banker who cannot tell the president \u201cno.\u201dLast year, the Treasury secretary was scoffed at by economic policymakers from across the political spectrum for insisting that the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts would pay for themselves. Nearly every independent economic analysis found otherwise, and the analysis produced by the department was mocked for its lack of rigor.He has also clashed with some of the more conservative members of the Republican Party. Last year, as the White House pressed lawmakers to raise the ceiling on how much the government can borrow, Mr. Mnuchin told members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus to \u201cvote for the debt ceiling for me.\u201d His plea was met with groans and hisses.His stance on social issues has also propelled him into controversy. Last August, fellow alumni of Yale, where Mr. Mnuchin earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, called on the secretary to resign when he defended Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of racially inspired violence in Charlottesville, Va. A month later, Lawrence Summers, a Clinton administration Treasury secretary, called Mr. Mnuchin the \u201cgreatest sycophant in cabinet history\u201d for supporting Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of football players who knelt during the national anthem.Mr. Mnuchin publicly brushes off the criticism and points to his role in successfully steering the Republican tax cut package, which many said would never pass, through Congress.Within the Treasury Department, Mr. Mnuchin has developed a reputation as a micromanager. He resisted choosing a full-time deputy for more than a year, preferring to oversee everything from carrying out the new tax law to overseeing financial sanctions.That has at times created problems. When the Internal Revenue Service systems failed on Tax Day, the response to the crash was slowed because Mr. Mnuchin was in New Hampshire at a tax event with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter. He had required that any big decisions be cleared by him, according to a senior government official.A Treasury spokesman said that this reflected the secretary\u2019s commitment to being hands-on when problems arose and did not slow the response.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s closest aides describe him as a collegial and mentoring figure. Despite his earnest persona on television, he is known to possess a wry sense of humor, even occasionally brandishing impressions from old movies such as \u201cThe Pink Panther Strikes Again\u201d to lighten the mood.But when it comes to the president, Mr. Mnuchin puts up little resistance when policy decisions are made, and he even keeps his pet peeves to himself.While Mr. Mnuchin insists that most people refer to him by his given name, Steven, he does not flinch when Mr. Trump just calls him Steve.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Contain Tourism, One Spanish City Strikes a Ban, on Airbnb", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALMA, Majorca \u2014 In summers, Majorca and its sister islands off the eastern coast of Spain were once a discreet destination for the cultured, famous and well-heeled. In the 19th century, the composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and his partner, the writer George Sand, were among those who sought its Mediterranean climate.It has gotten to the point where some hotels in the port of Magaluf have encased their balconies in glass panels to prevent inebriated clients from jumping off. Usually they land in swimming pools, sometimes not. In early June, a 20-year-old tourist became the second person to fall to his death this year.Then there is Palma, the island\u2019s quieter, tonier capital about a half-hour drive along the coast, where the mayor is erecting his own kind of barrier to tourists: In July, it will become the first Spanish city to ban the short-term rental of apartments through Airbnb and other home-sharing websites.\u201cWe want Palma to remain livable for its inhabitants,\u201d Antoni Noguera, the mayor, said in an interview. \u201cWe believe that we are setting a trend, because there are many cities in Europe that have the same problem.\u201dBut Mr. Noguera may be right to think that his city is taking the clampdown a step further. Under Palma\u2019s new rules, only owners of detached townhouses will be allowed to rent to tourists. Anybody offering short-term rental in an apartment building risks a fine of as much as 40,000 euros.The mayor and other critics of Airbnb insist they want to contain rather than dampen tourism. The sector, after all, represents about 40 percent of Majorca\u2019s gross domestic product.But they view short-term rentals as a frontal attack on the social fabric of their city, reducing the housing supply and making Palma unaffordable for its 440,000 residents. Last year, prices in Palma\u2019s secondary housing market rose at the fastest pace among Spanish cities, according to some studies.Fed-up residents have hung posters from their balconies showing a woman with a shopping trolley using a walking stick to drive away tourists with their selfie sticks and carry-on luggage. \u201cThe city is for whoever lives in it, not whoever visits it,\u201d it reads.Palma\u2019s ban was decided under a broader regional law that allowed the different local authorities of the Balearic Islands, which also include Ibiza and Menorca, to set their own rules for short-term renting.Joan Miralles, the president of Habtur, an association that represents homeowners who rent to tourists, said local politicians have made Airbnb the scapegoat for their failure to control the tourism boom and to build more affordable housing.Instead, he said, politicians bowed to pressure from the hotel lobby, on an island that is home to four of Spain\u2019s five largest international hotel operators.\u201cBanning Airbnb will do nothing to solve our housing crisis, but it will stop the democratization of a tourism sector that has been controlled by a few hotel oligarchs,\u201d Mr. Miralles said.Mr. Miralles showed off a section of Palma that has a few abandoned and dilapidated buildings, but mostly renovated ones that could serve as tourism apartments. Within the city, 19 hotels have opened since 2011, many of them boutique establishments in converted palaces.Palma\u2019s mayor predicted that Airbnb\u2019s removal would free up apartments for residents. But for now, rental prices are climbing, with little evidence that landlords want long-term tenants rather than tourists.Cristina Morey, who owns an apartment overlooking Palma\u2019s seafront avenue, plans to sell her unit because she fears a tenant could turn into a squatter.In four years of renting on Airbnb, Ms. Morey said, nobody complained about her guests: \u201cIt\u2019s insulting and wrong to say that all Airbnb tourists are loud and disorderly.\u201dSome residents also worry that their politicians will stop their efforts to control tourism after tackling Airbnb, when other matters also stifle life for residents, like the influx of cruise ships and rental cars.\u201cAnybody concerned about tourism saturation should start by dealing with the crazy summer traffic on our roads,\u201d said Jaime Bonn\u00edn, a taxi driver.Where both critics and supporters of Airbnb find common ground is in questioning how the ban will be enforced.\u201cIf there is a new law but then no inspection and control, that\u2019s just creating another big problem,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Frontera, the president of the island\u2019s hotel federation.Mr. Miralles, on the other hand, warns that banning Airbnb risks driving more of the island\u2019s tourism revenues into the underground economy, by cutting off an electronic payment system that makes it easy to trace transactions on Airbnb and other platforms.In fact, Airbnb is already appealing a fine of 300,000 euros it received in February from the regional government after the authorities identified advertising for unregistered homes on its website.Some of Palma\u2019s residents believe their city government is only adding to the legal confusion surrounding the growth of Airbnb and other online businesses.\u201cPalma has come up with a very bad rule that will surely get knocked out either in Madrid or Brussels,\u201d said Imma Molas, who rents a room in her Palma apartment to tourists. She argued that the ban contravenes Spanish rental laws as well as the free-market legislation of the European Union.But for Manel Dom\u00e8nech, who heads one of the neighborhood associations that pushed for the ban, residents should have the right to live without suffering the excesses of tourism.\u201cIt\u2019s fine to have your neighbor celebrate his birthday once a year, but not to have a weekly party above your head,\u201d said Mr. Dom\u00e8nech, who is a retired schoolteacher.While some property owners might depend on renting to tourists, he said, others like him face \u201ca fall in the value of our apartment once people work out what kind of unwanted neighbors come with it.\u201dAs Palma and other cities struggle to adjust to the new forms of mass tourism, Carlos Garc\u00eda-Delgado, a local architect, draws an analogy with the way British cities dealt with the onset of the Industrial Revolution.Factories were initially allowed inside the cities, but later forced to relocate to the outskirts once their number and pollution made city life unbearable.\u201cDecades ago, we allowed mass tourism to keep us away from our own beaches during the summer,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we can\u2019t now allow it to kick us out of our last bastion, which is our city.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Europe, an Unpleasant Question: Confront Trump or Avoid a Costly Trade War", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe next move is more complicated and uncertain. Though European leaders project unified resolve in confronting what they portray as American bullying that breaches the rules of global trade, they have not proved adept at setting aside national differences in pursuit of common aims.And Europe at the moment appears especially divided and internally conflicted.Britain is headed for the exits. A potentially destabilizing, populist government just assumed power in Italy. Spain unexpectedly changed leaders as well, while Hungary and Poland are testing the values of the European Union with policies anathema to democracy. In addition, European economic growth appears to be slowing, with factory orders down in Germany.In European corridors of power, anger at the Trump administration is intense \u2014 not just because of the tariffs, but also because of the American decision to revoke support for the Iran denuclearization deal. Yet given the difficulties Europe confronts in orchestrating any policy and given competing economic interests across the 28-nation bloc, Europe is in a compromised position as it squares off with a bellicose American president.Many trade experts assume Europe will be forced to cede ground, further opening its markets to American exports to gain relief from Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs.\u201cThe U.S. is more powerful than the E.U., and the E.U. is facing many challenges,\u201d said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will be strong enough to rally against this. They are not willing to pay the price.\u201dFrance is especially inclined to punish the United States, viewing Mr. Trump\u2019s justification of the tariffs on national security grounds as an affront to the concept of rules-based international trade, as overseen by the World Trade Organization.Germany \u2014 the bloc\u2019s largest economic power \u2014 is reluctant to escalate the conflict, lest tit-for-tat tariffs jeopardize its lucrative exports of automobiles and other industrial goods to American shores.Yet to the extent that tactics may be divined, the Trump administration appears to be deploying the constant threat of tariffs to create uncertainty for business in a bid to force trading partners to accede to American demands.The Trump administration had hoped to use that agreement as a template in extracting similar concessions from the European Union. It suggested the bloc could gain an exemption from the American tariffs so long as it reduced its own duties on American autos while limiting its exports of steel.But European leaders balked at that approach, enraged at what they viewed as demeaning treatment from a longstanding ally.\u201cWe will talk about anything in principle with a country that respects W.T.O. rules,\u201d the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told reporters in Brussels in March, shortly after the Trump administration announced its metals tariffs. \u201cWe will not talk about anything when it is with a gun to our head.\u201dThe Dutch, whose economy is especially tied to trade, were particularly incensed by the Trump administration\u2019s approach. They were joined by other European bloc members still angry that Mr. Trump had withdrawn the United States from the Paris climate accord and, more recently, revoked support for a deal brokered by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, committing Iran to renouncing the production of nuclear weapons.The apparent demise of that deal and the resumption of American sanctions against companies transacting with Iran is expected to cost European firms billions of dollars in sales, with French, German and Italian interests especially vulnerable.All of which has reinforced European predilections to treat the battle over tariffs as a fight the Continent must engage and win, lest the foundations of international cooperation break down, yielding a new era in which rules are eclipsed by raw power.As the word came on Thursday that Europe would not be spared from the American metals tariffs, its leaders quickly declared they would follow through on threats of retaliation.\u201cThis is a bad day for world trade,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, during a speech in Brussels. \u201cWe will immediately introduce a settlement dispute with the W.T.O. and will announce counterbalancing measures in the coming hours.\u201dBut whether that stance can be maintained appeared uncertain.Despite its name, the European Union is not generally a model of unity. If Mr. Trump was banking on internal division stymieing the European response, he picked an opportune moment.Britain is consumed with domestic sniping over its pending departure from the European Union, making it a bit player in these proceedings.\u201cEurope is in disarray,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss, a university in Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s even difficult to understand who is in power in Europe.\u201dIn deliberating how to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, the key schism appears to run between Germany and the rest of the bloc.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a unified consensus for how to deal with the Americans,\u201d said Meredith Crowley, an expert on international trade at the University of Cambridge in England. \u201cThe Germans benefit from open markets globally, so they don\u2019t want to throw up more barriers to free trade.\u201dThere is also the not-insignificant question of whether Europe should adhere to the bounds of the World Trade Organization, the referee for global trade disputes.The European position \u2014 one shared by many economists \u2014 is that the Trump administration has undermined the institution\u2019s workings in citing national security as an imperative for its metals tariffs. But if Europe immediately responds with its own tariffs, that would itself violate the organization\u2019s rules, which require the filing of a formal case and a deliberative process requiring months to adjudicate.At a meeting last month with his counterparts from European nations, Peter Altmaier, the German minister for economic affairs, urged that Europe avoid an escalating round of tariffs with the United States, according to European diplomatic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. The German minister suggested that Europe should accept quotas on its exports of steel to the United States as the cost of gaining a permanent exemption from the American metals tariffs.European Commission officials responded angrily to the German proposal, calling for stiff and unequivocal retaliation. They were adamant that the conflict with the United States went well beyond the number of cars or the volume of steel sold to the United States: It presented an existential threat to the rules-based trading system.Publicly, that view carried the day.The list of retaliatory tariffs Europe has prepared for this eventuality is engineered to apply political pressure. The list of products includes bourbon, made in Kentucky, the home state of Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and motorcycles, which are made by Harley-Davidson in Wisconsin, the home of Speaker Paul D. Ryan.In seeking to extract an exemption from the tariffs, the European Union was prepared to agree to some sort of deal. According to the diplomatic officials, it floated the possibility of buying large volumes of liquefied natural gas from the United States while joining the Trump administration in pressing to alter the rules of the dispute settlement system at the W.T.O. \u2014 a longstanding American goal.But European leaders insisted they would entertain none of that so long as Mr. Trump threatened tariffs.Now that the threat has become reality, many think Europe will wind up blinking, assenting to some concessions, having learned that Mr. Trump is prepared to go to war.\u201cThe U.S. is now exercising its power,\u201d said Ms. Haugland, the DNB Markets economist. \u201cWhen push comes to shove, the E.U. definitely doesn\u2019t want a trade war.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A pile of letters and notes penned by Angelou was nearby. Every Mother\u2019s Day, Angelou liked to send flowers. An order would go out from her office to the Daily Blossom Florist with a list of women alongside the names of corresponding bouquet arrangements. In May 1994, she sent a spring-inspired bloom to Area Conerly, a Teacup Arrangement to Viola Sterling and a Loving Thoughts Bouquet to \u201cMother Baldwin\u201d \u2014 James Baldwin\u2019s mother. At least six other women received flowers from the poet that year, each bundle arriving with a message signed \u201cJoy, Maya Angelou.\u201dIn her latest body of work in New York City, B\u00e1ez, a 36-year-old Dominican-born New York-based painter, has found her own way to nurture relationships between historical women of color. The result of months of research, B\u00e1ez\u2019s shrine-like tribute, a Studio Museum commission curated by the institution\u2019s Hallie Ringle and titled \u201cJoy Out of Fire,\u201d brings together African-American and Afro-Caribbean women who are represented in the Schomburg\u2019s extensive archival holdings. Some are familiar names like the writer Zora Neale Hurston, others lesser-known like Ida Van Smith, an influential pilot from the 1960s who introduced underserved children to the aviation and aerospace industries, and Philippa Schuyler, a mixed-race child prodigy profiled by Joseph Mitchell in The New Yorker in 1940.B\u00e1ez is interested in visual language \u2014 the different ways that the hand and body can leave something behind, textures that communicate a less accessible but still obvious element of ourselves. In the writing of Angela Davis, she finds the precise, even shape of her letters an expression of the civil rights activist\u2019s deeply held egalitarian principles. \u201cI know what you are going through right now,\u201d Davis wrote to a fellow prisoner named Ericha in 1971, \u201cbut I also know that you don\u2019t have to be told to be strong \u2014 you\u2019re the epitome of strength. Still I want you to know that I\u2019m with you all the way and personally, I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to free you.\u201d Her script is so clear and uniformly spaced that it almost looks rehearsed, except for the sincerity of the message.\u201cI\u2019ve always thought of an activist as having unbridled passion,\u201d said B\u00e1ez, \u201cbut Davis has such self-control, right down to her writing \u2014 there was no element that was higher or lower. She believes in equality throughout.\u201dThere is a history of artists of color painting one another into the canon \u2014 Jack Whitten with his \u201cBlack Monoliths,\u201d which are monuments to famous African-Americans, and the lesser-known Dindga McCannon, who preserved a historical place for black women by painting and sewing their portraits. There is also a history of female artists carving out a seat at the table for other women through fictional and performative dinner parties: Judy Chicago\u2019s \u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d and Elia Alba\u2019s ongoing \u201cThe Supper Club\u201d are two prominent examples. It\u2019s a tradition that B\u00e1ez had in mind while formulating the concept for her installation. \u201cJudy Chicago doing \u2018The Dinner Party\u2019 is incredible, but it\u2019s specific to her filter,\u201d B\u00e1ez said, referring to the work\u2019s overwhelming representation of white women. \u201cThe more voices you can add to the conversation, the more nuanced it becomes.\u201dThe images of numerous pioneers come into definition in B\u00e1ez\u2019s paintings, their voices and legacies brought to the fore. But many women in the Schomburg\u2019s collection are buried in the archives of their male relatives, like the writer Maritcha Remond Lyons, whose unpublished memoir resides in the papers of her uncle Harry A. Williamson, a black Freemason. It\u2019s a reminder that the memory of these women, indeed the life of the archive, relies on the kind of attention that B\u00e1ez has brought to it through her tribute, that history needs constantly to be cared for, revisited and refined. Now B\u00e1ez\u2019s own voice and hand will join the historical record.

{"Headline": "Once Cut, Corporate Income Taxes Are Hard to Restore", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThe Trump corporate income tax cuts are the latest in a decades-long trend of tax reductions that have been substantially reversed mainly during times of war.The historical evidence is revealing.The corporate tax rate peaked in 1968 at 52.8 percent. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 brought the 2018 rate down to 21 percent from 35 percent last year.Wars provided an impetus for tax increases, with major hikes during both world wars and the Korean War. Corporate taxes remained high for more than 30 years, then dropped sharply under President Ronald Reagan and now, again, with President Trump.Taxes on land hit farmers unfairly, proponents of the new taxes said, while owners of corporate stocks paid no taxes. Excise and customs duties taxed consumers unfairly and benefited specific domestic industries, so the argument went. Seligman, a professor at Columbia University, said the income taxes were not an \u201cattack on wealth as such.\u201d The aim of the new income taxes \u201cwas solely to redress the inequality of taxation.\u201dThat was an intellectual defense of the income tax. But more emotional issues \u2014 those of unequal sacrifice in time of war \u2014 account for the high levels to which corporate tax rates rose.During World War I, the federal corporate income tax rose to 12 percent in 1918 from 1 percent in 1915. In addition, in 1917 a new \u201cexcess profits tax\u201d \u2014 on profits above the payer\u2019s prewar level \u2014 was imposed, and it ranged as high as 80 percent. The increase came amid public outcry against wartime \u201cprofiteering.\u201d People were angry to see men who stayed at home becoming millionaires from war profits, while the soldiers overseas were fighting and, often, dying.The excess profits tax was scrapped in 1921, but the corporation income tax remained at nearly the same level.With World War II, rates rose further, reaching 40 percent in 1942. And once again a wartime excess profits tax was instituted, ranging up to 95 percent.After that war, the corporate excess profits tax was eliminated, but the corporate income tax rates were not cut back for long.The Korean War, which scared many people as being the possible beginning of what they called \u201cWorld War III,\u201d occasioned further increases. The federal corporate income tax rate rose to 52 percent, and yet another temporary excess profits tax was instituted. And again, a familiar pattern was in place: Corporate income tax rates did not decline much after the war was over.These wartime tax increases left a lasting legacy of relatively high corporate income tax rates. Even with the Trump tax cuts, the United States is far above the rate that prevailed before World War I.What prompted taxes to begin a long decline, starting with the Reagan presidency in the 1980s? Here, we are in the realm of speculation. Decades after the Korean War \u2014 arguably the last American war with a high degree of public unanimity \u2014 the names and feats of war heroes began to fade in memory. People may simply have returned to more individualistic, self-centered views of society and the economy.In any case, under Reagan, the top corporate tax rate dropped from 46 percent to 34 percent. In 1993, during the Clinton administration, it increased slightly to 35 percent, where it held until last year.What data we do have shows an unmistakable trend. Consider, for example, the United States National Income and Product Accounts, published by the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis. Data from that source indicates that the fraction of profits on corporate income taken by federal, state, local and foreign taxes peaked during World War II and has shown a fairly linear, steady and steep downtrend ever since.This history provides an important perspective.While it may be tempting to view the Reagan and Trump tax policies as anomalies, they may be seen as part of a long-term trend. It is important to recognize that Reagan\u2019s tax decreases were not substantially reversed under subsequent administrations. And it is quite possible that President Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts may remain in place, even if Trump political power ebbs.Given this history, I have to wonder: Will it take a major war \u2014 one that galvanizes the public, involves vast sacrifice and seems to truly threaten domestic survival \u2014 to raise the corporation income tax significantly?Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Piece by Piece, a Factory-Made Answer for a Housing Squeeze", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "Developers are taking on residential building challenges by extending the concept of prefabricated housing to manufacture entire apartment buildings.Supported byVALLEJO, Calif. \u2014 California is in the middle of an affordable-housing crisis that cities across the state are struggling to solve. Rick Holliday, a longtime Bay Area real estate developer, thinks one answer lies in an old shipyard in Vallejo, about 40 minutes northeast of San Francisco.\u201cIf we don\u2019t build housing differently, then no one can have any housing,\u201d Mr. Holliday said during a recent tour, as he passed assembly-line workstations and stacks of raw materials like windows, pipes and rolls of pink insulation.The United States needs new housing, but its building industry isn\u2019t big enough to provide it. The number of residential construction workers is 23 percent lower than in 2006, while higher-skill trades like plumbers, carpenters and electricians are down close to 17 percent. With demand for housing high and the supply of workers short, builders are bidding up prices for the limited number of contractors.\u201cIt\u2019s reached the point where you cannot get enough rent or you cannot sell enough units to make it a viable deal,\u201d said Lou Vasquez, a founding partner and managing director of Build, a real estate developer in San Francisco.\u201cThe current system can\u2019t meet demand and that\u2019s resulting in a lack of opportunity for some folks and a major hit to the economy,\u201d said Stonly Baptiste, a co-founder of Urban Us, a Brooklyn-based venture capital firm that invested in Blokable. \u201cThese aren\u2019t small problems and they aren\u2019t small markets.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that looks like an overnight success but it\u2019s taken 10 years and hundreds of people toiling,\u201d said Chris Giattina, chief executive of BLOX, a Birmingham, Ala., company that builds hospitals with modular components.To understand this, consider how buildings are actually built. It all starts with the developer, who doesn\u2019t actually build anything but instead secures a piece of land and a loan, and gets the project approved by the government. At that point the money is passed to the general contractor that made a successful bid to build the project, who passes it to subcontractors that won the bidding for things like plumbing and sheet metal work, which often pass it to even more subcontractors.Contractors describe this handoff as \u201cbrokering risk.\u201d What they mean is that while everyone in the chain has agreed to build a certain piece of the project for a set amount of money and in a given amount of time, none of them are sure they can do so as cheaply or quickly as they\u2019ve promised. They broker that risk by paying someone else to do it for them, minus a small fee.\u201cSay you\u2019re a general contractor and your subcontractor agrees to do a job. Once we have a contract I don\u2019t care how many man hours you put into it because that\u2019s your problem now,\u201d said Randy Miller, chief executive of RAD Urban, describing the thinking behind the process.The goal of prefabricated building companies is to turn this model on its head. Instead of offloading risk, the contractor assumes all of it. Instead of sending jobs to subcontractors, they hire their own factory workers. \u201cThe general contractor says, \u2018Oh my God, construction is scary, let me broker all that risk,\u2019\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m saying, \u2018Oh my God, construction is scary, let me plan and control it.\u201dThe basic concept isn\u2019t new. In 1624, Massachusetts settlers built homes out of prefabricated materials shipped from England. The pattern was repeated in Australia, Africa and India as the British Empire shipped colonists and structures wide across the globe, according to \u201cPrefab Architecture,\u201d by Ryan E. Smith, a professor at the University of Utah.Along the way, the construction industry absorbed manufacturing concepts such as the assembly-line techniques that were utilized by Levitt & Sons, the pioneer of mass-built subdivisions. But the idea of factory-built housing was never adopted long or widely enough to make an impact, at least in the United States.One reason the United States has lagged behind Europe, Australia and Asia \u2014 which all have well-established companies doing modular and prefabricated building \u2014 is that it is a predominantly suburban nation, and the vast supply of open land has kept the cost of single-family-home building relatively low. Another is that the construction industry has slim profit margins and invests little in research and development.Now, instead of single-family homes, companies doing prefab building are focusing on higher-density condominiums and apartments. That\u2019s because, while single-family home construction remains well below its level before the recession, multifamily condominium and apartment buildings have rebounded strongly. \u201cOur goal is to be able to do a 40-story tower in 12 months, at half the cost of traditional construction,\u201d said Mr. Miller of RAD Urban.Still, even if builders are able to reduce construction costs, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they will be successful. Behind each of these companies is a bet that they can build far more efficiently than current methods. That bet has yet to be proven, at least on a large scale.Mr. Holliday of Factory OS started thinking about modular housing about four years ago, when he was struggling to build a project in Truckee, Calif., a mountain town of about 15,000 people near Lake Tahoe. The idea was to build a cluster of 800 to 1,000 high-density apartments and condominiums, but \u201cthe numbers wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get the construction costs down enough.\u201dMr. Holliday floated the idea of modular building to his longtime contractor, Larry Pace, from Cannon Constructors, who over the past four decades has built various projects from one-off homes to high-rise condo and office towers. \u201cI said \u2018modular jobs have been a fiasco \u2014 we don\u2019t need that in our lives,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pace recalled, adding an expletive for emphasis.But Mr. Holliday persisted, and he and Mr. Pace used modular technology from two manufacturers to build four projects in the Bay Area. They are planning to do the same with the original Truckee development. Mr. Pace became so comfortable with modular that he suggested that they find some investors and build a factory of their own.On a recent afternoon, Mr. Pace laid out the factory\u2019s process. At the first station, just past the door, four workers toiled above and below a raised platform to build what would eventually become the floor. The two men up top laid down flooring while a man and woman stood below simultaneously installing pipes.From there the unit would move steadily down the line, and, over 21 additional stations, would acquire toilets, indoor walls, outdoor walls, a roof, electric outlets, windows, sinks, countertops and tiling. It takes about a week to finish a unit, Mr. Pace said. The goal is to churn out about 2,000 apartments a year, which would be turned into four- and five-story buildings with 80 to 150 units each.For workers, factory building seems to mean lower wages but steadier work. Factory OS pays about $30 an hour with medical insurance and two weeks of vacation. That\u2019s about half what workers can make on a construction site, but the work is more regular and, for many, requires less commuting.Tony Vandewark, a 51-year-old foreman at Factory OS, is OK with the trade-off. Mr. Vandewark lives a few minutes from the factory in Vallejo, where homes cost less than half what they do closer to San Francisco. Contrast that with a job he once had in the Silicon Valley city of Sunnyvale. Mr. Vandewark drove two hours to work and three hours home before deciding to rent a room so he could stay closer to work on weekdays.\u201cOn a job site, you can go do piece work and make really big money, but then the job is gone,\u201d he said.In addition to not being rained on, one of the key differences between a construction site and Factory OS is that any worker can be trained to do any job. And for old-school trade unions, that is a declaration of war. \u201cThe business model is \u2018Hooray for me,\u2019\u201d without regard for anyone else, said Larry Mazzola Jr., business manager of UA Local 38, a San Francisco plumbers\u2019 union with about 2,500 members across Northern California.Factory OS is not anti-union: It has a contract with the Northern California Carpenters Regional Council, which has organized other modular factories and is banking on the technology\u2019s continued growth. The issue is that builders are laid out like a Detroit auto factory, where one union represents all of the workers, and workers can be trained to do any job within the company walls.That is a huge departure from construction sites, where unions representing plumbers, electricians, carpenters and various other trades each control their piece of the building process. Last year Mr. Mazzola wrote a letter to San Francisco\u2019s mayor, Ed Lee, a month before he died, urging him to deny any city business \u2014 such as contracts for subsidized housing \u2014 to Factory OS.\u201cAny decision to use Factory OS shows a blatant disregard for the other craft unions,\u201d he wrote. He asked the mayor to refrain from contracting with the company unless it allowed craft unions to do their pieces of the work. \u201cWe realize modular is coming and we want to be part of it, but not at the expense of our workers, which is what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d Mr. Mazzola said in an interview.Jay Bradshaw, director of organizing for the carpenters\u2019 council representing Factory OS workers, said that would be impractical. Think back to that first station, where four people worked above and below the floor. In Mr. Mazzola\u2019s world, a plumbers\u2019 union would represent the workers installing pipes, while other unions would represent the workers up top.\u201cIt would never work to have upward of 10 or 15 labor organizations at a single employer in a factory setting,\u201d Mr. Bradshaw said.For Mr. Bradshaw, the real fight isn\u2019t defending job titles but making sure construction workers remain part of a union at all. A short drive from Factory OS, at a carpenters\u2019 training center, the union is developing a program to train housing-factory workers \u2014 something that, it hopes, will prepare more people for an industry that it has come to see as inevitable.\u201cIt sure blows the hell out of building in China,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank \u2018Stress Tests\u2019 Results Clear Way for Wall Street to Reward Investors", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve on Thursday gave clean bills of health to most of the largest American banks, allowing them to return money to shareholders, but it forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to freeze such payouts around last year\u2019s levels.The Fed said that all of the nation\u2019s very biggest banks \u2014 Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 passed the second round of the central bank\u2019s \u201cstress tests,\u201d which gauge whether financial institutions have enough capital and are sufficiently well-managed to continue lending during periods of financial upheaval.The tests were intended to gauge the health of 35 banks, and regulators said they would allow 34 of them to pay dividends and buy back their own shares, a boon for investors who have been eager to benefit from the banks\u2019 record profits.The banks will almost certainly use their collective success to amplify their argument that, 10 years after the financial crisis, they do not need to be as tightly regulated, and that they deserve relief similar to what their much smaller peers received earlier this year when President Trump signed a bill easing parts of the Dodd-Frank law, the landmark bank oversight legislation enacted in 2010.The six largest American banks got permission to pay out a combined sum of more than $125 billions in the form of increased dividends, which reward investors for every share of stock they own, and share buybacks, which increase the value of a company\u2019s stock by reducing the number of shares outstanding.In an emailed statement, the American arm of Deutsche Bank said that it \u201ccontinues to make progress across a range of programs and will continue to build on these efforts and to engage constructively with regulators to meet both internal and regulatory expectations.\u201dThe Fed also dealt an embarrassing blow to Goldman and Morgan Stanley, which each fell below minimum capital levels. The banks were given \u201cconditional approval\u201d to return money to shareholders, but they were required to keep their shareholder payouts near last year\u2019s levels and work on beefing up their capital cushions over the next year.But that is likely to be only a temporary hiccup for the two Wall Street titans. Goldman and Morgan Stanley fell short largely because the tax law that Mr. Trump signed late last year caused them to record large, one-time accounting losses. Going forward, the cuts will most likely generate enormous tax savings for both firms, which would make it easier for them to win approval to reward shareholders.Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that the bank is \u201cpositioned to return capital to our shareholders, while reinvesting in our global client franchise for the long-term.\u201dGoldman is allowed to pay out $6.3 billion this year compared to $5.7 billion last year, while Morgan Stanley\u2019s permitted payout was the same as last year\u2019s actual distribution: $6.8 billion.Several other financial institutions scaled back their planned payouts in order to win the Fed\u2019s blessing, including JPMorgan Chase, KeyCorp, M&T Bank and American Express.Still, Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that the Fed\u2019s decision demonstrated\u201cour sound financial risk management practices and our strong capital position.\u201dState Street, a so-called custody bank whose biggest customers are institutions, not individuals, also received only conditional approval for its plans to reward shareholders. Fed officials said State Street had not been properly assessing the risk of its exposure to other financial players, although the central bank ultimately gave a green light to State Street to distribute cash to its shareholders.State Street did not comment specifically on the Fed\u2019s criticism. But in a statement published on its website, the bank said that it was not being required to resubmit its cash distribution plan after making the regulator\u2019s requested changes.Fed Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a statement on Thursday that the test results \u201cdemonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession.\u201dThese days, there\u2019s plenty of cash to hand out.Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America may now distribute $22 billion, $31.6 billion and $26 billion, respectively, according to company statements and calculations by The New York Times.Peter Eavis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Race for Governor, How Far Left Is Colorado Willing to Go?", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 Jared Polis, a leading Democratic candidate for Colorado governor, walked into the home of a prominent marijuana entrepreneur for a campaign event recently, wearing a suit and bright blue sneakers. He circled a room of voters, wound his way past the margarita machine and then fired off his vision for Colorado.Single-payer health care. An all-renewable electric grid. State-funded full-day preschool.The crowd showered him with applause. \u201cSupport the man,\u201d said a host, Scott Durrah, 53, \u201cbecause we really need him.\u201dThese changes have helped foster a parallel political shift, and in the last five years Colorado has legalized marijuana, passed major gun restrictions and put a single-payer health care system on the ballot. Just this month, Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, ordered the state to pursue California-style emissions standards, making Colorado the first interior state to do so.By many measures, Colorado is shifting blue. Now, with Mr. Hickenlooper term-limited and eight candidates from two parties angling to replace him, the question is just how far left this frontier state wants to go.Mr. Polis, a wealthy congressman from Boulder who made his millions in e-commerce, is one of four Democrats seeking to replace Mr. Hickenlooper, whose trademark has been political moderation. (Mr. Hickenlooper is weighing a bid for president.)If Mr. Polis is successful, he would be the country\u2019s first openly gay man to serve as governor, and he could bring his husband and their two children to this city\u2019s hilltop Executive Mansion \u2014 an idea that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.But Mr. Polis, 43, is attempting a win in a state whose east and west flanks run deep red, home to influential conservative organizations like Focus on the Family; a powerful fossil fuel industry; and a faction so fervently pro-Trump that in the last election it splintered from the Republican establishment to form a group called the Mesa County Deplorables.Portions of the state are famously tax averse, and in 2016, even as the majority of voters favored Hillary Clinton, the proposal for single-payer health care failed miserably at the ballot. Four of the last five governors have been Democrats, but moderates have long charted the state\u2019s course.As it stands, Colorado has one million registered Democrats, one million registered Republicans and 1.2 million unaffiliated voters, making for a nail-biter of an election year. For the first time in state history, those undeclared voters can participate in the June 26 primary, and the number of votes returned this month will be an early sign of the state\u2019s political direction.\u201cHickenlooper would never have campaigned on that kind of overt: \u2018Let\u2019s raid the revenue box,\u2019\u201d said Alan Salazar, a former chief strategy officer to the governor, noting that Mr. Polis could be a tough sell. \u201cJared is perceived, I think, as a lot more liberal.\u201dBut Mr. Hickenlooper was elected in 2010. That was before the state\u2019s galloping economic growth, before Donald J. Trump awoke a liberal resistance.When the governor took office, the state was in recession, with unemployment near double digits, jitters about exiting businesses and thousands of families tossed out of their homes by foreclosure.These days, the question is not how to grow, but how to pay for all these new people. Roads are crumbling, schools are starved for funds, and rural communities say all this metro-area expansion is sucking them of water and money.\u201cYou rest on your laurels at your own peril,\u201d said Mr. Hickenlooper in an interview at the state\u2019s gold-domed Capitol. His fear, he added, is that \u201cwe will strangle on our success.\u201dOf course, not everyone is interested in solutions put forth by Democrats like Mr. Polis, which include a change to a longstanding state law that limits the amount of tax revenue the state can collect. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than moving blue,\u201d said Jon Caldara, who leads the Independence Institute, a Denver-based libertarian think tank. \u201cWe\u2019re turning into California.\u201dThe best-known Republican candidate, Walker Stapleton, 44, the state treasurer, is promoting himself as a supporter of the president\u2019s tax plan while promising to yank funds from sanctuary cities. Apparently hoping to avoid scrutiny ahead of the primary \u2014 he has three lesser-known challengers \u2014 he has skipped some debates and repeatedly dodged reporters.When he does appear, he often saves his fire for Mr. Polis: \u201cThe issues that matter are: What is Jared Polis going to do to the economic future of Colorado?\u201d he said.But a Polis primary victory is far from certain, despite the $11 million the congressman has poured into his own campaign.His Democratic challengers include Cary Kennedy, 50, a former state treasurer who would be the state\u2019s first female governor if elected; and Mike Johnston, 43, a Spanish-speaking former state senator and principal who once ran a school in a juvenile prison.Ms. Kennedy has made education the center of her campaign, promoting her role in writing a constitutional amendment that sought to raise funds for Colorado schools. She has the backing of the state\u2019s energized teachers\u2019 unions, and educators have come out in droves to stump for her. \u201cWe\u2019re crazy for Cary!\u201d yelled one at a recent event at her campaign headquarters.A handwritten sign on the wall warned her male challengers. \u201cSpoiler alert: Women don\u2019t give up.\u201dBoth Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Johnston are pushing progressive plans for renewable energy and school funding, while supporting bans on assault weapons. But they have stopped short of measures put forth by Mr. Polis, like the creation of a state single-payer health care system.Mr. Johnston in particular has tried to pitch himself as the only Democrat who can win statewide, traveling rural roads in cowboy boots and delivering Obamaesque speeches about the nation\u2019s imperiled \u201cpromise of equality.\u201dOn a recent afternoon at his campaign office, he leapt over a fence like a rodeo star before delivering a speech to a sea of voters.\u201cIn the moment when people are lost, we are going to light a lantern out here on the Continental Divide,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the rest of the country can\u2019t lead us there right now, Colorado can lead first.\u201dAcross the street, Barry Castile, 56, was playing in the yard with his granddaughters Heaven and Harmony. \u201cThat\u2019s my No. 1 man,\u201d he said, motioning toward the campaign office.Mr. Castile, who owned a car detail business before a back injury, said the region\u2019s sharply rising rent had just about convinced him to leave.But before doing that, he was going to vote for Mr. Johnston. \u201cThis city has changed a lot. A whole lot. And it\u2019s just gotten outrageous for us.\u201dAll of the candidates are trying to address this central anxiety: How does Colorado, long fertile ground for the everyman\u2019s Western dreams, remain a place for the average American?\u201cI love the mountains. It feels safe \u2014 it was a good place to raise a family,\u201d said Jami Fries, 30, an undecided voter. \u201cThat appeal has started to fade.\u201dMr. Polis, sitting on the front porch after his campaign event, said he believes he is the one to take on that challenge.Blue Mountain sold for $780 million. Another online business, ProFlowers, went for $470 million.Mr. Polis has since bankrolled his way from the state board of education to Congress, and during five terms in Washington he has been an advocate for undocumented immigrants, has supported the Affordable Care Act, and has waged a battle against Colorado\u2019s $32 billion oil and gas industry.Mr. Polis said he would prefer not to be boxed in.\u201cI never view it as \u2018liberal versus conservative,\u2019\u201d he said, as voters wound their way up to a smoking room that had become the campaign event\u2019s unofficial after-party. \u201cI view it as a forward versus backward.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a host of a Jared Polis campaign event. He is Scott Durrah, not Duran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Investors Shrug Off an Intensifying Trade War", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe world\u2019s two largest economies appear to be escalating their trade war. In the United States, at least, investors do not seem to be terribly worried.An intensifying trade war \u2014 with the potential for pockets of painful economic fallout \u2014 is the kind of event that could spook investors. That has not happened.Stocks are off slightly, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index slipping 0.1 percent on Friday. Yields on bonds declined, a sign that investors were seeking a bit more safety. Commodities, the raw materials that fuel the global economy, dipped too. The price of American crude oil sank more than 2 percent on Friday.The decline in oil prices affected shares of energy giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Companies like Caterpillar, Boeing and Deere, which could be hit by Chinese tariffs, weighed on indexes.But the overall market drop has been mild compared with the steep slides \u2014 some of more than 2 percent in a day \u2014 that rattled global stock markets earlier this year, when investors were fretting about the possibility of rising interest rates. And there are some clear reasons that markets are reacting in a relatively blas\u00e9 fashion right now.\u201cThe simplest answer is that by our calculations the fiscal stimulus is about 10 times greater than the potential drag from trade,\u201d said Jason Trennert, chairman of the Wall Street research firm Strategas Research Partners.The stimulus he refers to is actually twofold: federal tax cuts and increased government spending. The twin propellers are pushing huge sums of money into the United States economy, which already appears to be in extremely good shape.In May, unemployment fell to 3.8 percent, a new 18-year low. After a lull earlier this year, consumer spending appears to be picking up again, a powerful boost given that consumption accounts for roughly 70 percent of the United States economy. By comparison, trade, the value of imports and exports, accounts for a little more than 25 percent.The increase in consumer spending is good news for companies, whose profits are already swelling because of the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts. Analysts expect that earnings for companies in the S. & P. 500 will be up more than 24 percent over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data.For now, in the stock market at least, investors are taking their cues from solid economic data rather than theoretical risks.And while the S. & P. 500 has not hit a new high since late January, it does seem to be gaining traction. The benchmark index is up more than 5 percent since the end of March.An earlier version of this article misstated how much the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has increased since the end of March. It has increased more than 5 percent, not more than 7 percent.Advertisement"}

I won\u2019t name names except to say: It was my boyfriend, Aaron. I shy away from the mechanical and don\u2019t read any manuals. Or contracts. Or fine print. When I\u2019m going to read at length I want it to be for work or pleasure, not for practicality. But he thought I should know the basics. He sees it as an ethical flaw that I don\u2019t change tires. Probably others agree. I learned I\u2019m intractable and have the attention span of a 6-year-old faced with a differential equation. I was reminded that in a disaster scenario, an every-person-for-herself kind of challenge or even one involving minor electronic failure, I would be lost. That much like pediatric periodontists and professional closet organizers, writers like me, however uneconomic we may seem, can exist with a degree of tranquillity or efficiency only in economies like this one, of extreme specialization. Hothouse flowers.What moves you most in a work of literature?Grief and longing. From an austere place, not one that \u2019s squishy with emotion. I like a backdrop of coldness, or at least neutrality. And I like fiction that doesn\u2019t affirm, reinforce a reader\u2019s fixed ideas or comfort him but casts the familiar in a strange light. Humor should always be present or ambient, even if sly or slight. I want to sense the presence of an author who can laugh at herself, who\u2019s aware of her own design and also her fallibility. One who doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s above self-mockery. Also I love ecstatic moments, but they have to be delicate, with the right balance of restraint and indulgence. Hard to earn as a writer and to find as a reader.Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night?Paper at home but electronic if traveling, because I am too lazy to carry heavy things. Night, because the rest of the day is for work and the children. Of course then there\u2019s the hazard of falling asleep, which happens too often. Recently I\u2019ve started a lot of books I don\u2019t keep reading. Not proud of it. Some of those books are very good. There are piles. Unfinished business that stretches for years.How do you organize your books?Opportunistically. I only keep them if I love them. And there are few enough of those that I can generally find them again pretty easily. I love libraries, so I borrow a lot.What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?\u201c120 Days of Sodom\u201d? Maybe they wouldn\u2019t be surprised. It features in my new collection. As a teenager I was very impressed by the Marquis de Sade. Horrified but compelled. Now he\u2019s more boring, but we all fall prey to nostalgia.What\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?\u201cThe Giant All-Color Book of Fairy Tales,\u201d retold by Jane Carruth, Golden Press, 1971, from my parents. Stories with pictures by different artists. It was my staple as a child. I still have it, spine torn and taped up, pages soft and filthy with childish finger smears. Fifty retellings of Grimm and Andersen and Perrault, piercingly sad tales like \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d and \u201cThe Little Match Girl,\u201d as well as lighter tales about the foolishness of those darn peasants, like \u201cThe Golden Goose.\u201d But I remember even the odd and mediocre tales, like \u201cRicky of the Tuft,\u201d where a prince suffers from having bad hair until he finds a beautiful stupid princess he has the power to make smart. Luckily she has the power to fix his hair in return. Young royals should have to settle for nothing less than the total package.Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?Those that are hero and villain at once. Different ones dominated different times. Before I was 10 it was the Lorax and Aslan, then briefly Scarlett O\u2019Hara, until I switched my loyalty to saintly Melanie. I too will suffer nobly in silence, I decided for a while. But then it turned out silence did not come easily to me. Ignatius J. Reilly and Beckett\u2019s fictional proxies in my 20s, and Nabokov\u2019s Charles Kinbote and the terrible guy in Elias Canetti\u2019s \u201cAuto-da-F\u00e9.\u201d Deeply flawed men with vast blind spots. Eventually I stopped remembering or noticing characters\u2019 names and cared only about voices. In my 30s maybe the narrator of J. M. Coetzee\u2019s \u201cDisgrace,\u201d the voices in Virginia Woolf\u2019s books and Joy Williams\u2019s and Lydia Davis\u2019s, in funny books by Mary Ruefle and Julie Hecht. In my 40s, not sure. The heroes are in hiding.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?Avid, obsessive and a binge reader, where the binges were constant. Prone to dramatic weeping and hysterical laughter. Extreme identification with characters both tragic and comic. We didn\u2019t have a television until I was 12 or 13, so books were all. Stories with talking animals were my favorites, typically. I loved the genius Dr. Seuss. \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d and Edward Eager and Beverley Nichols, who wrote \u201cThe Tree That Sat Down\u201d and \u201cThe Stream That Stood Still.\u201d They\u2019re tragically neglected. The \u201cSwallows and Amazons\u201d series, by Arthur Ransome; P. G. Wodehouse; Diana Wynne Jones, though I came to her late; and Nancy Farmer. I love Philip Pullman and Garth Nix, but they weren\u2019t around when I was young. I read their books now instead.Whom would you want to write your life story? How do you decide what to read next? Is it reviews, word of mouth, books by friends, books for research? Does it depend on mood or do you plot in advance?A bit of everything. I admit I use the \u201cLook Inside\u201d feature on Amazon as a smell test. I don\u2019t often browse at real bookstores, though I buy from them, because I don\u2019t enjoy the standing-and-perusing model. I never did, even before the internet. I like to write socially at times, surrounded by people in public spaces, but not to read that way. As Amazon knows very well, \u201cLook Inside\u201d has a voyeuristic quality all its own. It\u2019s like speed-dating, where the date is a book.If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?This president? Yes.

Cupp Unfiltered.\u201dAs a college-educated twentysomething woman with cool glasses and an affinity for modern art and Ryan Adams, I had the constant experience of strangers assuming I was a liberal. I grew accustomed to the shock and horror that passed over their faces when I revealed that, yes, I am a Republican.Some liberals would explain, usually politely, that I didn\u2019t realize it but I must secretly hate myself and other women. Others presumed it must be a God thing. (I am an atheist.)And nearly every employer has looked at me and asked how I could possibly be a Republican. Loosely translated: \u201cI like you and you are too smart to believe the things you say you do.\u201dIn the two decades since I came out as a conservative woman, more and more of us have popped up on your television screens and in your local elections. Voting patterns show we\u2019re hardly the unicorns some still believe we are. And so I\u2019d suggest some caution for midterm watchers breathlessly predicting a blue wave of women in November.The idea that Democrats have a lock on the female vote is contradicted by history. Ronald Reagan won the female vote in 1980 against Jimmy Carter and by 16 points in 1984 against Walter Mondale. George H. W. Bush won women against Michael Dukakis in 1988. More recently, a slew of Republican governors have gotten a majority of female voters, including Ohio\u2019s John Kasich, who was the choice of 60 percent of women in 2014.Yet even though the Democratic Party commands just a slight majority of the female vote, it seems that organizations on the left are still capable of surprise when it comes to the very voters whose loyalty they claim.Not even President Trump\u2019s success with women in 2016 \u2014 he won only 41 percent of women overall, but a full 61 percent of the votes of white women without college educations \u2014 has shaken loose the presumption that women couldn\u2019t possibly support Mr. Trump or Trump-like candidates.That idea is only getting stronger.In early May, Michelle Obama delivered a speech at the United State of Women Summit in Los Angeles in which she expressed a common belief among Democrats: They are entitled to the women\u2019s vote. \u201cIn light of this last election, I\u2019m concerned about us as women and how we think,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is going on in our heads where we let that happen?\u201dMrs. Obama continued: \u201cIf we as women are still suspicious of one another, if we still have this crazy, crazy bar for each other that we don\u2019t have for men, if we\u2019re not comfortable with the notion that a woman could be our president compared to \u2026 what, then we have to have that conversation with ourselves as women.\u201dThink about what it really means to suggest having a \u201cconversation with ourselves as women\u201d when the conversation you are having is about how many women didn\u2019t vote the way you think they should have. When you\u2019ve decided that some women didn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton because they were \u201cnot comfortable with the notion that a woman could be our president\u201d \u2014 instead of not being comfortable with this particular candidate.I didn\u2019t vote for Mr. Trump and I don\u2019t support him now. But I\u2019m not surprised many women did and do.If Democrats want to know why women voted for Mr. Trump \u2014 or more important, why they didn\u2019t vote for Mrs. Clinton \u2014 they should stop presuming that their gender decides what lever they pull.Salena Zito, co-author of the new book \u201cThe Great Revolt: Inside the Populist Coalition Reshaping American Politics,\u201d recently surveyed 2,000 Trump voters in the rust belt. They are the kind of voters, she says, that experts overlooked in 2016 and still don\u2019t get today.One of them is Amy Maurer, a 43-year-old well-educated suburban mom in Kenosha, Wis, who is on the executive board of the Republican Party of Kenosha County. The Clinton campaign aimed ads at Republicans\u2014 even women like Ms. Maurer \u2014 keying in on Mr. Trump\u2019s misogynistic remarks.\u201cIt\u2019s not my favorite thing,\u201d she said when I asked her about the way Mr. Trump has talked about women. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like what I told my mother-in-law when she complained that her heart surgeon wasn\u2019t very friendly: If he\u2019s good at what he does, who cares? He\u2019s not there to be your best friend.\u201dMr. Trump wasn\u2019t Ms. Maurer\u2019s first choice. But he was good on the issues that mattered most to her. \u201cI always find it funny when I hear the term \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 because that term equates to birth control and abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a small-business owner, taxes and the economy are usually my primary concern when making a choice.\u201dBarbara Lee, an election expert, said that she was wrong in envisioning what role women would play in the 2016 election. Rather than a win for Mrs. Clinton, \u201cit was this epic loss that drove women, first to the streets and then to the campaign trail in numbers previously unimaginable,\u201d she told me.Everything?There\u2019s little evidence that women, by virtue of their gender alone, govern substantially differently than men. Is Joni Ernst, the hog-castrating Republican senator from Iowa who supported missile strikes in Syria, opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on China and supported Gina Haspel\u2019s C.I.A. nomination, making discernibly different decisions from her male counterparts? Or for that matter was Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, standing up for women any better than a man would have when she defended her colleague, Representative John Conyers, against sexual harassment accusations because he was \u201can icon\u201d?That more women are getting involved in politics \u2014 either by running for office, managing campaigns or voting \u2014 is a great thing. But the belief that female intensity in 2018 guarantees a blue wave is unlikely to bear out as decisively as some think. Especially not if women like Amy Maurer are any indication.When I asked her if she regretted her vote for Mr. Trump, she replied: \u201cAre you kidding? Business is booming, profit-sharing is up, we can give raises this year while also reinvesting in our business by purchasing some large machinery. The economy is doing great. We\u2019re definitely headed in the right direction.\u201dWomen may be having different conversations this year, but I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll be making different decisions at the ballot box.An earlier version of this article omitted a relevant detail about Amy Maurer, a Wisconsinite who voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Ms. Maurer is a Republican Party official in Kenosha County; that information should have been included with her comments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Serge Dassault, French Aviation Magnate, Is Dead at 93", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Serge Dassault, the French billionaire and aviation magnate who made successful forays into politics and the media but was caught up in corruption scandals later in life, died on Monday at his office in Paris. He was 93.\u201cBy serving his company, Serge Dassault never ceased to serve his country,\u201d Mr. Philippe said. \u201cIt was legitimate that the country express its gratitude today.\u201d\u201cHe was a Dassault through and through; he taught us what was valuable in life, the value of work,\u201d Olivier Dassault said. \u201cAt 8:30 a.m. he was in his office, despite his age.\u201d He added that his father had always insisted on the importance of employee profit-sharing.Mr. Dassault shared not only his father\u2019s passion for aviation but also his interests in politics and the media. He ran for office as a conservative and bought into several publishing ventures.In 1995, Mr. Dassault was elected mayor of Corbeil-Essonnes, a town 15 miles southeast of Paris, defeating a Communist incumbent. He was re-elected five times. He also held a seat in the Senate, France\u2019s upper house of Parliament, from 2004 to 2017.Mr. Dassault was admired in French business circles and by many politicians, especially conservatives, as an entrepreneur and as a symbol of economic patriotism. Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s economy minister, said in a statement that Mr. Dassault had been an \u201cambassador for French technological know-how abroad.\u201dBut others were critical of his cozy relations with politicians, his attempts to sway the editorial line at Le Figaro, and the corruption scandals that clouded his later years. In 2009, France\u2019s highest administrative court annulled Mr. Dassault\u2019s re-election as mayor of Corbeil-Essonnes over suspicions of illegal money donations to voters. He was also under investigation over accusations of buying votes in favor of his successor.The conflicting attitudes toward Mr. Dassault were on full display in French newsstands after his death.In February 2017, Mr. Dassault was found guilty of money laundering and tax fraud for hiding millions of his own euros in tax havens. He was fined two million euros. An appeal of the verdict had been scheduled to be heard in court in June.Serge Dassault was born in Paris on April 4, 1925. His father was born into a Jewish family as Marcel Bloch but changed his last name and converted to Roman Catholicism after World War II. His mother was Madeleine Minck\u00e8s.The Gestapo imprisoned Serge and his family in a French detention camp in 1944, and his father was deported to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where the Germans hoped to use his skills as an aircraft designer. The elder Mr. Dassault was freed after eight months. The other members of the family were freed within weeks of being seized, when the Germans abandoned the detention camp.Mr. Dassault went on to study engineering, including at the prestigious \u00c9cole Polytechnique, before starting work at his father\u2019s company in 1951, first in the aviation department and then, in 1963, as a senior manager in its electronics branch. He was chairman and chief executive of Dassault\u2019s aviation business from 1986 to 2000.In 2014, the Dassault Group named his right-hand man, Charles Edelstenne, currently the group\u2019s chief executive, to succeed Mr. Dassault.Besides his son Olivier, Mr. Dassault is survived by his wife, Nicole Raffel; three other children, Laurent, Thierry and Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne; and several grandchildren.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Do We Value Country Folk More Than City People?", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Wilkinson is a contributing opinion writer and the vice president for research at the Niskanen Center.The logic of our electoral institutions has always sorted the bulk of American voters into one of two major parties. What\u2019s new is that the sorting dynamic of urbanization now accounts for partisan sorting, too. Democrats have become the party of the multicultural city, Republicans the party of the monocultural country \u2014 the party of urbanization-resistant white people.Such a clean partisan break along density lines has thrown our democracy into a crisis of legitimacy and dysfunction. Our federal system of democratic representation has drifted dangerously out of sync with the geographic distribution, demographic makeup and outsize economic role of America\u2019s urbanized population.Our politics is cracking up over the density divide. Big cities and their distinctive interests are suffering a density penalty and need more visibility in our scheme of representation.Higher population density doesn\u2019t just predict higher Democratic vote share. It also predicts a less white population and a better-educated, higher-skilled, higher-productivity work force. Immigrants and minorities have long congregated in big cities, attracted by the opportunities, services and safety in numbers they supply.America\u2019s outdated system of representation allowed Donald Trump and the party of the monocultural country to seize total control of the state with a minority of votes and about 36 percent of the economy. That\u2019s not just a glitch. That\u2019s a disaster.Representative democracy is more than a means for determining public policy. It is more fundamentally an instrument of collective self-defense, a channel through which individuals can combine to peacefully resist domination and press for the equal protection of their rights and vital interests. In the absence of fair political representation, democracy inevitably fails in this defensive function.Donald Trump capriciously suspended DACA, and the nativist Republican minority in Congress derailed attempts to replace it, throwing into limbo the basic security and rights of nearly 800,000 young Americans without papers. A small city\u2019s worth of Dreamers \u2014 123,000 of them \u2014 live in Los Angeles County alone.A Democratic takeover of at least the House in the midterm elections would blunt Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to inflict this sort of cruelty \u2014 unless our system\u2019s density penalty allows Republicans to hold it with a minority of votes. It happened in 2012, and election wonks say it has a nearly one-in-three chance of happening again.The problem is structural and demands a structural solution. The place to begin is by acting now to expand representation for big cities and their interests.For example, instead of splitting up urban Los Angeles into eight or so legislative districts, a single district encompassing most of the city\u2019s population would send the top eight vote-getters from the entire district to Washington. Each would represent all of Los Angeles, more or less \u2014 and two or three would likely be Republican.A few heavily urbanized states taking this path would stock the House with a significant block of votes representing cities as unified communities, much as senators represent whole states, ensuring that distinctive urban interests, and groups whose members are concentrated in cities, have defenders in Congress. Moreover, an urban caucus within the House that included a smattering of big-city Republicans would mitigate the threat of polarized, low-density minority rule by discouraging Republican persecution of urban constituencies, incentivizing outreach to socially conservative communities of color and creating a needed platform for free-market ideas in sclerotic big-city Democratic politics.One of the great dangers of hyperpolarization is that it blinds us to threats to the nation that happen to work to the advantage of our partisan tribe. When we\u2019re determined to see the other party as an existential threat, no matter what, we feel compelled to push structural changes that benefit our \u201ctribe.\u201d We need to resist this temptation and patch our democracy to function in an urbanized world without asking for too much assurance that the parties will realign in a way that suits our tastes or that the balance of partisan power will shift in our team\u2019s favor.Families are being torn apart, thousands are packed into squalid prisons, and millions of city-dwelling Americans have been made to suffer under a regime of \u201cinstitutionalized cruelty\u201d because country people are anxious and city votes count less. Fixing this is far more important than whose team wins when we fix it, because the basic framework of democratic self-defense is far more important than any ephemeral policy. As Judith Shklar sagely said, \u201cwithout enough equality of power to protect and assert one\u2019s rights, freedom is but a hope.\u201dWill Wilkinson is a contributing opinion writer and the vice president for research at the Niskanen Center.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "75 Percent of Americans Say Immigration Is Good for Country, Poll Finds", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost Americans oppose the separation of immigrant families at the border, and a larger share of people than at any point since 2001 say immigration is good for the nation.Those were just some of the findings of polls published in the past week that shed new light on attitudes toward immigration, a subject that many Americans view as a top concern ahead of this fall\u2019s midterm elections.And despite the president\u2019s anti-immigration message, three in four Americans say immigration is generally good for the nation, according to Gallup, the polling organization.Here\u2019s what the recent polls show.Despite the contentious political climate, 75 percent of Americans think immigration, in general, is good for the nation, according to Gallup, which surveyed more than 1,500 adults during the first two weeks of June.Among Democrats and those who lean toward the party, 85 percent viewed immigration positively, compared with 65 percent of Republicans and those who lean Republican.When asked their thoughts about \u201clegal immigration\u201d specifically, even more Americans, about 84 percent, said it was good for the country.Support for reining in immigration is at its lowest level in more than half a century: Just 29 percent of Americans believe it should be decreased, the smallest share recorded by Gallup since at least 1965.Several recent polls found that most Americans disagreed with President Trump taking a hard-line approach to immigration enforcement by separating families at the border.In all three polls, those surveyed were about twice as likely to oppose separating families as to support it. But there was a large partisan divide: Republicans were more likely to support family separation than oppose it, while Democrats overwhelmingly disliked it. Independents strongly opposed the policy, just not to the same degree as Democrats.When Pew asked that same question in January 2017, immigration was cited less often than health care, the economy, unemployment, race relations and Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect.Both polls found that Republicans cited immigration far more often than Democrats. Still, Pew found that about one in five Democrats and Republicans alike wanted local candidates to discuss the issue this fall.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Anxiety About World Affairs ", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new poll finds that Australians are disillusioned with President Trump, and worried about Chinese investment, immigration and climate change.How do Australians feel about President Trump and the state of the world? Not good, on both counts, according to the Lowy Institute\u2019s annual poll of Australians, which was released Wednesday. The poll shows they\u2019re also not pleased with Chinese investment, immigration rates to Australia, or their country\u2019s response to climate change.Here are a few key findings that provide a summary of the country\u2019s mood and political direction on global issues. A slight majority of Australians (55 percent) say they trust the United States to \u201cact responsibly in the world\u201d \u2014 a six-point drop since 2017 and a 28-point collapse since 2011.The responses, from one of America\u2019s closest allies, represent the lowest level of trust in the United States recorded in 12 years of Lowy Institute polling. Australians still value their country\u2019s alliance with the United States \u2014 three out of four said the alliance was either \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cfairly\u201d important for Australia\u2019s security. It\u2019s the president that concerns them: 42 percent consider the presidency of Donald J. Trump a critical threat to Australia\u2019s interests. Australians are more concerned about China\u2019s influence on their economy than their politics. Even though Australian politicians have been especially focused on Chinese interference in politics over the past year, only 41 percent of Australians see \u201cforeign interference in Australian politics\u201d as a critical threat.And while 63 percent expressed concern about China\u2019s influence in Australian politics, almost as many (58 percent) said they were concerned about the influence of the United States.\u201cThis debate has not really resonated with Australia,\u201d said Alex Oliver, the poll\u2019s author. \u201cIt\u2019s not high on their list of concerns.\u201d A bigger priority for Australians is the flood of Chinese cash. Almost three-quarters of Australian adults (72 percent, up from 56 percent in 2014) said the Australian government was \u201callowing too much investment from China,\u201d especially in real estate and agriculture. For the first time, the Lowy Institute poll found that a majority of Australians (54 percent) think the current rate of immigration to Australia is too high. That\u2019s up 14 points since last year, and 17 points since the poll started asking the question in 2014.Australians also appear to be questioning immigration\u2019s impact on national identity. A majority (54 percent) still say \u201cAustralia\u2019s openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation,\u201d but a significant minority (41 percent) now say that \u201cif Australia is too open to people from all over the world, we risk losing our identity as a nation.\u201d Climate change is back on the Australian agenda: 59 percent of Australians said \u201cglobal warming is a serious and pressing problem\u201d about which \u201cwe should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs.\u201d That figure has been rising steadily since 2012, when it was 36 percent, but is still below the peak of 68 percent in 2006. Almost all Australians (84 percent) also said \u201cthe government should focus on renewables, even if this means we may need to invest more in infrastructure to make the system more reliable.\u201d Only 14 percent said the government should promote traditional energy sources like coal and gas despite the environmental costs.In past polls, Australians ages 18 to 29 expressed far less support for democracy than their elders, with a slight majority (52 percent) saying last year that they preferred it as a form of government. This year, that number dropped to 49 percent, and it\u2019s even lower among Australians ages 30 to 44 (45 percent). By contrast, 76 percent of those 45 and older favor democracy, which raises an interesting question: If Australia did not have compulsory voting, who would actually participate?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump Gets Right About Europe", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.HAMBURG, Germany \u2014 Most people can agree that international affairs should not be conducted by tweet \u2014 especially when the tweeter in question is Donald Trump. Among other reasons, it\u2019s easy to dismiss the president\u2019s mercurial rage and flagrant insults as little more than temper tantrums.But that\u2019s a mistake. Mr. Trump\u2019s anger at America\u2019s allies embodies, however unpleasantly, a not unreasonable point of view, and one that the rest of the world ignores at its peril: The global world order is unbalanced and inequitable. And unless something is done to correct it soon, it will collapse, with or without the president\u2019s tweets.While the West happily built the liberal order over the past 70 years, with Europe at its center, the Americans had the continent\u2019s back. In turn, as it unravels, America feels this loss of balance the hardest \u2014 it has always spent the most money and manpower to keep the system working.The Europeans have basically been free riders on the voyage, spending almost nothing on defense, and instead building vast social welfare systems at home and robust, well-protected export industries abroad. Rather than lash back at Mr. Trump, they would do better to ask how we got to this place, and how to get out.The European Union, as an institution, is one of the prime drivers of this inequity. At the Group of 7, for example, the constituent countries are described as all equals. But in reality, the union puts a thumb on the scales in its members\u2019 favor: It is a highly integrated, well-protected free-trade area that gives a huge leg up to, say, German car manufacturers while essentially punishing American companies who want to trade in the region.The eurozone offers a similar unfair advantage. If it were not for the euro, Germany would long ago have had to appreciate its currency in line with its enormous export surplus.Sure, eurozone membership makes imports to Germany more expensive than they would be under the deutschemark; wage restraint has also helped maintain the competitiveness of German machinery. But how can the very same politicians and journalists who defended the euro bailout payments during the financial crisis, arguing that Germany profited disproportionately from the common currency, now go berserk when Mr. Trump makes exactly this point?Mr. Trump is not the first president to complain about the unfair burden sharing within NATO. He\u2019s merely the first president not just to talk tough, but to get tough.Indeed, while his actions are shocking, the Europeans cannot say they are surprised. The warnings from the Obama administration that America\u2019s indulgence might eventually cease had been plenty. Yet Europeans didn\u2019t care much. All those German politicians who oppose raising military spending from a meager 1.3 percent of gross domestic product should try to explain to American students why their European peers enjoy free universities and health care, while they leave it up to others to cover for the West\u2019s military infrastructure.Europe\u2019s unfair trade advantage is not the only challenge to the liberal world order. In retrospect, allowing China into the World Trade Organization \u2014 one of that order\u2019s crowning achievements \u2014 was a huge mistake.When the door was opened, in 2001, many in the West believed that a growing Chinese middle class, enriched by and engaged with the world economy, would eventually claim voice and suffrage, thereby democratizing China. The opposite has happened. China, which has grown wealthy in part by stealing intellectual property from the West, is turning into an online-era dictatorship, while still denying reciprocity in investment and trade relations.Is this how you behave as a privileged member of the world\u2019s business club? China\u2019s unchecked abuse of the global free-trade regime makes a mockery of the very idea that the world can operate according to a rules-based order. Again, while many in the West have talked the talk about taking on China, only Mr. Trump has actually done something about it.Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs against Europe are patently illegal, and Europe should retaliate. But simply punishing the makers of motorcycles, blue jeans and bourbon whiskey doesn\u2019t solve any of the problems festering beneath the skin of the liberal world order. Europe needs to understand what is driving Mr. Trump\u2019s anger and cooperate with Washington to fix the imbalances in the system.That\u2019s easy to say in theory, but can Europe work with Mr. Trump in practice? Maybe not. But there\u2019s no real choice. And there\u2019s a good chance for success if Europe engages Mr. Trump by his New York tycoon soul \u2014 he needs to be convinced that he\u2019s getting a good deal. And right now, it\u2019s easy to see why he thinks otherwise.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the position of politicians and journalists regarding the euro zone bailouts. They defended them; they did not attack them.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

An elite Chinese think tank affiliated with the government warned this week that the chances of a financial panic had risen significantly, shaking markets even more.Chinese officials are trying to help factories deal with American tariffs by weakening the value of the country\u2019s currency. That makes Chinese goods more competitive abroad, but it also gives investors inside and outside China a reason to take their money out of the country. And it offers Mr. Trump an opportunity to criticize Beijing \u2014 in the past, he has railed against the country for weakening its currency.The chances of a financial collapse that could shake the world are slim. The Chinese government has vast sums of money it can tap in the event of a crisis. And there are steep financial barriers to keep money from fleeing the country. While investors have ways around the barriers, they limit the possibility that such a flight could bring one of the world\u2019s most important growth engines to a halt.China\u2019s stock markets reflect the uncertainty. The Chinese stock market as of this week is down more than 20 percent from its January peak, making it a bear market. The country\u2019s main stock index lost nearly 1 percent on Thursday.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what Trump is going to do next,\u201d said Hong Hao, the chief market strategist in the international unit of the Bank of Communications, one of China\u2019s biggest banks. \u201cNormally at this level, there should be a technical rebound.\u201dChina\u2019s moves with its currency reflect its difficult balancing act. The Chinese central bank has guided the currency steadily lower against the dollar, particularly in the past two weeks, as the likelihood of further American tariffs on Chinese goods has increased. The currency is down more than 5 percent from its peak in February.The value of the renminbi has fallen somewhat faster lately in the less-regulated Hong Kong market than in Shanghai trading. A widening gap between the two markets has long been a sign that investors are worried about the currency.China faces still more obstacles. The United States Federal Reserve has begun raising short-term interest rates. That increases the cost of borrowing money for Americans and, given the vast influence of the American economy, for the rest of the world. Such rate increases have caused unpleasant economic surprises worldwide in the past, which could hurt China if growth slows in the markets where it sells its goods.As if investors did not already have enough to worry about in China, a deeply pessimistic internal government analysis has widely circulated on social media this week. The analysis was written by Li Yang, the chairman of the National Institution of Finance and Development, a Beijing-based research group, and by three other economists.A person who picked up the phone at the think tank said that the document was genuine and that its release had not been intended.The document said that with \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes and the long-term and highly uncertain trade conflicts between China and the United States, we believe that in China there is currently a high probability of financial panic.\u201dOther economists cautioned that the analysis should not necessarily be treated as representing a consensus view within the Chinese government.Mr. Li has a reputation as being more bearish during financial crises than other Chinese government economists. He has also used periods of financial stress in China to oppose economic reformers who seek the opening up of the country\u2019s financial system to greater competition and more international flows of money, Mr. Hong said.The document leaked this week said that the way to prevent a financial panic was to create a separate stabilization fund to prop up the currency, rather than selling dollars and shrinking the money supply. Such a move could help insulate China\u2019s economy, because reducing the money supply makes it harder for families and businesses to borrow for purchases and investments, from buying an apartment to building a factory.By contrast, many economic reformers say that China would benefit from more openness. The closed Chinese financial system tends to steer money to state-owned enterprises instead of smaller and more entrepreneurial private sector businesses.Predictions by the report\u2019s authors aren\u2019t gospel, said Qian Qimin, the director of wealth management research at Shenwan Securities, a Shanghai brokerage.\u201cThey consider problems from a theoretical perspective and they look forward and alert government to the worst consequences, which is understandable,\u201d he said.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Prince Who Would Remake the World", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "OpinionIn Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s Saudi Arabia, women will take the wheel. How much is really changing?Supported byOpinion ColumnistAt the approach of members of the Saudi religious police, whose official mission is to promote virtue and prevent vice, she reached for her head scarf. She did not, however, put it on. Enough already, she thought.\u201cCover your head!\u201d the agents ordered her.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d they muttered, \u201cmay God protect you.\u201dWith that, the bearded enforcers limped away. They used to descend on stores that sell the shapeless black gowns called abayas imposed on Saudi women, scoop up those with any adornment \u2014 a trace of color, beads \u2014 and burn them. No longer: These once-feared upholders of a puritanical Islamic order are now defanged \u2014 completely neutered, as the woman put it to me.The prince\u2019s apparent aim is to upend just about everything, except the absolute rule exercised since 1932 by the House of Saud, with the help of oil and American power. He wants to liberalize, at least economically and socially, and so demonstrate that Islam, in the nation of its holiest cities, Mecca and Medina, is not a harsh, unbendable rule book based on ancient scripture but is rather compatible with modernity and tolerance.That\u2019s a bold project. The prince\u2019s father, the 82-year-old King Salman, is \u201cthe custodian of the two holy mosques.\u201d Custodianship is a conservative business. Look no further than Egypt\u2019s assassinated Anwar el-Sadat or the toppled shah of Iran to see the fate of tradition-trampling Westernizing leaders of Muslim Middle Eastern states. Saudi Arabia is not any such state. It\u2019s the lodestar.Perhaps his most radical proposition is the empowerment of women because the genuine liberation \u2014 and that\u2019s still in doubt \u2014 of half the Saudi population would transform the country and send a clear message of a modernized Islam.The prince\u2019s makeover could, in theory, change more than Saudi Arabia. Five times a day many of the world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims turn toward the country in prayer. \u201cWhen people look at Saudi Arabia, see Mecca and Medina, they want to emulate it,\u201d the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, told me in an interview. \u201cWhen they see openness and moderation and tolerance and innovation, that\u2019s what they want to be.\u201d No other country, he argued, has \u201cthat soft power.\u201dIn other words, change Islam in its Saudi nucleus and you change the world. It was not, of course, Saudi moderation that put 15 Saudis on the 9/11 planes. It was the well-funded metastasis of extreme Saudi religious intolerance \u2014 its Wahhabi orthodoxy \u2014 into forms of murderous Islamist hatred of the apostate West. It was the House of Saud\u2019s unseemly deal with fundamentalist clerical firebrands: Spare us here at home, and we\u2019ll grant you license abroad.It could still be that M.B.S. is the great Make Believe Show. But something is moving. Cynicism is too facile. \u201cI get annoyed with the West telling us the changes are cosmetic,\u201d Hoda Abdulrahman al-Helaissi, one of the first female members of the Shura Council, an advisory body to the king, told me. \u201cWe are changing at the rate of a high-speed train, not of a rocket. Young people, and 70 percent of the population is under 30, don\u2019t want to live as we lived. The prince understood we have to pull the tooth from the mouth!\u201dPrince Mohammed is everywhere, even when, as in recent weeks, he scales back his public appearances. I went to see Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, the economy minister, to find out how the heir to the throne operates. He told me he\u2019d met six times with the crown prince the previous week. M.B.S. fires rat-tat-tat questions at him: What do you need from me? What do you think of that crowd-management software for the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca? How do we make things happen? One meeting took place at 4 a.m.Things are happening, all right. A new Jeddah airport opened last month. The Riyadh subway will begin operation next year. Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil giant, is to be partly privatized. Ground has just been broken near Riyadh on a vast, multibillion-dollar \u201centertainment city\u201d that will include a Six Flags theme park and create 50,000 Saudi jobs, the minister said.Instead of husbands ferrying their wives around, women will be able to drive from A to B. Saudization of the work force is also feminization. \u201cOur preference ultimately is no difference between men and women in terms of involvement and seniority in the economy,\u201d the minister said.Rulers over 80, a Saudi norm, may be wise, but they are not risk-takers. Now, with the crown prince, gradualism is gone. It\u2019s all \u201cVision 2030,\u201d his slogan, and K.P.I.s (key performance indicators) on a forced march to a less oil-dependent country of mass tourism, empowered women, renewable energy, theme parks and the rest.Believe it if you will. This is the Saudi Arabia the crown prince sought to sell during a three-week American roadshow that ended in April. From Trump to Richard Branson, from Jeff Bezos to Oprah Winfrey, he peddled his message of reinvention and urged American investors to join the party. The second school is the pride-before-a-fall faction. They see a rash leader, as corrupt as those he\u2019s accused of corruption, embarked on the helter-skelter pursuit of modernization as he reinforces rule by royal decree, cutting subsidies even as he acquired a French chateau for several hundred million dollars. \u201cM.B.S. is erratic, irrational and immature,\u201d Samer Shehata, a professor of Middle East studies at the University of Oklahoma, told me. \u201cIs he really the man who can reconcile Saudi Arabia with the modern world?\u201dAt a restaurant, over rice and lamb, I met with a man in his 30s, a former journalist who\u2019s taken himself off Twitter and decided to go abroad for a few years to sit out what he sees as an unpredictable, troubling moment. What sort of transformation, he asked me, includes no political change and shuts the door on more freedom? In what kind of society are you a national security risk if you question the bungled war in Yemen? Saudi society, he mused, never challenges the government \u2014 as a public, press or parliament. Nor, it seems, will it any time soon.In a transition to democracy, the core question is often the degree to which civilian leaders can bring the military under control. But democracy is a nonstarter in Saudi Arabia. In the hybrid Saudi transition, the question is how far the Wahhabi religious conservatism that created security problems around the world, and made Saudi Arabia a very repressive place, can be curtailed on the way to \u201cnormality.\u201d Judged on that basis, I\u2019d say Prince Mohammed\u2019s chances of success are good for two reasons: He has amassed tremendous power, and tens of millions of restive young Saudis back him.That sounded much more like a needed Saudi mea culpa.A huge CNN screen behind the minister churned through stock prices, Trump and tumult. It\u2019s a reactionary moment in world affairs, yet maybe, just maybe, Saudi Arabia can inch in the other direction under the crown prince. Tuwaijri said: \u201cI'm not sure if the pace is sustainable. But 90 percent of the time he's cool.\u201d The minister paused before adding, \u201cAnd he's ready to change his mind.\u201dCould the Saudi prince, Qataris wonder, be suffering from a touch of pique and envy? Certainly, he has shown recklessness, both here and in Yemen, where the military coalition Saudi Arabia leads has been placed on a United Nations \u201clist of shame\u201d for the killing and maiming of children.The thrust was clear: To heck with Big Brother\u2019s demands to shut down Al Jazeera and cut off all relations with Iran!In response, Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, was equally defiant. I asked him in Riyadh why Saudi Arabia \u2014 along with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt \u2014 had imposed the blockade. \u201cHate!\u201d he said. \u201cInterfering in our affairs, paying money to terrorists.\u201d He urged Qatar \u201cto move from denial to introspection,\u201d adding that \u201cuntil they change, we\u2019re not going to talk to them.\u201dThe Qatar blockade was imposed on June 5, 2017, two weeks after Trump\u2019s lovefest in Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip as president. Trump exulted on Twitter: This was a blow to \u201cradical ideology.\u201d The president has since tried to row back his elation, and he hosted Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar at the White House in April. The fact is that neither Saudi Arabia nor Qatar is innocent when it comes to having funded Islamist extremism.Trump, at heart, has no interest in the details. His uncritical embrace of Saudi Arabia reflects a radical gut-driven, money-tinged reorientation of American foreign policy in the Middle East.This infuriated Saudis and the United Arab Emirates. It terrified them. In Trump they saw opportunity, plying him with flattery and blandishments. He has duly shredded Obama\u2019s attempted Saudi-Iranian rebalancing.The problem is Iran is a big, resource-rich country. Qatar and Iran share the world\u2019s biggest gas field. As Thani, the Qatari foreign minister, told me, Qatar has \u201clegitimate reason to have a relationship with Iran.\u201d In fact, it has no choice. But for Trump, and Prince Mohammed, any tie with Iran is heinous. Several times from Saudi ministers I heard Iran compared to Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime. The crown prince himself uses the analogy. This is pure Iran Derangement Syndrome. Iran is a repressive country with a hideous human rights record (just like Saudi Arabia) and an expansionist agenda in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. It needs to be confronted, with great firmness and creative diplomacy. It will not, however, surrender to Trump\u2019s braggadocio or Prince Mohammed\u2019s absolute demands, which play into the hands of Iranian hard-liners. So, as the United Arab Emirates\u2019 ambassador to the United States, Yousef al-Otaiba, told me over lunch in Washington, a big push went into backing the counterrevolution \u2014 that is, along with Saudi Arabia, plying tens of billions of dollars into backing the movement that ousted Morsi and installing as president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, whose repression of the Brotherhood has been brutal.This is the fundamental disagreement with Prince Mohammed, the basic Middle Eastern schism. He is betting that he can crush the Brotherhood and its sympathizers in Qatar, as well as crush Iran and its sympathizers in Yemen.Three years after it began, the Yemen war continues unabated, with widespread starvation, cholera, thousands dead, accounts of indiscriminate Saudi bombing of hospitals and schools, Houthi missiles being fired into Saudi Arabian towns, and spreading misery. If the prince can indeed change his mind, Qatar and Yemen would be good places to start. Qatar is not going to genuflect to every demand. Yemen is not going to be an Iran-free zone. \u201cWhere would we be if the Yemen war had not taken place?\u201d Helaissi, the Shura member, asked me. \u201cBut this has been terrible for our image around the world. I think it\u2019s our Vietnam.\u201dI went down to Jeddah, the Red Sea Saudi port and gateway for pilgrimages to Mecca. On the corniche, dotted with beaches, flanked by a new bike path, high-rise condos are going up beside luxury hotels. I tried to imagine this pleasant, uncluttered stretch of coast as a kind of Saudi Canc\u00fan a decade from now, with busloads of tourists clogging the streets.It was a stretch. What I saw was a pier with shaded areas down which formless black shapes \u2014 that is to say, women \u2014 glided with their faces veiled, one woman lifting the black flap over her mouth to insert an ice cream cone; and an official telling a little girl to get off her tricycle. I turned from the sea, where nobody swam, and looked for somewhere to get a cold drink by the beach. The Starbucks was closed for prayer. I waited in the blistering heat.At the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, I asked Saud Bin Saleh Al-Sarhan, the secretary general, and Abdullah bin Khalid Al-Saud, the director of research, how far the Saudi makeover could go. They suggested that where there is disagreement between Islamic scholars change would occur, but where there is unanimity it would not.Women would go uncovered; store closings for prayer and restaurant gender segregation would end; the crippling system of \u201cguardianship\u201d (already crumbling) that allows men to control the movement and lives of Saudi women would unravel; Medina might be accessible to non-Muslim tourists, Mecca probably not.However, alcohol, same-sex marriage and going public about homosexuality would never be allowed.I visited the Riyadh driving school for women, out on a university campus. It has a waiting list of a mere 70,000. Here, some 3,000 registered students go through 30 hours of training, for about $600, or about six times the cost of the course for men. (Saudi authorities insist the quality of the training is higher.) Her analysis of her country at the cusp struck me as about right. The crown prince is genuine. He\u2019s put his finger on what is keeping Saudi Arabia back. He lacks wisdom, especially on Qatar. There are lots of red lines, new and old, constant censorship, calls to blacklist any \u201canti-Saudi\u201d media. The centralization of power is alarming. Changes have occurred but have not been framed in law, which makes them vulnerable. And so? \u201cI am hopeful,\u201d Fassi told me. \u201cHopeful that 10 years from now we will have a public sphere that is more humane and safe for women, freed of the guardianship\u2019s abuses, and that will be good for the Saudi economy.\u201dI also think that will happen. If it does, Saudi Arabia\u2019s embodiment of a harsh, troublemaking Islam will have collapsed, and that could usher in the post-post-9/11 era. As a sign of his intent, Prince Mohammed should immediately release the female activists recently detained.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "All Over U.S., Local Officials Cancel Deals to Detain Immigrants", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLocal governments around the United States are starting to sever lucrative ties with federal immigration entities amid growing discomfort with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies. Fueled largely by alarm over the separation of migrant children from their parents, the cancellations suggest an attempt to disengage from federal policies seen as harmful to immigrant families \u2014 even when those policies could be pouring millions of dollars into local government budgets.\u201cIt just felt inherently unjust for Sacramento to make money from dealing with ICE,\u201d said Phil Serna, a Sacramento County supervisor who joined two colleagues in canceling the contract. \u201cFor me, it came down to an administration that is extremely hostile to immigrants. I didn\u2019t feel we should be part of that.\u201d\u201cDealing with ICE became distracting from the day-to-day operations of running our county,\u201d said Terry Cook, a commissioner in Williamson County in Texas, a relatively conservative part of the Austin metropolitan area where Dell Computer employs thousands of people.Ms. Cook was among the commissioners who voted 4 to 1 this week to end the county\u2019s contract with ICE by 2019, an agreement under which nearly 40 mothers separated from their children have been held in the T. Don Hutto Residential Center. The facility is managed by CoreCivic, a private prison operator, through an intergovernment agreement with the county.\u201cThe federal government made their bed with its policies, so let them sleep in it,\u201d said Ms. Cook, emphasizing that efforts to end the contract had started to gain momentum about four months ago, well before the migrant family separations made national headlines. \u201cWe did not need to be in the middle of this.\u201dIn some parts of the country, the discussions over ICE contracts seem to be widening political fissures.\u201cI don\u2019t like being called immoral and a racist,\u201d said Mr. Hissong, who described himself as a \u201cReagan Republican\u201d who dislikes the Trump administration. \u201cI just believe that the federal government has an obligation to uphold immigration laws and this would be an economic boon for us.\u201d\u201cWe need to approach each facility on a case-by-case basis to do what\u2019s right for the young people involved,\u201d said David Lichtenhan, vice chairman of the Yolo Interfaith Immigration Network, which urged the county to go forward with the contract. \u201cThe kids are vulnerable and could end up being moved into a district that\u2019s less favorable to immigrants than ours.

{"Headline": "Lobsters, Small-Batch Whiskey and Trump\u2019s Trade War", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Trump, who campaigned on a get-tough approach to trade, has said his tariffs would make trade pacts more fair and ultimately help American workers, farmers, manufacturers and other. But the situation could soon become politically perilous to Mr. Trump, whose trade policies are starting to inflict economic pain across the country, including in areas that are home to the voters who helped him win election.Business owners across the country are fearing the worst and wondering if Mr. Trump, who calls himself a master negotiator, will get the better end of the deal. Here are the ways several American products are being affected.In the 2016 presidential election, George Skarich, the vice president of sales for the Missouri-based Mid Continent Nail Corporation, voted for Mr. Trump and hoped that he would use his business acumen to supercharge the economy.The economy is booming, but Mr. Skarich said he was not reaping the benefits. Instead, as a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies, Mr. Skarich said his nail company may soon be out of business.Mid Continent, the largest American producer of nails, imports steel from Mexico to make its nails. That steel is now subject to the 25 percent tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on dozens of countries, forcing Mid Continent to raise its prices by nearly 20 percent.Orders have plummeted by 50 percent this month as the company tries to compete with cheaper foreign-made nails. Those foreign manufacturers are not facing higher steel costs, giving them an advantage over Mid Continent.The company, which employs about 500 workers, has already cut 60 jobs. It could potentially cut 200 more in the coming weeks.While Mr. Trump might propose that Mid Continent simply buy American-made steel, it might not be so simple: Mr. Skarich notes that the cost of American-made metal is much higher than what the company had been importing from Mexico, meaning it would still have to raise prices for its nails if it used domestic steel.Mr. Skarich, a Republican, has lobbied Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, for help.\u201cHe ran on \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 and the point was to defend and protect jobs in the United States,\u201d Mr. Skarich said. \u201cNow here is an action he decides to take that has the potential to cost 500 U.S. citizens their jobs.\u201dFor small distillers like Scott Harris, a founder of Catoctin Creek Distillery in Purcellville, Va., this has dampened happy hour.\u201cWe are just launching into the European market now in a big way, and this could be the worst possible timing for us,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cWe\u2019re probably going to see all of our European sales now come to a screeching halt.\u201dExports to Europe represent about a fourth of Catoctin Creek\u2019s annual sales, and the prospect of a 50 euro bottle of whiskey costing 25 percent more is troubling. Some bigger distillers shipped extra spirits to Europe before the tariffs were in place, but for small businesses, the shipping and warehousing costs are prohibitive.A self-described free-trade Republican, Mr. Harris is disappointed with the path that his party has taken on trade.\u201cI remember just two years ago we were talking about pushing hard for the Trans-Pacific Partnership so we could open markets in Asia, but all of that has just been turned upside down,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cIt really is quite puzzling.\u201dThe European response is not the only one that has industries on edge. Next month, China is expected to impose an additional 25 percent tariff on American lobster as the sparring over trade continues and Mr. Trump threatens to impose tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods.China buys about a fifth of American lobster exports, Ms. Tselikis said, and the value of those exports has nearly tripled in the last two years to $137 million.\u201cI\u2019d love see these tariffs not go through for the sake of our industry and the Maine economy,\u201d Ms. Tselikis said. \u201cAt this point it\u2019s really about American jobs.\u201dKristan Porter, the president of the Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association, said that he supported Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to renegotiate trade agreements to help American industry but hoped his was not harmed in the process.\u201cI\u2019m sure everybody is playing their hands and we\u2019re caught in the middle of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping cooler heads prevail.\u201dFor several years, the cranberry industry has been struggling with an oversupply problem that has been eased somewhat by exporting juice and berries to Europe and elsewhere.Now cranberry farmers are an unlikely victim of a trade war, in large part because Wisconsin is one of the world\u2019s biggest cranberry producers and is the home state of Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House.Like most Republican lawmakers, Mr. Ryan opposes tariffs and wanted to avoid a trade war. But other countries have targeted his and other politically important states in an effort to exert pressure on lawmakers and Mr. Trump ahead of the midterm elections.As a result, the European Union has included cranberries among the items subject to new tariffs that took effect this week, and the industry is about to feel the pain.Tom Lochner, executive director of the Wisconsin State Cranberry Growers Association, said that the tariffs would \u201chinder our ability to compete in international markets.\u201dAccording to the Cranberry Institute, a trade association, exports to Europe were about $127 million last year, and the additional costs of doing business there would most likely make a dent in that figure, putting family farmers at risk.Terry Humfeld, executive director of the institute, said while it was too soon to estimate the total market impact, the reason for singling out cranberries was obvious.\u201cFrom a political perspective, it makes sense to pick on those crops that would have the most significance politically,\u201d Mr. Humfeld said. \u201cThe speaker of the house happens to live in Wisconsin.\u201dEuropean tariffs on peanut butter will be a blow for the makers of Peter Pan and Skippy spreads, but it is peanut farmers in Republican-leaning states like Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi who could struggle the most.\u201cIf it affects the peanut butter market, it affects all of us,\u201d said Malcolm Broome, executive director of the Mississippi Peanut Growers Association. \u201cWe definitely don\u2019t need to get into a trade war.\u201dThe United States and China are the biggest peanut butter exporters in the world, according to the Department of Agriculture, and European tariffs would likely give China an edge in expanding its market share.Mr. Broome said that many of the peanut farmers in his state have been supportive of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda, but that they will be watching carefully to see how he manages the trade negotiations.\u201cIf this can give him some leverage to get a deal made, they\u2019d be all for that,\u201d Mr. Broome said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work and he\u2019s miscalculated, then it could be a different story.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The commission is empowered to impose fines of up to $11bn \u2014 which is 10 percent of the global turnover of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet \u2014 but typically decisions are at the lower end of the range.The decision will mark an escalation of the commission\u2019s battle with Google, which began eight years ago with an investigation into comparison shopping, then only a narrow part of online commerce. Though that case concluded with a \u20ac2.4bn fine, it has not led to significant changes to Google\u2019s business.The issue with AndroidAs the FT notes, this penalty could have big ramifications for Google. Its Android operating system dominated smartphone market worldwide because Google gave it away for free. But Ms. Vestager has been looking into whether the Silicon Valley behemoth improperly forced phone makers to favor services like Chrome and Google search, as well as stopping others from developing competing operating systems using the open-source parts of Android.The bigger picture\u2014 Michael de la MercedAthenahealth acknowledged that this was possible. From a statement by its executive chairman, Jeff Immelt, on Wednesday:To ensure athenahealth maximizes shareholder value and is best positioned to realize the full potential of its premier health care technology platform, the board has authorized a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger or continuing as an independent company under new leadership.The context Over the past two weeks, Mr. Bush (Athenahealth\u2019s co-founder, and a cousin of George W. Bush) had taken fire for a variety of disclosures about his conduct, both at the workplace and at home.In an unusual statement on Wednesday, Mr. Bush said of his exit:\u201cI believe that working for something larger than yourself is the greatest thing a human can do. A family, a cause, a company, a country \u2013 these things give shape and purpose to an otherwise mechanical and brief human existence. athenahealth is a near once in a life time example of such a thing. With that lens on, it\u2019s easy for me to see that the very things that made me useful to the company and cause in these past twenty-one years, are now exactly the things that are in the way. I cannot imagine a single organization more loaded with potential to transform health care.\u201dWhat happens nowAthenahealth has the investment banks Lazard and Centerview Partners and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges advising it on a potential sale.Elliott\u2019s response to the newsFrom a spokesman:\u201cElliott welcomes the Board\u2019s decision to explore strategic alternatives and believes it is the right one for athenahealth\u2019s shareholders, employees and customers.

He argued with Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, about whether he was allowed to give an opening statement to provide \u201cfew clarifications\u201d about what happened when he last testified before the same panel. He wasn\u2019t.Here are some choice interactions from the rest of the hearing:\u201cThe allegation is false, the facts are not correct.\u201d\u201cThose boxes were not ours. As far as I\u2019m aware, the I.C.O. were the only people to remove documents, files and hardware from that office.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t represent the company properly, I didn\u2019t represent what we do. In our overzealousness to secure a contract, Mark Turnbull and I were guilty of hyperbole of agreeing on matters that, not only had we never done, but we had no understanding of. We were telling a client what we thought he wanted to hear.\u201dDid Mr. Nix mean to mislead the politicians during his last hearing (in February, before the Cambridge Analytica scandal exploded)? Then, one member of the committee asked about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s possession of data obtained from Global Science Research, which has been originally gathered from Facebook users.\u201cIt was my firm impression that Mr. Collins\u2019 questions were about whether we were currently in possession of the data\u2026 so I answered no.\u201d\u201cWhen I read the transcript, it became clear that Mr. Collins was also asking whether we had ever held it. Clearly the answer should have been yes. The fact that we received data from G.S.R. was already in the public domain from as early as December 2015, when the Guardian published an article.\u201d\u201cI also stand by my evidence that we do not work on Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data. That data was given by G.S.R., and subsequently deleted at Facebook\u2019s request.\u201dHow useful was the Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, which was used to inform the company\u2019s work in the U.S.?\u201cThat data was less useful than simply using Facebook\u2019s own advertising algorithms.\u201d\u2014 Jamie CondliffeMore from Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X.

Lawmakers are irate anyway: Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that he will \u201clook forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that.\u201dMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, announced that he was dismissing the bureau\u2019s consumer advisory board, which provides feedback on its rules and policies.By law, the bureau must convene the advisory board and hold an in-person meeting with its members at least twice a year. The bureau canceled a meeting scheduled for February, and last week it canceled one planned for this week.Anthony Welcher, who, as one of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s deputies, oversees external affairs for the bureau, told those members of the board, which now numbers 25, that it would be reconstituted as a smaller group.The consumer advisory board\u2019s members are consumer activists, academics, entrepreneurs who run financial start-ups and industry representatives from companies including Citi, Discover, and Mastercard.The White House has said that it plans to help A.I. researchers develop better artificial intelligence systems by making government data available to researchers to help them. But the nation remains at risk of being overtaken as a global A.I. leader, as other nation states appear to value the technology more highly.\u201cAnything that we can do to unlock government data, we\u2019re committed to. We\u2019d love to hear from any academic that has any insights.\u201dSo far, a big part of the administration\u2019s approach to giving A.I. research a push has focused on removing regulatory barriers so that industry can apply the technology more quickly. It also says that it\u2019s increased investment in R.&D. for \u201cA.I. and related technologies\u201d by more than 40 percent since 2015 \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear what those \u201crelated technologies\u201d are.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeElsewhere in tradeBut something bigger is at work.

Oh, and Comcast is expected to fight hard for the other Fox assets that Disney wants, too.In a survey, America\u2019s CEOs expressed concern over the Trump administration\u2019s approach to trade, with 95 percent of respondents seeing a moderate or serious risk of \u201cforeign trade retaliation leading to lower U.S. exports.\u201d\u201cAs you may have read, Uber is now run by your dad \u2014 so, no, that interpretation was lost on him, but he appreciates Business Insider pointing it out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Susan Graham, Opera\u2019s Sweetheart, Tries Something New: Being Nasty", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe great mezzo-soprano Susan Graham turns 58 this summer. And she\u2019s celebrating by taking on one of her most challenging parts yet \u2014 and logging 20 flights of stairs during each performance.Fans who have grown accustomed to Ms. Graham\u2019s sweetness, both onstage and off, might be caught off guard by \u201cRegina\u201d; it demands an vocal ugliness that would drive some singing teachers insane. And her soothing stage presence takes a turn for the venomous here.\u201cThe character fits me scarily well,\u201d she said. \u201cI must have an inner Regina.\u201dIf Ms. Graham is exhausted \u2014 and she is, sometimes sleeping for nearly 12 hours after rehearsals \u2014 she doesn\u2019t show it. Local reviews have been laudatory, and her voice sounds as powerful and assured as ever. In her trademark way, she somehow manages to make the irredeemable Regina sympathetic, even tragic.\u201cSusan\u2019s still in her prime after 30 years,\u201d said Stephen Lord, the production\u2019s conductor and the festival\u2019s music director emeritus.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like this \u2018Regina,\u2019 you don\u2019t like \u2018Regina,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Graham said. \u201cThis is about a good a showing of it as you can get.\u201d\u201cRegina\u201d is one of those American operas \u2014 like George Gershwin\u2019s \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d and Kurt Weill\u2019s \u201cStreet Scene\u201d \u2014 that had their premieres on Broadway and have faced uphill battles at opera houses. It doesn\u2019t help that Blitzstein\u2019s score dabbles in ragtime, spirituals and parlor music alongside more conventional styles.Yet that melting-pot approach is why \u201cRegina,\u201d Mr. Lord said, \u201cembodies everything American opera could be.\u201d Blitzstein, sometimes at the risk of minstrelsy, absorbed the musical voice of the South, where the opera takes place, while writing symphonic music with the economy and directness of Copland. The score influenced some of Blitzstein\u2019s closest friends, including Leonard Bernstein, who not-so-subtly nods to it in \u201cMaria\u201d from \u201cWest Side Story\u201d and in the \u201cAuto-da-F\u00e9\u201d scene of \u201cCandide.\u201dWhen \u201cRegina\u201d had its premiere on Broadway \u2014 for reasons that were strictly commercial \u2014 the word \u201copera\u201d was stripped from the score and marquee because producers worried it would scare away audiences. With so much popular music and spoken dialogue, there was no consensus among critics on what to call it. Blitzstein settled the debate with his published score, which said \u201cRegina: An Opera.\u201dThe original Broadway production received cool reviews from theater critics, but largely positive ones from music writers who came to its defense too late to save it. They couldn\u2019t help, nor could Bernstein or a handful of other luminaries like Jerome Robbins and Tennessee Williams, who took out an ad in The New York Times urging people to buy tickets.In the 1950s \u201cRegina\u201d arrived at New York City Opera, with revisions that restored some sung lines that had been spoken on Broadway. Still, a flaw remained: It was far too faithful to Hellman\u2019s script. \u201cThe Little Foxes\u201d is talky, with convoluted, Shakespearean scheming; there\u2019s a reason that thin plots are characteristic of a sung art form.\u201cIt\u2019s a bloody difficult opera to put together,\u201d said James Robinson, Opera Theater\u2019s artistic director, who is directing this summer\u2019s production.\u201cYou have to direct \u2018The Little Foxes\u2019 and an opera at the same time,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything is so incredibly tied into a complex fabric that you have to make sure that the dialogue is at the same level as the singing, and that the singing speaks the dialogue.\u201dMr. Robinson regards \u201cRegina\u201d as one of the great American operas, alongside Carlisle Floyd\u2019s \u201cSusannah\u201d and John Adams\u2019s \u201cNixon in China.\u201d Both of those have been performed by the Metropolitan Opera, the great American opera house. \u201cRegina\u201d has not.\u201cUnfortunately the Met neglected a lot of contemporary opera for a considerable length of time,\u201d said Peter Gelb, the company\u2019s general manager. But, he added, \u201cit makes sense for the Met to produce them only if we can cast them with big singers, with promotional force.\u201dWould Ms. Graham take her new role to New York?\u201cI want every opera company in America to do this piece, with this cast,\u201d she said, before adding the caveat that the cavernous Met might not be a good fit: \u201cIt\u2019s a very intimate piece, and it has to find the right setting.\u201dShe thinks Santa Fe, where she has a home, would be perfect. So would Los Angeles Opera and the Glimmerglass Festival. \u201cI may have been putting bugs in people\u2019s ears,\u201d she said with a sly smile, \u201cbut they can never be reinforced too much.\u201dShe has grown comfortable with Regina, and with her castmates, most of whom are staying on the same floor at the hotel and hanging out at night, watching old movies in Mr. Morris\u2019s room. The younger performers \u2014 including the soprano Monica Dewey, who plays Regina\u2019s daughter, Alexandra \u2014 have been watching Ms. Graham with the attention of eager students.\u201cThe fact that I got to be her colleague took a lot of processing and preparation,\u201d Ms. Dewey said, \u201cbut she has treated everybody as a neighbor. She invited me out to lunch on our first break.\u201dThe experience has also been a homecoming for Ms. Graham, who made her professional debut at Opera Theater in Samuel Barber\u2019s \u201cVanessa\u201d 30 years ago. \u201cThere are patrons of a certain age who can remember my first performance,\u201d she said.From there she made a name for herself in trouser roles like Cherubino in \u201cLe Nozze di Figaro,\u201d as well as with ing\u00e9nues like Dorabella in \u201cCos\u00ec Fan Tutte\u201d and Charlotte in \u201cWerther.\u201d Another of her signature roles was Octavian in \u201cDer Rosenkavalier,\u201d which she said she can still sing, but avoids because of it\u2019s so physically demanding.\u201cSword fighting and jumping on and off furniture \u2014 ouch!\u201d she said, adding that when she performed the role at the Met in 2010, she logged two miles on her pedometer during the first act alone. \u201cThat got to be too much.\u201dShe doesn\u2019t perform most of those roles anymore and misses some of them \u2014 especially Charlotte \u2014 but in recent years Ms. Graham has broadened her repertory with new characters she has come to love: Didon in \u201cLes Troyens,\u201d for example, and \u2014 though it took a lot of getting used to \u2014 Countess Geschwitz in Alban Berg\u2019s \u201cLulu.\u201d (Mr. Gelb said she would return to the Met in \u201cLulu,\u201d as well as in the coming company premiere of Jake Heggie\u2019s \u201cDead Man Walking.\u201d)There, Ms. Graham has joined Los Angeles Opera as the artistic adviser of its young artists program. The twins, who are in the Los Angeles Children\u2019s Chorus, occasionally perform with the company.\u201cIt\u2019s all opened new chapters,\u201d Ms. Graham said at the hotel, where her family was outside playing in the pool, adding that her life now is \u201cmore about doing things that make me happy and enriching the family life that we\u2019re building.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t hungry for new roles, or even new kinds of performance. As a fan of \u201970s and \u201980s ballad singers, she said she could see herself singing more cabaret: \u201cI might do the Barbara Cook thing, who knows?\u201dShe does know that she isn\u2019t interested in settling down in an academic post. (\u201cThat\u2019s not my jam.\u201d) And at any rate, her body isn\u2019t telling her it\u2019s time to start slowing down.\u201cI\u2019m very grateful that my voice is still working well,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still up for doing this, as long as I can.\u201dMs. Graham isn\u2019t done playing the villain either, now that she\u2019s had a taste. Her next role debut is in \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d at Los Angeles Opera this fall. But she won\u2019t be in the trouser role: She\u2019ll be the Witch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbus Tells Britain It Wants Details of a Brexit Deal, or Else", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Britain voted almost exactly two years ago to leave the European Union, and months before it must agree on a withdrawal deal or crash out of the bloc, much remains undecided. Too much, for at least one company.On Friday, the European aerospace giant Airbus, which makes commercial airliners like the A380 as well as military aircraft, delivered a stark warning to the British government: Give us more clarity, or we might leave the country.But with Britain set to leave the bloc at the end of March, few details have been ironed out. Banks based in Britain do not know what access they will have to Continental markets, pharmaceutical companies do not know how their drugs will be regulated, and airlines are unsure whether they will need to create separate entities with headquarters abroad.Airbus voiced many of those frustrations on Friday. The company, which employs about 14,000 people in Britain, said uncertainty about the country\u2019s future relationship with the European Union was forcing it to reconsider whether it should continue developing airplane wings in Britain. It warned that it had to make decisions this summer about supplies and investments that would affect it beyond the spring, when Britain is set to leave the bloc.\u201cThe U.K. exiting the E.U. next year without a deal,\u201d the company said, \u201cwould lead to severe disruption and interruption of U.K. production.\u201d\u201cThis scenario,\u201d it continued, \u201cwould force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the U.K., and its long-term footprint in the country.\u201dAirbus said that it had more than 4,000 suppliers in Britain, and that parts for its planes and other products crossed the English Channel multiple times. Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, the company said, \u201cwill set new boundary conditions cutting through this highly integrated system.\u201d If Britain withdraws without reaching a deal with Brussels, the company said, it could lose as much as 1 billion euros, or about $1.16 billion, a week in revenue.Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated the outline of a deal in which Britain would remain subject to European Union rules for a transitional period immediately after its planned date of withdrawal.However, that is conditional on striking a broader agreement on several thorny issues, including a backstop plan to prevent the imposition of border controls between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union. That complex problem still has to be resolved.Nor is there agreement in London on Britain\u2019s plan for its longer-term economic relationship with the European Union, and how close future ties should be \u2014 an issue that has divided and paralyzed the government.Even if Mrs. May manages to break that deadlock and unite her cabinet, she faces the task of negotiating such a settlement with the European Union.Businesses are growing increasingly nervous.\u201cEven if we move into a standstill transition, that\u2019s going to last two years, and most business leaders think that\u2019s insufficient,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director in Europe for the Eurasia Group, referring to a transition arrangement in which Britain remained subject to the same rules as though it were a full member of the European Union.\u201cI do think many other business are thinking the same thing, and many are likely to come out in public in the next few weeks,\u201d he added.Some already have.Any move by Airbus could put a dent in the British economy. Airbus argues that its decisions will have a significant impact, claiming that it indirectly supports more than 110,000 jobs and contributed 7.8 billion pounds, or $10.3 billion, to the British economy in 2015, according to analysis done for the company by Oxford Economics, a research company.Many businesses \u201care going to think very hard before choosing the U.K. if they don\u2019t know whether it will be part of the integrated market\u201d of the European Union, said Thomas Sampson, a lecturer at the London School of Economics.Airbus\u2019s decision to publicize its stance, Mr. Sampson said, suggested that it didn\u2019t feel the government was listening to its private appeals. \u201cIt\u2019s another signal,\u201d he continued, \u201cof how unhappy the business community is.\u201dStephen Castle contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Message of the June Fed Meeting: There\u2019s a New Chairman in Charge", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJerome Powell\u2019s policy decision was in line with his predecessors, but he made a series of changes that give him more flexibility in the years ahead.He began his session with the news media with what he called a \u201cplain-English\u201d description of what the Fed had done and why, a contrast with the practice of his predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, both Ph.D. economists who prefaced their appearances with long prepared statements loaded with monetary policy jargon.\u201cThe economy is doing very well,\u201d Mr. Powell said, standing before reporters (Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke both chose to sit at a desk for their post-meeting news conferences). \u201cMost people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment and inflation are low.\u201dMr. Powell announced that he would begin holding a news conference after every Fed policy meeting starting in January; currently such a session is held after only four of the eight annual meetings.Although he said this was not meant to signal any change in the direction of policy, it opens up more flexibility for the Fed as it sets interest rate policies. Financial markets currently expect interest rate increases only in meetings with a news conference; now the Fed will have the option of making more than four policy moves a year without unnecessarily surprising markets.And the Federal Open Market Committee, which Mr. Powell leads, changed its statement describing its rate increase in a way that removed a mainstay of its monetary policy of recent years. Dating to the Bernanke era, the Fed has used \u201cforward guidance\u201d to signal the future direction of interest rates.For example, at the March policy meeting, the committee said that its interest rate target \u201cis likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\u201dThat language was excised from the new policy statement, which said only that the \u201ctiming and size\u201d of future rate increases will be determined by many factors.This change reflects a judgment that the economy is in much sounder shape than it was a few years ago, when its policy rate was stuck near zero and this forward guidance was a tool the Fed used to try to guide interest rates.Taken together, Mr. Powell signaled a Fed that is broadly confident in the state of the economy, and happy to say so for the audience far beyond the bond traders who hang on the Fed chairman\u2019s every word.A risk with these moves is that the Fed \u2014 which has carefully maintained its image as a bastion of cautious, apolitical policymaking in Washington \u2014 might become too quick to make abrupt changes, or adopt a tinge of showmanship.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Did the Nazis Gain Power in Germany?", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The Nazis, in Hett\u2019s account, were above all \u201ca nationalist protest movement against globalization.\u201d Even before the Great Depression brought huge unemployment to Germany, the caprice of the global economy offered an opportunity to politicians who had simple answers. In their 1920 program, the Nazis proclaimed that \u201cmembers of foreign nations (noncitizens) are to be expelled from Germany.\u201d Next would come autarky: Germans would conquer the territory they needed to be self-sufficient, and then create their own economy in isolation from that of the rest of the world. As Goebbels put it, \u201cWe want to build a wall, a protective wall.\u201d Hitler maintained that the vicissitudes of globalization were not the result of economic forces but of a Jewish international conspiracy.As Hett capably shows, the Nazis were the great artists of victimhood fiction. Hitler, who had served with German Jews in the war, spread the idea that Jews had been the enemy within, proposing that the German Army would have won had some of them been gassed to death. Goebbels had Nazi storm troopers attack leftists precisely so that he could claim that the Nazis were victims of Communist violence. Hitler believed in telling lies so big that their very scale left some residue of credibility. The Nazi program foresaw that newspapers would serve the \u201cgeneral good\u201d rather than reporting, and promised \u201clegal warfare\u201d against opponents who spread information they did not like. They opposed what they called \u201cthe system\u201d by rejecting its basis in the factual world. Germans were not rational individuals with interests, the reasoning went, but members of a tribe that wanted to follow a leader (F\u00fchrer).Did the Nazis come to power through democratic elections? In Germany in the 1930s, as elsewhere, elections continued even as their meaning changed. The fact that the Nazis used violence to intimidate others meant that elections were not free in the normal sense. And the system was rigged in their favor by men in power who had no use for democracy or for democrats. The Nazis were by no means the handmaidens of German industry or the German military but, as Hett argues, both businessmen and officers formed lobbies in the late 1920s that aimed to break the republic and its bastion, the Social Democrats. They tended to confuse their particular interests in lower wages and higher military spending with those of the German nation as a whole. This made it easy to see the Social Democrats as foreign and hostile.When elections were called in 1932, the purpose was not to confirm democracy but to bring down the republic. Hindenburg and his advisers saw the Nazis as a group capable of creating a majority for the right. The elections were a \u201csolution\u201d to a fake crisis that had been, as Hett puts it, \u201cmanufactured by a political right wing that wanted to exclude more than half the population from political representation and refused even the mildest compromise.\u201d It did not occur to the president\u2019s camp that the Nazis would do as well as they did, or that their leader would escape their control. And so the feckless schemes of the conservatives realized the violent dreams of the Nazis. The Nazis won 37 percent of the vote in July, 33 percent in a November election, and Hitler became chancellor in January 1933. A few weeks later, he used the pretext of the arson of the Reichstag to pass an enabling act that in effect replaced the constitution.The conclusions for conservatives of today emerge clearly: Do not break the rules that hold a republic together, because one day you will need order. And do not destroy the opponents who respect those rules, because one day you will miss them.An earlier version of this review misstated the year of Hitler\u2019s attempted coup. It was 1923, not 1924.Timothy Snyder is the Levin professor of history at Yale University. His latest book is \u201cThe Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Vote on Marijuana Paves the Way for Legalization", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Canada\u2019s Senate passed legislation on Tuesday that will make the country the first major economy to legalize recreational marijuana use.The bill, which was approved by the House of Commons on Monday, goes next to the governor-general, the representative of Queen Elizabeth, as a formality. Once it is formally approved, the legislation is expected to create a multibillion dollar industry, with Canada joining Uruguay in allowing its citizens on a national level to use marijuana without fear of arrest.\u201cWe\u2019ve just witnessed a historic vote for Canada, the end of 90 years of prohibition,\u201d said Tony Dean, the senator who sponsored the bill in the chamber.There remain significant concerns about the social and health effects of marijuana.\u201cNow we can start to tackle some of the harms of cannabis,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Dean said. \u201cWe can start to be proactive in public education. We\u2019ll see the end of criminalization and we can start addressing Canada\u2019s $7 billion illegal market.\u201dPrime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government had originally hoped to have the legal sale of marijuana begin by July 1. But provincial governments will now need eight to 12 weeks to prepare retailing systems, government officials said.On Twitter, Jody Wilson-Raybould, the justice minister, said the bill \u201cwill help protect our youth from the risks of cannabis while keeping profits out of the hands of criminals and organized crime.\u201dThe legislation was a signature piece of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s platform in the 2015 election campaign. The idea was rejected by the opposition Conservative Party in Parliament and was questioned by some of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s supporters. Polls indicate Canadians are divided on the initiative.Senator Linda Frum, a Conservative, wrote on Twitter that the bill\u2019s approval was a \u201csad day for Canada\u2019s kids.\u201dMr. Trudeau and his cabinet members have argued that criminalization had failed, enriching organized crime while ruining the lives of people convicted of possession.Precisely how Canada\u2019s system will operate will not be fully known until the government makes public detailed regulations. But the broad plan is for a tightly controlled system that some marijuana advocates argue will be a form of prohibition in itself.There will be strict limits on advertising marijuana, and it will likely be sold in uniform packages that carry health warnings as their only decoration. Candies, baked goods and other edible products containing marijuana will, initially at least, continue to be banned.While the federal government will set the overall laws governing recreational marijuana and will license growers, the provinces will determine how it will be sold to consumers. Some provinces, like Ontario, plan to set up government operated stores. But other provinces, notably Alberta, will license private sector retailers.The minimum age for use will be 18 or 19, with the provinces authorized to make that determination. The Canadian Medical Association had recommended a minimum age of 21.Experts also disagree on how effectively the police will be able to screen motorists for marijuana impairment once sales begin.Some provinces had wanted to ban home growing of marijuana, and they were initially backed by the Senate. But the government prevailed and individuals will be permitted to tend up to four plants.Follow Ian Austen on Twitter: @ianraustenAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Have There Been No Great Black Art Dealers? ", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow a small but influential group of black gallerists is correcting history.The art world of the \u201960s and \u201970s in general, \u201cwas a hostile environment for black folks,\u201d recalls Linda Goode Bryant, who, in 1974, challenged the white establishment in New York by opening a gallery of her own. Black artists then were still embarrassingly absent from museums (a 1969 show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, called \u201cHarlem on My Mind: Cultural Capital of Black America, 1900-1968,\u201d infamously contained no work by black artists) and there were wild discrepancies in value between white artists and their non-white peers. Realtors, unreceptive to the idea of showing work by \u201cblack artists,\u201d would hang up on Bryant, and it wasn\u2019t until she started calling her gallery a place for \u201cemerging artists\u201d that she could secure a space. She went directly to 57th Street, then the financial heart of the art world, and Just Above Midtown (better known as JAM) was born.What these art dealers understood is that the gallery, as an entr\u00e9e into the art market, is the sole platform for an artist to make a living. And in many ways, galleries are where the hierarchy of power in the art world begins and ends. They discover an artist\u2019s work and promote it to both collectors and institutions; the work rises in value once it enters a museum, and this ultimately leads to more gallery shows. It is an unchanging cycle that for decades artists of color, lacking a commercial outlet, \u201ccouldn\u2019t even attempt to break into,\u201d according to Bryant.  \u201cIf someone wants to do a \u2018black art\u2019 show and put together several of my artists who are only thematically linked only by a thread, we\u2019re going to have a conversation about that,\u201d Bellorado-Samuels says. \u201cWe\u2019re the artist\u2019s first line of defense; part of our responsibility is to build their market, and another is to navigate how we talk about them, and how we contextualize them.\u201d The pioneering black art dealers have all since moved on: JAM closed in 1986, after which Bryant became senior policy analyst for development during the Mayor David Dinkins\u2019s administration and a Peabody Award-winning documentary filmmaker; Brockman Gallery shuttered in 1990, and both brothers continued their respective teaching careers and artistic practices, and Alonzo moved to the East Coast. In the path they cleared, black gallerists continue to disrupt the art world\u2019s homogeneity, one show, one art fair, or one press release at a time. WHY HAVE THERE been so few black gallerists? Besides the legacy of their historic exclusion, one reason is that starting a gallery takes tremendous resources; Linda Goode Bryant had been lucky enough to find a landlord who would turn a blind eye to her absent rent payments, and a community of artists and curators who would install the parquet flooring for free. Another reason: The predominantly white art world can still be an uncomfortable space for a person of color to navigate, both in the making of art and the selling of it. Haynes, happy about the overall climate, is still reticent to hand out pats on the back. \u201cA lot of time has passed that no one paid attention, and no one should be congratulated for paying attention now.\u201d And during a time when the representation of blackness within the mainstream has become an increasingly central civil rights issue, to be a black gallerist in 2018 still entails the tedious sidestepping of both the fetishization of black artists, as well as the assumptions of what a gallerist should look like. Progress, however, does reveal itself in small victories. Jenkins-Johnson recalls participating in the 2017 edition of the Association of International Photography Art Dealers fair in New York, where she was exhibiting next to Ibrahim and Atlanta-based gallerist Arnika Dawkins. \u201cThat was a groundbreaking time,\u201d Jenkins-Johnson says, \u201cto have three black-owned galleries in one fair.\u201d Her first instinct was to pull out her camera. \u201cI said, \u2018We gotta have a photo to mark this occasion.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

Overwhelmingly white and culturally conservative, it is an uneasy mix of working-class struggles and old-money prosperity \u2014 bourbon distilleries and luxuriant horse farms, one very large auto plant and the University of Kentucky. President Trump and the Second Amendment are popular here, but not in that order. Reverence for veterans runs deep.\u201cI didn\u2019t have the luxury of voting the way I felt or taking the positions I wanted to take or even the best positions,\u201d he said in an interview on the farm that has been in his family since 1784. \u201cI had to balance that with what the people I represented wanted.\u201dBy 2012, after four terms in office, Mr. Chandler found that formula no longer worked. In an increasingly polarized country, there was no longer a middle of the road in the Sixth District. A Republican, Andy Barr, defeated him and has won re-election two times since.Now, Ms. McGrath\u2019s race against Mr. Barr will test the limits of any Democratic wave in the midterm elections and of the power of female candidates in a year with a record number of women running for Congress. If Ms. McGrath and others like her can win, Democrats would almost certainly retake control of the House.She will have to run up large margins in the few heavily populated areas that lean Democratic, such as Lexington and Frankfort. More challenging, she will have to win the votes of rural residents who feel alienated from the national Democratic Party, stepping squarely into the culture wars over guns, same-sex rights and access to health care.A Democrat\u2019s path to victory starts in Lexington, a city of more than 300,000 in a county with the state\u2019s highest percentage of college graduates that often provides about 40 percent of the overall vote. Lexington is ringed by suburbs where Democrats are hoping Ms. McGrath can pick off the votes of suburban women and men who will be drawn to her military service.In the other 18 counties outside Fayette, Mr. Trump won with an average of 63 percent of the vote. Mr. Barr, who has deep reserves of trust and affection in rural precincts, won his race that year by 22 percentage points.But Ms. McGrath may have the kind of profile that can bring around some conservatives, win over moderates and appeal to liberals.\u201cThe word most people would apply to her is tough,\u201d said Al Cross, the director at the University of Kentucky\u2019s Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues. \u201cShe has a pretty well-defined identity.\u201dIn her primary victory over Mr. Gray, Ms. McGrath won handily in all of the rural counties, including Anderson, where tobacco farms have either gone to seed or given way to subdivisions as it has evolved into a bedroom community for Frankfort or Lexington. Mr. Trump won nearly 75 percent of the vote here.But Ms. McGrath decided early that she would compete for votes in the county. In November, she came to sit for an interview in the office of Ben Carlson, the editor and publisher of the weekly Anderson News, the principal source of local news, with a subscription price of $30 a year and a market penetration of 32 percent. \u201cCongressional candidates don\u2019t flock into The Anderson News asking us to interview them,\u201d Mr. Carlson said.He delivered a 3,500-word, front-page article, covering a number of issues, including ones that could cause Ms. McGrath trouble in the race against Mr. Barr. \u201cWhat really surprised me was how honest and open she was about things she knew dang well weren\u2019t going to be popular here,\u201d he said.Mr. Carlson attends dozens of community meetings a month and prides himself on being able to gauge sentiment. \u201cShe was accessible,\u201d he said of Ms. McGrath\u2019s campaign appearances. \u201cPeople love the Marine Corps thing.\u201dThey do not like her position on guns, he said, because Ms. McGrath calls for background checks and banning bump stocks on weapons. \u201cThis is very, very, very pro-gun country,\u201d Mr. Carlson said. \u201cAn assault rifle ban will go over like a lead balloon. There are more AR-15s in this county than you can shake a stick at.\u201dIn another rural area, Donna Barnes, the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Montgomery County, agrees. The people here \u201c are passionate about the Second Amendment,\u201d she said. \u201cMs. McGrath has changed her stance on gun control and when she did that, she actually lost some of the interest of Montgomery County.\u201dMs. Barnes also said that voters needed to hear more about Ms. McGrath than her biography. \u201cBasically, all we are hearing is \u2018I am a veteran, vote for me.\u2019\u201dFor many others, though, Ms. McGrath\u2019s military service will be appealing and could help to inoculate her on a number of issues. To break through, she has opened a number of field offices in rural counties, including Clark, where her staff has a presence on the historic Main Street in Winchester.Ed Burtner, the mayor of Winchester and former Marine who served in Vietnam, is no fan of Mr. Trump because of the president\u2019s criticism of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, but he said the president\u2019s support runs deep here. \u201cI haven\u2019t found a single person that said they voted for Trump that has also not said they wouldn\u2019t do it again,\u201d Mr. Burtner said.\u201cWe\u2019ve got that conservative base and in some cases ultra conservative base,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she has to recognize that\u2019s here, and that\u2019s going to be in a lot of the communities where she is running.\u201dHenry Branham, a local judge and Democrat, said that people did not engage him on the subject of the president, but that hardly meant an embrace of his party. \u201cClark County is so far from Nancy Pelosi, it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d Mr. Branham said.Republicans tried to quickly define Ms. McGrath as too liberal for the district.\u201cPeople accepted gay marriage; they don\u2019t like it,\u201d Mr. Carlson said of people in Anderson County. \u201cTransgender in the military. A lot of the feedback was, I really like her, but boy, she is awfully liberal.\u201dBut her military r\u00e9sum\u00e9 provides a strong counterpoint. Lawrenceburg, the Anderson County seat, has a healing field with flags to honor every Kentuckian who has been killed in the war on terrorism. The American Legion is the largest civic group.\u201cHow do you caricature someone as a liberal who has bombed terrorists?\u201d Mr. Chandler said. \u201cThat\u2019s ludicrous. I hope they try it.

{"Headline": "A Trump-Kim Deal Could Send China\u2019s Trade With North Korea Soaring", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUNCHUN, China \u2014 In the Chinese border town of Hunchun, garment factories gladly employ squads of North Koreans, who are valued as skilled and dutiful workers. Live crab from the North wriggle in huge tanks in the fish market. Informal bankers promise to deliver the equivalent of thousands of dollars in Chinese currency to North Koreans across the border in a matter of hours.Up and down the 900-mile border, in fact, Chinese businesspeople export and import things like Chinese-made street lighting and exotic North Korean-grown mushrooms.By all indications, China has at least officially enforced the international sanctions that have been imposed on the North to curtail its nuclear weapons program. But on the border, the signs of North Korea\u2019s economic dependence on China are evident in a shadow economy of cash couriers, short-term workers and gray-market trading that has persisted despite the sanctions.And with President Trump\u2019s summit meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, back on track, excitement is growing about the opportunities that could open up should the sanctions be eased.\u201cThat\u2019s their neighborhood; it\u2019s not our neighborhood,\u201d said Mr. Trump, leaving aside the fact that American troops have been stationed on the peninsula for decades.Much of the business is driven by demand from a nascent North Korean middle class, which Chinese traders said could become a group of avid new consumers once sanctions are eased.The changes in the North are largely the work of the young leader, Mr. Kim. He has lifted the controls of the command economy to allow small-time trading, smuggling and \u201cshuttle traders\u201d who move with ease between China and his nation, economists and Chinese businesspeople say. In a New Year\u2019s speech in January, Mr. Kim said that having developed a nuclear arsenal, he would now turn his attention to improving the lives of his people.While this growth has bolstered popular support for the Kim family dynasty, the North Korean leadership is aware that it can also be a two-edged sword, he said. Having set itself on this road of economic improvement, North Korea must continue to find ways to expand and develop a national economy whose output is still just $20 billion \u2014 half the size of that of South Korea\u2019s sixth-largest city, Gwangju.\u201cNorth Korea is now a place where you can enjoy a normal life compared to the 1990s,\u201d said Mr. Kim, the economist. \u201cMoney has become very important. People there are saying if they can have money they have no reason to flee to South Korea.\u201dThe support of the middle class is vital for the North Korean leader, and so far he seems to have gained it. That holds true not only in the capital, Pyongyang, but in other towns to the north, said Andrei Lankov, a Russian expert on North Korea who has lived in the North and maintains ties there.\u201cKim Jong-un is popular,\u201d Mr. Lankov said. \u201cEveryone supports him.\u201dChina is anxious to repair its tattered alliance with the North and is determined to play a dominant role, along with South Korea, in any reset of the North\u2019s economy. In perhaps the most telling sign of a revival in trade, Air China announced Tuesday that it would resume regular flights from Beijing to Pyongyang on Wednesday. The sudden resumption came after flights were suspended last November because of negligible demand, the airline said.The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, met in Beijing last month with a delegation of North Korean mayors and governors, an unusual gesture by the powerful Chinese president to meet such low-ranking foreign visitors. The North Koreans were given a grand tour not just of Beijing but also of Shanghai and the rural central province of Shanxi, traveling on state-of-the-art bullet trains and receiving tutorials on how China rapidly built up its cities and industries.For now, China is providing visible help to the North in smaller ways. One is by serving as a conduit for money transfers back home by North Koreans living abroad who are trying to help family members maintain their improved living standards despite the sanctions.A restaurant owner in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, who fled the North several years ago, said she sent the equivalent of $5,000 a year to her mother, husband and school-age son who stayed behind in Pyongyang. She uses a money dealer here, not far from the border, to send $2,500 twice a year.The money has gone to pay for a tutor for her son, and also to buy him a $200 secondhand Japanese bicycle, the restaurant owner said. She asked that her name not be used for fear of attracting the attention of the South Korean security services, who she fears might not welcome such money transfers.While her husband has a good job as a manager at a state-owned enterprise, she said, they need the money because food is short after the long winter and the price of rice is rising. She said she sent the money in Chinese currency, the renminbi, which is used in the North to buy consumer goods.Other North Koreans living in Seoul said relatives had been requesting more money over the last year, not only to ride out the sanctions but also to cover what they said was the growing cost of bribes paid to North Korean officials, who are also trying to profit from the new cash economy.In Hunchun, one of China\u2019s biggest garment manufacturers, Younger, recently built a sprawling factory complex where North Korean workers make men\u2019s suits for the Chinese market. The North Koreans work alongside Chinese workers, receive the same wages and live in apartment blocks about three minutes from the plant, a manager said.Even though the sanctions require that North Korean workers return home, those working in Hunchun are most likely doing so legally, local businesspeople said. Their contracts appear to be written for short-term work, which is not covered in the sanctions, they said.In Hunchun, seafood sellers said they were still fetching top prices for North Korean live crab, considered a delicacy because it comes from the North\u2019s unpolluted waters.The crabs were trucked on a short trip from North Korea into the port of Vladivostok in Russia, then south over nearly 60 miles of bumpy road to Hunchun, a journey of up to 10 hours. They said the detour through Russia gave the crabs a cover of legality, and the Chinese are building a new road that will allow them to arrive more quickly.The customs paperwork needed to resume direct shipments of crab and frozen seafood has already been completed and is ready to be submitted as soon as sanctions are lifted. That will make the Russia detour unnecessary, said one seller as he watched over a dozen tanks filled with green crabs.\u201cWe have been told it will be soon,\u201d he said.Iris Zhao contributed research from Yanji and Hunchun, China; Luz Ding from Beijing; and Su-Hyun Lee from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareSome readers and experts have responded to a recent article by pointing out that the 1980s increase in U.S. health costs coincided with a broad push toward deregulation. Why did American health care costs start skyrocketing compared with those of other advanced nations starting in the early 1980s?The 1980s divergence in health costs, some readers and experts observed, coincided with a broad push toward deregulation.Gary Gaumer, an associate professor at Simmons College School of Business, pointed to changes in how hospitals and doctors were paid. Before the early 1980s, payments by Medicare and other insurers were tied to costs. If it cost a hospital, say, $5,000 for a patient\u2019s surgery, that\u2019s what the hospital was paid, plus a bit more for reasonable profit.\u201cHospitals and other providers began to behave more like businesses,\u201d Mr. Gaumer said. \u201cAnd the culture of health care delivery began to change.\u201d\u201cWe need to see the medical sector as part of the broader gestalt of American society at the time,\u201d said John McDonough, professor of Public Health Practice at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. President Carter was \u201cobsessed with broad public and private health care cost control, and Reagan abandoned that, with the exception of Medicare,\u201d he said.Gail Wilensky, senior fellow at Project HOPE, an international health foundation, and former director of the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President George H.W. Bush, agreed that the United States spends too much on health care and too little on other social services. Firearms and illicit drugs also contribute to early deaths. However, she pointed to one hopeful example. \u201cThe U.S. was unusually successful in smoking cessation, relative to other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we could replicate that success in other areas, like obesity reduction, we might close the gap in health care outcomes.\u201dShe said there are other hopeful lessons from history. American health spending pulled away from that of other countries over the decades in large part because of an expansion of programs like Medicare and Medicaid, without the kind of brakes on prices and technology adoption that other countries put in place.But health spending growth relative to G.D.P. held steady in the 1990s. \u201cThat\u2019s partly due to a strong economy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we also put some brakes on Medicare in that decade. In addition, managed care slowed growth in the private sector.\u201d If we did it then, we could do it again, she added.An earlier version of this article misstated a reason that direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs began in the 1980s. The Federal Trade Commission did not make a decision in 1978 to allow it.Advertisement"}

So They\u2019re Putting Diners to Work.", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe UpshotThe city offers a case study of how high housing costs alter the economics of everything else, including restaurant service. The small menu is so appealing and the place itself so charming that you almost forget, as a diner, that you have to do much of the work of dining out yourself. You scout your own table. You fetch and fill your own water glass. And if you\u2019d like another glass of wine, you go back to the counter. Inside these restaurants, it\u2019s evident that the forces making this one of the most expensive cities in America are subtly altering the economics of everything. Commercial rents have gone up. Labor costs have soared. And restaurant workers, many of them priced out by the expense of housing, have been moving away. San Francisco\u2019s tech riches have fed demand for restaurants \u2014 and some wealthy tech workers have decided they would also like to be partners in a restaurant, opening up more investment. But as those highly paid workers have also driven demand for scarce housing, the city has struggled to keep lower-wage workers afloat. If customers won\u2019t buy $20 burgers, or $25 dosas, and the staff in the kitchen can\u2019t be cut, that something is service. \u201cAnd that is what we did \u2014 we got rid of our servers,\u201d Mr. Mitra said. Charles Bililies had worked in fine-dining restaurants for years before he opened the first Souvla in 2014. By then, restaurateurs were already fretting about the city\u2019s employer mandates and housing costs. \u201cWe can sit around here, and we can complain and whine and moan,\u201d Mr. Bililies said. \u201cWe can be very negative about this. Or we can sort of turn this on its head and see an opportunity.\u201dAt Souvla, there is no oversize menu board above the counter, no service line where your food is assembled before your eyes. Behind the counter sits a shelf of wine glasses for the all-Greek wine list, touches that make the place feel plausible for a dinner date. At the original Souvla, the counter is just inside the front door, so a line invariably spills onto the sidewalk, a neat marketing trick that also means the restaurant wastes little of its rented space on waiting customers.The model and the small menu are conducive to takeout, which produces more than half of the revenue at this location. The restaurant has just 40 seats, but now averages more than 900 meals a day, far more than a full-service restaurant could manage in the same space. For restaurateurs, counter service makes fine dining \u2014 or something like it \u2014 profitable. To economists, it makes sense. David Neumark, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has studied the minimum wage, recalled a trip to Norway where nearly every restaurant he and his wife visited relied on counter service.Innovations in farming machinery or microwave meals, for instance, freed up people to be more productive, and better paid. But that is not entirely what is happening here. Restaurants haven\u2019t developed a way to serve meals with less labor. They\u2019ve gotten customers to do the labor they had been paying employees to do. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad,\u201d said Jennifer Sullivan, who worked for years as a server in the area. Twenty years ago, she moved from Chicago to Oakland, where she rented a $750 studio apartment and waitressed her way through college. She fears that story would not be possible in the Bay Area now. When she opened Jardini\u00e8re in 1997, they were 27 percent. (Mr. Bililies said Souvla\u2019s percentage is in the mid-20s now, even with paid vacation and retirement benefits.) Ms. Des Jardins has experimented with raising her prices, but she said customers simply spent the same amount in different ways, skipping a second glass of wine, or ordering two appetizers instead of an entree. At one of her other restaurants in town, she now serves lunch as counter service.\u201cI enjoy doing what I do, and we support a community of people here,\u201d Ms. Des Jardins said. \u201cBut the economics are pretty rotten.\u201d Souvla, on the other hand, is planning to expand beyond the Bay Area, starting with New York. Mr. Bililies said he wanted to occupy \u201ciconic streets in iconic neighborhoods in iconic cities.\u201d The strategy, in other words, is to go to precisely the places with rotten economics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Court Rules Against Plumbing Company in \u2018Gig Economy\u2019 Case", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s highest court ruled on Wednesday that a plumber who had sued a large London plumbing company over working rights could not be classified as self-employed, in a case that could lead to a closer examination of the relationship between businesses and workers in the \u201cgig economy.\u201dThe man, Gary Smith, had worked for Pimlico Plumbers in London for six years until 2011, when he was dismissed after trying to cut his days from five to three. Mr. Smith accused the company of unfair dismissal, making deductions from his wages, not paying him for statutory annual leave and discrimination.An employment tribunal had previously decided that Mr. Smith had not been an employee of Pimlico Plumbers \u2014 meaning that he was not entitled to sue for unfair dismissal \u2014 but was a worker there, which meant that he could pursue his other complaints.Pimlico Plumbers appealed the tribunal\u2019s decision, arguing that Mr. Smith was self-employed, a status carrying still fewer rights.On Wednesday, the case reached the Supreme Court, where the judges unanimously dismissed the company\u2019s appeal. Pimlico Plumbers was neither a client nor a customer of Mr. Smith, the judges said, and had exerted control over how he worked and how much he was paid.It also pointed out that Mr. Smith had been contractually required to drive a Pimlico Plumbers-branded van.The company will now face the accusations made by Mr. Smith in a lower court.He added, \u201cIt can only lead to a tsunami of claims.\u201dThe court\u2019s scrutiny of the circumstances of Mr. Smith\u2019s work could affect other companies that argue that workers in the so-called gig economy \u2014 those who, for example, work as freelancers or on short-term contracts \u2014 are self-employed, since other courts may look more closely at exactly how much control companies exert.\u201cThis is relevant to the gig economy at large because, in many cases, workers in the gig economy don\u2019t have any say in the prices charged, and they are under a certain degree of control from a platform,\u201d said Valerio De Stefano, a law professor at the Institute for Labor Law and the Faculty of Law at the University of Leuven in Belgium.Susannah Kintish, the lawyer at the London-based firm Mishcon de Reya who is leading the case for Pimlico Plumbers, maintained that the court\u2019s reliance on details particular to Mr. Smith\u2019s case would make it difficult for other businesses looking to use it as a reference point.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily do anything\u201d for other plumbers at the company, she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really even give Pimlico any guidance.\u201d\u201cThe problem of employment rights in the so-called gig economy is not confusion in the law but rather companies who think the law need not be obeyed,\u201d said Jason Moyer-Lee, the general secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which supported the Uber drivers\u2019 case.\u201cWe now need the government to start actively enforcing the law rather than playing the role of useless bystander,\u201d he said.But tougher rules would upend the strategies of Uber and other companies like it, and push costs up at businesses like the airline Ryanair, where many pilots are not considered employees, by forcing them to pay for workplace benefits.\u201cWe\u2019re in a really sort of unsatisfactory situation where we have an acknowledgment that the current law is unfit for purpose; we\u2019ve got new legislation coming, but we don\u2019t know when,\u201d Ms. Kintish, the lawyer, said.\u201cWe were looking to the Supreme Court for some guidance and to go some way to ameliorating the uncertainty,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, unfortunately, it did not take the opportunity to do that.\u201dStill, companies would have to take a closer look at their business models, Mr. De Stefano, of Leuven University, said.\u201cOf course, it is going to cost them because they employ a business model that uses people as workers in a way that is similar to other workers traditionally protected under labor law,\u201d he said.\u201cIf the business itself cannot comply with the laws that are existing,\u201d he added, \u201cthe problem is of the business, rather than the legislation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China Rejects Our Waste, What to Do?", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:For too long, we have taken the easy way out by shipping our excess recyclables to China. Instead, we should be investing in new technologies that can better sort and process recyclable waste and building a market for these materials so that it is economically unwise to send them to a landfill. We must also design products to be less wasteful and continue to foster responsible consumer behavior. We must realign our regulations and policies to foster these outcomes.The economic and environmental case is clear: We need to invest in a sustainable, circular economy where materials are efficiently and continuously reused \u2014 and we need to do it now.MATHY STANISLAUS, WASHINGTONThe writer is a circular economy fellow at the World Resources Institute and former solid waste chief for the Environmental Protection Agency.To the Editor:As China cuts off imports of recyclable materials, it\u2019s critical that we realize that recycling isn\u2019t the goal by itself. Reducing waste is the goal, and recycling is just one way to do it.One of the key ways we know we can reduce waste is by repairing and reusing things instead of assuming that recycling will solve our problems. Perhaps we were lulled into complacency as recycling capacity grew, but we are also fighting the marketing campaigns of major companies that need us to buy their new products rather than helping us keep our stuff in use. Keeping things in use is the low-hanging fruit of waste reduction.We can take action today to reduce waste by advancing Right to Repair legislation, which has been introduced in 19 states. Consumers and independent businesses need access to parts and service information, but many companies have gone out of their way to make things hard to repair.It\u2019s time we stop accepting the premise that new is always better and be allowed to fix and reuse our stuff. This is our mess, and it\u2019s up to us to fix it.The writer is executive director of the Repair Association.To the Editor:The United States is currently doing little to truly ameliorate the proliferation of waste plastics pollution in our seas and on our beaches. Durability is one of plastic\u2019s \u201cblessed\u201d properties, which is the reason that plastics present a seemingly endless threat to the marine environment. And the oceans are not the only repositories of plastic pollutants. Approximately 40 percent of the lakes in America are too polluted for fishing, aquatic life or swimming.Over a million seabirds and 100,000 sea mammals are killed every year by ingesting or getting entangled in plastic. One of the main culprits is from industrial sources. Further contributors to pollution are municipalities\u2019 garbage, a significant quantity of which ends up in our waterways.Most plastics are neither truly degradable nor recyclable. The only long-term solution is that manufacturers be induced to create truly recyclable plastics, which until now they have been avoiding. It may be costly, but the alternatives are totally unacceptable.The writer is professor emeritus of materials science and engineering at Stony Brook University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Mexico Is Swinging Left", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Grillo is an author based in Mexico.ACTOPAN, Mexico \u2014 In this arid farming town in central Mexico, a crowd packed the plaza under a punishing sun to hear the leftist presidential hopeful Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador promise to end the corruption that plagues the nation.\u201cThey have even said that corruption is part of Mexican culture,\u201d he said to a chorus of supportive shouts. \u201cThat is a falsehood. A big lie. In our people, there is a great reserve of values, cultural, moral, spiritual, in the families, in the pueblos, in the communities.\u201d He pointed upward. \u201cThe problem is above. The rulers always set a bad example.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador went on to promise cuts in government expenditures, including a reduction in the president\u2019s salary and the selling of the executive air fleet. He said he would redirect money to the poor through pensions, scholarships, apprenticeships and free fertilizer for small farmers, a vow greeted with raucous cheers.The colossal lead comes as a surprise, considering that in his previous two bids for president, in 2006 and 2012, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador won no more than 35 percent of the vote. His message has changed little over the years \u2014 some of the phrases I hear at his rallies are almost identical to ones that I wrote down when I covered his speeches 12 years ago. What has changed are his expressions: He looks happier, more relaxed, less angry.Back in the 2000s, leftist politicians were sweeping Latin America. Now, conservative-leaning leaders have made a comeback in countries like Argentina and Peru. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador appears to be bucking the trend.So why is he finally surging? The main reason is that confidence in Mexico\u2019s established parties has nosedived in the last five years amid rising prices and brutal crime alongside horrendous corruption scandals. In this environment, his message resonates louder. For many who are struggling, his words promise hope.\u201cWe are tired of the same people in power, the same dinosaurs \u2014 we want them out,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Sampedro, a 52-year-old builder, said at the Actopan rally. \u201cWe want it so Mexican citizens don\u2019t have to go to the United States to work, so they don\u2019t have to be mistreated\u201d by the Trump administration\u2019s policies. Mr. Sampedro, like many in this area, has traveled north for work \u2014 in his case, construction jobs in Florida.In these circumstances, promises of more government help for the poor are applauded. A huge chunk of P.R.I. voters \u2014 especially in poorer states like Hidalgo, where this town is situated \u2014 appear to have migrated directly to Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador. They are the biggest bloc of voters pushing him into the lead.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has also made inroads in wealthier northern states, where the center-right National Action Party, known as the P.A.N., has historically been strong. A likely reason is that former President Felipe Calder\u00f3n, of the P.A.N., waged a military crackdown on drug cartels during his tenure, from 2006 to 2012, which led to an explosion of violence in the north. The bloodshed has continued under Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, with 2017 being Mexico\u2019s most homicidal year in decades.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador blames both parties for the violence, and has pledged that he will bring peace to Mexico, even floating the idea of an amnesty for some criminals and inviting the pope to oversee a reconciliation process. His rivals denounce these proposals, but many here find it hard to see how violence could get any worse and are open to new ideas.The rise of President Trump could also be helping Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, convincing people that a stronger, more nationalist figure could better defend their interests against threats from the north. But this is probably a minor factor; most people I talk to at rallies are far angrier with their own rulers than those over the river in the United States.Critics retort that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is himself a member of the establishment he rails against. He began his career in the P.R.I. in the 1970s, then left to help found the Democratic Revolution Party in 1989; he founded his new party, National Regeneration Movement, or Morena, in 2014. When he was mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005, his minister of finance was caught on camera as a regular in a Las Vegas casino and subsequently imprisoned for embezzlement and money laundering. Many P.R.I. and P.A.N. politicians are switching to Morena as it surges in the polls.But while Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador may indeed be another career politician, his style and discourse contrasts with those who have governed this nation the last few decades. This is enough of a signal of change to attract the votes of millions of people who are struggling to provide for their families, to escape violent gangs, or to recover from being deported from the United States. Time will tell if it is enough to really solve Mexico\u2019s fundamental problems.Advertisement"}

Countries are still struggling to absorb the roughly 1.8 million sea arrivals since 2014. Public anxiety has risen in countries like Germany after high-profile assaults involving migrants, including the killing of a 19-year-old German student and the terrorist attack on a Christmas market that killed 12 people.And leaders still have sharp disagreements about who should take responsibility for the newcomers \u2014 border states like Greece and Italy, where most migrants enter Europe; or wealthier countries like Germany, which many migrants subsequently attempt to reach.But what is striking is how many leaders, particularly in far-right parties, continue to successfully create the impression that Europe is a continent under siege from migrants, even as the numbers paint a very different picture.But the reality on the ground is that, despite the rhetoric, migration is back to pre-crisis levels \u2014 and has been for some time.\u201cIt\u2019s an invented crisis,\u201d said Matteo Villa, a migration specialist at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies. \u201cThe high flows of the last years have bolstered nationalist parties, who are now creating a crisis of their own in order to score cheap political points.\u201dMr. Salvini and Mr. Orban have cultivated popular support by creating the impression that they are the only leaders willing to make the tough decisions needed to reduce migration. Yet the European establishment, under pressure from the likes of Mr. Orban and Mr. Salvini, has been quietly working for some time with the main gatekeepers along the migration trails to Europe, including with authoritarian regimes, to bring the numbers down.\u201cThe measures implemented by the previous government, which Salvini was so critical of, have actually been effective,\u201d said Andrew Geddes, director of the Migration Policy Center at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.Now Europe\u2019s challenge is largely about process: How to house asylum seekers waiting for decisions on their cases; how to integrate them into the economy and into society if their applications are approved; and how to deport them if not. These challenges remain as officials also have yet to fully address the squalid migrant camps of Greece, which house roughly half of the country\u2019s 60,000 asylum seekers, or the underground economy of Italy, where many of the country\u2019s 500,000 undocumented migrants are exploited.The European Union summit meeting that opens on Thursday is a reminder of how much the political landscape has shifted. Ms. Merkel, the German chancellor who was once the Continent\u2019s unassailable leader, now needs to secure an agreement with other European leaders to stave off a political crisis at home.Others, like Ms. Merkel, want to reduce migration but acknowledge it cannot be ended entirely unless Europe abandons the right to asylum that was enshrined in the international conventions that emerged in the aftermath of World War II.To uphold this right while also curbing migration, officials in Brussels want to set up offshore hubs to process asylum applications in Africa, while some analysts argue it would be easier and cheaper to invest in more efficient asylum systems in Greece and Italy \u2014 and to secure more deportation agreements with the countries migrants are originally from.\u201cTheir proposals are fundamentally contradictory,\u201d Mr. Knaus said. \u201cSalvini and the Italians want to get rid of Dublin and share everyone throughout Europe. The Bavarians want to push everyone back to Austria. And Kurz says that\u2019s fine \u2014 we\u2019ll then send them to Italy and Hungary.\u201dAnd far away on Lampedusa, this makes the debate seem less about the specifics of migration management, and more about the widening chasm between liberal and illiberal forces in Europe.It is \u201can ideological war,\u201d said Mr. Martello, the mayor. \u201cEurope is divided into two main blocs: One is defending the borders, and the other is actually doing something about the situation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Le Mans Privateers Try to Compete With the Big Boys", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe championship, which has four classes of cars competing while sharing the same racetrack, has seen an exodus of manufacturers from LPM1, the top-level category, because of the high cost of racing. Audi pulled out in late 2014, after years of success at Le Mans. Porsche followed suit at the end of 2017, after three consecutive Le Mans victories.So that leaves Toyota as the only manufacturer left in the LMP1 class, racing against a group of independent teams known as privateers. At a financial disadvantage from the start, and with a fraction of the research and development facilities of a brand like Toyota, privateers have traditionally battled to be the \u201cbest of the rest.\u201dStephane Sarrazin, who drives for SMP Racing, said privateers like his could not dream of competing against the might of Toyota.\u201cWe are in another world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a private team so we fight\u201d with the other privateers.Toyota\u2019s entry, the TS050 Hybrid, has raced at Le Mans before. It first ran there in 2016 and has proved itself over two years of continued development based on knowledge gained on the track. The privateer entries, in contrast, are newer designs created on smaller budgets.Where the privateers can save money is by working with chassis and engine partners, outsourcing as much as possible. Several companies build chassis, and they have the resources and specialist knowledge to develop cars suited to the technical regulations of Le Mans.Rebellion Racing develops its chassis with Oreca, while CEFC TRSM Racing uses a Ginetta-built prototype. SMP Racing and DragonSpeed get theirs from Dallara. Each team also works with an engine partner, using a unit developed for use in LMP1.In contrast, Toyota develops its own hybrid engine and does all of the bodywork research and development for its LMP1 entry. It spent about $100 million on the program in 2016. The high development costs are balanced by the transfer of race technology to production cars, a slow but constant process.To many observers, the imbalance does not seem quite fair, so the race organizers, F.I.A. (International Automobile Federation, known by its French acronym) and the Automobile Club de l\u2019Ouest, use the Equivalence of Technology, or EoT, to give the privateers an equal chance.The EoT has been in use since the inception of the sport, but in previous years it helped to equalize the playing field between diesel and gasoline engines. Now, with Toyota the only hybrid entrant and the only factory-backed one, the EoT equalizes hybrids and nonhybrids.\u201cAs the only hybrid-powered car in the LMP1 field, Toyota\u2019s TS050 Hybrid is only permitted to use 35.2 kilograms of fuel per stint, compared to the 52.9 kilograms of its privateer opponents,\u201d the EoT reads, referring to the period when each of the three drivers is behind the wheel. \u201cIn the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Toyota can only use a maximum of 124.9 megajoules of energy a lap compared to the 210.9 megajoule of its opponents.\u201dIf a car goes over the limit, it would be deemed illegal and disqualified.\u201cThis disparity is designed to address the inherent advantages hybrid systems offer in acceleration and fuel economy, allowing privateers without the means to utilize such technology to battle the better-funded manufacturers on the same terms,\u201d the explanation continues.The rules, announced last September as part of a wider shake-up of the championship, were aimed at ensuring that privateers would be able to match the speed of the Toyota hybrids.Despite the EoT attempts, Toyota has been reluctant to make concessions to equalize lap times.\u201cWe understood that there was no point in having two cars running much faster than the others, and running longer,\u201d said Pascal Vasselon, the Toyota Motorsport technical director. \u201cDefinitely, we have agreed to have the nonhybrid cars a bit closer, but not at the same pace.\u201dFollowing the season-opening round at Belgium\u2019s Circuit of Spa-Francorchamps in May, there was concern that equivalence had not been achieved. One of the two Toyotas was 1.8 seconds per lap faster than the first nonhybrid LMP1 entry, a significant advantage on any racetrack.Rebellion Racing, which has two cars driven by previous Le Mans winners, issued a statement after the Spa round saying that \u201cthe ambition of the team is to be able to fight and offer a nice show for the Le Mans 24 Hours, but for that it is obvious that the EoT will have to be modified.\u201dCalim Bouhadra, vice president of Rebellion Racing, said later that the cars showed they were very competitive. \u201cBut the competition will not be attractive if the advantage of hybrids is not reviewed,\u201d he said.For the LMP1 class to survive, it needs to remain competitive. Spiraling costs helped to drive out Peugeot, Audi and Porsche, while Toyota\u2019s long-term future in the sport is unclear.Jean Todt, the F.I.A. president, is aware of the challenges faced by the LMP1 category. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult championship to host,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably the increase of cost has made some manufacturers disappear. We are in an emergency situation. Being in an emergency situation means we have to find some innovative solutions to prepare for the future, and that\u2019s where we are.\u201dAsked whether he saw it as a requirement that future regulations would enable privateers to battle with manufacturers, Todt said, \u201cOf course.\u201cIdeally, that\u2019s the most attractive situation.

The state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun plastered the pages of its Wednesday edition with color photographs of Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump talking, walking and smiling, apparently as equals, with the flags of the two countries arranged side by side as a backdrop.They got few new clues on Wednesday.On Wednesday, the office of President Moon Jae-in in Seoul appeared to endorse Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. \u201cWhile North Korea and the United States are engaged in sincere talks on denuclearization and relations-building, we recognize the need to find various options to smooth such dialogue,\u201d said a spokesman, Kim Eui-kyeom.Also on Wednesday, the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency reported that Mr. Trump had agreed to \u201clift sanctions\u201d once bilateral relations improve. Mr. Trump had said on Tuesday that the sanctions would stay in place until North Korea dismantled enough of its nuclear program to make it difficult to reverse course. Mr. Trump said the denuclearization process would begin \u201cvery soon\u201d and happen \u201cvery quickly.\u201d\u201cKim Jong-un and Trump had the shared recognition to the effect that it is important to abide by the principle of step-by-step and simultaneous action in achieving peace, stability and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d the Korean Central News Agency said.To some, including Mr. Moon, the South Korean leader, the summit meeting was a success even if many questions remained unanswered. Mr. Moon and others saw it as the clearest signal yet that the two countries were walking away from the brink of war and were willing to take bold steps to end decades of hostility.But the agreement signed on Tuesday lacks any detail on the central issue, denuclearization, raising fears among analysts that once negotiators wade into the specifics, the talks could end in stalemate, as they have after past nuclear disarmament accords. South Korean officials hope that the two strong-willed leaders will push the process ahead, with an eye on their legacies.Mr. Trump has recently begun to acknowledge that denuclearization could take time, but he appears eager for it to start quickly. He said on Tuesday that Mr. Kim had promised to dismantle a facility for testing missile engines. In an interview with ABC News, Mr. Trump also said North Korea planned to \u201cget rid of certain ballistic missile sites and various other things.\u201d As of Wednesday, there had been no announcement from North Korea about removing such facilities.\u201cThe critical question is what comes next?\u201d Kelsey Davenport, nonproliferation policy director at the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said in an email. \u201cThe true test of success is whether the follow-on negotiations can close the gap between the United States and North Korea on the definition of denuclearization and lay out specific, verifiable steps that Pyongyang will take to reduce the threat posed by its nuclear weapons.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From New York\u2019s Primary Upset to Polling Data, How The Times Is Covering the Elections ", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBulletin boardAs the November midterm elections approach, we invited Times readers to ask our politics editor, Patrick Healy, about our current political coverage and our plans for the 2020 presidential race. We quickly heard from more than 200 readers. Please share any additional questions or suggestions for our Politics team in the comments.The Times coverage of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez before her surprise defeat of Joe Crowley was limited to a few paragraphs in articles about multiple candidates and a cameo in a prescient editorial warning the incumbent not to take his seat for granted. I\u2019d like to hear from someone on the local politics/midterms team about the decision not to cover her more, their understanding of shifting demographics and whether they need to adjust the way they think about/approach nontraditional candidates. \u2014 Staci D. KramerHi, Staci. Thanks for the question. That said, I do wish I had assigned a piece that fully captured the dynamics, demographics and issues in the Ocasio-Cortez/Crowley race before Primary Day on Tuesday. In the case of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, I wasn\u2019t in tune with the intriguing elements of her story like I was with the Grimm story. I will keep asking myself those questions, and I will ask them of my team, as well. There are also lessons here about not making assumptions about the power of incumbency, and about understanding changes in a district and the way a new voice can powerfully reflect them.We have also done a strong job writing about Republican candidates and voters, evangelical voters and die-hard Trump supporters. These are critical stories for understanding the issues facing the country, its mood and direction, and its political and civic future. More and more we will ask ourselves whose stories we are telling and covering, and whose voices we need to do a better job reflecting. Thanks, PatrickDoes her victory signal a strong move to the left in the Democratic Party?\u2014 Gilles de DomingoHi, Gilles. It\u2019s a really important question. More Democratic candidates are embracing progressive policy ideas like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d/single payer and making emphatic cases against the Trump presidency. But I think Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory was also very much her own. She was a smart candidate and campaigner, a gifted communicator who appealed strongly to the voters and the changing demographics in her district, and who championed issues \u2014 like abolishing the department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 that resonated with many people there. She also campaigned hard and showed up at debates and events that her opponent skipped. So I think her victory was partly about her alignment with the voters and left-leaning issues of importance in her district, but also very much about her strength and tenacity as a candidate. Thanks, PatrickHere in New York, pollsters yet again got races like Donovan/Grimm (NY-11-R) and Crowley/Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14-D) badly wrong. What\u2019s the future of polling, of political reporting, and of politics in general with such increasingly useless tools?\u2014 Stephen Koeth\u2014 Julia LeedsHi, Stephen and Julia. Many of us have put too much faith in polls at one time or another. They must be regarded as snapshots of politics \u2014 not a guarantee or a prediction of the outcome of a race, but as one tool among many to help understand issues, candidates, campaigns and places. The Times does very few stories based solely on polls by others; more often, we include some data from well-regarded polling operations like Gallup and Pew when it provides illuminating context. We work closely with our colleagues at The Upshot, our data-driven storytelling unit, to assess polling data and decide whether it is useful for a story we are already pursuing. Polling is a way to survey a wide sampling of voters about issues and concerns that are vital to them. Issue-based poll questions can be revealing about a district or a candidate. But polls shouldn\u2019t be taken as the final or absolute word on anything. We are careful how we write about polls, and poll results don\u2019t dictate our coverage decisions. Thanks, PatrickHow does the department decide the amount of coverage that various candidates receive, especially when unlikely challengers that are barely known are winning more frequently?\u2014 Jacob LeppekThanks, PatrickStop ignoring third-party candidates. Any reporter who buys into the \u201cfringe candidates aren\u2019t worth the ink. They will never get elected\u201d philosophy is a tool.\u2014 Joshua GoodHi, Joshua. Thanks for this. I hear you. I\u2019ve never bought into the idea that we shouldn\u2019t write about candidates simply because \u201cthey will never get elected.\u201d A major factor for us \u2014 and this isn\u2019t some excuse \u2014 is resources: We have so many political stories and races and candidates to cover, and a limited number of reporters and editors, so we have to make tough choices. We are often drawn to the campaigns that are the most competitive, that would resonate with a wide spectrum of readers, or where the outcomes could have major ramifications on people\u2019s lives, on issues, on the balance of power, etc. Thanks, Patrick How will you cover 2018 without the repeat of the 2016 errors and continue on with what I have read as really strong journalism since 2017?\u2014 Patty McLooneHi, Patty. Thanks for this. Our colleagues in Washington have done a terrific job covering the Trump presidency, the Mueller investigation and the extraordinary developments at the White House and in Congress. Reporters on our National and Business staffs have captured so many of the changes, challenges and struggles across America, from daily life, education, immigration and health care to the changing economic fortunes for families and voters. One of our 2018 goals is to collaborate extensively with these colleagues to tell a really complete story about all facets of life in America and how politics expresses itself in this country. I was a senior reporter on the 2016 campaign coverage, and I am proud of the work that our team did. By the end of that campaign, I think voters who read our coverage of Trump and Clinton were extremely well-informed about whom these candidates were, what they stood for and what kind of president each would be. I hope to deliver that kind of insightful coverage again, and to build on it by providing the smartest, most nuanced and accurate picture of the country and its voters. Thanks, PatrickDoes the turnout among Democrats tell us anything about probable mobilization/motivation among voters in November? Does it confirm, e.g., that Democrats are energized for the 2018 midterms and so likely to vote in larger numbers than in past midterm elections?\u2014 Ken DreyfackYou are asking good questions; there are many others. I consider it enormously important not to make assumptions or shape coverage presuming a likely November result. Thanks, Patrick What is the prospect of a Republican challenge to Trump for the 2020 nomination or is the president\u2019s hold on the GOP too strong?\u2014 Cameron ClyneHi, Cameron. There\u2019s a good chance for a Republican challenge to Trump in 2020 if he runs for re-election. Senator Jeff Flake and Gov. John Kasich are sharp critics of the president, and both have been making trips to New Hampshire, home of the first-in-the-nation primary. Senator Ben Sasse and outgoing Senator Bob Corker might be tempted, depending on how the next year unfolds. Thanks, PatrickWhat will be the defining issue this fall to determine electoral success and control of the House of Representatives?\u2014 Emmitt CarltonHi, Emmitt. It\u2019s too soon to say. Every week seems to bring another moment or issue that, during a normal presidency, could be defining. A gun massacre. The president\u2019s policy separating children and parents at the border. A possible trade war. The Mueller investigation. The strengthening economy. Tax cuts. The Supreme Court opening. The fraying of global alliances. Russia. North Korea. Disinformation. Stormy Daniels. Lies and false statements made by this president and this administration. The strong support that President Trump has from Republicans. The intensity and determination on the part of Democrats. But this is not a normal president or presidency. We have to keep reporting on the ground in towns and cities, keep asking questions and keep challenging assumptions rather than predict now what the defining issue will be. Thanks, PatrickAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Peace Is a Problem", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Wrong has spent over two decades reporting on the African continent, visiting Ethiopia and Eritrea repeatedly.If nature abhors a vacuum, politics abhors a military standoff, especially between two nations in one of the poorest, most volatile and most strategically sensitive regions of the world.Legally, Ethiopia clearly was in breach, having committed in the 2000 peace deal, like Eritrea, to uphold whatever decision the boundary commission issued. The United Nations, the European Union, the Organization of African Unity (now the African Union) and the United States had pledged to act as guarantors, and so were also in the wrong. Eritrea, for its part, had good reason as a fledgling country to crave international recognition for its borders.But given the choice between a giant traditional ally led by an emollient prime minister and a tiny new-kid-on-the-block with a notoriously prickly president, the major Western powers opted to side with the bigger player \u2014 and all the more readily because it cast itself as an ally in the fight against Islamist terrorism.So what prompted Ethiopia\u2019s announcement this week? Age and sickness is one answer. Over the years, local analysts and former guerrilla fighters have told me that Ethiopia\u2019s dispute with Eritrea was partly being kept alive by animosity between the two countries\u2019 longtime leaders and their immediate entourages.But rivalry and resentment simmered below the surface. In 1998, a dispute over the nondescript border village of Badme escalated into a war that would kill more than 100,000 people. Many Horn of Africa watchers predicted that relations between the two countries would only normalize once the two leaders quit the scene.So have its foreign allies.In recent years, Western diplomats have grown more and more worried that an increasingly isolated Eritrea, resentful at its treatment by the international community and routinely dubbed a \u201cpariah state\u201d for its domestic human rights record, might come to be seen as an attractive destination by jihadists spilling out of nearby Yemen, Syria and Iraq.For such players, the stalemate between Eritrea and Ethiopia was becoming politically and financially untenable. It is probably no coincidence that Ethiopia\u2019s shift about the boundary this week follows a visit to the region in late April by Donald Yamamoto, the United States\u2019 acting assistant secretary of state for African affairs.\u201cThis is breathtaking stuff,\u201d said a diplomat who has spent years shuttling between the region\u2019s capitals. \u201cThe pace of change is incredible, and the prime minister needs every bit of support from the international community if he is to push this through.\u201dAnd yet the much-awaited, much-desired normalization of relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea could prove more destabilizing to the Horn of Africa in the long term than its cold war ever was.For all of Mr. Isaias\u2019s complaining about Ethiopia\u2019s refusal to honor the boundary decision, that reluctance has served him well: It has allowed his control-freak regime to keep running Eritrea along the militaristic lines he and his movement established in the bush during the fight for independence. His government could invoke the threat of an imminent invasion to justify its refusal to implement the 1997 Constitution, allow opposition parties, stage multiparty elections or tolerate a free press.If Ethiopia does withdraw its troops from the Eritrean territory it still occupies, a key excuse for Mr. Isaias\u2019s iron rule will be removed.His admirers hope that he would grab any historic opportunity for real peace with Ethiopia to display once again the visionary leadership that defined him as a freedom fighter and reset his management of the country.His critics, who see him as incapable of shifting gears, believe the sustained bluff that was mass conscription may have just been called. If they are correct, Ethiopia\u2019s recent peace overture could actually make the region more, not less, volatile.Michela Wrong is the author of \u201cBorderlines,\u201d a novel about a border dispute in the Horn of Africa, and \u201cI Didn\u2019t Do It For You,\u201d a history of Eritrea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E. Dropped From the Dow After More Than a Century", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd then there were none.General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain.The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company\u2019s new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company\u2019s financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.Over the last year, G.E.\u2019s shares have fallen 55 percent, compared with a 15 percent gain for the Dow. G.E., which closed Tuesday at $12.95, has the lowest share price of any of the index\u2019s 30 components.S. & P. Dow Jones Indices \u2014 which owns the Dow \u2014 suggested that the slide in G.E.\u2019s stock price contributed to the decision to remove the company from the index, where it had been a member continuously since 1907. The Dow is a price-weighted index, which means higher priced stocks have a greater influence on its direction.\u201cThe low price of G.E. shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point,\u201d said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S. & P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cWalgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s share price is higher, and it will contribute more meaningfully to the index.\u201dThe move also is freighted with economic symbolism. With the inclusion of Walgreens Boots, the index \u201cwill be more representative of the consumer and health care sectors of the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Blitzer said.The removal of G.E., which will formally occur June 26, reflects a shift in the economic composition of the United States, which long ago tilted away from heavy industry and toward services, such as technology, finance and health care.And it also amounted to a milestone for General Electric. It was the last remaining original member of the index, when the stock market measure was introduced in 1896.Back then, just a few years after the company was formed through a merger of Thomas Edison\u2019s electric companies with a rival, G.E. was the modern-day equivalent of a technology stock, and the Dow itself was geared heavily toward the growth industries of the day such as railroads. In the more than 120 years that followed, the company was often at the center of American capitalism. And as recently as the 1990s. G.E. was at times the most-valuable American company by market value.Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are the five most valuable companies in the United States today.After G.E.\u2019s departure from the index, the company with the longest presence in the Dow will be Exxon Mobil, whose corporate predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey, joined the Dow in 1928, according to S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Stress? It's Good to Be a Bank", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat a time to be a bank.That banks are in such a position highlights the remarkable change in fortunes for an industry that was on life support a decade ago.Banks have more than doubled their capital, their main financial defense against losses. Profits are surging on the back of the stronger economy, and bank stocks have risen more than the broader stock market since the election of Donald J. Trump. Wall Street\u2019s chief executives are enjoying hefty paydays. The Trump administration has started to relax post-crisis regulation, and banks are angling for more loosening. Lenders are embracing exciting new technologies that could revolutionize parts of their industry.\u201cYou guys thought I was kidding when a few years ago I said you can have a golden age of banking,\u201d Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said this month, taking stock of trends in the industry. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re going to have a golden age of banking. You have a golden age of banking.\u201dBut the resurgence of the industry is a refutation of those who predicted that the post-crisis regulations would hamstring banks and damp the economy. Banks are not only safer than they were before, they are back to earning strong profits.The largest financial institutions find out for certain next week if the Federal Reserve has signed off on their plans to distribute capital to shareholders. The results on Thursday suggest that most will get what they want. Analysts at Barclays forecast that the banks, on average, are in a position to distribute all of their profits to investors. Banks can do this because they have quite a bit more capital than regulators require.Critics of the industry say the banks should be lending that money out or retaining it to strengthen their balance sheets. But Mr. Dimon rejected such assertions in an interview.\u201cIf you look at the growth of capital over all, it\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d he said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair as a blanket statement to say paying out is bad. Many banks have a huge amount of capital they can\u2019t deploy right away.\u201dAfter the crisis, policymakers believed that making the banks stronger would bolster their lending. In many ways, this outcome has occurred. Since the end of 2010, banks have added $2.5 trillion of loans, a 37 percent increase, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Over the same period, their profits have soared. In the first quarter, the industry as a whole reported its highest profits in recent decades, according to data compiled by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.The six largest American banks \u2014 JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2014 have done particularly well. They made $141 billion in pretax profits in 2017, nearly double the $75 billion they made in 2010. The tax cuts enacted last year have provided a particularly large lift to the bottom lines of banks. A strengthening economy and higher interest rates are expected to further increase earnings this year.Those behind the post-crisis regulatory overhaul say the robust economy shows that more or less the right amount of regulation was imposed. Barney Frank, the former congressman who helped sponsor the Dodd-Frank Act, said, \u201cI have been struck ever since Trump came into office by his bragging that we have the best economy that ever existed anywhere and his insistence that regulation was damaging the financial sector.\u201dThe stress tests suggest that the banks can withstand punishing losses. They assume, for instance, that Bank of America can suffer $50 billion of losses on its loans and still have ample capital.But good times in banking can lead to complacency among regulators and bankers. So while banks are definitely stronger, some prominent skeptics would prefer that more be done to make sure taxpayers are never called on again to bail out the banks.\u201cThe question is not: How do banks perform when the economy is strong?\u201d Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in an interview. \u201cThe question is: How do banks perform if there is a major economic downturn? And our analysis at the Minneapolis Fed says that the banks are still too big to fail.\u201dMr. Kashkari, who was a Treasury official during the crisis and oversaw the government\u2019s bailout of the banking industry, said he believed that a crucial part of regulators\u2019 post-crisis plans for winding down failing banks \u2014 turning a bank\u2019s debt into equity \u2014 would not work in a real crisis. To stop a collapse of the system, he said, taxpayer bailouts would almost certainly be required. Instead, regulators should have banks substantially increase their equity, Mr. Kashkari said.Banks would no doubt oppose such a move, saying it would make certain businesses unprofitable. But he said, \u201cIf the banks\u2019 business model requires taxpayer support, then they don\u2019t have a business model that works.\u201dInvestors hope deregulation will reduce the costs of complying with rules, give banks more freedom to pursue profitable business and allow them to pay out even more capital. Such hopes have helped drive bank stocks, measured by the KBW Bank Index, up 44 percent since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, compared with 29 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Bankers assert that they do not want a wholesale dismantling of the post-crisis rules. Instead, they say, they want to refine rules to make lending less costly and cumbersome. Mortgage lending, for instance, is one area that could benefit from looser rules, some banking experts contend.\u201cPeople say the banks are doing well, so we don\u2019t need to change,\u201d said Phillip L. Swagel, a professor of international economic policy at the University of Maryland and a Treasury official during the administration of George W. Bush. \u201cBut, no, if we can do it better, then let\u2019s make it better.\u201dBut critics of the banks say the banks could be doing more under the current rules to expand whom they lend to, especially when they have so much spare capital. Michael Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending, said deregulation could lead to less lending. He asserted that possible changes to the Community Reinvestment Act could reduce the presence of banks in certain less well-off areas.\u201cIs it too much for banks to provide basic banking services in their footprint?\u201d Mr. Calhoun asked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Entitled Parents Hurt Schools", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe authors\u2019 research focuses on equity in American public education.We started visiting this community \u2014 which is similar to places like the Boston suburb Newton, Mass. \u2014 to understand how parents decide where to live and send their children to school. After the study had begun, Kingsley administrators began the process of redrawing boundaries for the district\u2019s high schools to balance attendance numbers. Administrators, of course, don\u2019t want children crowded into one school while there are empty seats in classrooms in another. Since they cannot control where parents live within the district, they sometimes reassign certain neighborhoods\u2019 students from one school to another. This provoked an outcry among many of the parents, which we documented.At no point was there a suggestion, by parents or administrators, that the educational quality of one of the two high schools was worse. However, the reassignment would have increased some students\u2019 travel time, by an average of about 10 minutes.The reassignment process lasted for almost a year. Once the district began releasing proposals, there were vigorous protests, which led to revised proposals and new protests. We read more than 3,000 emails and letters from parents to administrators and the school board on the subject. We transcribed video recordings of the 18 board meetings that took place during the controversy, including the public commentary at these sessions.Many of these meetings were held in packed auditoriums, with hundreds of angry parents. At the end of one meeting, parents were visibly distraught. Groups of mothers gathered together, and one was crying as she said, \u201cIt is not fair.\u201d Her friend told her, \u201cWe will fight it!\u201d Another agitated mother worried, \u201cHow am I going to tell my 12-year-old?\u201dThe capacity of the parents and guardians at Kingsley to impede the reassignment process was due in large part to their noneconomic resources: the professional skills and connections they could deploy in a fight against the school district. School administrators found themselves confronted not just by disgruntled parents but by pediatricians, urban planners, public relations specialists and psychologists.These parents had an extraordinary capacity for mobilization. At one parent meeting we observed, no fewer than 10 committees were formed. When administrators denied parents\u2019 requests for a school-bus ride-along so that parents could time the proposed bus routes, parents \u2014 with stopwatches in hand \u2014 collected their own data on travel times.They recruited local politicians to attend their planning meetings and solicited letters of support from outside experts. At school board meetings, administrators found themselves presented with two inch-thick binders full of copies of peer-reviewed studies, meant to demonstrate the shortcomings of the administrators\u2019 proposals.Although the district ultimately passed and implemented a plan, the process consumed vast amounts of administrators\u2019 time, energy and resources. The superintendent estimated that he devoted 70 to 80 percent of his working time over several months to the redistricting process. At one point, the administration felt it necessary to have law enforcement present at board meetings, after an incident in which a board member was confronted by a hostile resident. The superintendent called the process a \u201cNor\u2019easter\u201d that damaged the school district\u2019s reputation and diverted his attention from other substantive issues, including curriculum planning and supporting students in the transition from middle school to high school.In 1932, Willard Waller\u2019s classic work on the sociology of teaching pronounced parents and educators to be \u201cnatural enemies\u201d: Parents are concerned for their own children, while educators look to the success of all students.This is an inherent tension, and one that parents and school administrators should understand better. Controversies can escalate quickly, and unprepared educators sometimes make things worse. Democratic processes are essential in public school districts, but educators should also find ways to listen to parents\u2019 concerns and resolve matters quickly and decisively.All parents want the best for their children, but a key goal of public education is to create citizens with a vision of a common good. Upper-middle-class parents are understandably anxious about the futures of their children in an increasingly competitive global economy, but not every issue is worthy of a fight. Parents should think about what matters in the long run and reflect on whether their actions might be contributing to greater inequality. Affluent parents bring powerful resources to schools. They should also model thoughtful civic engagement that considers collective, rather than simply individual, benefits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Curb Illegal Airbnbs, New York City Wants to Collect Data on Hosts", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA group gathered in front of City Hall on Tuesday to support proposed legislation that would rein in illegal Airbnb apartment listings.In an unusually crowded City Council hearing on Tuesday, lawmakers took on Airbnb as they discussed a bill aimed at cracking down on illegal online home-sharing listings that have turned residential apartments into year-round hotels for tourists.The bill, which is almost certainly to pass with a veto-proof majority, would cap one of the most fractious battles in New York City to regulate companies of the so-called sharing economy. Council members are expected to vote on it later this summer.If passed, the bill would require online rental services, like Airbnb, to disclose the addresses of its listings and the identities of its hosts to the city\u2019s Office of Special Enforcement on a monthly basis. Hosts would also have to list whether the dwelling was their primary residence and whether the entire unit or a portion was available for short-term rentals. Companies that fail to share the data would be fined up to $25,000 for each listing they did not disclose.Lawmakers hope the data would help identify commercial operators with multiple listings who run illegal hotels in residential buildings. Commercial operators have long been a concern for lawmakers and housing advocates who say that Airbnb makes it easy to rent apartments to tourists, taking units off the market for full-time residents and exacerbating the city\u2019s affordable housing crisis.\u201cThis bill has one clear priority in mind: protecting our affordable housing stock for the millions of New Yorkers who could not live here without it,\u201d said Councilwoman Carlina Rivera, who introduced the bill. Disclosing listing data would allow \u201cmore prosecution of bad actors who are pushing out tenants\u201d in a \u201clargely unmonitored rental market,\u201d Ms. Rivera, a Democrat, said.Airbnb has more than 50,000 apartment rental listings in New York City, the company\u2019s largest market in the United States. But even as cities, such as San Francisco and Barcelona, have passed similar legislation, New York City has struggled to regulate Airbnb, which some critics say is rampant with listings of illegal hotels that flood apartment buildings with tourists and threaten the safety of residents.Airbnb did not send officials to testify at the hearing because, \u201cCouncil members should hear why this bill hurts regular New Yorkers directly from those hosts,\u201d Liz DeBold Fusco, a spokeswoman for the company, said.In written testimony submitted to the Council, Josh Meltzer, the head of northeast public policy for Airbnb, said the bill places \u201cthe interests of the hotel industry above the interests of New Yorkers who rely on opening their own home to stay in their home.\u201dMr. Meltzer said that in the past year, the typical Airbnb host in New York City shared their dwelling for about five nights a month and earned about $6,400 a year, \u201creinforcing the fact that most hosts are not full-time \u2018commercial\u2019 operators, but everyday New Yorkers who turn to sharing their home part-time to make ends meet.\u201dHowever, the city estimates that 20 to 30 percent of online listings \u201care operating with commercial frequency,\u201d Christian Klossner, the executive director of the Office of Special Enforcement, said during the hearing. Mr. Klossner said the legislation would \u201csignificantly enhance our ability\u201d to target illegal hosts.Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said the mayor supports the bill.Mr. Meltzer said the bill unfairly targets Airbnb because it is limited to online platforms and would undermine the privacy of its hosts by having them consent to the disclosure of their personal information.He also said that it would lead the city law enforcement agency to \u201charass and fine New Yorkers who share their own home.\u201dIn 2017, the Office of Special Enforcement received 1,800 complaints through 311 about short-term rentals and issued about 3,050 violations, amounting to nearly $7.2 million in fines.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Luchino Visconti Made History Sing", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookAmong the Italian filmmakers who achieved international prominence in the decades after World War II, Luchino Visconti possessed perhaps the sharpest historical insight and the keenest literary appetite. The 14 features he directed between 1942 and his death, in 1976, included adaptations of books by Dostoyevsky, Camus and Mann, a biopic about King Ludwig II of Bavaria and several forays into the political upheavals of mid-19th-century Italy and early-20th-century Germany. Visconti, a longtime member of the Italian Communist Party, was also one of the founders of neorealism, dramatizing the struggles of working-class Romans, Sicilian fisherman and migrants from the southern countryside to the factories of the north.His historical films are essays disguised as operas. \u201cSenso,\u201d his 1954 tale of Venetian intrigue during the Third Italian War of Independence, begins at a performance of \u201cIl Trovatore\u201d and is swept along on the music of Verdi and Bruckner. \u201cThe Leopard,\u201d set in Sicily around the same time (the 1860s), culminates with a scene at a formal ball that conveys the rhythms of radical political change through the intricacy and sensuality of dance. The protagonist of \u201cLudwig,\u201d who ruled Bavaria from 1864-86, is less interested in statecraft than in the music of Wagner and in building palaces that resemble fantastical stage sets.A restored print of \u201cLudwig\u201d \u2014 almost four hours of opulent set design, languorous camera movements and ambient eroticism, featuring actors from various countries dubbed into Italian \u2014 will conclude Film Society\u2019s program with a weeklong run starting June 22. It\u2019s late Visconti (originally released, in truncated form, in 1973) and also what you might call advanced Visconti. The best preparation might be a half-dozen selections from earlier in the series.To describe \u201cLudwig\u201d (or Ludwig himself, for that matter) as decadent might seem like an understatement. Surrounded by gilt, velvet and crystal, a glass of champagne never far from his hand, the man known as the Swan King (played by the Austrian actor Helmut Berger) literally decays before our eyes, his teeth blackening in his mouth and his blue eyes sinking into his perfectly sculptured cheekbones. Ludwig\u2019s kingdom is gradually swallowed up by the bureaucratic Prussian empire, which sets a gaggle of officious black-suited doctors and politicians to investigate his majesty\u2019s mental health.Their inquiry is in part an act of implicitly homophobic persecution \u2014 among the \u201ceccentricities\u201d that concern the authorities is Ludwig\u2019s taste for the company of gorgeous young men \u2014 and in part a symptom of encroaching modernity. An old aristocratic order, at once morally flexible and rigidly traditional, is giving way to something new, and the change is bittersweet, containing both progress and tragedy.Ludwig\u2019s fate is a variation on the one faced by Prince Fabrizio, the Sicilian nobleman played by Burt Lancaster in \u201cThe Leopard,\u201d who contemplates the arrival of the new order with melancholy acceptance. Something beautiful is sacrificed on the altar of the future, which nonetheless must be embraced. This ambivalence is central to Visconti\u2019s work and is often described in terms of the supposedly contradictory facets of his personality. He was an ardent Marxist who happened to be the scion of a wealthy, titled family, a gay man working in a profession (and a culture) steeped in machismo. His aesthetic temperament is often assumed to be in conflict with his political sensibility.It is sometimes said that the visual and sensual pleasures of Visconti\u2019s neorealist films undermine their austere moral intentions, or that their beauty transcends the grittiness of their settings. But it seems to me that his lyricism is its own argument, an insistence on the inseparability of art and life.Visconti\u2019s second feature (and first masterpiece) was \u201cLa Terra Trema,\u201d originally commissioned by the Communist Party as a documentary on the exploitation of Sicilian fishermen. Instead, Visconti constructed a fictional story, using real people and locations, about the attempted rise and bitter fall of \u2019Ntoni Valastra and his family. Moments of melodrama and scenes of everyday life are stitched together by deliberately dry third-person narration. You don\u2019t forget you are watching a movie, but you are somehow simultaneously aware of the human reality in front of your eyes and the cinematic artistry that makes it visible.Early in the film, \u2019Ntoni\u2019s boat and his fellow fisherman from the village of Aci-Trezza go ashore to unload the morning\u2019s catch and sell it to wholesalers, who take most of the profit. The bustle and clamor make it seem as if a big-city stock exchange has been transported to a Mediterranean beach. There is no distinguishable dialogue, only a cacophony of shouting and haggling. The camera travels through it all in a single unbroken shot that lasts more than two minutes, a thrilling technical feat that manages to communicate an enormous amount of information about the political economy and social organization of Aci-Trezza. There are clear divisions of class, generation and status, but because of the absence of cuts, we see coherence within chaos. There is injustice here, but also a kind of stability.In defiance of custom, \u2019Ntoni tries to eliminate the middlemen, mortgaging his family\u2019s house to buy a bigger boat. His rebellion, though ultimately futile, disrupts the old order and fully exposes its cruelty. His defeat is confirmed in another scene on the same beach, a ceremonial blessing of the fleet that brings out the whole town. This time, as the speeches of local authorities proclaim unity and harmony, the editing splinters the action into a series of discrete, disjunctive shots. People who had previously been joined in argument are now isolated from one another, alienated, at odds.The relationship between the two moments is dialectical: The aural noise and visual integrity of the first scene are reversed in the second. An exploitative system held together by custom is now maintained by fraud and force. Justice lies over the horizon, and things may have to get worse before they get better.\u201cRocco and His Brothers,\u201d Visconti\u2019s second masterpiece (and his contribution to the Italian cinematic miracle of 1960, the year of \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d and \u201cL\u2019Avventura\u201d), ends with a similar gesture. Again, a family trying to improve its lot has suffered devastating defeat. Rocco Parondi and his brothers, who migrated to Milan with their widowed mother, endure the fracturing of their familial bonds and the crumbling of their traditions. But their loss, like Prince Fabrizio\u2019s and King Ludwig\u2019s, is a toll paid on the road toward the future.The faith in that future might now count as an object of nostalgia in its own right, and it\u2019s hard to deny that Visconti offers 21st-century audiences a banquet of voluptuously old-fashioned delights. The longing in some of these movies can transmute into a wistful regard for the world they come from. In that world, Marcello Mastroianni could be cast as the feckless protagonist of the Dostoyevsky adaptation \u201cWhite Nights\u201d in 1957 and then, 10 years later, as the existential antihero of \u201cThe Stranger,\u201d based on the Camus novel. Dirk Bogarde could sit on the beach contemplating the passage of time and the torso of a young tourist in \u201cDeath in Venice.\u201d The world could fall apart, slowly and beautifully. Decadence is not what it used to be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trade War Could Pick Off Weaker Firms. Look at Harley-Davidson.", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHarley-Davidson shows how this assumption might break down in practice.It\u2019s the sort of situation any company would want to avoid, but these challenges were the last thing Harley-Davidson, which has grappled with years of falling sales, needed. And it demonstrates how trade frictions could end up having an outsize effect on any other American company that was struggling before hostilities broke out.Harley-Davidson is vulnerable on several fronts. The Trump administration\u2019s metals tariffs are pushing up its costs. The European Union\u2019s tariffs on American motorcycles, raised in retaliation last week to 31 percent from 6 percent, added on average $2,200 to the cost of a Harley sold in the bloc, the company said. For now, Harley-Davidson said it was going to bear the additional expense itself, which could cost the company as much as $100 million a year.As if that were not enough, the company may now lose sales among supporters of Mr. Trump. The president did not hold back in his criticism of the company and even suggested that prospective buyers might now back away. \u201cCustomers are already very angry at them,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.If Mr. Trump\u2019s comments do drive down demand, it would only make Harley-Davidson\u2019s long-standing problems worse.As tastes change, fewer people are buying Harley\u2019s motorcycles \u2014 a trend that shows few signs of changing. Last year, Harley-Davidson sold 148,000 motorcycles in the United States, by far its biggest market, down more than 8 percent from 162,000 in 2016. To make up for falling domestic sales, the company has been trying to bolster its international business, with some success in recent years. But last year, overseas sales came in below the company\u2019s expectations, falling 4 percent from 2016. And those sales struggles have weighed on Harley\u2019s work force. The company expected to shed 800 jobs with the closure of a plant in Kansas City, Mo., while adding 450 at its main plant in York, Pa.Harley\u2019s weakness is reflected in its stock price. With a quintessentially American brand and an important niche in the United States manufacturing sector, Harley might have been expected to participate in the stock market rally that took place after Mr. Trump was elected. But the company\u2019s stock is down 28 percent since then, compared with a 27 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Harley-Davidson may, of course, be citing the tariffs as a reason for moving more operations overseas when it was already planning to do so. Its foreign operations are still small compared with those in the United States, but they are a crucial part of its efforts to grow. Well before the European Union tariffs came into effect, Harley-Davidson was investing significantly overseas, most recently a plant in Thailand expected to begin production this year.The buoyant stock market, rosy economic statistics and the earnings kick from the recent tax cuts all might give the impression that American companies can power through a trade war. But Harley shows why that might not always be the case.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Californization of America", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Kettmann is a columnist for The Santa Cruz Sentinel.SOQUEL, Calif. \u2014 Across the country, Democrats are winning primaries by promoting policies like universal health insurance and guaranteed income \u2014 ideas once laughed off as things that work only on the \u201cLeft Coast.\u201dAt the same time, national politicians from both sides are finally putting front and center issues that California has been grappling with for years: immigration, clean energy, police reform, suburban sprawl. And the state is home to a crop of politicians to watch, from Kevin McCarthy on the right to Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris on the left, part of a wave that is likely to dominate American politics for the next generation.California, which holds its primaries on Tuesday, has long set the national agenda on the economy, culture and technology. So maybe it was just a matter of time before it got back to driving the political agenda, as it did when Ronald Reagan launched his political career in the 1960s. But other things are happening as well. The state is a hub for immigrants, a testing site for solutions to environmental crises and a front line in America\u2019s competition with China. On all sorts of big issues that matter now and will in the future, California is already in the game.In a way, California even gave us Donald Trump. So much of his \u201ctraining\u201d to be president came while he was an entertainment celebrity, on a show that, for a stretch of its existence, was produced in Los Angeles. And of course the means of his ascent \u2014 the smartphone, social media \u2014 came out of Silicon Valley. That\u2019s a lot to have on a state\u2019s conscience.For decades, California, even as it grew in size and wealth, was seen as an outlier, unintimidating, superficial and flaky. We were no threat. We were surfer dudes and California girls who got high and turned on, tuned in and dropped out. We spawned Apple and Google, but we also spawned hippies and Hollywood. For a time, our governor was nicknamed Moonbeam.As recently as the 2000s, with California at the center of the subprime-mortgage crisis, it was fair to wonder whether we had a future; a popular parlor game was to imagine how the state might be divided up into more manageable statelets.That was the old California.California\u2019s raw economic power is old news. What\u2019s different, just in the past few years, is the combination of its money, population and politics. In the Trump era, the state is reinventing itself as the moral and cultural center of a new America.California is hardly monolithic. The region around Bakersfield provides the power base for Mr. McCarthy, the House majority leader and an indefatigable defender of President Trump, who calls him \u201cmy Kevin.\u201d Other sizable pockets of Trump supporters live along the inland spine of the state, especially in the north near the Oregon border.Still, there\u2019s no doubt California runs blue \u2014 so blue, people say, that its anti-Trump stance is inevitable. But that\u2019s not right; in fact, California defies Mr. Trump \u2014 and is turning even more Democratic \u2014 not for partisan reasons but because his rhetoric and actions are at odds with contemporary American values on issue after issue, as people here see it, and because he seems intent on ignoring the nation\u2019s present and future in favor of pushing back the clock.California doesn\u2019t just oppose Mr. Trump; it offers a better alternative to the America he promises. While Mr. Trump makes hollow promises to states ravaged by the decline of the coal industry, California has been a leader in creating new jobs through renewable energy.While Mr. Trump plays the racism card, California pulls in immigrants from all over the world. For California, immigration is not an issue to be exploited to inflame hate and assuage the economic insecurities of those who feel displaced by the 21st-century economy, it\u2019s what keeps the state economy churning.For us, immigration is not a \u201cLatino\u201d issue. The state\u2019s white population arrived so recently that all of us retain a sense of our immigrant status. My great-great-grandfather Gerhard Kettmann left Germany in 1849 and made his way to California during the Gold Rush. That\u2019s why everyone is able to unite, even in our diversity.It seems as if every other idealistic young person who worked in the Obama White House or on the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign later moved to California. All these new arrivals create major problems, from housing shortages to insane Los Angeles-style traffic in Silicon Valley. They also create a critical mass of innovation.Many Californians see the next decade as a pivot point, when decisions about the environment and the economy will shape America\u2019s future for generations to come. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Mad Max\u2019 or \u2018Star Trek,\u2019\u201d said Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor and leading candidate to succeed Governor Brown. It\u2019s no mystery which movie he thinks Mr. Trump is directing.Nationally, Mr. Newsom is known mostly as a cultural pioneer, having allowed same-sex marriage as the mayor of San Francisco in 2004 \u2014 among the first big-city mayors to do so. But he sees himself in more pragmatic terms, more like a latter-day Robert Kennedy, a believer in the idea that government can do more for the people if it\u2019s smarter about trying new ideas and updating old assumptions.California for years was divided between its main population centers. Northern California, birthplace of Berkeley\u2019s Free Speech Movement in 1964 and the Summer of Love in San Francisco later that decade, was often at odds with large sections of Southern California, particularly Orange County, a bastion of suburban Republicans.The key, many of the state\u2019s politicians say, is to promote the former without falling into the trap of the latter \u2014 no easy task at a time when many Californians see their state as the base of the anti-Trump resistance.It would be easy for him to run far to the left, mixing anti-Trump rhetoric with unrealistic policy promises. Instead, he wants America to see a different California \u2014 a state that mixes pragmatism and progressivism.\u201cI\u2019m one of those people that think the threats that we face from Washington are very real, and not just to the resources we need, but the values that make us who we are,\u201d he said. \u201cCalifornia is really a model for what the country can be if we make the right choices.\u201d\u201cThe momentum is definitely on our side,\u201d Mr. Janz told me. \u201cMy opponent is more concerned about blaming Democrats than getting the job done. The people here honestly want Nunes to focus less on creating these fake controversies and more on doing the work that\u2019s required to move us along into the 21st century here in the Central Valley.\u201dAgain and again, this is the message coming from the state\u2019s rising politicians \u2014 anger with the president and his allies not out of an ideological commitment, but because the president seems more interested in personal gain than national progress.The more visionary among California\u2019s leaders, including Mr. Newsom, recognize that their state has the highest poverty rate in the country, by some measures, and that addressing the problem \u2014 through affordable housing, job programs and early education \u2014 has to be a priority. To the extent these are national problems, too, other states may soon be looking to Sacramento, not Washington, for leadership.It\u2019s also a given that one or more Californians could figure prominently in the 2020 presidential race, including Ms. Harris, a first-term senator who has gained a reputation for her withering examinations of the president\u2019s cabinet nominees. Mr. Newsom, particularly if he wins the governor\u2019s race this year by a convincing margin, could also make the jump to the national stage, following Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown.To see how different the stereotype of California is from the reality, consider another of the state\u2019s rising political figures, the billionaire Tom Steyer.To most people in Washington or New York, Mr. Steyer is the \u201cImpeachment Guy\u201d who has spent millions of dollars on television ads in which he speaks to the camera directly and makes a case for the urgent need to impeach President Trump. Impeachment is a widely popular idea among Democrats, but political realists say it\u2019s unlikely to happen absent a Democratic surge in the midterm elections \u2014 in other words, that\u2019s California for you.\u201cI think California has this great advantage, which is we have a functioning democracy,\u201d Mr. Steyer said in a recent interview. \u201cWith all our problems \u2014 and we have a lot of them, the biggest one being economic inequality \u2014 we have a spirit in business and in politics that says, sure, there are big problems, but we can address them. That spirit is a great advantage and it\u2019s not true in Washington, D.C., right now.\u201dHis bet \u2014 and that of millions of others in my state \u2014 is that soon, California will pick up the slack.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Diplomacy, Trump Is the Anti-Reagan", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAn optimistic take on Donald Trump\u2019s historic meeting Tuesday with Kim Jong-un is that it\u2019s Geneva Redux \u2014 a reprise of the 1985 summit between Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that established their rapport, fundamentally altered the tenor of relations between the superpowers and led within a few years to the end of the Cold War.\u201cTrump\u2019s lack of focus on the details of denuclearization may be a good thing,\u201d Beinart writes. \u201cLike Reagan, he seems to sense that the nuclear technicalities matter less than the political relationship.\u201dIt\u2019s true that Reagan was able to raise his sights above the technical arcana to something few others could see. To wit: The Cold War didn\u2019t need to last forever. The security paradigms that defined it weren\u2019t immutable laws of history. Personal chemistry with a Soviet leader could go a long way to changing the relationship.Could the same scenario unfold with North Korea? Probably not \u2014 for reasons that would have been obvious to most conservatives before their current Trump derangement.First, Trump isn\u2019t Reagan. Reagan generally acted in concert with allies. Trump brazenly acts against them. Reagan\u2019s negotiation method: \u201cTrust but verify.\u201d Trump\u2019s self-declared method: \u201cMy touch, my feel.\u201d Reagan refused to give in to Soviet demands that he abandon the Strategic Defense Initiative. Trump surrendered immediately to Pyongyang\u2019s long-held insistence that the U.S. suspend military exercises with South Korea while getting nothing in return. Reagan\u2019s aim was to topple Communist Party rule in Moscow. Trump\u2019s is to preserve it in Pyongyang.Second, Kim isn\u2019t Gorbachev. Gorbachev was born into a family that suffered acutely the horrors of Stalinism. Kim was born into a family that starved its own people. Gorbachev rose through the ranks as a technocrat with no background in the regime\u2019s security apparatus. Kim consolidated his rule by murdering his uncle, half brother and various ministers, among other unfortunates. Gorbachev came to office intent on easing political repression at home and defusing tensions with the West. Kim spent his first six years doing precisely the opposite.Fourth, the timetables are incompatible. Trump wants a foreign policy \u201cachievement\u201d by the midterms, and maybe a Nobel Peace Prize sometime before the 2020 election. Kim plans to be ruling North Korea when one of Chelsea Clinton\u2019s kids is president. Trump\u2019s incentive will be to make concessions up front. Kim can renege on his promises much later.Fifth, Trump is a sucker. Kim is not. Say what you will about the North Korean despot, but consolidating power in his vipers\u2019 nest regime, fielding a credible nuclear arsenal, improving his economy without easing political controls, playing nuclear brinkmanship with Trump and then, within weeks, getting the prestige of a superpower summit are political achievements of the first order. Machiavelli smiles from the grave.As for Trump, the supposed success of the summit after the debacle in Quebec appeals to innate love of drama. He is where he loves to be: at the center of a stunned world\u2019s attention.I\u2019d be happy to be proved wrong. I would be thrilled to learn that Kim is a farsighted reformer masquerading, out of desperate necessity, as a thug and a swindler. It would also be nice to think that Trump is playing geopolitical chess at a level plodding pundits can scarcely conceive. Political commentators should always maintain a capacity for surprise and an ability to admit mistakes.For now, however, it\u2019s hard to see what the Singapore summit has achieved other than to betray America\u2019s allies, our belief in human rights, our history of geopolitical sobriety and our reliance on common sense. For what? A photo op with a sinister glutton and his North Korean counterpart?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What a Trade War With China Looks Like on the Front Lines", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow trade disputes play out will vary depending on the product and how hard it is to find a workaround. But tariffs on more countries mean more economic risk.For Malaysian factories that make light-emitting diodes, it is an opportunity. For American makers of outboard boat motors, it is a threat. For the biggest sellers of flat-screen televisions, it is a nuisance.The emerging trade war between the United States and China has prompted predictions of severe economic and geopolitical disruption. But for any given industry, the impact of tariffs depends on the microeconomics of its products: How much does demand change when its prices rise? Are substitutes readily available? How much extra productive capacity is there around the world, and how long would it take to get new manufacturing facilities up and running?\u201cHow this will play out is idiosyncratic to any given product and unique to each supply chain,\u201d said Daniel Rosen, partner at the economic research firm Rhodium Group. \u201cNobody can honestly claim high confidence that they understand what the overall impact will be. You may as well project the weather on a Tuesday afternoon a year from now.\u201dThe United States imposed its first wave of tariffs over the spring, and each of the 1,102 goods that may be affected will end up with its own list of winners and losers. To see how this may unfold, it\u2019s helpful to examine the different trade patterns for those goods, along with some of the thousands of comment letters that companies and industry groups have submitted to the U.S. Trade Representative. And executives and other experts have their own sense of exactly how supply chains might be rerouted and prices might swing for particular goods.The lesson that emerges: Be skeptical of predictions of radical disruption to major industries in the near term. For now, companies have options to avoid some of the most severe risks.But the longer the trade dispute lasts, the more products will get pulled into it. And the more the United States finds itself at odds not just with one other major economy but the entire world, the more it makes sense to worry. The workarounds that companies are using so far wouldn\u2019t succeed in an open-ended, indefinite trade war.China has the world\u2019s second-largest economy and is a major supplier of many of the products lining store shelves in the United States. The Trump administration\u2019s first round of tariffs is devised to focus on goods for which there are many other suppliers.Consider light-emitting diodes, the tiny part that makes LED light bulbs illuminate and are used in many industrial settings. The United States imported $637 million worth of them from China last year, more than any other country. But that doesn\u2019t mean China is the only supplier. Japan and Malaysia exported an additional $593 million in LEDs in the United States combined.So for American companies that import the diodes and incorporate them in their products, such as solar-powered streetlamps, China isn\u2019t the only option. The question is whether other countries not subject to the 25 percent tariff can accommodate a potential surge of demand.In Malaysia, the LED industry senses opportunity.\u201cThe trade war, I would say it will benefit us if it really keeps going in the direction of tariffs,\u201d said Daniel Fong, senior regional manager of Oversea Lighting and Electric, located 40 minutes from Kuala Lumpur. \u201cThe U.S. market is cutting off all ties to China, and in that sense we have a bigger opportunity to benefit the U.S. market with Malaysia-made products.\u201dThe industry in Malaysia has struggled to make inroads in the American market, in part, said Jamie Fox, a lighting components analyst with IHS Markit, because China subsidizes its LED industry. A crucial machine needed for the manufacture of the diodes can cost $2 million, but regional subsidies in China make them available for half as much, putting competitors outside China at a price disadvantage.If tariffs make Chinese exporters less competitive, the balance may shift. John See, chief executive of QAV Technologies, said his company\u2019s two LED factories in Penang could quickly increase production by 300 to 400 percent, if demand were there. Malaysia, he suggested, might no longer have to play \u201csecond fiddle\u201d to China in business with the United States.It\u2019s easy for American importers to replace Chinese LED supplies with those made elsewhere because the parts are relatively standard; the issues are mostly price and availability.But other Chinese products covered by tariffs aren\u2019t so easy for their importers to substitute.Ray Electric Outboards in Cape Coral, Fla., imports its powerheads \u2014 the electric motors that turn the propeller for a small boat \u2014 from China. Shifting to a different supplier is no small matter.\u201cHave I tried different companies to get a different motor?\u201d said Joy Hurley, business manager at Ray Electric. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s just not as readily available. There is nothing else that will work in our system.\u201d The company has molds that are already made to fit the company\u2019s current suppliers\u2019 products, and it costs thousands of dollars to change them.The American boating industry has complained of many elements of the tariffs. Mercury Marine, for example, of Fond du Lac, Wis., said in a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative that it employs 4,800 American workers, but that the manufacture of 40-to-60-horsepower boat engines in Suzhou, China, is crucial to the enterprise.Because boats are often bought for recreational purposes, their demand tends to be elastic \u2014 highly responsive to price changes. That means those higher prices may well translate into fewer people enjoying their summer in a new motorboat.Outboard boat motors and LEDs were both on the list for tariffs the Trump administration released this month. There is also something to learn from a product that wasn\u2019t.It will become particularly relevant if the dispute with China escalates and televisions again find themselves targeted \u2014 which, in recent days, has appeared more likely than not.The manufacture of liquid crystal display televisions takes place in several steps. The liquid crystal is made in sophisticated factories that can cost billions to build. Those displays are then combined with other parts to make the backlight assembly, the innards of a TV.The last step is the simplest and most labor-intensive: packing the backlight assembly into the plastic shell of a TV, along with other parts like speakers and buttons, and putting it all into a box where it can be shipped to store shelves.The liquid crystals are made mainly in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China. The final assembly is done in many more places; many larger TVs sold in the United States are assembled in Mexico.That shows the ways that savvy companies \u2014 which the giants of the TV business like LG, Sony and Samsung are \u2014 can avoid having the Chinese tariffs pinch. Shifting even more of their assembly to Mexico could allow them to avoid the tax even if it is expanded to encompass their products.For example, LG has a facility in Reynosa, Mexico. Bob O\u2019Brien, the president of Display Supply Chain Consultants, said he suspected the company could expand production there to shift assembly work from China.\u201cIt would be disruptive in the sense that they would have to change their plans, but they could hire more people in Reynosa, add additional shifts, maybe change production lines, relatively easily,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. Even if the company needed to open up new production lines, six months or so might be enough.Moreover, the strategy of moving television assembly from China to Mexico would be a way to avoid any Chinese tariffs only so long as the North American Free Trade Agreement keeps American imports from Mexico tax-free.That points to one of the risks of the Trump administration\u2019s strategy of waging trade wars on multiple fronts. When only one country \u2014 even a big, important one like China \u2014 faces punitive tariffs, companies can find ways to mitigate the damage to their own profits and to consumers.But if the United States simultaneously raises tariffs on much of the world, corporate strategists have less room to maneuver.\u201cCompanies will try to find ways to reduce the cost of trade barriers,\u201d said Mary Lovely, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIf you take away all their options, it\u2019s going to be much more detrimental to American corporations and American workers.\u201dIn other words, the impact of this first wave of China tariffs, while it will vary across different products for all sorts of reasons, may be manageable. A trade war with much of the world would be a different story entirely.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Kuantan, Malaysia.Advertisement"}

This isn\u2019t some theory that I\u2019m basing on the whisperings of unnamed administration officials whose candor the president can dismiss as fake news put out by a maleficent media.Translation: He can live, in the meantime, with this short-term horror. Can everybody else?On Twitter, Trump himself expectorated that all of this is \u201cthe Democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with Boarder Security and Crime.\u201d He equates random capital letters with virility. They\u2019re typographical Viagra. In another spasm of super-potency, he tweeted, \u201cCHANGE THE LAWS!\u201dTranslation: Give him his border wall and he\u2019ll give the country relief from the sight of caged children and the sound of their sobs. Deny him and his government will stay its heartless course, no matter how much trauma is inflicted on these kids, no matter how much shame is heaped on America, no matter how profound the betrayal of its promise, no matter how deep the interment of its soul. He\u2019ll blame the nightmare on his opponents and he\u2019ll be persuasive, because he\u2019s a better liar. He has had more practice at it.When I say that we have a hostage crisis, I\u2019m being provocative with my language, but I\u2019m not being loose with it.But that disquieting number is nonetheless well below his usual approval ratings from members of his party. And Senate Republicans, showing more independence and defiance than they typically do, signaled on Tuesday afternoon that they wanted to pass legislation to end quickly the separation of families who cross illegally into the country. They\u2019re no doubt worried about the prospects of Republican senators, like Ted Cruz, who are up for re-election in November. Cruz had already denounced what the Trump administration was doing.What these Republicans perhaps also understand is that how we approach immigration, legal and illegal, is about more than the economy, though that\u2019s an important part of the equation, and more than security, though that\u2019s vital.In a country of immigrants that has proudly held itself up as an exemplar, it\u2019s about morality. It\u2019s about values. Few aspects of American policy define us in the eyes of the world as sharply as our treatment of immigrants does. Few define us as sharply, period.We can be tough, yes. But cruel? That\u2019s not in our interests, not if we care to maintain the global sway that we have. Not if we want to hold on to who we are or mean to be: people of generosity and mercy. Not if we\u2019re invested in that \u201cshining city on a hill\u201d that Ronald Reagan so poetically evoked.He and other presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, saw America as a beacon.

{"Headline": "The Bankruptcy of 21st Century Socialism", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Casta\u00f1eda was foreign minister of Mexico from 2000 to 2003.Cuba paid a heavy price for the initial, and perhaps enduring, successes of its revolution: education, health and dignity. But from the very beginning \u2014 with the exception of a few years between the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of its subsidies to Cuba in 1992 and the advent of Venezuelan support in 1999 \u2014 it always found someone to pay the bills. The next option was meant to be the United States. That no longer seems possible.Venezuela, for its part, embarked on a perilous course with the election of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 1998 that was spurred further after a failed national oil workers strike in late 2002 and early 2003: building socialism after the Cold War, with support from Cuba and practically no one else. Cuban intelligence and security backing for Caracas continues, but high oil prices disappeared in 2014, and so did the Venezuelan government\u2019s Saudi Arabian-like generosity to Havana. The glory days have been over for a long time; all that matters today is survival.Which brings us to the third source of concern. Venezuela is no longer able to subsidize Cuba\u2019s transition to a Vietnam-style socialist economy the way it did before.The alternative for Cuba was thought to reside in normalization with the United States, which has stalled following the end of the Obama administration. Venezuela, however, means more to the island country than hard currency and oil. Despite ongoing flirtations with China and Russia, it is Cuba\u2019s only unconditional ally in the world, which is why the Venezuelan debacle is so worrisome.The international community has intensified sanctions against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s dictatorship. But this will produce little effect in Caracas unless Washington imposes oil-related restrictions: expropriating Citgo, the Pdvsa-owned oil company, or forbidding oil exports and imports to and from Venezuela. But for this not to play into Mr. Maduro\u2019s hands, the Latin Americans and the Europeans would be obliged to support the measures and adopt similar ones.Herein lies the central question involving Venezuela, and ultimately, Cuba itself. At its annual assembly on June 5, the Organization of American States might consider a motion to suspend Venezuela; it will probably fail, but a stand will have been taken by the region\u2019s democracies.In the ensuing confrontation, anything can occur. The international community can decide, cynically but not illogically, that the country\u2019s crisis is too dangerous to be left to Venezuelans. In this case, the only way to press the Maduro government to change course seems to be oil-based sanctions, led by but not limited to Washington.It is anybody\u2019s guess how the regime will fare if unrest flares. The only certainty is the utter failure of so-called 21st century socialism, in Venezuela as such, in Cuba by another name.Jorge G.

{"Headline": "Is Neymar Black? Brazil and the Painful Relativity of Race", "Date": "2018-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEver since his \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m black, you know?\u201d comment, Neymar has served as a focal point in Brazil\u2019s cultural reckoning with racism, whitening, identity and public policy.Ms. de Oliveira is a Bras\u00edlia-based reporter.Years before he became the most expensive player in the world; before his Olympic gold medal; before the Eiffel Tower lit up with his name to greet his professional move from Barcelona to Paris, Neymar da Silva Santos J\u00fanior, the Brazilian forward known to the world simply as Neymar, faced his first public relations controversy.\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m black, you know?\u201dHis answer was heard like a record-scratch across the country. Was this young man in denial about his racial identity? Particularly when in the same interview he outlined his meticulous hair care regime, which involved getting his locks chemically straightened every few weeks, then bleached blonde. Or was there a less alarming explanation behind his comment? Could Neymar merely be pointing out that, as the son of a black father and a white mother, his lighter skin tone shielded him from the racist abuse directed at other players? Had he, at least in his context, reached whiteness? Whatever the interpretation, Neymar\u2019s words revealed the tricky, often contradictory ways that many Brazilians talk, and fail to talk, about race in a country with the largest population of black descendants outside of Africa.Because Brazil never had an apartheid system like South Africa, or a ban on mixed-race marriages like America, went the argument, a spirit of warm relations blossomed across racial divides. Never mind that Brazil was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery in 1888; or that after abolition, the ruling class mounted a campaign to whiten the majority-black population, by fully subsidizing the immigration of over four million white Europeans, giving them free land, and compelling Brazilians to take up with them. Even once democracia racial was widely debunked by a new generation of social scientists, the enduring legacy of the myth was that, rather than engage with the race question, Brazilians had turned racism, and talking about racism, into a taboo. In concealing the problem from vigorous public debate, a hierarchy based on skin color was allowed to congeal.Even that happier stat that a third of marriages are mixed-race comes with an asterisk: According to the sociologist Edward Telles, author of \u201cRace in Another America: The Significance of Skin Color in Brazil,\" the rates of intermarriage are negligible among wealthier Brazilians.Lima\u2019s words point to a painful and somewhat paradoxical consequence of Brazil\u2019s racial fluidity. America\u2019s politics of racial purity, which culminated in the notion that even one-drop of African blood made a person legally black, fostered solidarity among those targeted by discriminatory laws. In Brazil, however, the often admirable blurring of racial boundaries is a modern reality that \u2014 rather than stemming from colorblindness \u2014 is tainted with the sinister origins of state-sanctioned attempts to dilute, even dissolve, blackness. Black rights groups in Brazil, such as Educafro and the student movement Coletivo Negrada, have since fought to counter that legacy. Activists don\u2019t want social ascension, or economic betterment, to have to correlate with whiteness. They want visibly black and brown faces not just on the beloved national team, but in the highest ranks of Brazilian society. And in the past two decades, they\u2019ve succeeded in measurable ways.But with these gains came new dilemmas. Concerns over affirmative action fraud have plagued some of the most prestigious university programs, fostering unease on campuses. Students of complex heritages and identities report each other to administrators for not being black, or at least black enough. Episodes of mass expulsions occur multiple times a year \u2014 followed, inevitably, by lawsuits from the expelled students. The World Cup is a wonderful event, showcasing the best of human achievement. And Brazil, with Neymar leading the way, have a good shot at winning it. But this pageant of nations is also a reminder, on the 130th anniversary of slavery\u2019s abolition, that the modern world, in all of its globalized splendor, still lacks a truly equal, multiracial society.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indonesia\u2019s Order to Foreign Workers: Learn the Language", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia is making it easier for foreigners to work here \u2014 but they will have to study as well.A decree by President Joko Widodo that is set to take effect this month will simplify Indonesia\u2019s procedures for issuing work permits to foreigners, which are often hampered by delays, arbitrary denials and revocations, not to mention compulsory bribes to civil servants just to stamp the paperwork.Buried inside the order is a section requiring all expatriate workers to undergo formal Indonesian language training, an apparent first for any nation in Southeast Asia.The foreign business community has been caught off guard by the new requirement.\u201cOur businesses want to be here and want to invest, but what they also want are predictable rules,\u201d said A. Lin Neumann, managing director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia, which represents nearly 300 American companies operating in the country.The United States is one of Indonesia\u2019s largest foreign direct investors, in industries including oil and gas, mining, banking, technology, e-commerce and logistics.The language requirement \u201csends a negative message that foreigners are somehow unwelcome,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cThis hurts the investment climate.\u201dThe order also applies to domestic companies, which are reacting with alarm.\u201cI think this is foolish; it\u2019s stupid. It lacks clarity on what the objective is,\u201d said Suryo B. Sulisto, a prominent Indonesian business executive and former chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\u201cWhat are they trying to do \u2014 stop investment coming in?\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s counterproductive.\u201dThe government has not explained the reasoning behind the language requirement. But it may be an attempt by Mr. Joko, who is running for re-election next year, to placate political rivals who say he is \u201copening the floodgates\u201d to foreign workers by streamlining the process for obtaining work permits.Indonesia, a country of 260 million people, currently has about 126,000 working Asian and Western expatriates, a low percentage compared with neighbors like Singapore and Malaysia.The complaints from Mr. Joko\u2019s opponents stem partly from an increase in the number of Chinese manual laborers entering illegally on tourist visas to work on Chinese-funded infrastructure projects. As unregistered workers, they would not be subject to the new language requirement.Mr. Suryo said it made little sense to address concerns about illegal foreign labor by imposing a language requirement on bankers, engineers and other professionals.\u201cThis is another part of bureaucracy where it\u2019s a moneymaking opportunity for someone,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will get into the business of issuing fake language certificates.\u201dIn 2015, Mr. Joko publicly quashed a draft regulation requiring all expatriate workers to be proficient in the Indonesian language, saying it was bad for business.But his own decree requires companies to arrange and pay for foreigners working in the country for longer than six months to take Indonesian language courses at local schools, and to provide attendance certificates.If they fail to do so, the companies and their employees could face unspecified sanctions that are being drafted by the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration, which processes and revokes foreign work permits, according to Budiman, head of the ministry\u2019s legal affairs bureau.The order goes into force on Tuesday, said Mr. Budiman, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. Some details, like how many class hours are required per week, are still being decided.Mr. Budiman said companies shouldn\u2019t complain because the decree also reduces waiting times for work permits, from months to days.\u201cDon\u2019t look at this issue from only one side,\u201d he said.Throughout his presidency, Mr. Joko has fought over foreign investment policies with his own cabinet ministries and bureaucracy, which are often accused of being more focused on protecting their own interests than in opening up the Indonesian economy.In 2015, as Mr. Joko was rolling out a series of regulatory reforms, his government adopted dramatically higher tariffs on more than 1,000 imported items, an increase that he opposed but which did not require his approval.Johan Budi, Mr. Joko\u2019s spokesman, played down any political infighting or the possibility of negative economic repercussions, insisting that the order does not require that expatriates be fluent in the Indonesian language to be employed.\u201cIt is necessary for companies to provide the facilities for training expatriates\u201d in the language, Mr. Budi said, \u201cand there\u2019s nothing wrong with foreign workers learning Indonesian. But it is not mandatory to be able to speak the Indonesian language.\u201dThen why have such a rule?\u201cMy reading is that the government is doing it to address concerns about foreign workers without having to annul the controversial decree,\u201d said Marcus Mietzner, an associate professor at Australian National University in Canberra and a longtime researcher in Indonesian politics.\u201cThe latter would be an admission that they were wrong on this and thus would look bad,\u201d he said.Muhammad Rusmadi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Maybe, maybe not.But it only added to the mounting tensions between Mr. Trudeau, now the Canadian prime minister, and Mr. Trump as the president arrived for the Group of 7 summit meeting that had become so fractured before it started that many observers were calling it the \u201cG-6 plus 1\u201d \u2014 with Mr. Trump being cast as the irrational, irascible and dangerous outsider.When the two leaders finally met on the grounds of a grand Quebec hotel on Friday, they had a brief, cordial exchange and made no show of the antagonism between them that has grown over the past week. Instead, Mr. Trudeau gave his telegenic smile, and Mr. Trump gave a thumbs up for the cameras.\u201cTrudeau finds himself in a very challenging and difficult situation,\u201d said Louis B\u00e9langer, director of the Institute for International Studies at Laval University in Quebec City. \u201cWe wish him good luck.\u201dThe Group of 7 meeting, set in La Malbaie, on the shores of the St. Lawrence River, 90 miles northeast of Quebec City, is the occasion for Mr. Trump\u2019s first official visit to Canada, which he announced he would cut short.Across the country, Canadians reacted with both incredulity and horror, as almost three-quarters of the country\u2019s exports go directly across the southern border and any trade war begun by the United States would cause huge damage.\u201cWe are in the eye of the storm,\u201d said Janice Stein, the founding director of the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. \u201cThe direction of the Canadian economy and national interest are now at stake. There is grave danger to this country like never happened before.\u201dOthers worried that the fury over trade would swamp every other issue on the leaders\u2019 agenda, particularly women\u2019s advancement and a commitment to remove plastics from the ocean.However, when Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Trump met with reporters during a break in the afternoon\u2019s program, they seemed friendly and jovial, cracking dark-humor jokes about their differences.\u201cJustin has agreed to cut all tariffs,\u201d Mr. Trump said, to which Mr. Trudeau responded, \u201cI\u2019d say Nafta is in good shape,\u201d a reference to the North American Free Trade Agreement.Mr. Trump characterized their relationship as \u201cvery good\u201d and then \u201cprobably better, as good or better, as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve made a lot of progress today. We\u2019ll see how it all works out.\u201dSince Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Trudeau has employed a charm offensive, working to maintain close relations with the president, but also sending an army of negotiators across the border to shore up support for Nafta and try to contain Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist and nationalist impulses.Called the \u201cdoughnut strategy,\u201d Mr. Trudeau\u2019s campaign seemed to be working until the end of last month.In response, Mr. Trudeau pushed back for the first time, with punitive tariffs of his own on American imports worth $12.8 billion, and Canadians largely applauded.On Friday, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the Canadian government would not back down. \u201cBut we say that with great sadness,\u201d she said. She added that history had shown, for G-7 countries in particular, \u201cwe are most successful, and prosperous and safe, when we all grow together.\u201dOn the eve of the summit meeting, a 2000 editorial resurfaced from a small British Columbia newspaper admonishing Mr. Trudeau for what it said was \u201cinappropriately \u2018handling\u2019\u201d of a female reporter, creating one more fire Mr. Trudeau had to douse.The current publisher of the newspaper, the Creston Valley Advance, said the paper was not in a position to \u201cconfirm or deny\u201d any of its substance.If any place could soothe the tempers of the leaders, it would be the site of the summit meeting. With the site\u2019s rolling forests that meet the tidal waters of the St. Lawrence River, it was easy to see why the sleepy village of La Malbaie was once a vacation spot for Hollywood stars and American presidents alike. (President William Howard Taft owned a luxurious villa here.)A giant fence was installed around the meeting site, and at its base on the water\u2019s edge, the town set a small \u201cfree speech zone\u201d for protesters, but it remained as languid as the rest of town. When meetings were beginning in earnest, reporters outnumbered a handful of North Korean defectors who had come from Toronto to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s coming meeting with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, whom they called a \u201cmurderer and dictator.\u201d\u201cThe stress levels aren\u2019t on the outside of the G-7,\u201d joked Mayor Michel Couturier of La Malbaie, who is still hopeful the meeting will buff some of the town\u2019s former tourism luster. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly inside the G-7 red zone.\u201dDan Bilefsky contributed reporting from Montreal, and Ian Austen from Ottawa.Advertisement"}

But to many legal scholars and democracy supporters, it is a trap that will rob Hong Kong of a measure of autonomy, and set the stage for it to lose much more in the future.The new rail line will cut the two-hour trip between Hong Kong and the city of Guangzhou to 48 minutes. Some critics, though, have questioned the project\u2019s $10.8 billion cost, an increase from the original estimate of $8.3 billion, when Hong Kong already has rail links with mainland China, in addition to air, road and ferry connections.The biggest issue, though, is not the price tag of the sweeping, clamshell-shaped station, built in western Kowloon near shopping malls, apartment towers and a new arts district. More troubling to many is that in the heart of Hong Kong, mainland Chinese law will hold sway over 26 acres of floor space in the station, an area slightly larger than Yankee Stadium.When Hong Kong was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the arrangement with Beijing was that it would be given a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d under a model of \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d For 50 years Hong Kong could keep its independent courts, its free-market economy and its freewheeling press, while Beijing was responsible for matters of state like national defense and foreign relations.The granting of mainland jurisdiction is a subtle yet powerful way to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s unique status, said Victoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame.\u201cInstead of sending bullets into Hong Kong, they\u2019re sending a bullet train,\u201d she said.The new station \u201cwill become a horrifying precedent that it\u2019s possible to introduce laws from China in Hong Kong without any legal basis,\u201d said Chris Ng, a representative of the Progressive Lawyers Group, a Hong Kong organization that promotes democracy and the rule of law.The mainland officers would have authority over a customs and immigration area that makes up about one quarter of the West Kowloon station.Eric Cheung, a professor of law at the University of Hong Kong, said there was a risk that the passage of the station arrangement would bypass Hong Kong\u2019s courts. But Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for justice, Teresa Cheng, said it would have to undergo court scrutiny, though she said she believed the plan was on solid legal ground.Pro-democracy legislators tried to limit the scope or permanence of the mainland officers with a series of amendments, but they were all defeated Thursday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Bloomberg Will Spend $80 Million on the Midterms. His Goal: Flip the House for the Democrats.", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has decided to throw his political clout and personal fortune behind the Democratic campaign to take control of the House of Representatives this year, directing aides to spend tens of millions of dollars in an effort to expel Republicans from power.By siding so emphatically with one party, Mr. Bloomberg has the potential to upend the financial dynamics of the midterm campaign, which have appeared to favor Republicans up to this point. Facing intense opposition to President Trump and conservative policies, Republicans have been counting on a strong economy and heavily funded outside groups to give them a political advantage in key races, especially in affluent suburbs where it is expensive to run television ads.While Mr. Bloomberg has not chosen his list of targeted races yet, he is unlikely to get involved in rural, conservative-leaning districts where his views on guns and other issues could stir an uproar, according to people briefed on his plans, some of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.The new alliance between Mr. Bloomberg, 76, and congressional Democrats marks a fresh stage in the former mayor\u2019s political evolution. And it promises to put New York and its political leaders even more squarely at the center of a midterm campaign already stocked with prominent characters from the city, including a president who made his fortune in Manhattan real estate; the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer; and Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s predecessor in Gracie Mansion, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who serves as a lawyer for Mr. Trump.Massive campaign spending by partisan billionaires \u2014 like Mr. Adelson and Mr. Steyer, and the powerful conservative donor network led by the Koch brothers \u2014 has yielded a hodgepodge of results over the years. In many cases, it has helped to amplify existing political trends, allowing parties already on the rise to gain ground even more rapidly. In other instances, billionaire-funded \u201csuper PACs\u201d have helped parties limit their losses in difficult political conditions, as Republicans hope their outside groups will do this year. But money alone rarely determines the outcome of national elections.Calling Republican leaders in the House \u201cabsolutely feckless,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg criticized them for failing to check Mr. Trump or to exercise rigorous oversight of his presidential administration.\u201cI\u2019ve never thought that the public is well-served when one party is entirely out of power, and I think the past year and half has been evidence of that,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said, lamenting that Republicans \u201chave done little to reach across the aisle to craft bipartisan solutions \u2014 not only on guns and climate change, but also on jobs, immigration, health care, and infrastructure.\u201dMr. Bloomberg continued: \u201cRepublicans in Congress have had almost two years to prove they could govern responsibly. They failed.\u201dMr. Bloomberg is said to be intrigued by a list of candidates Mr. Moulton has endorsed, many of them also veterans.\u201cEspecially in these marginal suburban districts, he\u2019s someone whose resources and credibility can help candidates in tough races,\u201d Mr. Moulton said, adding that Mr. Bloomberg would likely be cautious about where to deploy his operation: \u201cThere are places where you want to go in very obviously, and other places where you want to do work behind the scenes.\u201dMr. Crowley said in an interview that Mr. Bloomberg had expressed dismay to him about Republican lawmakers\u2019 refusal to challenge Mr. Trump.\u201cHe recognizes the threat of this presidency,\u201d Mr. Crowley said.In a sign of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s deep alienation from the Republican Party, he has recently told associates that if he were to run for president in 2020, he would likely do so as a Democrat, according to people who have spoken with him directly.It is unclear whether Mr. Bloomberg, who would be 78 on Election Day in 2020, is actively contemplating another presidential campaign or simply leaving the door open to the possibility.\u201cHe plays very well in the moderate suburbs where we need to win seats,\u201d said Mr. Gottheimer, adding: \u201cFrom my perspective, I want more pro-business, moderate Democrats in Congress next year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the G.O.P. Built Donald Trump\u2019s Cages", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.President Trump may have caved on his child-separation policy, after a public outcry that included significant members of his own coalition. But rather than waste time on self-congratulation, Republicans who spoke up this time should be asking themselves why a president of their party felt he was enforcing its principles by breaking apart families and caging children.For a number of reasons \u2014 economic, cultural and demographic \u2014 immigration has been a growing concern among Republican base voters for decades. From the early 1990s to 2000, the conservative firebrand Pat Buchanan kept the Republican Party on its toes, running for president three times with an explicitly isolationist message. But it was during the George W. Bush years that anti-immigrant sentiment started to become more central to the party\u2019s identity.Mr. Bush made comprehensive immigration reform a priority of his second term. Multiple Senate bills emerged, built on the pillars of border security, a guest-worker program and a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants. But conservatives in the House rejected the idea of legalization and instead focused on border security. Conservative talk radio took up the cause, smacking Mr. Bush as squishy on immigration. The very concept of comprehensive reform became anathema to many on the right.President Barack Obama also took a run at reform. And as with Bush 43, his efforts shattered when they collided with the Republican hard-liners in the House. The Great Recession that Mr. Obama inherited did nothing to quell nativist resentment among working-class whites, and the rise of the Tea Party pulled the Republican Party further to the right, with zealots on immigration setting the tone. Politicians who did not follow risked banishment.Just ask Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican, who saw his fledgling political career almost snuffed out by his flirtation with comprehensive reform. In early 2013, Mr. Rubio joined a bipartisan group of colleagues, nicknamed the Gang of Eight, to hammer out a grand compromise. This was in the wake of Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential loss in 2012, after which the Republican Party briefly decided that one of its principal goals was to improve its image with Hispanic voters. The resulting plan would have done everything from beefing up border security to overhauling visa categories to promoting a merit-based immigration system. It also provided for the legalization of undocumented immigrants, which meant conservatives hated it. That June, the bill cleared the Senate by an impressive 68-to-32 vote. But John Boehner, then the House speaker, refused to bring it up for a vote in the Republican-controlled lower chamber.For his efforts, Mr. Rubio became a pariah to the Tea Party voters who had propelled him to office three years earlier. Soon, he was denying that he had ever really supported the bill.Time and again, given the choice between soothing and stoking nativist animus, Republican lawmakers chose the low road. By the late Obama years, a skeptical-verging-on-hostile view of immigration had become a core tenet of party orthodoxy \u2014 like opposing gun control or denouncing Obamacare.There is no question that Mr. Trump inherited a broken immigration system. There is also no question that he prefers ranting about its brokenness to making even a token effort at fixing it.None of this is surprising considering the rampant violence in the region \u2014 in 2016, Honduras and El Salvador ranked among the five nations with the highest rates of violent death. People are desperate to escape, no matter what they may face at the U.S. border.Helping these nations stabilize themselves is key to reducing the flow of asylum seekers. But Mr. Trump does not like complexity or long-term strategizing. He prefers casting blame and making threats. He has repeatedly vowed to cut off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras unless they stem the flow of drugs and people into the United States.In the administration\u2019s budget proposals, it has sought deep cuts in aid to these countries \u2014 something Congress has wisely ignored. Removing a financial lifeline from nations already in chaos is hardly a recipe for progress.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s move to kick out as many people who are from these countries as possible threatens to overwhelm nations ill equipped for such an influx. And without the money that many of the immigrants living here regularly send back to their families, the economies of these countries would further crumble. (In 2016, 17 percent of El Salvador\u2019s gross domestic product came from remittances from abroad.)America\u2019s immigration mess is not going to be cleaned up anytime soon. The House\u2019s efforts last week to pass legislation dissolved into squabbling. Maybe leadership can salvage the situation and squeak through some uneasy compromise between Republican moderates and conservatives. But conservatives are terrified that the base will punish them if they concede even an inch. Speaker Paul Ryan, with one foot out the door, has no juice. And pretty much everyone assumes that nothing will move through the Senate anyway.For his part, Mr. Trump is planning fresh crackdowns in the run-up to the midterms, to reassure his base that he has not lost his resolve. If anything, given the fragility of his ego, last week\u2019s flip-flop will make him all the more desperate to prove his strength.More immediately, there is the matter of the 2,300-plus migrant children who need to be reunified with their parents as soon as possible. It remains unclear how the White House plans to handle that logistical challenge. Mr. Trump is more a breaker than a fixer.Whether out of moral queasiness or political fear, a smattering of Republican lawmakers chose to say, \u201cEnough is enough\u201d to this particular Trump atrocity. The question now is whether the conference will learn anything useful from this episode. Dehumanizing undocumented immigrants may be one of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature outrages, but it is hardly his only one. There is also his politicization of law enforcement, his attempts to undermine public faith in the democratic process, his attacks on the press, his family\u2019s suspect business dealings and his habitual lying \u2014 so this is unlikely to be the last time the president puts members of his party in an uncomfortable, and perhaps untenable, position.It takes work for America to hold on to its values. Individuals must push back when those values are threatened \u2014 especially when that threat comes from the commander in chief. Republican lawmakers should feel this burden more than most. Having done so much to pave the way for Mr. Trump and his immigration policies, they now owe it to the American people to help keep him in check.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brahms, the Berlin Philharmonic \u2026 and Me", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Gelles was executive director of the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra.On a Thursday in May, 101 musicians gathered on the stage of the Philharmonie in Berlin to rehearse the First Symphony by Johannes Brahms and then perform the work under the direction of Simon Rattle, the Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s conductor. For Mr. Rattle, or Sir Simon, or his preferred Simon, this would be one of his final concerts at his home for the past 16 years before taking over at the London Symphony Orchestra.Despite the imposing venue, those 101 musicians were amateurs all. They came from 30 countries, their ages ranging from 10 to 75. I was the elder bookend, one of six French hornists selected, and lending the event a special sweetness was the fact that I, like many others who play for sheer pleasure, chose not to pursue a professional career. In fact, I played virtually not at all for 37 years, and returned to my first love only 15 years ago.This was our route to Berlin: Having seen the event announced online by the Berlin Philharmonic at the start of the year, we auditioned by video for members of the orchestra. The ad hoc ensemble, known, cunningly, as the Be Phil Orchestra, offered a remarkable opportunity \u2014 to be a weeklong guest of one of the world\u2019s great ensembles, attending its rehearsals, being coached by its musicians and performing under its music director.Of the 1,900 avocational instrumentalists who expressed interest in participating, 1,000 were auditioned online, and the Berlin Philharmonic musicians then selected the 101. The occasion was a reprise of similar events that the Philharmonic hosted twice before, though not in recent years. Whether the tradition will continue after Mr. Rattle relinquishes his post of music director and relocates to London \u2014 his successor is the Russian Kirill Petrenko \u2014 is at present unknown.Among other reasons, the event was notable for advancing a notion put forward by the British social scientist and journalist Charles Leadbeater in \u201cThe Pro-Am Revolution.\u201d Mr. Leadbeater\u2019s book, published in 2004, suggests that there is an overlap, slight but significant, between the realms of professionals and amateurs, that \u201cPro-Ams \u2014 people pursuing amateur activities to professional standards \u2014 are an increasingly important part of our society and economy.\u201d It should be stressed, however, that as adept as an amateur instrumentalist might be, the skills and stamina of the professional musician are of an altogether different order.Mr. Leadbeater cites the best-known of these manifestations, the Pro-Am sports tournaments, but he mentions, too, the various streams of expertise and interests that create open-source computer programs, that make astronomical discoveries, that lead to political engagement and change. He argues convincingly that just as professionals have much to teach amateurs, so too do amateurs have insights worth sharing with those more skilled. Should you search the open-source universe, you will find myriad programs ranging through the sciences and humanities, to mathematics and finance, to games and genealogy and hobbies. Firefox and Linux are among the most familiar names; CyberBrau perhaps less so.For those of us in the Be Phil Orchestra, proximity to the Berlin Philharmonic was thrilling. As was the opportunity to meet colleagues whose nationalities and professions were literally and figuratively all over the map. There was Alexander, a cellist from London, an attorney; Yoram, a tympanist from Israel, an engineer; and among the other hornists, Emma from the Netherlands, active in law enforcement; Tony from Canada, a luthier with guitars his specialty; Kjartan from Iceland, a lecturer at the University of Akureyri; and Cody, an administrator at the University of South Carolina\u2019s law school.Stanley Dodds led our rehearsals for the first two days. A violinist in the Philharmonic and a conductor of formidable gifts, clarity was his keynote: clarity of musical thought, clarity of expression, clarity of technique.Mr. Rattle rehearsed us for the next two days, and the Brahms First was much on his mind. Within a week of our performance, he would conduct the same piece with his Berlin Philharmonic. Yet to our rehearsals, he brought the same energy and insights he would bring to any orchestra.Most notably, he kept urging, exhorting with words and gestures, that solo lines sing with vocal intensity, and moreover, that they be animated and infused with an operatic urgency. Brahms never composed an opera, but had he written one, its melodies might have soared like these. The performance was a kaleidoscope of pleasures: Mr. Rattle on the podium, Brahms on the music stand, 100 fellow musicians, many now friends, sharing the stage at the Philharmonie.Performing on that stage reveals a secret in the design of architect Hans Scharoun. Flanking the ensemble on either side are walls of a sort that gently taper down from the rear of the orchestra toward the front of the stage, from about 16 feet in height to eight. These structural features look like nothing architecturally and do everything acoustically. They enclose and embrace the orchestra, creating uncommon community among the musicians. You know there are 2,200 people in the audience before you, but your energies are contained in this privileged space onstage.The Be Phil performance was the capstone of a daylong open house to which the Philharmonic invited any and all. Thousands attended and sampled a fascinating smorgasbord. On the plaza in front of the hall, guests could whack away al fresco on a jumble of percussion \u2014 xylophone, gongs, chimes, and drums large and small. Inside, there were informal performances by members of the Berlin Philharmonic and friends: chamber music, ethnic music, jazz and soul.George Gelles has written on music and dance, served at the National Endowment for the Arts and at the Ford Foundation, and for 15 years was executive director of Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Fed Tweaked an Obscure Interest Rate This Week", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve has formidable powers to help steer the United States\u2019 $20 trillion economy. So when it makes even the smallest of tweaks to one of its tools, take note.But for those who want to know more, let\u2019s look at how the Fed is steering the economy.In fact, the Fed targets a range for the federal funds rate. It on Wednesday raised that range to 1.75 percent to 2 percent, from 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent.Now for a more subtle point. The interest rate on excess reservesplays a supporting role to the fed funds rate in monetary policy. Previously, the Fed set the interest rate on excess reserves at the same level as the top of the- fed funds rate. But on Wednesday the Fed said the interest rate on excess reserves would now be set 0.05 percentage point below the top of the range.As a result, the interest rate on excess reserves is now 1.95 percent.So, why would the Fed pay interest on these excess reserves? The rate was introduced to give the Fed control over the reserves. Banks can turn reserves into real money by making loans. If banks make too many loans, the economy could overheat. To guard against that, the Fed introduced the excess reserve rate. If the economy is growing too quickly, the Fed can raise the interest rate on excess reserves to persuade banks to keep money at the Fed, rather than deploying it in the economy.Right now, the Fed doesn\u2019t need to use the rate on excess reserves as an emergency brake. But the rate does play a role in the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.But recent developments in the fed funds market prompted the Fed to make its change.The government has recently been issuing a lot more debt to finance its deficit, much of it in the form of Treasury bills that are sold to investors. But to find sufficient buyers, the Treasury has had to pay higher rates on Treasury bills. This helped attract money out of the federal funds market into Treasury bills, and in turn that caused the fed funds rate to move higher and closer to the top of its range.This caught the Fed\u2019s eye. The central bank, according to analysts, wants to avoid a situation in which the fed funds rate moves above the Fed\u2019s target range. \u201cThe Fed doesn\u2019t want anyone in the market to think it\u2019s not in control of overnight rates,\u201d Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, said. \u201cIt might worry some people if it went above the upper band.\u201dImagine that the Fed still set interest rate on excess reserves at the top of the range of the fed funds rate. Banks could go and borrow overnight funds at, say, 1.95 percent and deposit them at the Fed and earn 2 percent, netting the 0.05 percentage point profit. But such trades might continue to lift the federal funds rate, set in the market, too close to the upper band for the Fed\u2019s comfort. That\u2019s because the excess funds rate would be set at the upper band of the federal funds rate.But now, with the rate on excess reserves set at 0.05 percentage point below the upper band, the banks doing that kind of arbitrage trade would have to borrow in the fed funds market at 1.9 percent to earn the same profit margin. As a result, the market may set the federal funds rate further below the upper band \u2014 which is what the Fed wants.Big challenges still lie ahead. As the Fed reduces the stockpile of bonds it acquired through its bond buying program, it takes money out of the economy, and banks\u2019 excess reserves fall. This could make it harder to keep interest rates at levels appropriate for the wider economy. While the tweak to the rate on excess reserves shows that the Fed is prepared to be flexible, it will need to remain so. \u201cThis may be step one,\u201d Jim Vogel, a fixed income strategist at FTN Financial, said.Advertisement"}

His father was a small farmer. Mr. Ince taught physics at a school before entering politics.I got to know Mr. Ince while serving as a member of parliament for the C.H.P. from Istanbul. His speeches in the parliament went viral on Turkish social media; his humor inspired caricatures and memes, skewering the opponents. In the past month of campaigning, Mr. Ince\u2019s witty and pugnacious speeches challenging Mr. Erdogan at public meetings have inspired the Turks.I recently attended a public meeting Mr. Ince was having in Duzce, a city on the Black Sea coast, which has elected Justice and Development Party candidates in every parliamentary election since Mr. Erdogan founded the party in 2002. Politicians from the secularist C.H.P. would face active hostility \u2014 even assault, once \u2014 when visiting Duzce. I was surprised to see about 5,000 people waiting to hear Mr. Ince. It was a signifier that he was not preaching to the converted.A young man I met described himself as a supporter of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party, but he was curious about Mr. Ince. He spoke about how the people of his city were losing their once-ardent faith in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party. \u201cNobody believes them any longer,\u201d he said. \u201cEven at the meetings where they distribute alms, they seal off their seating area to separate themselves from the poor.\u201dYet not voting for Mr. Erdogan and his party wasn\u2019t a choice. \u201cLast month, the imam of our village asked all of us to put our hands on the Quran and take an oath to vote for our party,\u201d the young man said. He wouldn\u2019t break his oath but came to agree with the opposition leader\u2019s message.Mr. Ince is asking the people of Turkey to choose between freedom and fear, between national prestige and national solitude, between imposition of religious practice and freedom to choose, between openness and xenophobia.In May, in a speech in the parliament, Mr. Erdogan tried to dismiss Mr. Ince as \u201ca poor person.\u201d The opposition leader responded by asking an important question: \u201cWe got the same salary at the same time. How come you became so rich and I am poor?\u201dMr. Ince provided examples of moral leadership long before he was in the fray. In the summer of 2016, the Turkish parliament approved a constitutional amendment stripping its members of immunity from prosecution. The bill was pushed by the governing A.K.P. and its ultranationalist allies to target the members from the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party.But the shift in the national mood is evident on the streets, on the usually obsequious television networks, in the tea shops across the country. For the first time in almost two decades, Mr. Erdogan no longer seems invincible. A Turkey where every citizen may live without fear finally seems possible.Safak Pavey was a member of the Turkish Parliament from the Republican People\u2019s Party from 2011 to 2017.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Was Jimmy Carter the Most Underrated President in History?", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Shortly before Ronald Reagan was inaugurated in January 1981, one of his aides drafted a memo recommending that he invite his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, for a meal at the White House. \u201cUltimately, while the American people overwhelmingly rejected President Carter,\u201d the memo said, \u201cthey continue to like Jimmy Carter personally.\u201dI found the memo during archival research recently, a reminder of a time when Carter loomed large in our national life. He was the down-home, jeans-wearing peanut farmer with the infectious grin who promised to heal the country after Watergate only to be brought down by a miserable economy and a hostage crisis that overwhelmed him. He was a populist outsider promising to make America great again long before someone else claimed that mantle. The memo got it right: Americans did reject him, but they also liked him personally.Today, most Americans are too young to remember Carter\u2019s presidency firsthand and know him more for his active post-presidency, appreciating his energetic, Nobel Prize-winning efforts to help the downtrodden, monitor elections and search for peace in the darkest corners of the planet. He has gone too far for some, particularly with his criticism of Israel. But while many in both parties consider Carter a failed president, they generally view him as a model former president.Stuart E. Eizenstat argues that it is time to re-evaluate his four years in the White House too. Carter may seem like a transitional figure between scandal-tarred Richard M. Nixon and venerated Reagan, but in \u201cPresident Carter: The White House Years,\u201d Eizenstat makes the case that the 39th president changed the course of the country for the better.\u201cHe has more than redeemed himself as an admired public figure by his post-presidential role,\u201d Eizenstat writes. \u201cNow it is time to redeem his presidency.\u201dEizenstat is no neutral arbiter. A fellow Georgian, he joined Carter\u2019s 1976 presidential campaign and became his White House domestic policy adviser. He is an unabashed admirer who in judging Carter against his presidential peers deems him \u201cone of the most consequential in modern history.\u201dIndeed, he opens with a burst of excess, contending that Carter\u2019s accomplishments outpace not just those of fellow one-term presidents like Herbert Hoover and Warren G. Harding but also the more highly regarded John F. Kennedy and George H. W. Bush. He goes further, asserting that Carter\u2019s record outshines those of two-termers like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Few historians would go so far.But for those who resist the temptation to put the book down there, what follows is not the hagiography the opening lines suggest. Instead, relying in part on more than 5,000 pages of his own contemporaneous notes and 350 interviews, including five with his former boss, Eizenstat has produced a thoughtful, measured and compelling account that bemoans Carter\u2019s weaknesses even as it extols his strengths. If readers are not convinced that Carter was the second coming of Kennedy, they will come away with a three-dimensional portrait. Coming in at nearly 900 pages, Eizenstat\u2019s book requires an investment, and it may explain more about, say, energy policy than anyone really wants to know. But overall it proves a surprisingly good read and fills a gaping void on the presidential bookshelf.While Carter himself is a prolific author and writers like Douglas Brinkley, Mark Bowden and Lawrence Wright have examined specific periods of his life, until now there has never been a satisfying full-length history of his presidency. Eizenstat closes that gap, evidently on the leading edge of a wave of new books about Carter currently being worked on by Jonathan Alter and Kai Bird.In Eizenstat\u2019s rendering, Carter was a thoroughly decent, well-intentioned idealist who tackled tough issues like energy, wrestled with economic troubles and advanced human rights, all with drive and determination. He made peace between Israel and Egypt, ratified the Panama Canal treaty and started the military buildup in response to Soviet aggression that Reagan would accelerate. Despite punishing inflation and unemployment, economic growth under Carter was nearly as high as it was under Reagan, and he added less to the national debt as a percentage than either Reagan or the two Bushes.Yet by Eizenstat\u2019s own description, Carter was also priggish and pedantic, correcting grammar in memos \u201cas if he were my elementary schoolteacher\u201d and immersing himself too deeply in details, as when he requested world oil reserve estimates in square miles instead of barrels.He stood by his unseasoned \u201cGeorgia mafia\u201d too long and should have appointed a strong chief of staff from the start. He tried to do too much at once, as even his wife, Rosalynn, warned. He had a moralistic streak, striking a congressman off a Camp David invitation list because he was living with a woman outside marriage.Overall, \u201cCarter\u2019s message was sacrifice and pain,\u201d Eizenstat writes. \u201cWhen he faced Reagan\u2019s message of hope and optimism amid soaring inflation and interest rates, the very contrast itself was painful.\u201dIndeed, his fatal flaw was captured in his infamous \u201cmalaise speech,\u201d in which Carter lectured the nation on its poor morale (although he never actually used the word that would come to define it in history). After the speech and subsequent cabinet firings, Vice President Walter F. Mondale grew so despondent that he contemplated resigning.This was reported before, in a 1997 book by a former Carter adviser, and Mondale disputed it then. Eizenstat, however, is a firsthand witness. In a phone call, Mondale told me that he was just venting and would never have followed through. \u201cI just had a spasm there but I kept right on going,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was just depressed there after that meeting.\u201d Still, a president who demoralizes his own vice president invariably has trouble inspiring a nation.The crushing finale of Carter\u2019s presidency, the 444 days when American diplomats were held hostage in Iran, demonstrated his essential humanity even as it cemented an image of fecklessness.Alone among his team, Carter had anticipated what would happen if he allowed the deposed Shah of Iran into the United States for medical treatment. \u201cWhat are you guys going to advise me to do when they overrun our embassy now and take our people hostage?\u201d he asked. Yet he granted the request anyway, triggering the rage that led to the storming of the embassy in 1979.Much like Carter\u2019s critics, Eizenstat believes the president erred by holing up in the White House consumed by the impasse while taking even the theoretical threat of military force off the table. Carter looked incapable of commanding events, and the long standoff undercut American stature.But Carter\u2019s laser focus did, at last, secure the release of the 52 hostages, at the cost of his presidency. The final indignity came when Iran barred the plane with the hostages from taking off until minutes after Reagan was inaugurated.For the following 37 years, Carter\u2019s presidency has been held hostage in a way, too \u2014 to the string of missteps, the missed opportunities and the two-dimensional image. He has Eizenstat to thank for seeking to free him from the chains of history and provide a fuller picture.Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.

But I\u2019m a long way from making any decisions about the future.\u201dThe possibility that Mr. Schultz, who has spent three decades leading Starbucks, could run for president has become far more realistic with the election of Mr. Trump, a real estate developer and reality-television star before his political career.Under Mr. Schultz\u2019s leadership, Starbucks has waded into debates over social issues such as gay rights, race relations, veterans\u2019 rights, gun violence and student debt. Mr. Schultz was an early champion of the idea of a corporate executive as a moral leader as he sought to achieve what he described as \u201cthe fragile balance between profit and conscience.\u201dStill, Mr. Schultz cautioned against reading too much into his decision to leave Starbucks. \u201cI want to be of service to our country, but that doesn\u2019t mean I need to run for public office to accomplish that,\u201d he said.He stepped away from the chief executive role at Starbucks last April, handing the reins to Kevin Johnson. It was the second time that Mr. Schultz had made that move, having given up the role in 2000 to become chairman, only to return to the chief executive position eight years later.His latest departure, however, is a greater separation than before. Myron E. Ullman, the former chairman of J. C. Penney, will become Starbucks\u2019s new chairman, and Mr. Schultz will be given an honorary title of chairman emeritus.Mr. Schultz said he planned to work on his family foundation and write a book about \u201csocial impact work and the efforts to redefine the role and responsibility of a public company.\u201dBill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, whose father was the lawyer who helped Mr. Schultz buy Starbucks in 1987, said, \u201cHoward has built an amazing organization in Starbucks, and it\u2019s exciting to consider what he might accomplish philanthropically.\u201dOn Monday, just hours before Mr. Schultz planned to send a letter to the company\u2019s 350,000 employees around the world announcing his decision, he visited Starbucks\u2019s first store at Pike Place Market for the last time as its leader.\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for almost 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking my green apron off is hard. It is emotional. More emotional than I thought it would be.\u201d\u201cI told myself a long time ago that if I was ever going to explore a second act, I couldn\u2019t do it while still at the company,\u201d he added.Mr. Schultz\u2019s legacy as an entrepreneur will be defined as much for his vision to create a global coffee chain as for his progressive approach to running the company \u2014 or, as he has often said, \u201cto build the company my father never got to work for.\u201dMr. Schultz, who grew up in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn, said watching his father, a World War II veteran who became a truck driver and later a taxi driver, struggle to make enough money to pay for basics had led him to offer complete health benefits for full- and part-time employees and their domestic partners, a first for such a chain. He later provided stock options for part-time workers and offered to cover college tuition for students enrolled in online courses at Arizona State University.\u201cHoward proved that a company could be more successful and profitable by elevating humanity,\u201d said Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments and a Starbucks director who will become vice chairwoman when Mr. Schultz steps down.Under Mr. Schultz, the company\u2019s financial success has been immense. Shares of Starbucks have risen 21,000 percent since the company\u2019s initial public offering in 1992; an investor who had put in $10,000 then would have more than $2 million today.Still, Mr. Schultz\u2019s progressive approach to management has not been without criticism. The company announced two weeks ago that it would let customers and non-customers alike use its restrooms following the incident in Philadelphia, and it was soon criticized by some as putting its store managers in increasingly complex and difficult situations that they may not be properly trained to handle.And Mr. Trump has criticized Starbucks as trying to be too politically correct, bashing the company for no longer selling Christmas-themed cups. \u201cMaybe we should boycott Starbucks?\u201d Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail.For Starbucks, Mr. Schultz\u2019s departure will most likely be seen \u2014 both internally and externally \u2014 as a new challenge. While Mr. Schultz had already handed over the chief executive title to Mr. Johnson, he largely remained the face of the company as he continued to champion the idea of Starbucks as \u201cthe third place\u201d \u2014 a meeting ground between home and work that he modeled from coffee bars in Italy after he took a trip there in 1983.Starbucks itself is transitioning in the United States from a fast-growing company to one that\u2019s more likely to rise and fall with the rest of the economy. Still, it is growing wildly in China, where it is planning to open as many as two new stores a day. It is one of the few American companies that operate in China without a local partner.Mr. Schultz, however, said his decision to leave now \u2014 even after the episode in Philadelphia \u2014 illustrated the complete confidence he had in Mr. Johnson, the company\u2019s top management and its board.\u201cThe timing was never going to be perfect,\u201d he said.At the original Pike Place Market store early Monday, with only a handful of customers looking on, Mr. Schultz leaned over to inscribe the wall next to an espresso bar he installed himself in 1987: \u201cThis is where it all began. My dream to build a company that fosters respect and dignity and create a place where we can all come together over a cup of coffee. Onward with love.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated the year that Howard Schultz said President Trump created \u201cepisodic chaos.\u201d He made the statement last year, not this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anger Flares as G-7 Heads to Quebec", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump will skip most of the second day of a summit meeting with allies this weekend, the White House said late Thursday, as he engaged in a contentious war of words over trade on the eve of a gathering that will underscore his isolation from the leaders of the world\u2019s largest economies.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, announced that Mr. Trump will leave Canada at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, well before scheduled sessions on climate change, clean energy and oceans. He will attend an early-morning session on \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment,\u201d but he will be gone before any joint statement is issued by the other leaders.Earlier Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada lashed out at Mr. Trump for imposing tariffs on their steel and aluminum industries. They called it an illegal economic assault on their countries that is unanimously opposed by the other leaders of the Group of 7 who will gather Friday in a sleepy village in Quebec for their annual summit meeting.Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference with Mr. Macron that \u201cwe are going to defend our industries and our workers\u201d and \u201cshow the U.S. president that his unacceptable actions are hurting his own citizens.\u201dMr. Trump responded with his trademark Twitter bluntness a few hours later, signaling that he has no intention of relenting on his aggressive trade demands and cares little about the diplomatic niceties that usually constrain public disagreements between the leaders of friendly nations.He added, with a hint of sarcasm: \u201cLook forward to seeing them tomorrow.\u201dMr. Trump was scheduled to arrive Friday morning at the meeting for a gathering that traditionally includes a moment of global camaraderie \u2014 the \u201cfamily photo\u201d that captures presidents and prime ministers smiling for the camera.This year, there will not be many grins.Mr. Trump is the black sheep of this family, the estranged sibling who decided to pick fights with his relatives just before arriving to dinner. The dispute, Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, acknowledges, is \u201cmuch like a family quarrel,\u201d but with the potential for vast diplomatic and economic consequences for the world.\u201cPatently absurd\u201d is what Liam Fox, the British trade minister, called them. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said they were \u201cillegal,\u201d while Mr. Trudeau said they were \u201cinsulting and totally unacceptable\u201d \u2014 and that was in the carefully worded public statement. In a phone call with Mr. Trump, he was said to be even more blunt.Before the summit meeting, finance ministers from the other six countries that form the Group of 7, or G-7, condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s trade decisions in an extraordinary rebuke of a member nation\u2019s president. And some of the leaders themselves have threatened to boycott the usual end-of-meeting communiqu\u00e9. A senior Canadian official said a statement by only Mr. Trudeau, the gathering\u2019s host, is possible.Asked about the upcoming discussions in Canada, Ms. Merkel, the famously taciturn leader of Germany, said they would be \u201cdifficult.\u201dThere have been disagreements within the G-7 in the past, including a long chill between the Europeans and President George W. Bush over the Iraq war. When President Ronald Reagan put missiles in Europe, his counterparts branded him a cowboy who would start World War III.But rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 has there been the kind of visceral and unanimous outrage at an American president among the United States\u2019 most important allies, who for decades have seen the closest of relationships with the leader of the free world as a paramount foreign policy priority.So when Mr. Trump disembarks Friday morning from Air Force One for a day and a half of closed-door meetings in the resort town of La Malbaie, the president can expect a subzero reception for what some observers have begun calling the \u201cG6+1,\u201d a reference to the political and diplomatic isolation that Mr. Trump has created for himself with his unilateral trade and security actions against his friends.Cliff Kupchan, a veteran foreign policy analyst, said he expected a \u201cvery frosty dynamic\u201d and predicted that Mr. Trump is \u201cgoing to get an earful from all of them.\u201d Dan Price, who guided Mr. Bush through many economic summit meetings, said the other six leaders should express their concerns to Mr. Trump, \u201ceven at the risk of offending a notoriously thin-skinned president.\u201dAnd Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that because of \u201creal indignation and real frustration\u201d on the part of European leaders who are extremely angry at Mr. Trump, the \u201cventing process is likely to continue\u201d throughout the meeting.The ill will among the United States\u2019 allies is a striking contrast to the praise Mr. Trump has heaped on North Korea, one of the country\u2019s most enduring adversaries, before his historic meeting next week with Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s normally reclusive leader.Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the allies is also risking a go-it-alone approach to China\u2019s trade practices, even as many trade experts have called for a unified front by Western economies to confront China. The disputes with the United States have frustrated European leaders, who are eager for a joint effort that might pressure Beijing for change. Leaders had hoped to use the meeting to help formulate a strategy to combat China\u2019s surplus steel, but they now appear more likely to focus on their own trade divisions instead.\u201cThe isolation from our G-7 allies undermines the United States\u2019 ability to work with them to confront real challenges in Russia or China or the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Price said. \u201cI certainly hope the president and his team will take the opportunity presented by the G-7 summit to find a path forward.\u201dOthers are less sanguine about that possibility.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the Iran deal was particularly infuriating to leaders in Europe, where businesses and banks had been eager to begin commercial activities in Iran with the lifting of sanctions. But because the president decided to withdraw the United States from the agreement, European businesses are likely to avoid doing business in Iran for fear of risking sanctions that could keep them out of the much more lucrative American markets.\u201cThere\u2019s no underestimating the level of anger and frustration,\u201d Mr. Dubowitz said. \u201cFor the Europeans, this is really a question of sovereignty. It\u2019s a direct challenge, in the case of Iran, to their national security.\u201dMr. Trump has sent no signals that he is willing to back off. In remarks to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Kudlow insisted that the president does not intend to be constrained by the global trading rules set up by his predecessors.\u201cThat system has been broken in the last 20 years-plus. The World Trade Organization, for example, has become completely ineffectual,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cInternational multilateral organizations are not going to determine American policy. I think the president has made that very clear.\u201dThe allies at the G-7 are unlikely to give in, either. The Canadians and the European Union have filed cases against the United States at the World Trade Organization, and they have announced retaliatory tariffs in a tit-for-tat series of economic moves that could set off an all-out trade war.French officials say Mr. Macron is likely to urge Mr. Trump to relent, arguing that Mr. Trump will damage the United States economy if he persists. Other allies are hoping that American businesses will pressure Mr. Trump to back off once the tariffs begin affecting their supply chains and profits.Clues to how the meetings in Canada have gone may be found in the body language of Mr. Trump and his counterparts as they pose for pictures before and after their sessions.Mr. Kupchan said he will be looking for the expressions on the faces of the allies: \u201cMerkel sitting next to Trump, having just talked about Iran, with a massive frown, looking the other way,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my best bet.\u201dReporting was contributed by Ana Swanson from Washington, Steven Erlanger from Brussels, Peter S. Goodman from London and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Taps the Brakes on Its Global Push for Influence", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China has spent nearly five years steering an ever-growing stream of hundreds of billions of dollars to a bold plan to gain greater global influence by funding big projects across Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.Now, Beijing is starting to tap the brakes.The value of the deals that Chinese companies are striking under the country\u2019s big global plan \u2014 called the Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 is smaller than a year ago, according to new data. Chinese officials themselves are sounding a cautious note, voicing worries that Chinese institutions need to be careful how much they lend under the program \u2014 and make sure their international borrowers can pay it back.\u201cCurrent international conditions are very uncertain, with lots of economic risks and large fluctuations for interest rates in newly emerged markets,\u201d said Hu Xiaolian, the chairwoman of the Export-Import Bank of China, a state-controlled lender that plays a big role in financing the projects, at a forum this month in Shanghai. \u201cOur enterprises and Belt and Road Initiative countries will face financing difficulties.\u201dChina has begun a broad, interagency review of how many deals have already been done, on what financial terms and with which countries, say people close to Chinese economic policymaking, who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity because the effort has not been made public.American and European officials have long worried that Belt and Road represents a diplomatic and economic power grab by Beijing, fueled by its vast government wealth and helped by the Communist Party\u2019s laserlike focus on achieving long-term goals.Under the initiative, Chinese government-controlled lenders offer big chunks of money \u2014 usually through loans or financial guarantees \u2014 to other countries to build big infrastructure projects like highways, rail lines and power plants. That money often comes with the requirement that Chinese companies be heavily involved in the planning and construction, throwing them a lot of business.This year, some Chinese officials have expressed some concerns about lending under the program.\u201cEnsuring debt sustainability \u2014 that is very important,\u201d Yi Gang, the new governor of China\u2019s central bank, said at a conference in Beijing in late April.While Belt and Road activity remains huge, it has certainly become more restrained, according to official data. In the first five months of 2018, Chinese companies signed contracts worth $36.2 billion in business, down nearly 6 percent from the same period a year ago.\u201cI sensed that the level of enthusiasm about B.R.I. had certainly shifted down a few notches relative to last year,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell economist and former head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China division who recently visited Beijing and had extensive conversations with Chinese financial policymakers.Project activity could pick up later this year, of course. But an uncertain global economic outlook has given Beijing even more reasons to be cautious.But part of the problem now is that no one \u2014 not even the Chinese government \u2014 has a comprehensive picture of the lending so far. The Finance Ministry and the state-controlled banking system have poured money into projects from the Czech Republic to Laos, and from South Africa to Kazakhstan. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission estimated this spring that Chinese banks had lent $200 billion for 2,600 projects.Various government agencies have also issued extensive export guarantees, loan guarantees and other financial arrangements as part of the initiative, although some of these overlap with the bank loans.A Belt and Road slowdown may also be natural. Official data show Chinese companies are completing projects at nearly the same pace as they are signing deals for new ones, suggesting the initiative may simply be settling into a sustainable rhythm.\u201cThey are still very actively promoting Belt and Road,\u201d said Andrew Mackenzie, the chief executive of BHP Billiton, an Australian mining giant that is among the biggest exporters of iron ore to Chinese steel mills, which are among the intended beneficiaries of Belt and Road.Still, some Chinese officials are looking more closely at where the money is ending up.For example, they have been reassessing the country\u2019s financial exposure in Africa, a continent with immense natural resources that has lured a wide range of Chinese energy and construction companies, people close to Chinese policymaking said.Belt and Road has been viewed with increasing skepticism by multilateral institutions as well. They have warned that developing countries should not incur excessive debts.\u201cThe first priority,\u201d Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said at the Beijing conference in April, \u201cis that Belt and Road only travels to where it is really needed.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Biggest Banks Pass Fed\u2019s Stress Tests", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation\u2019s biggest banks are strong enough to continue lending if the economy plunges into a severe downturn, an assessment by the Federal Reserve on Thursday that could fuel Wall Street\u2019s calls to further relax financial regulations.The results of the first phase of the Fed\u2019s annual \u201cstress tests\u201d showed that the country\u2019s banks have more than enough capital to survive the combination of a recession, cratering of housing prices and double-digit unemployment.The banks are riding high thanks to tax cuts and recent moves to soften regulations. They are eager to return more of their profits to shareholders, and the test results suggest regulators will give many the green light to pay dividends or buy their own shares next week.Still, two Wall Street giants \u2014 Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2014 came close to falling short on one of the Fed\u2019s financial-health gauges. That could complicate their plans to pay dividends and repurchase their shares.The ability of most banks to ace the tests is an indication of how far Wall Street has come since the financial crisis. A decade ago, bad bets on the housing market crippled the industry and led the government to bail out hundreds of banks.To prevent a repeat of those taxpayer-financed rescues, the Fed now requires banks to maintain capital cushions that would allow them not only to stay afloat but also to keep lending during periods of intense financial stress. Since 2009, the 35 banks that underwent the tests have added about $800 billion in the highest quality type of capital, the Fed said.The Fed\u2019s annual simulation tested 35 of the largest banks, including the United States units of several foreign firms. Under the Fed\u2019s \u201cseverely adverse scenario,\u201d which envisions the economy rapidly sinking into a recession, banks would suffer losses totaling $578 billion, but they would still have enough capital to stay above the minimum levels required by the central bank.\u201cDespite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year\u2019s test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,\u201d Randal K. Quarles, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman for supervision, said in a statement.This is the second straight year that all the big United States banks were found to have enough capital to withstand a hypothetical recession. In 2017, the banks sailed through the first round of the stress tests, and, a week later, the Fed approved all 34 banks\u2019 plans to return money to their shareholders.This time around, though, Goldman and Morgan Stanley might need to adjust those plans. Both Wall Street firms came perilously close to falling below the Fed\u2019s minimum level on a key metric, the so-called supplementary leverage ratio. It is intended to measure the ability of banks to withstand severe economic distress, and the test punishes companies for a heavy reliance on borrowed money and for exposure to assets that are not on their balance sheets.The Fed requires large banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 3 percent of their assets and certain other positions. Goldman\u2019s ratio was as low as 3.1 percent under the stress tests, while Morgan Stanley\u2019s lowest was 3.3 percent. (Under a separate measurement in the tests, Goldman had a 5.6 percent capital ratio, and Morgan Stanley\u2019s was 7.3 percent, safely above the Fed\u2019s 4.5 percent minimum.)Those low ratios mean the two banks might have to reconsider how much money they want to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Next week, the Fed will run a more consequential round of stress tests, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, in which the regulator will decide whether banks are sufficiently strong and well-managed to warrant their dividend and buyback plans.In a statement on Thursday, Goldman said its own of forecasts of how its capital levels would fare during downturns came up with different results than the Fed. The bank said it planned to discuss the divergence with the Fed ahead of next week\u2019s test.In a statement on Thursday, Goldman said it did not agree with the results of the Fed\u2019s tests and that it planned to discuss the \u201cdivergence\u201d between the bank\u2019s measurements and the Fed\u2019s ahead of next week\u2019s test.Morgan Stanley said in a statement that Thursday\u2019s results \u201cmay not be indicative of the capital distributions that we will be permitted to make.\u201dWells Fargo, which has faced a series of regulatory penalties stemming from its sales practices, was among the banks to easily clear the Fed\u2019s hurdles. Its key capital ratio was 8.6 percent, above the Fed\u2019s 4.5 percent minimum. That was the highest among the country\u2019s five largest banks, as measured by assets.Other large banks weren\u2019t far behind, with Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase showing that their capital ratios would have held above 7 percent under the Fed\u2019s worst-case economic scenario.While the results are likely to cheer bank executives and shareholders, skeptics cautioned against regulators responding to the strong performances by watering down safeguards against future crises.\u201cThis just shows that regulators\u2019 models are saying that you have O.K. capital. But guess what, regulators\u2019 models said before the financial crisis that you had O.K. capital, too,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group that pushes for tougher financial regulation. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is telling us that everything is O.K. and we don\u2019t need to be vigilant.\u201dRepublicans in Congress and regulators in the Trump administration appear open to more changes. Fed officials have stressed that they want to keep the architecture of the post-crisis regulatory regime, while improving it in particular for smaller financial institutions.Banks are in the midst of an era of extraordinary profits, fueled by the strong American economy, record low unemployment and rising interest rates, which are a key source of bank profits.The biggest banks have said the tax cuts, which slashed the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, will lower their effective tax rates considerably. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have both said the new law should reduce their tax rates next year to 19 percent, down nearly one-third from what they paid in 2016.\u201cThe banking system usually looks at its greatest health at the top of an expansion,\u201d said Kim Schoenholtz, a professor of the history of financial institutions and markets at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One-Season Wednesdays: \u2018Aliens in America\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bysummer watchingEvery Wednesday this summer, we\u2019ll be recommending a one-season show for low-commitment, high-enjoyment summer viewing. Updated weekly.\u201cAliens in America\u201d debuted on the CW in 2007, when comedies were in a weird place. That was the fall when \u201cCavemen\u201d also debuted on ABC, when \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d was still dominating the CBS comedy lineup, when \u201cEntourage\u201d was still being nominated for Emmys, when \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d was competing as a comedy. Not long, and yet very long ago. So a sitcom about a Muslim Pakistani exchange student who finds himself living with a white, nominally Christian family in Wisconsin \u2014 airing on a network that was only a year old \u2014 did not make the impression it perhaps could have.\u201cAliens\u201d aired just 18 episodes. Absolutely skip the first three, where the show is at its most expository and labored, and just know this: Justin (Dan Byrd), our narrator, is a high school dorkus whose social life is so crummy that his mother, Franny (Amy Pietz), agrees to house a foreign exchange student, Raja (Adhir Kalyan), in the hopes that Justin will make a friend and gain some social footing. It sort of works. Justin remains at the very bottom of the social ladder, but he and Raja are instantly and sweetly best friends.The show is often called a \u201cfish out of water story,\u201d but that\u2019s not quite right. There\u2019s no water, or maybe no fish: No one here is totally comfortable, and none of the characters find their environment completely suitable. Franny is frustrated by her family\u2019s indifference to her (sometimes smothering) efforts. Her husband, Gary (Scott Patterson), loses his job and, with it, his identity. Their daughter, Claire (Lindsey Shaw), thrives on the cutthroat popularity game, but she also craves more meaningful validation. Justin refers to himself as an alien, having no idea how to fit in better.So \u201cAliens\u201d is really just a family comedy. It has a lot in common with \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d or \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d right down to the not-always-necessary narration, the clear sibling roles, the contrived but deeply revered suburban rituals.Revisiting the show this week, I was struck by how darling it is, how gently it regards that floppy, scary, badly dressed, constantly stressed time of teenhood, when boys wear the ugliest sandals on earth and eat 17 cupcakes in a sitting. (I was also struck by the occasional use of the word retarded, a term that has rightly been banished since the show aired.)This ensemble cast is where \u201cKitchen Confidential\u201d really shines: John Cho, Nicholas Brendon, Jaime King, John Francis Daley and Bonnie Somerville have great chemistry and alternately squabble, flirt and get up to high jinks against the backdrop of the glitzy Manhattan restaurant scene. (One episode is focused around the star power of Lindsay Lohan\u2019s dog.)Do you ever feel like you\u2019re being gaslit by members of the underworld? Then look no further than this demon-hunting comedy on Netflix, by way of Channel 4, which offers a roadmap for women navigating personal, and actual, demons.In \u201cCrazyhead,\u201d Susan Wokoma and Cara Theobold star as Raquel and Amy, two young women in Bristol who have the ability to see the malevolent, supernatural beings who walk among us. Since this isn\u2019t a common gift, they are treated as if they were unwell, resulting in both having a justified skepticism of prescription-happy doctors and psychiatric institutions. This all helps to cement their friendship. Fast.Which is good, because the demons, who occupy Southwest England have been up to no good. It\u2019s a fast-paced romp through bowling alleys and night clubs, full of scatological, dark humor.Our picks for One-Season Wednesdays have usually been shows you might have missed a few years ago. Here, for a change, is a great show that was airing just two weeks ago, but chances are you weren\u2019t watching it. Fox\u2019s \u201cGhosted,\u201d a charming series that was part paranormal police procedural, part workplace sitcom, ended its first and, as far as we know, only season on July 22.During its short life it had an onerous distinction: It was jerked around in a classic broadcast-network fashion that we\u2019re less used to seeing in the short-season, streaming era. Fox seemed to be in the show\u2019s corner after it debuted last fall, announcing an order for an additional six episodes (bringing the total to 16). But in January it yanked the show from the schedule for six months, burning off the extra episodes this summer.The first nine weeks were an \u201cX-Files\u201d parody involving mismatched partners solving wacky-alien cases of the week. But then, Fox switched showrunners midstream \u2014 Paul Lieberstein, an \u201cOffice\u201d alumnus, replaced Kevin Etten \u2014 and \u201cGhosted\u201d ended up being two different series in a single season. The final six episodes dropped the existing plot lines for a more serialized and naturalistic comedy about office underdogs. The result is a season that is not a natural binge, but each of the two sections of the season works on its own terms, centered as they both are on the comic teamwork of Craig Robinson and Adam Scott, who play a police detective turned mall cop and a physics professor turned bookstore clerk. Recruited to a clandestine government E.T.-hunting agency, they\u2019re a low-rent Scully and Mulder with something to prove, and Robinson and Scott are equally funny in the season\u2019s more raucous first half and its more melancholy second.Remember that time that Baz Luhrmann, the Australian filmmaker famed for his indulgence of dizzying pastiche in \u201cRomeo + Juliet\u201d and \u201cMoulin Rouge,\u201d decided to create a series about the last days of disco, the birth of hip-hop and political corruption in the Bronx? No, it was not the stuff mad libs are made of. It was Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d a musical extravaganza set during the late \u201970s, which has an impressive ensemble of reliable character actors and vibrant newcomers \u2014 and a sick soundtrack.At the center of this delightful pop opera are two young dreamers: Mylene (Herizen F. Guardiola), a pastor\u2019s daughter torn between abiding by her strict religious upbringing and becoming the next Donna Summer, and Ezekiel (Justice Smith), a smart poet who aspires to escape the Bronx. Guardiola and Smith make a convincing pair as high school kids in love, evoking all the awkwardness and uncertainty of their age. They play against a backdrop of story lines touching on race, class and religion (for starters) with a sensory overload of elaborate production numbers, cultural references (Star Wars, kung fu, Grandmaster Flash) and wildly alternating cinematic styles.I\u2019ll admit my bias up front: I love John Cho. I think he is a fine actor who is also quite charming and extremely good looking! I would watch anything that cast him as a romantic lead. And that is pretty much exclusively the short-lived 2014 ABC sitcom \u201cSelfie.\u201d\u201cSelfie\u201d is ostensibly a \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d update set in the offices of a children\u2019s pharmaceutical company. Cho plays Henry Higgs, a stuffy marketing guru tasked with rebranding Karen Gillan\u2019s Eliza Dooley, a social-media famous sales rep who can\u2019t socialize in real life. The premise is silly, and the internet references were stale even four years ago. But the show\u2019s charms reveal themselves as the relationship between the leads transcends those priors.\u201cSelfie\u201d is about the acts we put on to distance ourselves from one another, online and off, but once the show allows Cho and Gillan to get close, they spark. Things really get going around Episode 6, in which Eliza and Henry touch, in a sexy way, for the first time, then recoil back into their defensive poses. At which point: ABC promptly canceled the show. But on Hulu, you can watch the remainder of the first truncated season and marinate in their will-they-or-won\u2019t-they thing for a full 13 episodes.This show might also have been too weird. It transported the biblical story of David to a world that looked a lot like America in 2009, but it was accented with motifs found in dystopian futuristic fantasies, such as a \u201cHunger Games\u201d-like decadence in the capital city. Beyond that, it was vaguely religious, with frequent, jarring mentions of God and sincere invocations of divine right.Yet it\u2019s utterly binge-worthy, and perfect summer-watching fun.After all, what operatic plot isn\u2019t? There\u2019s palace intrigue, young love, closeted homosexuality, illegitimate children, war, assassination \u2014 the list goes on, much of it absurd, such as a kaleidoscope of monarch butterflies that land on David\u2019s head like a crown. (Get it?) Prepare yourself, though: This show was canceled before the writers could achieve much resolution. For the nearly 10 years since the season finale, I\u2019ve been wondering what happened to David, who was hapless yet destined for great things.It\u2019s been a joy to revisit \u201cKings\u201d recently, not only for the delicious plot but also for the fun of trying to figure out its filming locations, like watching a Nora Ephron or Woody Allen movie. The series takes place in a city called Shiloh, but it\u2019s clearly just New York with the Empire State Building edited out and a few glossy skyscrapers added in.Filled with irreverent jokes fired like fastballs, the 13 episodes of this Fox comedy are a breeze to binge and are smartly satisfying, even as they leave a bitter aftertaste. \u201cAction\u201d debuted in 1999, placing it a few years (and a few bleeps) too ahead of its time to last longer than a single season on broadcast TV. But the audacity of its satire, which skewered the very Hollywood industry that created it, is still surprising, even now.Jay Mohr stars as Peter Dragon, a Hollywood movie producer who is reeling from an action-movie flop and in desperate need of a hit. That means the frequent demeaning of others and himself as he fights to stay on top: He\u2019s queasily lecherous, he\u2019s conniving, and he\u2019s perfectly willing to throw a colleague to the wolves in order to make a deal.Later in the week, Kate, who feels like a \u201cweird Craigslist roommate\u201d living with Pete and his three children from two previous marriages, tells Pete she wants more parental responsibilities. So he offers her a herculean task: putting Bert to sleep.\u201cTrophy Wife\u201d is full of arcs like this: good, clean comedy in the style of \u201cModern Family,\u201d with humor that ranges from silly to absurd. Most of the main plot lines center on Kate\u2019s struggle to define her role in a family that includes the precocious and cheeky Bert (\u201cI get a horndog?\u201d he exclaims when his parents buy him a puppy, having overheard a word he shouldn\u2019t), as well as two teenagers and two ex-wives: Diane Buckley (Marcia Gay Harden), a no-nonsense surgeon with an unmatched talent for beer pong, and Jackie Fisher (Michaela Watkins), an obsessive yoga-meditation-reiki-farmers\u2019-market lover with no interest in boundaries.Here is what you can expect from the first five minutes of \u201cSwingtown,\u201d a one-season fantasy that opens in July 1976. With \u201cYour Love Is Lifting Me Higher\u201d as the backing track, you get: a simulated simulated sex act; a simulated actual sex act; the sentence \u201cMy wife is going to love you\u201d; Grant Show, bred in a lab for just this role, sporting a pornstache and a white tank top; a large can of Tab with a soft aluminum pull; a threesome; Lana Parrilla; the sentence \u201cI feel like I\u2019m ready for the next thing.\u201dThe episode goes on to include: a Harvey Wallbanger; a glass of Chablis; the line dance where you roll your hands; polyester halter dresses; the phrase \u201cWe missed the whole Woodstock counterculture thing\u201d; the response \u201cThe train is still boarding\u201d; cocaine being done with $100 bill; cocaine being rubbed on the gums; sunglasses that start dark but fade toward the bottom; quaaludes; hair so feathered that it might take off at the next breeze; did I mention the basement orgy?But for all its flamboyance and audacity, \u201cSwingtown\u201d does a good job of exploring a generation of people who aren\u2019t quite sure why they fell for the traditional value of marriage, which (like swinging, to me at least), seems like more trouble than it\u2019s worth. It\u2019s a meditation on conservatism, risk, values, fidelity and aging. And swinging.Why did it have to die? Why was it pulled away from us too soon? Why was it gone before it could answer the question of whether people who have key parties bought the fishbowl just for the key party or if there was a dead fish in its past? \u201cSwingtown\u201d was a midseason replacement in the summer of 2008. Entities like the American Family Association and Parents Television Council wrote strongly worded letters to CBS to try to get a boycott going. Man, I miss those swingers. There were cliffhangers in the season finale that I still think about. Mostly I\u2019m grateful for \u201cSwingtown\u201d because it allows me to continue to participate in my fantasy that I think we all share about swingers, which is that all they think about is swinging \u2014 that it consumes their every day, that their lives are built around it.I\u2019m pretty sure the denizens of \u201cSwingtown\u201d would agree with me when I say that I don\u2019t think guilty pleasures exist. Pleasure exists \u2014 I know they\u2019d agree with me about that. But I beg you, do not feel guilty about the pleasure that \u201cSwingtown\u201d can bring you over the course of its 13 delicious hours. Like its predecessor and successor, this 2012-13 ABC Family (R.I.P.) series is a show about starting over. Here, it\u2019s Michelle (the Broadway veteran Sutton Foster) going through upheaval. A classically trained ballerina stranded in a Vegas chorus line, she winds up \u2014 through a first-episode twist I won\u2019t spoil \u2014 alone and jobless in the small town of Paradise, Calif., teaching dance.In some surface ways, \u201cBunheads\u201d plays like a \u201cGilmore\u201d revival. Paradise is more or less Stars Hollow but warmer (meteorologically and culturally). The cast includes Kelly Bishop as Fanny Flowers, the imperious dance teacher who takes Michelle on; other familiar \u201cGilmore\u201d faces include Liza Weil and Sean Gunn in a cameo as a haughty barista. (Also a recurring favorite from \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d: coffee.) But the true secret weapons of \u201cBunheads\u201d are the four teenage students whom Michelle and Fanny mentor, whose show the series gradually becomes. Artistic aspiration and teen coming-of-age are two bittersweet tastes that taste great together, each with its own flavor profile of longing, rejection and fumbling toward identity. This German series (with English subtitles) clocks in at only eight episodes, and it\u2019s too intense to binge; don\u2019t watch more than two at a time unless you want to feel extremely trashola about everything. That\u2019s not to say the show is wall-to-wall violence \u2014 it\u2019s not, and there are poppy, fun moments, and sweet and silly ones. But a lot of brutality and sorrow, too. The show is, as you might expect, set in a divided Germany in 1983. Martin (Jonas Nay) is a young East German soldier with the odd luck of looking a lot like a West German soldier named Moritz, who is preparing to become an aide to a powerful general. East German forces kill Moritz, and Martin is recruited to pose as him in West Berlin, thus collecting all kinds of valuable intelligence.Unlike the spies in most stories, Martin is largely mediocre. In one memorable training montage, he can barely learn how to hand off small parcels discreetly. He\u2019s also utterly taken with the food and music and culture of West Berlin. But he\u2019s not there for shenanigans, and his responsibilities to his country, his family and himself sometimes pull him in opposing directions. This is further complicated by the fact that his aunt is one of his Stasi bosses.In \u201cCrashing,\u201d Waller-Bridge plays Lulu, a luminous troublemaker who moves into the hospital to follow her old friend Anthony, who lives there with his uptight fianc\u00e9e, Kate. This of course creates tension. There\u2019s also the moody French artist Melody, the sex-crazed and often offensive Sam, and the lovable, anxious Fred.Lulu sees herself as cool and whimsical, but she\u2019s really just callous and irresponsible. When she shows up with her ukulele in tow, strumming improvised songs, Kate is immediately a little put off. \u201cWow, quirky!\u201d she says. \u201cThanks, I try really hard,\u201d Lulu jokes. Well, sort of jokes. Lulu is the quintessence of the kind of woman other women see as artificial but men see as charming, and Waller-Bridge devilishly plays with these types and conventions in interesting but still empathetic ways.There\u2019s an abundance of love and romance and sex on \u201cCrashing,\u201d much of it completely charming. There\u2019s also genuine friction among the characters, along with struggles to set healthy boundaries and to be decent people.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Upends Global Trade Order Built by U.S.", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 At the rockiest annual meeting of major Western powers in decades, President Trump criticized the tariffs imposed on American goods as \u201cridiculous and unacceptable\u201d and vowed to put an end to being \u201clike a piggy bank that everybody is robbing.\u201dBehind Mr. Trump\u2019s outrage is his belief that the United States is at a disadvantage when it comes to global trade and is on the losing end of tariffs imposed by other nations. But to many of the country\u2019s trading partners, the president\u2019s criticisms ring hollow given that the United States places its own tariffs on everything from trucks and peanuts to sugar and stilettos.\u201cWhile the system has problems, it is in no way \u2018unfair,\u2019 to the U.S., which as a hegemon has set the rules and the exceptions to the rules,\u201d said Susan Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University\u2019s Elliott School of International Affairs.The United States has long been the biggest champion of global trade, viewing the opening of borders as essential to strengthening not only its economy but the global economy as well. It led the way in building the international trading order in the 20th century, rising to become the world\u2019s predominant economy. Tariffs were used as a way to offer protection for certain industries, but free trade was considered the tide that would lift all boats because all countries involved would benefit.Instead of viewing trade as a mutually beneficial relationship, the president has described trading relationships as a zero-sum game, in which the United States loses out when other countries have more favorable terms. Mr. Trump has seized on trade policy to prop up industries that he has promised to revitalize, such as manufacturing, by limiting foreign competition.Many of the United States\u2019 tariffs were put in place to protect influential industries that lobbied the government to set high barriers to foreign products, including a 25 percent tariff on sugar and foreign trucks, and a 163 percent tariff on imported peanuts.Mr. Trump has singled out specific products where American producers face barriers, like Canada\u2019s 270 percent tariff on imported milk and Europe\u2019s 10 percent tariffs on American cars. On Saturday night, as Mr. Trump left the Group of 7 summit meeting en route to Singapore for a meeting with North Korea, he lashed out at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada once again for his country\u2019s dairy tariffs and for his criticisms of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade measures.\u201cVery dishonest & weak,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet aboard Air Force One. \u201cOur Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!\u201dBut on average, American tariffs are on par with those of other rich, developed countries, which tend to be low, according to the World Bank and the United Nations.So far this year, Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs on nearly $60 billion of steel, aluminum, solar products and washing machines that flow into the United States from around the world.He is threatening additional tariffs on foreign goods that would expand his trade penalties significantly, including a tariff on $350 billion of imported automobiles and parts and levies on $150 billion worth of Chinese goods, on the assumption those will force trading partners to drop their own barriers to entry.The approach risks upending the United States\u2019 longstanding embrace of free trade and its use of trading relationships to help power economic growth in the United States and the world economy writ large.Since the Second World War, the United States has cut its tariff rates in step with other developed countries. It also gave some less-developed countries access to its markets, with the idea of increasing wages and improving quality of life.Mr. Trump appears ready to change that equation and increasingly views every country as a threat, regardless of its economic strength.Critics fear Mr. Trump\u2019s approach will hurt developing nations and result in an escalating series of tariffs that raise costs for American consumers and industries, potentially harming the very manufacturers Mr. Trump says his trade policy is intended to protect.\u201cTrump\u2019s bull in a china shop act is clearly grating on other trading partners, who now see the U.S. as a recalcitrant and unruly member of the global trading system rather than as a responsible steward,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University. He said allies\u2019 tolerance had waned to a point \u201cwhere they are more likely to retaliate and escalate trade disputes rather than give in to U.S. demands.\u201dThe president has reserved his harshest criticisms for Canada \u2014 the largest destination for American exports, and one of the United States\u2019 most open trading relationships under the terms of the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.The president and his supporters argue that the United States must be willing to take drastic action to fulfill Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to rewrite trade agreements to protect American workers \u2014 a vow that found favor with many American workers and helped fuel his rise to the White House.\u201cThe global trading system needs major surgery and every country must be part of the solution, even our friends,\u201d said Daniel DiMicco, a former trade adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and current chairman of the Coalition for a Prosperous America trade group.Still, it is unclear whether Mr. Trump\u2019s approach will convince trading partners to make the concessions he wants.But the world\u2019s major powers have so far responded to the president\u2019s criticisms by toughening their resolve. Indeed, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said Sunday that Europe would enact countermeasures against the United States tariffs on steel and aluminum.\"When you go up and slap someone in the face, they\u2019re not going to say, \u2018Please sir, can I have another?\u2019\u201d said Philip Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.At a news conference on Saturday, Mr. Trump said his ultimate goal was eliminating all trade duties and subsidies. But in his short tenure in office, he has scrapped potential agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership with Japan and Canada and a sweeping trade pact with Europe that would have slashed the tariffs he is now criticizing.The United States has just one trade agreement with the countries of the G-7 \u2014 Nafta, which includes Canada. The remaining countries of the group have recently inked multiple deals among themselves that have left American exporters at a disadvantage in their markets.In the last year, a trade agreement between Canada and the European Union went into force, and remaining countries of the Trans-Pacific Partnership signed a trade pact, as did the European Union and Japan.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have criticized these as bad deals, and argued that his \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy did not mean \u201cAmerica alone.\u201d But with the world\u2019s other leading economies moving ahead with trade pacts and united against Mr. Trump\u2019s trade approach, the United States certainly appears to be at odds with many of its former partners.\u201cThe president\u2019s principal objection to multilateralism seems to be that he doesn\u2019t want other countries united against him,\u201d said Mr. Levy. \u201cNow, look at what he\u2019s done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marc Benioff of Salesforce: \u2018Are We Not All Connected?\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bycorner officeA billionaire tech mogul with a spiritual side, Mr. Benioff riffs on his early days at Apple and Oracle, and what\u2019s wrong with Facebook. Salesforce may not be a household name like Facebook or Twitter, but the software company and its chief executive, Marc Benioff, are hugely influential forces in the technology industry. Salesforce is a cloud computing pioneer that helped popularize the software-as-a-service business model. And Mr. Benioff has fashioned himself as a benevolent chieftain who can make the world a better place while making hefty profits, too. An entrepreneur at an early age, Mr. Benioff became a star executive at Oracle before leaving to co-found Salesforce nearly 20 years ago. Today, Salesforce is worth roughly $100 billion, and Mr. Benioff is a billionaire many times over. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Salesforce headquarters in San Francisco.What was your childhood like? Do you want me to lie down? Yeah. Close your eyes and count backward from 100.O.K., great. I\u2019m happy to. I was born an entrepreneur. When I was about 12 years old, I would go around to people\u2019s homes and repair their antennas and their CB radios. Then I got a regular job at a jewelry store, cleaning the cases after school, which I did not really enjoy. But across the street there was a Radio Shack and that\u2019s where I found a computer for the first time. I wrote my first piece of software, and sold it when I was about 15 years old.In 1984, you interned at Apple. What was that like? I was at the University of Southern California, putting myself through school with royalties of my software company. And I was writing a bunch of adventure games for the Atari 800, the Apple II, the Commodore 64. Then when the Macintosh was introduced in 1984, I sold my other computers and bought the Macintoshes.The summer before my junior year, I worked for Apple. There was a pirate flag on the roof. There was a motorcycle in the lobby. Steve Jobs was running between the two Macintosh buildings. It was a big scene.What did you do there? No one was really paying attention exactly to what I was doing. I wrote this piece of software which was a game called \u201cRaid on Armonk,\u201d which was where IBM\u2019s headquarters were at the time. And my manager said to me, \u201cNo, no. You cannot do this.\u201dWhat did you do after college? I wrote a business plan for a network-type company based on something that Apple was working on called AppleLink. But U.S.C. was like, \u201cNo, no. You\u2019re not going to create a company when you graduate from school. We want you to go get a real job in a real company, and we want you to go into sales.\u201d So I asked around, and this person who I was working with at Apple mentioned this company called Oracle.What did you learn while you were at Oracle? Then Larry [Ellison, Oracle\u2019s co-founder] took notice of me, and I started working directly for him. That was a very powerful moment, when he started to shape how I thought about business. Larry took the long view. He was like, \u201cI want to think about this company over 50 years, not over 10 years or five years.\u201d Now he\u2019s been doing it for 40 years.Why did you strike out on your own? As I came into my 10th year at Oracle, I was really burning out, but I couldn\u2019t exactly figure out why. I didn\u2019t have a good feeling when I went in the building. I went into Larry\u2019s office and said, \u201cI need to take some time off.\u201d And right away he said, \u201cYeah, why don\u2019t you just take a sabbatical. You\u2019ve worked really hard for 10 years.\u201dFirst I went to Hawaii for a few months and really, really worked on my meditation practice. Then I went to India for six weeks with a friend of mine who was also going through a similar life transformation. We had these amazing experiences going to all of these different ashrams and meeting all these different spiritual masters. It was almost like a guru tour. I definitely came back from that trip as a different person. How so? I came back with a clear vision of what the future of the internet was going to be in regards to software-as-a-service and cloud computing. I also had a much deeper sense of my spiritual self. So I said, \u201cWhen I start a company, I will integrate culture with service.\u201d When I started Salesforce, on March 8, 1999, I said we\u2019re going to put one percent of our equity, product and time into a foundation and create a culture of service within our company. We\u2019ll be creating new technology, the cloud; we\u2019ll be creating a new business model, subscription services; and we\u2019ll create a culture built on philanthropy.How do you make sure new Salesforce employees get what the company\u2019s all about?On their first day of work, we take everyone and we show them the kitchen and the bathroom and their office and their desk. Then we take them out and they do service in the afternoon. They\u2019ll go to a homeless shelter or they\u2019ll go to the hospital or go to a public school. This is a very core part of our culture.I want a company where people are excited to come to work every day, where they feel good when they get here, where it doesn\u2019t take from them, but it\u2019s giving to them, it\u2019s giving to others. Why do people want to be here? It\u2019s not that we have more amenities than everybody else. We have less. We don\u2019t have a cafeteria. But we have a stronger purpose and a stronger mission. A reader, Ellen McBarnette, asks, \u201cDo public companies have a responsibility to contribute to the public good?\u201dThere\u2019s a shift going on. When I went to U.S.C., it was all about maximizing value for shareholders. But we\u2019re moving into a world of stakeholders. It\u2019s not just about shareholders. Your employees are stakeholders, so are your customers, your partners, the communities that you\u2019re in, the homeless that are nearby, your public schools. A company like ours can\u2019t be successful in an unsuccessful economy or in an unsuccessful environment or where the school system doesn\u2019t work. We have to take responsibility for all of those things. This idea that somebody put into our heads \u2014 that companies are somehow these kind of individuated units that are separate from society and don\u2019t have to be paying attention to the communities they\u2019re in \u2014 that is incorrect. We need to have a more enlightened view about the role of companies. This company is not somehow separate from everything else. Are we not all connected? Are we not all one? Isn\u2019t that the point?So what is Salesforce doing about it? Salesforce is the biggest tech company in San Francisco. We can unleash a power onto this city. All of these people can go into the public schools and volunteer, and they can work and make the city better. They can improve the state of the city, improve the state of the world. All I have to do is give them permission to do that.You\u2019ve been outspoken on issues like L.G.B.T.Q. rights and tougher gun laws. What issues are you focused on right now? We\u2019re working on the homeless programs here. We have a plan to get every homeless family off the streets within five years.That\u2019s a pretty ambitious goal. Are you setting yourself up for failure? We\u2019ve already moved hundreds of families back into society and into homes. But we cannot delegate these complex problems off to the government and say, \u201cWe\u2019re not all part of it.\u201d They\u2019re part of the solution, but I believe that for $150 million, we can get every homeless person in San Francisco into homes.Now when I say every single person, I actually don\u2019t believe it. There are some people in San Francisco who are intentionally homeless. They just want to be homeless. San Francisco is kind of the Four Seasons of homelessness. They all say this is the best place in the world to be homeless.His memo is very clear. He talks about putting growth above trust, and you can\u2019t do that. Never put growth before trust. If you put growth above trust, then all of a sudden you create a toxic culture. People don\u2019t want to work in that environment or use the product. Then you get these campaigns, #deleteuber, #deletefacebook. It\u2019s a referendum on the culture, not the product.Has your meditation practice influenced how you lead? Having a beginner\u2019s mind informs my management style. I\u2019m trying to listen deeply, and the beginner\u2019s mind is informing me to step back, so that I can create what wants to be, not what was. I know that the future does not equal the past. I know that I have to be here in the moment. Advertisement"}

Tell us a little about that history.I joined The Times when I was 28 years old, in December 1979. I spent less than two years in New York, and then a decade as a foreign correspondent, based in Tokyo, Manila and London. Then, I did a couple of years in two editing stints, before I was able to get back to being a reporter.How has using technology to report for The Times changed for you over the years?When I started at The Times, nothing was online. To research a story, you started by going to the \u201cmorgue,\u201d a large room where people cut out old stories and placed them in row after row of file drawers, grouped by subject.The files weren\u2019t just Times articles. They often included pieces from The New Yorker, Life, Esquire, New York and elsewhere.Personal computers were hobbyist curiosities, not yet used in newsrooms. We wrote on terminals linked to a central computer. The terminals were shared, two for every four reporters. Sometimes, that created problems.The most territorial reporters took a squatter\u2019s rights approach \u2014 get on a terminal and camp out, no matter how distant their deadline. Rather than fight, I managed to get a password for signing onto any terminal in the building. So I\u2019d just find an open terminal in some other part of the newsroom. But that meant you were away from your phone. No cellphones then.When I went to Tokyo, it was back to a typewriter and a small Underwood portable, which was the laptop of its day. We wrote stories, 200 words on a page, and hand-delivered them to the Reuters office across town, to be cabled to New York. Later, we moved to small word-processing computers \u2014 Tandy 100s and then Tandy 200s, with phone couplers for the modem connections. In some places, the phone service wasn\u2019t good enough to transmit by modem. Then, you\u2019d just call in your story and dictate it to the Times phone room.Then came the internet era. How did that change how you report?The internet, put simply, is a low-cost communications network. Everything else, like the web, builds on top of that. And having so much information online can be a gold mine for reporting. In my case, I report on technology and economics these days.Silicon Valley is a caldron of innovation. But all the big issues surrounding technology\u2019s impact on the world \u2014 like automation, economic opportunity and income disparity \u2014 are playing out outside the tech hubs, across the $20 trillion American economy. Tons of research is being done on those subjects, and it\u2019s all online \u2014 working papers from the National Bureau of Economic Research and the Social Science Research Network, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and scientific studies.What it means is you can test your assumptions for any trend or explanatory story. Is the lively anecdote you just came across an outlier, or representative of a broader phenomenon? Early in reporting a subject, you can get an answer to the question: What story do the numbers tell you? That is a powerful tool that applies to most fields today, including journalism.Outside of work, what tech products are you currently obsessed with?I live in an apartment with more than 4,000 books, and yet I\u2019ve also become a huge Kindle fan. It\u2019s just so convenient, a library in a lightweight tablet. For big books, like William Taubman\u2019s biography of Mikhail Gorbachev, published last year, I\u2019ll sometimes buy both the hardcover and the digital versions. Each has its advantages.Advertisement"}

But the Kochs have increasingly found themselves at odds with the president, and sometimes with Republican leaders in Congress, on other issues including trade and immigration.\u201cThe Trump administration has taken some incredibly positive steps for the American economy, but tariffs will undercut that progress and needlessly hamstring our full economic potential,\u201d Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, said in announcing the advertising campaign.James Davis, the executive vice president of Freedom Partners, said the campaign was \u201ca demonstration of our long-term commitment to advance common-sense trade policies that will ensure America\u2019s brightest days are ahead, and to directly confront the protectionist ideas that would hold us back.\u201dAlong with pressing the administration to drop its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and on Chinese goods, the group is calling on Mr. Trump to work on \u201cmodernizing\u201d the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada and to re-engage in negotiations toward joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership alongside 11 Pacific Rim nations.A survey conducted in early May for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey found that 78 percent of Republicans approved of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.

He claimed that the government saved $1.6 billion on Air Force One after he got involved in negotiations. The Post reported, \u201cMilitary officials have not been able to explain where Trump got such a figure.\u201dOne subject Trump did not get around to, according to The Post, were the victims of Hurricane Maria, even though Puerto Ricans are facing a new hurricane season well before they\u2019ve recovered from the last one. He apparently hardly spoke about Puerto Rico at all, though he did mention that its power company was \u201cin bankruptcy prior to the hurricane,\u201d as if that exonerates his administration\u2019s performance in the territory.Whether the real death toll is 1,000, 4,600, or more, it took Trump less than a year in office to stumble into his own version of Katrina, the deadly Gulf Coast hurricane whose botched response came to symbolize George W. Bush\u2019s incompetence.There are lots of reasons that Hurricane Maria hasn\u2019t had the same political impact as Katrina \u2014 Puerto Rico is far away from the mainland, its residents can\u2019t vote in federal elections, and the punishing churn of today\u2019s news cycle makes it hard to focus on a single catastrophe for too long. But Trump\u2019s failure in Puerto Rico is representative of his presidency, and it is a portent.We\u2019ve been at once lucky and unlucky.

The longer it takes, the more he\u2019ll be able to consolidate power and exploit his position for private gain. America has become like one of Trump\u2019s casinos, surface glitz hiding corruption and rot that Trump will ultimately make others pay for.Experts acknowledge that Hurricane Maria would have challenged any president. \u201cThe basic model for a FEMA response is that the state and local authorities lead, and FEMA comes in to support their recovery effort,\u201d Jeremy Konyndyk, who headed U.S.A.I.D.\u2019s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance under Barack Obama, told me. In Puerto Rico, where the whole island had been devastated, that was impossible.But it\u2019s precisely because FEMA isn\u2019t set up to handle situations like Puerto Rico that we needed a capable president. \u201cWhen a government agency needs to do something it is not designed to do, it takes a lot of very disciplined, rigorous White House leadership\u201d to make it happen, Konyndyk said.Puerto Ricans have been the first American citizens to really feel what it means to have a president who is so wildly unable to fulfill his responsibilities. It\u2019s hard to imagine they\u2019ll be the last.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a slap in the Canadians\u2019 face,\u201d said Walter Thomas, who poured molten steel at Stelco, one of the two major producers in Canada\u2019s steel-making epicenter of Hamilton in Ontario, before taking early retirement 13 years ago. \u201cNo Canadian wants what Trump is doing. And if gets away with this, what else is he going to ask for? He\u2019s like a little bully; that\u2019s all he is.\u201dMr. Thomas was part of a small dinnertime crowd on Thursday at the bar and restaurant that has long served steel workers. Sue Sinden, another patron at a table with her sister and two friends, was no more a fan of the president or his action against Canada than Mr. Thomas.\u201cTo say that we\u2019re a national security risk for them, I think that\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Ms. Sinden, who once worked at an appliance factory that has since moved to Mexico and whose husband is retired from Dofasco, now part of ArcelorMittal, the other local steel giant.\u201cI think of all the jobs that we\u2019re going to lose here and the same thing is going to happen down in the states,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s already alienated all of Europe. Who\u2019s going to stand up with him? Who\u2019s going to support the states anymore?\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Trump renewed his attack on Canadian trade policies.\u201cCanada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in an apparent reference to Canadian policies that effectively exclude or severely limit imports of dairy, poultry and some pork products.Unlike some other industrial communities in Canada, the city of Hamilton with just under 750,000 people has been unusually successful at diversifying its economy as automation and changes in the steel industry steadily eroded its employment base.Nevertheless, Fred Eisenberger, the mayor, estimates that about 9,000 people work in steel-making in the city. Another large group of local residents commute to Ford, Toyota and General Motors auto assembly plants in nearby communities that may face disruptions because of the tariffs \u2014 both Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Trudeau\u2019s.\u201cNo one\u2019s dismissing this as trivial by any stretch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our losses in that whole free trade arrangement for sure. Obviously, the current president doesn\u2019t agree and is looking to rejig the economy in favor of the United States. I\u2019m not sure this is going to work.\u201dMr. Trudeau\u2019s decision on Thursday to hit back immediately with tariffs is a break with Canada\u2019s approach to trade disputes for decades. In the past, the government would have first waited for Mr. Trump\u2019s measures to be declared illegal under the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, and World Trade Organization rules \u2014 a lengthy process \u2014 and then fired back.The Canadian tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on everything else on its list will cover 16.6 billion Canadian dollars ($12.8 billion) worth of American goods \u2014 equal to the value of Canadian steel and aluminum exports to the United States last year.Also on the list is fresh orange juice. It mostly comes from Florida, a state the president won narrowly in 2016.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s list does not go into effect until July 1, suggesting that it may be mainly about getting Mr. Trump to back down on his measures.Some people in Canada want their government go further. Since first announcing the steel and aluminum tariffs back in March, Mr. Trump has tied them to reaching a quick agreement at talks on Nafta.Jean Simard, the president of the Montreal-based Aluminum Association of Canada, said Canada should pull out of those negotiations until Mr. Trump backs off on his tariffs.\u201cWe\u2019re just a piece in a larger chess game,\u201d Mr. Simard said of his industry\u2019s current situation. \u201cThe Canadian government has always been very clear that we will not negotiate with a knife to our throat.\u201dFor Hamilton, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs are particularly ill-timed. Stelco is just getting back on its feet under a new American owner. That follows a tumultuous nine years as part of U.S. Steel marked by layoffs and shutdowns, including an end to steel and iron making in Hamilton. The company still has coke ovens and finishing plants in the city as well as a large steel mill in nearby Nanticoke, Ontario.Even in its current diminished form, the scale of Hamilton\u2019s industrial district remains impressive. At the same time, the shabbiness of many of its adjacent residential areas is a stark contrast to parts of the city high on the Niagara Escarpment, or \u201cthe mountain\u201d as it\u2019s known locally, which are among Canada\u2019s most affluent.Matthew Green, the city councilor for the industrial area, has undisguised passion for the neighborhood and its history. It seems to be reciprocated.When he walked into the Galley Pump Tavern, he was immediately recognized by a trio of stevedores who clearly had been spending considerable time toasting the summer weather on its rudimentary outdoor patio. One woman, seeing Mr. Green on the street, honked her horn and offered a fist salute as she drove past.Mr. Green, the city\u2019s first black council member, has said that three decades of free trade with the United States have been responsible for factory closings and exodus of jobs to the United States, particularly in his city.\u201cWith Nafta, a lot of our jobs got sent down south and with them went the prosperity of our neighborhood, so we got hit pretty bad,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cSo first they came for our jobs with free trade. And now with this tariff announcement it\u2019s like they\u2019re coming for our factories.\u201dFollow Ian Austen on Twitter: @ianraustenCatherine Porter contributed reporting from Toronto.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Reaches $50 Billion Financing Deal With I.M.F.", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentina reached a three-year deal with the International Monetary Fund on Thursday for a $50 billion credit line, an amount that was larger than expected, which the government promoted as a vote of confidence on its market-friendly reforms.The deal, known as a standby agreement, places requirements for cuts in the country\u2019s fiscal deficit that were sharper than initially planned. It also requires decreases in the inflation rate, which has long been one of the key challenges for the government. It is subject to approval by the I.M.F. board.The agreement \u201creflects support from the international community to Argentina and is very good news,\u201d the country\u2019s treasury minister, Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne, said. \u201cWe are very, very happy because it will allow us to go down the path of fiscal balance.\u201dMr. Dujovne specified that 30 percent of the total, or around $15 billion, would be available to Argentina shortly after approval by the I.M.F. board, expected on June 20. \u201cWe will try to maintain the rest of the funds as precautionary,\u201d he said.Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, took office in December 2015 with a goal of opening the country to international markets and wooing foreign investors after more than a decade of economic isolation.As part of the agreement with the I.M.F., Argentina committed to reducing its primary budget deficit at a faster clip than initially planned.The agreement also increases the independence of the central bank and establishes a clear path to reduce inflation to 9 percent in 2021 from 17 percent in 2019. Analysts expect inflation this year to be around 25 percent.\u201cThis is a pretty credible goal,\u201d said Gabriel Zelpo, the chief economist at Elypsis, a research and consulting company. \u201cIt isn\u2019t far from what the market was expecting and marks a change for a government that had fallen into a pattern of ambitious targets that it couldn\u2019t fulfill.\u201dIn what was likely a nod to the negative opinion that the Argentine public has of the fund, Mr. Dujovne took pains to emphasize that the agreement included \u201cinnovative\u201d measures to protect the most vulnerable members of society. That includes a provision to increase welfare spending if economic indicators worsen.Economic analysts say that the agreement is likely to lead to short-term economic pain, but that it could lay the groundwork for positive numbers.\u201cFiscal austerity will lead to lower growth, particularly next year,\u201d said Mat\u00edas Carugati, chief economist at Management & Fit, a consulting firm in Buenos Aires. \u201cBut it could be positive in the medium term. If, as a result of this deal, Argentina becomes more stable and predictable, it will provide a framework that is usually associated with higher growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudis, Saying They Heard Price Complaints, Are Raising Oil Production", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIENNA \u2014 Saudi Arabia said on Saturday that it was substantially increasing oil production in an effort to cool down rising prices and head off potential future shortages.Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister, told journalists at the headquarters of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries here that Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, was already in the process of ramping up production to increase exports from Saudi ports in July. \u201cShips have been scheduled, and it will be hitting the markets, I assume, in August,\u201d he said.While declining to give a specific number, Mr. Falih said the kingdom would be increasing output by \u201chundreds of thousands, not tens of thousands, of barrels\u201d \u2014 a substantial amount.The major producers appear to have consumers\u2019 interests in mind more than they have in the past. Mr. Falih said that in addition to the tweets from Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India had spoken \u201cclearly and loudly\u201d about the negative impact of high oil prices on the Indian economy and that he had received phone calls with similar complaints from officials in China and South Korea, also big customers for Saudi crude.As Mr. Falih explained it, the big producers are shifting from a regime in which oil production has been tightly controlled and monitored to one in which countries with spare output capacity will be encouraged to exceed individual quotas to head off any price spikes.\u201cThey are preparing for more disruptions, and they are preparing to react to them as they feel is needed,\u201d said Roger Diwan, a managing director of IHS Markit, a research firm, who was observing the meetings.With Russia\u2019s energy minister, Alexander Novak, at his side, Mr. Falih fleshed out OPEC\u2019s cryptic decision on Friday to raise production by saying that OPEC and Russia were aiming to lift output by a collective one million barrels a day, or by about 1 percent of world supplies.Mr. Falih explained that the major producers have been overshooting the production cuts agreed to in late 2016 by nearly a million barrels, in part because output from some countries like Venezuela has declined precipitously amid political turmoil. The production cuts have helped prices more than double from their lows in early 2016. Brent crude oil, the main international benchmark, closed at $75.55 a barrel on Friday.The countries that have been holding back oil, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, will now work to fill the gaps.Mr. Falih also suggested that traders, who pushed up oil prices sharply on Friday after the OPEC decision, may have underestimated the major producers\u2019 determination to act.If the major producers are free to produce what they want, immediate shortages seem unlikely. Saudi Arabia says it has two million barrels in spare capacity, well over what is needed. Analysts estimate that Russia could increase production by 400,000 barrels a day. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates could also add more oil.Advertisement"}

Party strategists across the country convened on emergency conference calls Wednesday afternoon trying to figure out the best way to confront a situation that they could do little about as long as Republicans controlled the Senate.\u201cThis will be the biggest, most bitter political battle we have ever seen in terms of intensity,\u201d said Paul Begala, the longtime Democratic strategist.Veteran party leaders predicted they would be inundated with a new wave of volunteers and donors, eager to halt Mr. Trump and the conservative takeover of all three branches of the federal government.\u201cThis is going to be incredibly motivating for women,\u201d said Cecile Richards, the former head of Planned Parenthood, noting that her phone and social media accounts had been \u201cblowing up\u201d since the afternoon announcement.\u201cWomen are saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to do everything I can,\u2019\u201d she added.But pointing out the 10 Senate Democrats facing re-election in states Mr. Trump carried, Republicans said a confirmation vote before the election would force senators in some of these states to choose between liberals and more Trump-friendly voters. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a Republican, invoked Mr. Trump\u2019s first pick for the court, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch\u201cI would suspect if we vote before Election Day and we have a Gorsuch-like nominee, man or woman, I think some of them will wind up voting for that nominee,\u201d Mr. Blunt predicted of imperiled Democratic senators.But Mr. Begala said doing so would be political malpractice.\u201cI don\u2019t think any Democrat is going to go along with a Trump appointee to the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cNot if he or she wants to raise any money or have any volunteers.\u201dMr. Manchin was noncommittal on Wednesday, saying in a written statement that he looked forward to \u201cmeeting with and evaluating the qualifications of whoever President Trump nominates.\u201dMs. Heitkamp also declined to commit either way on Mr. Trump\u2019s potential nominee but did appear to leave the door open to voting yes, and indicated that she did not want to try to drag out the confirmation vote. She said she saw Justice Kennedy\u2019s retirement as an opportunity for the president to nominate someone \u201cwho reflects the same qualities embodied by Justice Kennedy of being fair, pragmatic, and empathetic to all.\u201dAppearing at a rally in Fargo, N.D., Wednesday night, Mr. Trump pressured her to support his eventual pick and emphasized the stakes of the Senate campaign.\u201cJustice Kennedy\u2019s retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important thing we can do.\u201dThe question for Republicans, though, is if their own voters will have enough of a reason to come out if the new justice is already seated by the election.\u201cIf McConnell forces through a vote in the fall, then the issue disappears for Republicans and just motivates Democrats,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.But Steven Law, a top McConnell ally who runs the Senate Leadership Fund, said that the majority leader\u2019s main focus was on filling the seat, and that Senate Democrats would feel no pressure to support the nominee if the vote was held after the election.\u201cThen you have no leverage at all,\u201d Mr. Law said.Within hours of Justice Kennedy\u2019s retirement, Mr. Law and a coalition of conservative groups had begun planning an expansive campaign to pressure the red-state Democrats who could determine control of the Senate.The campaign was more than a year in the planning and began almost immediately after Mr. Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation last April, which cleared the Senate, 54-45, the narrowest margin since Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s contested nomination in 1991.\u201cLike they did before, extremists will lie and attack the nominee,\u201d the announcer says as pictures of Democratic senators that are favorite targets of the right flash one by one across the screen: Chuck Schumer of New York, Dianne Feinstein of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, among others.\u201cWith your help, America will get another star on the Supreme Court,\u201d the ad concludes.Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director for the Judicial Crisis Network, said that vulnerable Democratic senators who are thinking of voting against Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee needed to be put on notice.\u201cThese are people who are up for re-election in states President Trump won,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cIs running to the left really their best bet in those states? I\u2019m not sure it is. I know we\u2019re seeing states where socialists are winning. But I\u2019m not so sure that plays well in places like Montana, Indiana and West Virginia.\u201dThe political network founded by the Koch Brothers is also gearing up. Tim Phillips, president of the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, said in an interview on Wednesday that he anticipated a \u201cmaximum effort.\u201dThe ability to reshape the Supreme Court was one of the decisive factors in Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Conservatives, who were initially wary of a thrice-married former Democrat who once supported abortion rights, came to accept Mr. Trump in part because he took the unusual step of providing a list of people he said would be on his Supreme Court shortlist.And while the Gorsuch nomination allowed him to make good on that promise, replacing Justice Kennedy will allow him to further solidify his bond with conservatives \u2014 which could prove important in keeping his base unified heading into the November elections.\u201cThe biggest thing this does is set us up for a replay of 2016 from the standpoint of voter engagement,\u201d Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said in an interview. \u201cIn some of the Senate races where people aren\u2019t so excited about the candidates, they will overlook them because they are overshadowed by Trump and the Supreme Court.\u201dOn Wednesday morning, hours before Justice Kennedy announced his retirement, top leaders of the social conservative movement were already texting one another reminders to have their news releases ready in anticipation of their greatest opportunity to tilt the court rightward and potentially even overturn Roe v. Wade.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this moment for 40 years, more, since 1973,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group with an active ground game in battleground states, citing the year the court legalized abortion.But Democrats say Republicans do not fully appreciate just how determined many women will be to engage in a campaign where the fate of legal abortion could hang in the balance.\u201cThe No. 1 issue that I hear about from women is their right to choose and to protect that right,\u201d said Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, whose Republican colleague, Dean Heller, is facing a difficult re-election campaign. \u201cAnd at stake now is this administration putting somebody on the court who is going to roll that back.\u201dA photo caption accompanying an earlier version of this article misstated the state Senator Heidi Heitkamp represents.

{"Headline": "South Pacific Nation Shrugs Off Worries on China\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTO ISLAND, Vanuatu \u2014 Australian officials have become increasingly concerned about China\u2019s influence in the small island countries of the South Pacific, especially around infrastructure like a gleaming new wharf in Vanuatu that was built by a Chinese construction company and financed by the Chinese government.But in a sign of the growing divide over China\u2019s role, Vanuatu\u2019s leaders are pushing back \u2014 sharing for the first time the contract this country signed with China for the wharf, and arguing they are perfectly capable of paying back the loans and making decisions on their own about when to work with China.\u201cThe loan was considered economically viable for such infrastructure as the main gateway for international trade between the northern part of the country and the rest of the world,\u201d said Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu of Vanuatu.His decision to share the contract was just the latest example of how Vanuatu, a nation of roughly 80 islands and 270,000 people, is trying to alleviate the concerns of Australia, New Zealand and the United States about whether China sees the archipelago as a vulnerable mark, and a potential military outpost.The wharf was built by the Shanghai Construction Group Co. Ltd. and opened last August. In recent weeks it has become a source of concern in Australia, where defense officials worry that Vanuatu and China have discussed a possible Chinese military base, which could make the wharf available for military and commercial use.Australian officials and experts have also questioned the terms of the financing deal, suggesting that in the case of default, China could seize the wharf directly through a \u201cdebt equity swap\u201d like what was used to take over Sri Lanka\u2019s main port when that nation fell behind on Chinese loans.But Mr. Regenvanu, sharing a copy of the contract signed in 2014, confirmed it did not include a debt equity swap clause. He said Vanuatu sees the wharf as valuable and necessary for hosting the fast-growing cruise ship and agricultural exports industries.In the wake of Australian news reports about a potential Chinese military facility, Prime Minister Charlot Salwai of Vanuatu personally assured Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia that Vanuatu was not in discussions with China about a base.Vanuatu, Mr. Regenvanu said, prefers neutrality. The country is a longtime member of the Nonaligned Movement \u2014 a group of countries not formally aligned with any superpower \u2014 and he cited that membership as a reason Vanuatu would never allow a Chinese military installation.Vanuatu, however, was the first Pacific nation to support China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea and its ties to China have been increasing. For several years now, China has been on a construction spree in Vanuatu, erecting government buildings, stadiums, convention centers, roads and extensions to Port Vila\u2019s runway to allow for larger planes.Direct weekly flights from Beijing and Shanghai are expected to start at the end of the year.The wharf on Santo Island has long been strategic. First built by Seabees during World War II, Vanuatu (then called the New Hebrides) was the second-largest American military base in the Pacific after Hawaii. More than half a million troops passed through the port on their way to fighting crucial battles at Guadalcanal in the neighboring Solomon Islands.Despite the government of Vanuatu\u2019s assurances, experts said the terms in the contract between Vanuatu and China\u2019s EXIM Bank, with Shanghai Construction Group Co. Ltd. as supplier or builder, are heavily weighted in China\u2019s favor in the event of a default.The terms are more restrictive than the loan provided by Japan for a similar wharf.Japan\u2019s loan provides a 10-year grace period, a loan with interest of .55 percent and a repayment schedule of 40 years.The Chinese EXIM Bank loan has a five-year grace period, interest of 2.5 percent and a 15-year repayment schedule.In the case of nonpayment, China can also call in the entire debt at once. And the contract is entirely subject to the laws of China and any arbitration must be done via CIETAC \u2014 the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Committee.But Vanuatu\u2019s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio \u2014 around 30 percent, with half the debt owing to China and the other half owed largely to the Asian Development Bank \u2014 is not out of line for what is typical in the region, experts said.The broader question, discussed openly in the dimly lit kava bars that locals frequent, concerns China\u2019s motivations and whether small countries can withstand its influence.\u201cSome of us are worried about Chinese taking over the economy since they run most of the trade stores already and they are bringing in workers to do basic jobs that locals can do,\u201d said Joseph Waiku, a local construction worker. \u201cWe hope our government is looking out for our long-term interests.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Huawei\u2019s New Front in the Global Technology Cold War: Australia", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Already essentially shut out of the United States, the Chinese technology giant Huawei is scrambling to salvage its reputation in another country where growing worries over spying and security could hurt its chances at a big chunk of business.In an unusual letter to politicians in Australia made public this week, Huawei defended its status as a longtime supplier of networking gear and other equipment to the country\u2019s biggest telecommunications companies. The letter came after news reports that Australian politicians were likely to shut the firm out of a potentially lucrative contract to upgrade the nation\u2019s mobile network over security concerns. It also followed growing concerns among Australian leaders about Chinese influence in the country.\u201cTo completely exclude Huawei from 5G in Australia means excluding Huawei from the entire Australian market,\u201d it said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this would be in Australia\u2019s best interest.\u201dUnited States officials have said for years that Huawei products pose unacceptable security risks for Americans, citing the company\u2019s ties to Beijing and its murky ownership. As a result, large American wireless carriers already shun its products, and smaller ones may soon be barred from using the brand under proposed new rules.Huawei officials have said repeatedly that the company is owned by its employees, not the Communist Party, and that it is a private firm that does not answer to any government. It has said it complies with the laws wherever it operates.Still, Huawei\u2019s big worry is that officials in other countries may someday follow Washington\u2019s lead. Some of America\u2019s closest political and military allies use the company\u2019s technology. Customers in Britain, Canada, Germany and New Zealand are among its biggest.Huawei this week pointed to its business in those countries as proof that it can be a reliable and secure partner. It said it had passed security inspections by officials in Britain, Canada and New Zealand. It offered to build a testing center where Australian officials could monitor the security of its gear.\u201cWe have an open invitation for Australian officials and security agencies to meet with our world-leading research and development teams to better understand our technology,\u201d it said.Still, the company appears to be increasingly caught in a debate in Australia about Chinese companies.Last month, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s government agreed to fund a multimillion-dollar undersea communications cable linking the Solomon Islands with Australia, effectively blocking Huawei\u2019s plan to lay the cables for the island nation.Australian leaders are trying to walk a fine line so they do not alienate a major customer. Speaking to the Australia China Business Council on Tuesday, Mr. Turnbull said, \u201cThe Australia-China relationship gets stronger and stronger.\u201d\u201cIt is built on so many connections,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is built on great economic engagement, it is built on history, but, above all, it is built on family.\u201dFor its 5G build-out, the race is on between telecommunications companies that have been testing the technology for years and are expected to begin bringing the service to consumers next year.Years of exclusion from the United States have not dented Huawei\u2019s determination to help lead wireless internet into its next era. The company has developed 5G-ready products and patented key technologies. It has hired seasoned experts to represent the company at the global body that is setting the new technology\u2019s standards. These complex technical guidelines will ensure that different manufacturers\u2019 gear can be used on different carriers\u2019 mobile networks.\u201cHuawei has a very strong position on shaping 5G standards,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu.The company can count on support within the information technology, or I.T., business not only within Europe, but also in Canada, Japan and other technologically advanced countries, he said.\u201cOutside the U.S.,\u201d he said, \u201cHuawei has become an accepted member of the international I.T. community.\u201dJacqueline Williams reported from Sydney, and Raymond Zhong from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dangerous \u2018Bigness\u2019 of the AT&T-Time Warner Merger", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust and telecommunications.When Congress enacted the Anti-Merger Act of 1950, the law by which American courts still adjudge corporate mergers, it did so with the repeatedly stated goal of fighting excessive economic concentration. The \u201cdominant\u201d concern, as the Supreme Court wrote in a 1962 merger case that analyzed the law, was about \u201ca rising tide of economic concentration in the American economy.\u201d At the time, the court explained, a wave of corporate consolidation posed the threat of an \u201caccelerated concentration of economic power\u201d and also a \u201cthreat to other values,\u201d like the independence of smaller businesses and local control of industry. In particular Congress had said it intended the new law to stop a wave of mergers in its \u201cincipiency.\u201dJudge Leon\u2019s decision shows just how far the law has wandered from congressional intent. The law has become a license for near-uncontrolled consolidation and concentration in almost every sector of economy. Whether involving airlines, hospitals, the pharmaceutical industry, cable television or the major tech platforms, mergers leading to oligopolies or monopolies have become commonplace.Reading Judge Leon\u2019s opinion makes it clear how this has happened. The decision barely touches on Congress\u2019s concerns about excessive concentration of economic power or other guiding principles or values. Instead, the opinion is mostly a tedious dissection of whether customers might end up paying an extra 45 cents per month for pay-TV service. How did a battle over 45 cents become how we decide the future of the media industries? Yes, higher prices for consumers are a bad thing, but they are not the only thing, and certainly not what Congress cared most about. In fact, the law itself doesn\u2019t even mention prices: It instructs courts to bar mergers when the effect \u201cmay be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\u201dThe case could have centered on what Congress really cared about: competition, concentration and the direction of the industry. On its face, despite being a \u201cvertical\u201d merger between two companies at different levels in the supply chain, the marriage of such large and powerful players in the media industry looks anything but harmless. One of AT&T\u2019s defenses of the merger was that it wanted to take on internet companies like Google, Facebook and Netflix. But was that really a creditable goal of this deal? Was there good evidence of an effort to prevent new business models from taking flight? And what about the risk of setting off a wave of consolidations, leaving a fully integrated industry immune to new competition?These kinds of considerations would have yielded the question Congress wanted answered: Was the likely effect of the merger to diminish the level of competition in the media industries? Yet in vain pursuit of numerical certainty about the monthly cost of pay-TV service, the ruling never really came to address this broader question.What Congress cared about in 1950 is even more important today. The public cares about the aggregation of wealth in the top echelons, the suppression of wages and the shrinking of the middle class, all of which are linked to industry concentration. That\u2019s why Congress, in the wake of repeated affirmations that the anti-merger laws no longer work, needs to act. It should reassert that Congress in 1950 really did intend to preserve a competitive economy \u2014 one that is free, if possible, from what the Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201dTim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "LeBron James: The Strange Thrill of a One-Man Show", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "On Pro BasketballRarely has one of the N.B.A.\u2019s supreme players chased a championship with less help and more athleticism. Will his thrilling performances prove futile?Supported byTo watch LeBron James score 80 points in two games and see his Cleveland Cavaliers still losing the series to the Golden State Warriors is to behold the tragedy of the super performer wrestling with an age-old dilemma: How much do I need my backup singers?James this season has upended a team game \u2014 a sport in which a bedrock assumption is that you\u2019re better off with more good players \u2014 into a successful one-man show that just might be reaching its heroic limits.On Sunday night, after the Cavaliers lost to the Warriors, 122-103, in the second game of the best-of-seven series, James sat silently at his locker at Oracle Arena here with his feet in a blue pail of ice water. He wore ice packs on his knees as he bobbed his head to music that pumped through his headphones. He did not smile. He barely acknowledged anyone around him.James looked utterly alone \u2014 and perhaps that was fitting after another game in which he had done everything he could to lift his team to a win: 29 points, 13 assists, 9 rebounds. In the first game of the series, his effort was even more striking: 51 points, 8 assists, 8 rebounds.The losses did not diminish the artistry of his performance, though. Instead, they only seemed to underscore the beauty of his labor, without the glory that comes with actually winning any games.James, of course, is a comeback master. In 2016, his team was down 3-1 against the Warriors and he hauled them back, with a much stronger crew around him, to win the series in seven games.This series resumes Wednesday night in Cleveland, a home court where James makes magic happen.Yet, as he makes his eighth straight appearance in the N.B.A. finals, his trip through the playoffs this spring has had a different feel to it. Rarely, if ever, has one of the league\u2019s supreme players \u2014 perhaps any league\u2019s \u2014 chased a championship with less help.\u201cIt\u2019s my job to make sure that we\u2019re as laser-focused as possible, do my job and continue to instill confidence in my teammates until the last horn sounds,\u201d James said. \u201cThat\u2019s my job. That\u2019s my responsibility. That\u2019s my obligation, and I need to continue to do that.\u201dThe results so far are not entirely the fault of James\u2019s backups. His challenge is even more daunting because the Cavaliers are facing one of the deepest, most talented teams in N.B.A. history. The Warriors have the luxury of starting four All-Stars. After James opened the series last week by scoring 51 points, his coach Tyronn Lue was reminded by a reporter that James usually plays even better after losses.\u201cSo that means he has to score 60 now, right?\u201d Lue asked, deadpan.That James even dragged this team to the finals could be considered one of his greatest achievements, which is saying something after three championships. Before the season even started, Kyrie Irving, the Cavaliers All-Star point guard, demanded a trade. He landed with the Boston Celtics. Several personnel moves followed that left the Cavaliers largely bereft of top-level talent.All the tumult has only fueled speculation about James\u2019s future. He can declare for free agency after the season. But he is revered in Northeast Ohio, where he grew up and played high school basketball in Akron.He was anointed a future superstar and drafted right out of high school in 2003 by the Cavaliers. He left Cleveland in 2010, outraging fans, to join the Miami Heat, where he fulfilled his desire for a championship in 2012 and won another the following year.After returning to Cleveland for the 2014-15 season, he made good on his pledge of delivering the franchise\u2019s first championship in 2016. So if he were to leave again this summer, perhaps fans would be more understanding. Also, how much can one man reasonably expect to do by himself, even if that man is LeBron James?\u201cI marvel at him every single year,\u201d Rick Carlisle, the coach of the Dallas Mavericks, said in an interview before the start of Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cEvery year, his skills become more refined. There\u2019s a greater economy of movement. He plays every angle so precisely. For me, it\u2019s uncharted territory seeing a guy do this at this stage of his career.\u201dOther greats \u2014 Bill Russell, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, to name a few \u2014 were obviously just as essential to their teams. But Russell played alongside fellow Hall of Famers like Sam Jones and Bob Cousy. Johnson had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy. Jordan had Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman.James has Kevin Love, a perennial All-Star, but Love has been up and down in the playoffs, and the Cavaliers have gotten minimal production from their guards.Even as the Cavaliers overhauled their roster this season (more than once), James tried to compensate by leading the league in minutes played. He appeared in all 82 games for the first time in his career.In an apparent attempt at team building early in the postseason, he splurged on matching suits for his teammates to wear to arenas. When he was not moonlighting as the team\u2019s stylist, James was hitting game-winning shots against the Indiana Pacers and the Toronto Raptors in the playoffs, saving the season more than once.Against Golden State, James absorbed a blow to the face in Game 1 and has been playing with blurred vision in his bloodshot left eye ever since. Still, he continues to lead the Cavaliers\u2019 offense at one end, while defending the Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant at the other. He ought to take the court in a hard hat.James\u2019s teammates are aware of what is being said \u2014 and written \u2014 about them. One of them, J.R. Smith, inspired a viral GIF of James\u2019s pained expression after Smith had made a gaffe that deprived the Cavaliers of the possibility of a game-winning shot in Game 1.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift and a curse. You play on his team, and you\u2019re playing with the best player in the world and you get to witness some great historic things and be a part of it. Then, on the other side, if you don\u2019t help that person win, they\u2019re looking at you, too.\u201dJames wound up playing 44 minutes in Game 2, and only took a seat on the bench once the game was out of reach. His teammates combined to shoot 27 of 70 from the field. He brushed aside a question about possible fatigue.\u201cI think I only got tired once tonight,\u201d he said.Since the start of the playoffs, James has been averaging 34.6 points, 9.2 rebounds and 9 assists a game while sinking 54.4 percent of his field-goal attempts. Against the Warriors, he has somehow managed to elevate his play by averaging 40 points, 10.5 assists and 8.5 rebounds while shooting 55.8 percent from the field and 45.5 percent from 3-point range.The last time the league saw someone take on such a disproportionate workload was \u2014 surprise! \u2014 LeBron James in 2015, when Irving injured his knee in the first game of finals. James tried to carry the Cavaliers the rest of the way, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists, but the Cavaliers fell to the Warriors in six games.Before that, it was probably Allen Iverson, the rocket-powered point guard who steered the Philadelphia 76ers into the finals against the Los Angeles Lakers in 2001. Iverson did not have an All-Star cast around him, especially late in the season. Larry Brown, who was the team\u2019s coach at the time, joked in a telephone interview that the team had been so affected by injuries that he went searching for reinforcements at the Y.M.C.A. Iverson averaged 35.6 points during the series, which the Lakers took in five games.\u201cI don\u2019t compare anybody with Allen,\u201d Brown said, \u201cbecause every day, every game that he played, he would do something remarkable. But I look at LeBron now, and he makes so many of the right plays, and he makes it all look so simple. The sign of greatness is playing on the biggest stage in the biggest games, and then raising your game. That\u2019s what he seems to do.\u201dOn Sunday, the Cavaliers wore matching outfits again: gray suits with short inseams and black boots. But James mixed up his look after the loss, opting for a navy blue sweatshirt under his blazer and suit shorts. He bit into an apple as he made his way outside, where his teammates waited for him on an idling bus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Would an Expanded Foreign Investment Committee Do?", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has decided not to impose new investment restrictions on China, and will instead support a congressional effort to expand the powers of an existing federal body that reviews foreign investments in the United States for national security threats.The president is supporting a bipartisan bill, known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, which would broaden the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. The legislation would give Cfius more power to investigate \u2014 and potentially block \u2014 foreign transactions.The House passed a version of the bill on Tuesday night, and the Senate passed its version this month. The bills now must be reconciled between the two congressional bodies before a final version lands on Mr. Trump\u2019s desk.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said an expansion of Cfius would be a powerful national security and economic tool \u201cthat better protects the crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property from transfers and acquisitions that threaten our national security \u2014 and future economic prosperity.\u201dHere is what an expanded Cfius (pronounced SIFF-ee-yus) would look like:The current committee \u2014 led by the Treasury secretary and made up of members of the State, Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security Departments \u2014 investigates only when a foreign company\u2019s attempt to acquire or merge with an American company poses a national security risk.In March, the committee rejected a proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the San Diego-based chip maker, by Singapore rival Broadcom over concerns that it would pose a national security risk by depriving the United States of a telecom leader.The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act would expand the universe of financial and business transactions that Cfius can review, giving it a say in a wider array of deals beyond just mergers and acquisitions.That means proposed joint ventures, minority stakes and real estate transactions near military bases or other sensitive national security facilities all could be reviewed \u2014 and potentially squashed \u2014 by Cfius.The current version of the legislation does not expand review powers on overseas joint ventures that involve American technology being transferred to foreign companies of interest. Instead, the law would strengthen the existing export control process run by the Commerce Department to manage such cases.The legislation would expand the types of risks that Cfius can consider when determining whether to block a deal, expanding it beyond just national security to America\u2019s competitive edge in emerging industries.Under the plan, Cfius would update its definition of \u201ccritical technologies\u201d to include cutting-edge and other technologies that could give the United States an advantage over countries that pose threats, such as China. What that means in practical terms is that Cfius could block a deal if it determined such a relationship would hinder America\u2019s edge in technological and industrial industries, or if it posed a national security risk.\u201cChina exploits loopholes in our existing safeguards to acquire sensitive, cutting-edge technology and then turns this technology against us to undermine our military advantage,\u201d Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican sponsoring the bill, said in a statement.About 20 percent of deals Cfius reviewed between 2013 and 2015 \u2014 the latest years for which the committee has made data public \u2014 involved Chinese investors.But Cfius investigates transactions involving dozens of other countries, and the legislation would give the United States the power to review deals involving a country of \u201cspecial concern.\u201d While those countries have yet to be designated, the legislation describes those countries as ones that have a \u201cdemonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology\u201d an American company possesses.Both versions specifically call on Cfius to look into cases that would give foreign governments a technological edge for a possible cybersecurity attack against the United States, such as activities \u201cdesigned to affect the outcome of any election for federal office.\u201dThe legislation has received bipartisan approval, with supporters saying it is a necessary step to prevent foreign investors who are intentionally sidestepping Cfius\u2019s authority. But critics say that some aspects of the bill are troubling, given how easily Cfius could reject a potential transaction.The proposed law would charge Cfius with investigating plans that are \u201clikely to reduce the technological and industrial advantage of the United States,\u201d which some say would do more economic harm than good, and could chill legitimate investments that boost American jobs and growth.\u201cThis change in approach would open the door to comparably broad protections with a zero-sum rationale of maintaining national economic superiority in vulnerable sectors in Europe and Asia, thereby undermining decades of effort to open domestic markets to competition from external sources,\u201d Mr. Moran wrote.Other opponents worry that additional investigations will unfairly constrict American companies and actually help foreign countries, and say that existing export control laws are sufficient to quell national security concerns.The House and the Senate have passed different versions of the Cfius legislation, which means both chambers will need to reconcile their bills and send a version back to their members for a final vote. Lawmakers are expected to fold the final Cfius legislation into a defense authorization bill that both chambers are planning to hammer out in the next few weeks.Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he would sign the legislation if Congress is able to get it to his desk.If not, Mr. Trump said he remained prepared to act alone and said he would \u201cdirect my administration to deploy new tools, developed under existing authorities, that will do so globally.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Supreme Court Devastates Antitrust Law", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust.Obscured by the destructive chaos of the Trump administration, a far more chillingly efficient assault on America is underway: a hard march backward to laissez-faire economic policies of a sort not seen since the late 19th century. Last year, Congress did its part by cutting corporate taxes. And on Monday, in Ohio v. American Express, the Supreme Court delivered a big blow to antitrust law and its traditional mission of helping consumers and fostering economic competition.One of the ways the American economy deviates from textbook capitalism is that prices are often hidden from consumers, interfering with the process by which competition is supposed to work. An example central to the American Express case is how we pay to use our credit cards. In addition to annual fees, interest charges and other, more mysterious fees that consumers pay, credit card companies also levy fees on merchants: usually a flat fee per sale and a commission of 2 percent to 3.5 percent or more. If you spend $200 at a store and use a credit card, you could be sending as much as $7 of that payment to the credit card company.Merchants, no fools, pass those fees on to consumers by making their products more expensive. This yields a credit card \u201ctax\u201d that everyone pays (even those, usually the poor, who don\u2019t have credit cards).There is no reason to expect credit card companies to offer their services free. But the credit card tax paid by American retailers and consumers is the highest in the world. Credit card \u201cswipe\u201d fees account for an estimated $42 billion every year in the United States. The Europeans pay less, because they see this as an obvious market failure and limit the commission to 0.3 percent, meaning that you would pay 60 cents instead of $7 in fees for that $200 purchase. We rely on the \u201cAmerican way\u201d \u2014 competition instead of regulation to keep prices lower \u2014 but that works only if we prevent companies from thwarting competition.Unfortunately, credit card companies like American Express have managed to stymie fee competition with those gag orders on merchants who contract with them. Merchants are prevented from steering consumers to cheaper options, for example by saying to a customer: \u201cPaying for this microwave with American Express will cost us an extra $5.60. Might you consider using another card if you have one?\u201dThe trial court in this case, after a full trial, found direct evidence that American Express\u2019s gag orders were anticompetitive and thus an illegal restraint on trade. This included evidence that the gag order allowed American Express to raise its fees 20 times in five years.Nonetheless, the five more conservative justices on the Supreme Court managed to find a way to win this case for American Express. They did so not by contesting the fact that the gag order stymies competition \u2014 for that was impossible to disprove. Instead the court put theory ahead of practice in an absurd way: Even though, in practice, American Express hurt competition and inflicted harm on consumers, the court concluded, the company was not, in theory, powerful enough to do so.The logic is ridiculous: You could just as easily say that robbing banks is economically irrational, given the risks involved, and therefore it does not happen.To reach this strained conclusion, the court deployed some advanced economics that it seemed not to fully understand, nor did it apply the economics in a manner consistent with the goals of the antitrust laws. Justice Stephen Breyer\u2019s dissent mocks the majority\u2019s economic reasoning, as will most economists, including the creators of the \u201ctwo-sided markets\u201d theory on which the court relied. The court used academic citations in the worst way possible \u2014 to take a pass on reality.As Justice Breyer points out in his dissent, America\u2019s antitrust laws represent a historic compromise between pure laissez-faire capitalism and state control of the economy. In cases like Ohio v. American Express, the court is rejecting that tradition of compromise and taking us down a path that leads in dangerous directions.Giving freer rein to private economic power has already yielded extreme levels of economic inequality, stoking the fires of social and political dissatisfaction. To break from Congress\u2019s historic compromise in aid of the credit card industry only throws fuel on the fire and represents judicial activism in its most unseemly form.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Italy, Immigrants Evoke Fear, Not Racism", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Severgnini writes regularly about Italian and European politics, society and culture.CREMA, Italy \u2014 As I was walking home, a man in his 70s, wearing a youthful shirt and sporting fiercely dark hair, stopped me in the main square, under the spire of the ancient Duomo. He introduced himself, then said he\u2019d had a tough life, working as a cow milker on a farm since he was a child. He didn\u2019t understand why I was so soft on migrants, in my writing and on television.\u201cI want them out,\u201d he said.\u201cAll of them?\u201d I asked.\u201cAll of them. Every single one.\u201d\u201cWho will care for you when you grow older?\u201d I asked him. \u201cAll caregivers are foreigners \u2014 from Eastern Europe, South America, Sri Lanka and the Philippines.\u201d\u201cItalians will do that!\u201d he snapped back.\u201cI doubt it,\u201d I answered. \u201cItalians are no longer interested in those jobs. They don\u2019t want your old job either. Milkers in the Po Valley these days are from India; farm laborers in the Mezzogiorno come from Africa; even our bars and restaurants are now staffed by foreigners. Are you sure you want them out? Italy will grind to a halt.\u201d He looked at me, mumbled something and walked away.Are Italians racist? No. They are just misled, angry, scared and confused.To begin with, Italians of all political persuasions are irritated by the way immigration has been mismanaged. Italy\u2019s foreign-born population is at 8.3 percent \u2014 in the realm of the European average \u2014 and mainly concentrated in the northern, wealthier half of the country. Half come from within Europe, 23 percent from Romania alone.The problem then is not numbers. It\u2019s the perception of losing control. The process of applying for political asylum \u2014 a well-intentioned charade, since only a fraction of African migrants are entitled to that protection \u2014 takes at least 18 months. During that time, thousands of young men \u2014 611,000 since 2005 \u2014 have not been allowed to work. So they roam the streets, often begging for money. Once they are denied asylum and are ordered to leave the country, they don\u2019t. They often disappear and slide into petty crime or slavery. Why hasn\u2019t any government proposed a temporary job permit that, even if the asylum request is turned down, would grant some priority for a future visa application? It\u2019s a mystery.Is this reason enough for a large country to be afraid? Probably not. But the potential for mass, uncontrolled immigration is there. Africa is just a few miles from Sicily, and political leaders like Mr. Salvini gain popularity by frightening voters. Public discourse about immigration, in the past couple of years, has become irrational. The sight of idle young men on street corners is considered a provocation by many in a country where salaries don\u2019t rise, the economy grows slowly and the health services and schools \u2014 though good \u2014 are underfunded and stretched to the limit.Italians are also angered by the European Union. The so-called Dublin Regulation requires asylum seekers to make their application in the first E.U. country they arrive in. Most of the time \u2014 you can\u2019t fight geography \u2014 that is Italy or Greece. Successive Italian governments have insisted that this rule be changed, but have failed.And Italy and Greece are not equal in this respect. Greece is protected by an expensive deal the E.U. signed in 2016 with Turkey, which acts as a bouncer, preventing refugees from entering the Balkans and reaching Hungary, Croatia, Austria and Germany. The only recourse: A dangerous voyage on the Mediterranean.Will the European Council meeting this week repeal or change the Dublin Regulation? Unlikely, because most countries are interested more in sealing Europe\u2019s external borders than in sharing the asylum seekers within them.But bigotry, fear and greed are not part of our national character or history. We Italians have been migrants ourselves \u2014 in northern Europe, the United States, South America and Australia. From 1861, when modern Italy was born, to 1985 about 30 million left the country seeking a better life elsewhere. In times good and bad, Italy\u2019s people can always be depended on to be unimpressed by their leaders, and that includes when they\u2019re told to reduce themselves to tolerating outright cruelty. It happened in 1938, after Benito Mussolini, in a tragic attempt to ape Adolf Hitler, passed the so-called \u201cracial laws\u201d to persecute Italian Jews. Some Italians, to their shame, went along with it; but many more helped their friends and neighbors, and saved lives. The real test, now, would come if we were asked to accept something as brutal as, say, separating asylum-seeking families by grabbing children and babies from their mothers\u2019 arms at the border. But I can tell you \u2014 here the family is sacred. They will never go for that.Giuseppe Conte, the new prime minister, wants to please his masters \u2014 the League and the Five Star Movement. So he proudly defines himself as a populist. History has put him, a little-known law professor, in the spotlight. But he must remember this: If his government behaves in a way the world considers inhuman, it\u2019s that for which he will be remembered.So, is Italy irritated, scared, annoyed, confused? Yes. But racist? Not yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "11 Ways to Save Money When Booking Travel", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooking flights, rental cars and hotels can add up quickly, but with a few simple tips you can save big when booking your next vacation. We asked a few travel experts how to travel luxuriously on the cheap.Earlier this year, Brian Kelly flew Singapore Airlines\u2019 new first-class suite on its A380 airbus, taking off with a glass of Dom P\u00e9rignon and 50 square feet of legroom. The market rate for his flight from Sydney to Singapore was over $3,000. Mr. Kelly\u2019s cost?\u201c150,000 points and $72,\u201d he said. \u201cSo while not the best redemption in terms of the value I got per point, the flight itself was one of my most memorable ever. It actually has both a seat and a bed.\u201dBlogs and online forums refer to it as travel hacking, stacking, or credit card churning, but the idea is the same: sign up for credit cards with big bonuses and cash back programs to earn points redeemable for free travel. That said, if you use them responsibly, credit card rewards can be, well, rewarding. \u201cDo your research before signing up for a card to make sure you\u2019re getting one that makes sense for you,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. If you dine out frequently, for example, you might want a card that comes with a higher cash back rewards for restaurant spending. Other cards reward you more for spending on travel or gas or groceries.For the same reason, flights are usually cheaper on holidays, but significantly more expensive on the days before and after the holiday. You can save a considerable amount of cash flying on Thanksgiving, for example, instead of the Tuesday before. Of course, the downside is that you will have to travel on a holiday, but the upside is beating the crowds.On the other hand, airline fare pricing is a science that can be tough to predict, said Mr. Kelly. \u201cBetween availability, airline revenue managers, when you\u2019re traveling and more, there are so many moving parts to airfare that you can\u2019t really focus on one too much.\u201d This might also come in handy if you need to cancel just one leg of your flight. For example, if you\u2019re flying to London, but your departure date changes, it may be cheaper to pay a cancel fee for your one-way departing ticket than to cancel and rebook your entire round-trip flight. Of course, this also depends on how the airline handles flight changes. Also, if you end up extending your trip to stay in your destination city longer, it may be easier to make a change when you book separate tickets.It may also be cheaper to fly into or out of an alternative airport. If you\u2019re flying into Los Angeles, for example, don\u2019t limit your search to LAX. Search for flights to and from surrounding airports, like Burbank. Just make sure they\u2019re not too far out of the way of your destination, otherwise you could find yourself on a mini road-trip from the airport to your hotel. Some overseas airlines list cheaper flight prices if you use their country\u2019s version of the website. \u201cParticularly, Norwegian Air is famous for offering discounts as high as 30 percent when you book through the foreign version of its website,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cIf you\u2019re booking a one-way flight from Oslo to New York, you can often find get major discounts by selecting Norway as your home country rather than the U.S.\u201dYou may have to ask Google to translate your page, but if you can navigate the website and book your ticket, this is a relatively easy way to save. Layovers will often make your flight cheaper, but the downside is, well, a layover. One way to use this to your advantage is to turn a longer layover into a bonus trip. For example, if you\u2019re flying to London and flights with layovers in Dublin are cheaper, search for the flights with the longest layovers to see if the prices are similar. If you have a 14-hour layover in Dublin, that could be enough time to grab a hotel, head to Temple Bar and return to the airport in the morning.Flight prices are cheaper than ever \u2026 sort of.For example, Mr. Kelly said that some hotels offer best price guarantees, so if you find a cheaper price than the one the hotel advertises on their own website, they will match it. More properties are willing to do this, Mr. Barba said, so it can\u2019t hurt to call and at least ask. \u201cAt other hotels, I\u2019ve seen a stigma associated with guests that booked with an online agency,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t get the same attention and may even get assigned to their \u2018last sell\u2019 room types.\u201d As you can imagine, these are less desirable rooms, usually smaller, near an elevator or without a view. On a more encouraging note, Mr. Barba said an added bonus of booking directly through the hotel is that it\u2019s easier to get upgraded. \u201cYou can increase your chance of an upgrade by informing the front desk of a special occasion, anniversary or birthday,\u201d he said. Of course, a little politeness toward the front desk staff will go a long way, too, and Mr. Barba suggested never asking for an upgrade outright. Car rental insurance can jack up your bill quite a bit, and the good news is, your existing car insurance policy might come with some form of coverage for rentals. While there are exclusions, chances are, your credit card probably comes with a policy that can make up for anything your personal auto insurance doesn\u2019t cover. Advertisement"}

But the expectation that a female-written, female-directed effort would yield something refreshingly different is scotched within the first few minutes.The movie\u2019s opening montage depicts a view of today\u2019s gig economy in New York City, specifically the sorry lot of the personal assistant. \u201cI have a master\u2019s in sociology and nothing else to do today,\u201d one such young person says into a phone as he is about to be put on hold. Big lights will inspire you, indeed.Eventually the film alights on Harper, the personal assistant to an icy sports reporter and website master, Kirsten Stevens (Lucy Liu), and then on Charlie, the assistant to a venture capitalist, Rick Owen (Taye Diggs, his inherent charisma subsumed in a truly nasty role).Harper (Zoey Deutch, charming) and Charlie (Glen Powell, unable to transcend his character\u2019s smarmy game face) meet semi-cute working late, fetching their bosses\u2019 dinners.Ms. Silberman\u2019s attention to trendy detail is exemplified by some one-liners here. When Harper is told the wait time for her order of truffle mac and cheese, she retorts: \u201cTwenty-five minutes? Are you sniffing for the truffles yourself?\u201d Charlie, on the other hand, waxes indignant. \u201cWhat kind of grocery store doesn\u2019t serve saffron-infused Kobe beef, medium-rare?\u201d he says.The movie\u2019s humor can be full-on unpleasant, as when an obese delivery man begins stripping, then urinating, while on a stalled elevator car. The liberal use of profanity and sexual innuendo actually succeeds in achieving gratuitousness. Mr. Powell\u2019s character makes no fewer than four penis jokes in the first hour, three of them about his own. Remember, this is the guy that the female protagonist is destined to fall for in the end.I found all of these characters depressing. I\u2019m happy that my profession does not require me to find out if they have real-life analogues.Another Netflix comedy, \u201cI\u2019m Not an Easy Man,\u201d which debuted in April, is also the work of a female director, El\u00e9onore Pourriat, who wrote the film as well. Alas, it, too, is not very good.The premise is simple: Extreme male chauvinist bumps his head on a Paris street sign, passes out and wakes up in a gender-reversed world. The street sign was for P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery; when he wakes up, it\u2019s for M\u00e8re Lachaise. John Steinbeck is Jane Steinbeck. Women don\u2019t wear makeup and are sexual aggressors, while men are required to shave their chests and inner thighs. And so on and so on.One could fill a 98-minute movie with such minutiae, but why would you want to? This picture is a heavy-handed pursuit of diminishing returns, given that the male lead, Vincent Elbaz, is equally unappealing as a creepy alpha male and a befuddled representative of oppressed manhood. As it happens, this movie is an expansion of Ms. Pourriat\u2019s 2010 short film, \u201cOppressed Majority,\u201d which was a punchier, and not particularly comedic, allegory of sexual assault. That picture can be found on YouTube; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good either, but it\u2019s more genuinely thought-provoking than its expansion.An academic having an early midlife crisis who neglects his wife, flirts with a student and stresses over a more successful colleague sounds like a scenario out of, if you\u2019ll forgive me, a Woody Allen film. In this case, it\u2019s the premise of a South African Netflix comedy, \u201cCatching Feelings,\u201d written and directed by and starring Kagiso Lediga, a popular stand-up comedian and television performer in his country. It is notable both for its considerable comedic flair and its detailed depiction of Johannesburg.Mr. Lediga\u2019s character, Max, is a creative writing teacher whom we first see performing a daringly lewd lecture on the cuckold-growing-horns myth. He\u2019s financially overextended, drinks too much and soon falls under twin spells \u2014 one woven by a female student, the other by a famous white writer who has returned to South Africa after a long self-imposed exile.Heiner, the writer (a boisterous Andrew Buckland), tells Max that he found his debut novel, \u201cBlossom of the Roses,\u201d promising and invites Max to spar with him about politics in front of a female interviewer who\u2019s entranced \u2014 by Heiner. At one of Heiner\u2019s parties, Max encounters a group of his students, including the flirtatious one (Zandile Tisani) who introduces him to cocaine. We next see Max holding court under the influence, proclaiming, \u201cYou cannot compare Hitler to Shaka Zulu,\u201d the warrior king. Many of the laugh lines here are similarly unexpected.After a Viagra-induced heart attack, Heiner moves in with Max and his beautiful journalist wife (Pearl Thusi), and Max starts imagining his own cuckold\u2019s tale happening to him. \u201cCatching Feelings\u201d starts to sag a little at this point; cultural specificity or no, the spectacle of a man exploding his own life for no good reason is a familiar one. But the feeling I was left with when all was said and done was the satisfying one of having encountered a fresh new comedic voice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says Abandoning Iran Deal Has Already Curbed Tehran\u2019s Bad Behavior", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump asserted Thursday that his decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal had already curbed Iran\u2019s aggressive behavior, and he predicted that his hard-nosed tactics would also result in a successful nuclear negotiation with North Korea.Iran, he said, was no longer as adventurous in Syria and Yemen, and had relaxed its ambitions to extend its influence all the way to the Mediterranean Sea. \u201cIran is not the same country that it was a few months ago,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference, five days before he was scheduled to meet in Singapore with Kim Jong-un of North Korea.\u201cThey\u2019re a much, much different group of leaders,\u201d he concluded.Mr. Trump cited no evidence to support his contention. Iran remains firmly under the control of its theocratic government, it continues to support proxy forces across the Middle East, and it just announced plans to increase its capacity to enrich uranium after Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal.Still, the president said his willingness to walk away from the Iran deal would set the right tone for his negotiations with Mr. Kim over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Mr. Trump pointed out that he had already walked away from the Singapore meeting once \u2014 a decision he reversed after 24 hours when the Kim government issued a conciliatory response.\u201cI hope it won\u2019t be necessary to walk because I really believe that Kim Jong-un wants to do something,\u201d Mr. Trump said, standing in the Rose Garden alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. \u201cI believe we\u2019re going to have a terrific success or a modified success.\u201dDepending on the degree of success, the president said, he could foresee inviting Mr. Kim to a follow-up meeting at the White House. And he left open the possibility of signing a peace declaration that would formally end the Korean War after nearly seven decades of military hostilities.Mr. Trump, however, acknowledged that this would be only the start of a protracted, difficult negotiation over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the easy part,\u201d he said of announcing a peace treaty.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said later that while the United States understood North Korea could not give us up its nuclear arsenal \u201cinstantaneously,\u201d the process needed to be \u201cbig and bold\u201d and not open-ended. \u201cWe can\u2019t step through this over years,\u201d he said.The debate over how to negotiate with North Korea has exposed a rift in the administration, between Mr. Pompeo, who strongly backs Mr. Trump\u2019s diplomatic gambit, and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, who nearly derailed the meeting last month by proposing Libya, and its voluntary disarmament under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2003, as a model for North Korea.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr. Pompeo at first dismissed reports of a rift as \u201cfiction,\u201d before conceding, \u201cAmbassador Bolton and I will disagree with great, great consistency over time, I\u2019m confident, right? We\u2019re two individuals. We\u2019re each going to present our views.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for a meeting with Mr. Kim has remained constant, even though he briefly canceled the encounter in response to a series of hostile statements by the North Koreans.Earlier Thursday, the president said he did not think the meeting required a great deal of preparation on his part. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a question of preparation,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of whether people want it to happen.\u201dFor Mr. Abe, the visit amounted to a last-ditch effort to stiffen Mr. Trump\u2019s spine before he flies to Singapore. Mr. Trump\u2019s more conciliatory tone in the past few days has alarmed the Japanese, who worry that he might trade the security of the United States\u2019 Asian allies for a deal with Mr. Kim on nuclear weapons.Mr. Trump has stepped back from his demand that North Korea give up its entire nuclear arsenal immediately, calling it a \u201cprocess.\u201d He also said he would stop using the phrase \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to describe the sanctions against the North, even though he insisted that they would remain in place.Mr. Abe has been on edge since March, when Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Kim\u2019s offer to meet. In April, the Japanese leader flew to the president\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Fla., for two days of meetings, after which Mr. Trump pledged to raise the plight of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea \u2014 an issue with great domestic political resonance for Mr. Abe.But Mr. Trump did not single out North Korea\u2019s short- and medium-range missiles, which threaten Japan but not the continental United States. Some Japanese analysts worry that he could make a deal with Mr. Kim that curbs its intercontinental ballistic missiles \u2014 protecting the United States \u2014 while leaving intact its shorter-range missiles.In a sign of how large North Korea has loomed, Mr. Abe said it dominated his talks with Mr. Trump, even though the United States has moved ahead with tariffs on Japanese steel \u2014 precipitating the most bitter trade clash between Tokyo and Washington in years.\u201cDonald, President Trump, you are about to make a new history,\u201d Mr. Abe said through a translator.Mr. Trump has long drawn a link between Iran and North Korea. When he announced last month that he would reimpose sanctions on Iran \u2014 effectively pulling the United States out of the deal negotiated by President Barack Obama \u2014 he told European leaders that his move would help pave the way for a successful negotiation with North Korea.Experts, however, point out that North Korea and Iran are very different countries \u2014 one a reclusive state with a sprawling nuclear program and dozens of bombs, the other a threshold nuclear state with no bombs yet, but a web of interests and proxy forces across the Middle East.Analysts said they were puzzled by Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that his abandonment of the Iran deal had so quickly changed its behavior. If anything, Iran has seized on the fact that the deal\u2019s other signatories have stuck with it as a way to divide the United States from its allies.Yet some experts, in trying to interpret Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, pointed to Israel\u2019s recent military strike on Iranian forces in Syria, the pullout of foreign companies from Iran, and the deepening woes of the Iranian economy as signs of how Iran\u2019s position has weakened in the past few weeks.\u201cBefore we pulled out of the Iran deal, Iran\u2019s leadership was arrogant and on the march,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a longtime critic of the deal. \u201cWhat I think he means is that he\u2019s cut them down to size.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Endgame, of Sorts, Is Looming for the U.K. in the Brexit Debate", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Each week Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain seems to face a new crisis over the country\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, only to escape, her authority diminished but her determination to carry on apparently undimmed.But finally an endgame of sorts is looming in the debate over what is known as Brexit as lawmakers prepare for important votes, starting Tuesday, and Mrs. May faces mounting pressure ahead of a meeting of European Union leaders at the end of the month.Mrs. May will try to overturn 14 of 15 amendments added by the House of Lords to her main Brexit bill, which transfers the entirety of European Union law to British law. It would take only a small number of Conservative Party lawmakers to rebel, if combined with opposition votes, to defeat the government.Among the more important issues is whether to give more control to Parliament in the withdrawal process, preventing Mrs. May from presenting lawmakers with a take-it-or-leave-it choice between the Brexit plan she supports and no deal at all.Another item, on membership in a European customs union, is so weakly worded that it would not actually require the government to sign up to one (though, if approved, it would be a significant defeat for Mrs. May). Lawmakers have been promised a vote in July on another, more definitive, customs union amendment in separate legislation, and pro-European Conservatives might wait for that opportunity.Meanwhile, the issue that most threatens Mrs. May\u2019s government, the status of the Irish border, remains highly divisive and in urgent need of settling.\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous series of tests,\u201d said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIt\u2019s a test of her authority in front of Parliament, it\u2019s a test of cabinet unity and it\u2019s a test of her ability to be all things to all men.\u201dFor months Mrs. May has been adjudicating between warring factions in a cabinet bitterly divided between those who want to keep close ties to the European Union to protect the British economy, and hard-line Brexit supporters who want to break free.Rumors of a plot to topple Mrs. May have swirled within her Conservative Party since last year when she called a general election and lost her parliamentary majority, and they have not gone away. She has survived, as Professor Menon put it, because, \u201cher strength is not her popularity; it is the lack of an alternative candidate who can unite her party.\u201dA promised white paper on Britain\u2019s overall negotiating objectives is now not expected before July, and not before a special meeting of senior ministers at Mrs. May\u2019s country residence.Mrs. May favors a \u201ccustoms partnership\u201d under which Britain would collect tariffs for the European Union on many goods but would be able to strike some separate trade agreements.Brexit supporters prefer another scheme called \u201cmax fac\u201d \u2014 short for maximum facilitation \u2014 that accepts the need for customs controls but uses technology to keep checks light. But that is entirely unacceptable to the European Union (as is Mrs. May\u2019s plan, though to a lesser extent).But the immediate question is what to do until one of the plans can be made to work, and how to keep open the border between Ireland, which is in the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.If she can get agreement on Ireland, Mrs. May can postpone the troublesome detail of future trade talks until after March next year, when a transition period is to begin. By then, she hopes, the political climate may have cooled.The Irish border question is urgent because Brussels has made solving it a precondition of discussing a deal on future trade, and an accord on Ireland will require great political agility.Mrs. May has promised that there will be no hard border (which might stoke sectarian tensions), but she has also insisted that Northern Ireland will have the same economic rules as the rest of the United Kingdom. She relies on the support of 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland, so she has little room for maneuver.Mrs. May\u2019s idea is to keep the whole of the United Kingdom in a type of European customs union for goods until the technology is ready to eliminate the need for most frontier checks.When the hard-line Brexiteers got wind of that, they erupted. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, threatened resignation, until he won a pledge that the British government \u201cexpects\u201d that situation to end no later than December 2021.The British plan runs afoul of the European Union, whose chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, rejected the scheme last week, suggesting that it amounted to cherry-picking. British officials hope, however, that the bloc\u2019s leaders might be more sympathetic, particularly if Britain offers financial contributions.Whether the plan \u2014 even as a temporary backstop \u2014 can convince Mrs. May\u2019s Conservatives remains unclear. However, her one advantage is that Brexit has caused such rancor in British politics that it has even divided its supporters.Some, like Mr. Davis, want more detail about future ties to the bloc as soon as possible, fearing that if Britain quits without firm pledges from Brussels, it will surrender all of its leverage, including a hefty $53 billion exit fee it has promised.It could then find itself obeying a set of trade rules over which it has no say at all.But others want Brexit to happen so much that they will put up with almost any compromise to secure formal exit from the European Union in March, confident that Britain will never rejoin the club they hate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Raises Interest Rates and Signals 2 More Increases Are Coming", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and signaled that two additional increases were on the way this year, as officials expressed confidence that the United States economy was strong enough for borrowing costs to rise without choking off economic growth.Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, speaking in unusually blunt terms at a news conference on Wednesday, said the economy had strengthened significantly since the 2008 financial crisis and was approaching a \u201cnormal\u201d level that could allow the Fed to soon step back and play less of a hands-on role in encouraging economic activity.The Fed\u2019s optimism about the state of the economy is likely to translate into higher borrowing costs for cars, home mortgages and credit cards over the next year as the central bank raises interest rates more quickly than was anticipated.Wednesday\u2019s rate increase was the second this year and the seventh since the end of the Great Recession and brings the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. The last time the rate topped 2 percent was in late summer 2008, when the economy was contracting and the Fed was cutting rates toward zero, where they would remain for years after the financial crisis.\u201cThe decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape,\u201d Mr. Powell said after the Fed\u2019s two-day policy meeting. \u201cMost people who want to find jobs are finding them.\u201dThe increases this year are part of a gradual series of steps to return rates to historically normal levels, and they reflect both the Fed\u2019s confidence in America\u2019s economic strength and its commitment to bring the inflation rate to its target of 2 percent.But the march toward higher interest rates comes as much of America\u2019s work force continues to experience slow wage growth, despite a tight labor market that should, in theory, translate into higher wages as businesses compete for workers.The rise in consumer prices over the last year has effectively wiped out any wage increases for nonsupervisory workers, the latest Consumer Price Index data suggests.As expected, the bank raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday as it continues to step back from its post-crisis stimulus campaign.That is odd for an economy with a tight labor market, with unemployment running at a 3.8 percent. And some analysts say it is a reason for officials to slow their pace of rate increases, since the benefits of a hot economy have not yet translated into a significant wage increase for workers.At a comparable time of low unemployment, in 2000, \u201cwages were growing at near 4 percent year over year and the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation was 2.5 percent,\u201d both above today\u2019s levels, Tara Sinclair, a senior fellow at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in a research note. \u201cToo many increases too quickly could choke the economy before we really see how good it could get.\u201dMr. Powell played down concerns about slow wage growth, acknowledging it is \u201ca bit of a puzzle\u201d but suggesting that it would normalize as the economy continued to strengthen.The Fed chairman said growth was being lifted, at least in the short term, by tax cuts and government spending increases signed into law by President Trump last year. And he dismissed, for now, concerns that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies, including tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, were hurting growth, saying the Fed had yet to see any data indicating an impact.\u201cSo right now, we don\u2019t see that in the numbers at all. The economy is very strong, the labor market is strong, growth is strong,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI would put it down as more of a risk.\u201dIn a statement released at the end of the two-day meeting, Fed officials noted that economic activity had been rising \u201cat a solid rate\u201d \u2014 a change from their May statement, when they called the rate \u201cmoderate.\u201d Fed officials now expect the economy to grow at a 2.8 percent rate this year, up from a 2.7 percent forecast in March. The unemployment rate is now projected to fall to 3.6 percent by year\u2019s end, down from a forecast of 3.8 percent in March.\u201cThe changes from the Fed today should not come as a surprise, given recent economic developments, but they nonetheless signal a more hawkish outlook for the next few quarters,\u201d Eric Winograd, a senior economist at AllianceBernstein, said in a research note.The Fed now faces a tricky balancing act as it tries to calibrate how to keep the economy chugging along. Raising rates too quickly could snuff out the economic recovery, which has finally begun to gain steam after years of sluggish growth. But not raising rates fast enough could allow inflation to spiral out of control, driving up prices and potentially plunging the economy back into a recession.Officials continue to project three additional increases in 2019, but reduced the number of forecast increases for 2020 from two to one.A faster pace of rate increases could slow economic growth, potentially frustrating Mr. Trump. But Fed officials signaled a willingness to allow inflation to remain slightly above their 2 percent target for several years \u2014 which would be accommodative for growth.Officials raised their headline inflation rate forecast for the year as well, to 2.1 percent from 1.9 percent. The Fed now predicts inflation will run slightly above its target rate of 2 percent through 2020, at 2.1 percent each year, a slight overshoot that Fed officials have roundly indicated they are comfortable with, in part because of slow wage growth.Financial markets had been widely expecting the Fed to raise the benchmark rate, and the reaction among investors was muted, even as the official monetary policy statement struck some as signaling growing confidence that rate increases would continue, and might even proceed at a faster pace.The stock market, which had been modestly positive for most of the day, turned slightly negative after the rate decision was announced at 2 p.m. Short-term Treasury bond yields, closely tied to monetary policy, rose faster than yields on longer-term bonds which take their cues from forecasts for economic growth and inflation, suggesting that investors in the bond market see economic growth continuing but not picking up sharply.It was the second news conference for Mr. Powell, who succeeded Janet L. Yellen in the job this year. But this was the meeting where Mr. Powell made several clear breaks from his predecessors, in a series of changes around process and communication that could ultimately have big implications for monetary policy and the economy.He began his session with the news media with what he called a \u201cplain English\u201d description of what the Fed had done and why, a contrast with the practice of Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, both Ph.D. economists who prefaced their appearances with long prepared statement loaded with monetary policy jargon.And he stood before reporters, in contrast to Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke, who both chose to sit at a desk for their post-meeting news conferences.Mr. Powell announced that he would begin holding a news conference after every Fed policy meeting starting in January; currently such a session is held only after four of eight annual meetings.While he insisted that this was not meant to signal any change in the direction of policy, it opens up more flexibility for the Fed as it sets interest rate policies. Financial markets currently expect interest rate increases only in meetings with a news conference; now the Fed will have the option of making more than four policy moves a year without unnecessarily surprising markets.\u201cThe June communication really ushered in the Powell Fed,\u201d said Julia Coronado, an economist and president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cHe stood at a lectern instead of sitting at a desk, he is moving toward more frequent communication, and the communication style from the statement to the press conference is direct and pragmatic.\u201dAnd the Federal Open Market Committee, which Mr. Powell leads, changed its statement describing its rate increase in a way that removed a mainstay of its monetary policy of recent years. Dating to the Bernanke era, the Fed has used \u201cforward guidance\u201d to signal the future direction of interest rates.For example, at the March policy meeting, the committee said its interest rate target was \u201clikely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\u201d That language was excised from the policy statement released on Wednesday, saying only that the \u201ctiming and size\u201d of future rate increases will be determined by many factors.Matt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Inside, a Calm Sea of Conservative Cash.", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 To anyone with even a cursory relationship to television or social media, a charged and emotional battle over the Trump administration\u2019s approach to immigration seems to have seeped into every dimension of American life.Just not quite the dimension containing the Trump International Hotel.President Trump zipped around the capital all day Tuesday, motorcade sirens blaring, as he forcefully defended a policy that includes separating families at the border. \u201cThese are laws that have been broken for many years,\u201d he said as he departed Capitol Hill.At the hotel, he spoke for an hour to 150 supporters \u2014 about half of whom were donors who paid $100,000 to $250,000 to attend a two-day summit meeting organized by America First Action, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d formed to support Mr. Trump and allied candidates.But inside, all was well.\u201cDoes anybody here look stressed out?\u201d the conservative commentator Candace Owens asked as she surveyed the lobby.Attendees shook hands and greeted each other as fellow \u201cgreat American patriots.\u201d Others posted photographs to social media, with hashtags like #BlackLivesMAGA.Upstairs, in a restaurant, a boy blew out the candles on his birthday cake, pausing to bite the head off a miniature President Trump made of frosting. TVs at the bar tuned to Fox News analysts who rehashed the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general report.The event was part of a heightened fund-raising push by America First Action.That group and an affiliated nonprofit, America First Policies, want to raise $100 million to advance Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda and help congressional candidates allied with him before a midterm election season expected to be difficult for Republicans.Sensitive to campaign finance rules barring federal officials from soliciting donations greater than $5,400, the White House has been careful to call these events gatherings with supporters, not fund-raisers, although they have a similar effect. The event this week felt like a conference, with several panels geared toward foreign policy, \u201cAmerica First\u201d messaging and a healthy disdain for the news media.\u201cYou guys are genuinely out of touch,\u201d said Ms. Owens, who also serves as a communications director for the conservative group Turning Point USA, after speaking on the media panel.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m talking to someone who actually thinks everyone else is an idiot,\u201d she said to this reporter.Panelists, including Ms. Owens, did not pay to attend.Beyond media criticism, what lessons could donors expect to glean?\u201cYou want it to be intimate,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cNot a cattle call.\u201dAnd besides, Mr. Spicer reasoned: They paid a \u201cton of money,\u201d he said, using a phrase that contained an expletive.Donors in attendance included the Oklahoma oilman Harold Hamm; the investor and former ambassador Ronald N. Weiser of Michigan; and the investors Roy W. Bailey and Tom Hicks Jr. of Texas.Mr. Hamm has donated $1 million to America First Action through personal and corporate accounts. Mr. Weiser, who has donated $200,000, said he suspected the event raised \u201ca lot\u201d of money.Yechezkel Moskowitz, 31, who attended on behalf of his grandmother, a donor, said that he felt as if he had gained a better understanding of the policies he should be supporting, including the administration\u2019s approach to rolling back environmental regulations and its hard-line stance on immigration.\u201cWe have to give the impression that our laws matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI think conservatism is the new counterculture.\u201dIn recent weeks, fund-raisers for the groups began aggressively courting donors ahead of the summit meeting. Donors were told that, in addition to Mr. Trump, speakers would include the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, and a host of Republican lawmakers, including Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Steve Daines of Montana, as well as Representatives Kevin Brady of Texas, Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Greg Walden of Oregon.Mr. Brady spoke Tuesday on a panel about \u201cthe great things already happening in the economy as a direct result\u201d of the tax overhaul passed last year, said his spokeswoman, Allyson Manley.\u201cPart of it is,\u201d Mr. Spicer said, \u201cyou buy into the philosophy.\u201dBill White, a donor based in New York City also at the event, said that during his speech to the group, Mr. Trump had focused on drumming up support for his immigration policy and approach to foreign relations \u2014 at one point, he again complained about being slighted by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada \u2014 among other issues.\u201cI\u2019m confident that Donald Trump is going to solve that problem\u201d of immigration, Mr. White said, \u201cwith the help of the American people. He hates the fact that children are being taken away from their loved ones.\u201dMr. White said that he and his husband have been so persuaded by the president\u2019s policies that they have pledged $100,000 to America First and are organizing a fund-raiser this year.America First Action has made hefty payments to consultants with close ties to Mr. Trump, including $184,000 to the firm owned by Brad Parscale, who will have to distance himself from the group because he was tapped to run Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. America First Action also paid $75,000 to the firm of Mr. Trump\u2019s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and $60,000 to the company of Katrina Pierson, a former campaign spokeswoman, according to Federal Election Commission filings.America First Action also paid more than $69,000 to a firm owned by David A. Clarke Jr., the former sheriff of Milwaukee County. On Tuesday, he roamed the hotel lobby, dressed in a white cowboy hat.The filings also show that the group has spent more than $160,000 at Trump Organization properties, the vast majority of which \u2014 $154,000 \u2014 went to the Trump International Hotel for facility rentals and catering. Nearly $2,000 was spent at the hotel\u2019s steakhouse, BLT Prime by David Burke, with another $864 going to the hotel\u2019s bar, Benjamin Bar and Lounge.Mr. White said he was comfortable with a large amount of money going toward the president\u2019s hotel. He called it one of the greatest hotel properties in the world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Backs Softer Restrictions on Chinese Investment", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration has backed off a plan to impose aggressive new restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States, opting instead to support a congressional effort that would expand the types of foreign deals that are subject to review.It would also allow the United States to consider risks beyond national security when rejecting transactions \u2014 for instance, whether a deal could undercut America\u2019s dominance in a particular field, like wireless technology or artificial intelligence.Mr. Trump said the expansion of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, would achieve his goal of combating China\u2019s \u201cpredatory investment practices\u201d of buying stakes in American companies to acquire valuable technology and trade secrets.The decision will forestall more draconian curbs on Chinese investment that the White House had been considering, such as limiting investment in technology and manufacturing industries by declaring an economic emergency. That could help defuse tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies, at least somewhat.But it is unlikely to avert a rapidly approaching trade clash that threatens to derail global stock markets and multinational supply chains. China is still far from offering to make the type of substantial changes to its economy that the Trump administration has pushed for, and no official talks appear to be scheduled in the next week.The Trump administration is scheduled to put levies on $34 billion worth of Chinese products on July 6, with the president threatening to impose tariffs on as much as $450 billion of Chinese goods as punishment for Chinese trade practices. Beijing has countered with its own threat of tariffs on American products.\u201cOur objective is not to single out China or treat them differently, but that we have the necessary tools to protect U.S. investments,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make specific comments on where we are in dialogue, but if China wants to come to the table with free and fair trade and treating American companies fairly and reducing the trade deficit, we\u2019re always willing to listen.\u201dAdditional curbs could still be coming. Administration officials said Wednesday that Mr. Trump would direct the heads of the Commerce Department and other federal agencies to review the nation\u2019s export controls and recommend any needed changes. That could have a more significant effect on American companies than restrictions on Chinese investment, since it could limit their ability to sell products to China. The targeted industries that the White House wants to prevent China from dominating include robotics, artificial intelligence and new-energy vehicles.Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University, said the president\u2019s announcement suggested \u201ca brief lull in the economic hostilities against China.\u201d\u201cFor now, at least, the momentum within the administration has swung back in favor of Mnuchin and others who favor a less confrontational approach to the economic relationship with China,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. \u201cHowever, with the imposition of tariffs against China just a few days away, this apparent respite in economic hostilities could prove to be all too fleeting.\u201dThe announcement appeared to be a narrow and unlikely victory for more moderate advisers in the White House. While expanding Cfius would most likely curb Chinese investment, the White House had drafted an executive order that would have put more stringent investment restrictions into effect, according to people familiar with the plans.That garnered the support of more hard-line trade advisers \u2014 among them Peter Navarro; Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative; and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross \u2014 as well as the national security adviser, John R. Bolton.But Mr. Mnuchin convinced Mr. Trump that the president could be blamed for triggering a drop in the stock market and for creating additional layers of bureaucracy necessary to review investments. Mr. Mnuchin and top Republican lawmakers made the case that the legislation winding its way through Congress provided a viable bipartisan alternative.Justice Department and State Department officials had also warned that investment restrictions emanating from the White House could trigger a wave of lawsuits.The potential investment restrictions were part of the White House\u2019s effort to punish China for what it says are years of unfair trade practices, including cyber espionage and a pattern of pressuring American technology companies to hand over valuable trade secrets.In a meeting last week with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, American corporate executives urged him to send one of his most trusted advisers, Wang Qishan, to the United States for talks. But with the United States and China so far from a compromise, such a visit appears unlikely in the near term, people familiar with the deliberations said.On Wednesday, Larry Kudlow, the White House\u2019s chief economic adviser, said that Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi \u201cwork well together,\u201d but that the president was unsatisfied with the Chinese response on trade talks.\u201cThe ball is in their court,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said.Administration officials who outlined the decision in an early-morning briefing said that Mr. Trump had been pleased with the evolution of the legislation to expand Cfius and that he viewed it as an \u201cextremely powerful tool\u201d to safeguard national security. The overhaul would allow Cfius to review investments from a list of \u201ccountries of special concern\u201d but stops short of specifically naming China as the target.The Senate and House have passed different versions of the legislation, which must be reconciled and sent back for a final vote. While final approval appears likely in the coming weeks, it is not guaranteed. Mr. Trump said he would be prepared to \u201cdeploy new tools, developed under existing authorities,\u201d if lawmakers did not act to \u201cprotect the crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property from transfers and acquisitions that threaten our national security \u2014 and future economic prosperity.\u201dThe decision could help repair ties with Republican lawmakers, who have been at odds with Mr. Trump over his approach to trade, including his tariffs on the European Union, Canada and Mexico and his decision to rescue the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE.Mr. Trump has also threatened to put 20 percent tariffs on autos imported into the United States. A handful of Republican senators have introduced legislation to limit the president\u2019s ability to impose such tariffs, but they have faced opposition from Republican leadership.Lawmakers have worked for months on the Cfius legislation, seeing it, rather than punitive new restrictions, as the best path to curtail risky investments from China.Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who has sponsored the bill, said in a statement that he appreciated the president\u2019s support for the legislation, which \u201ctakes a carefully tailored approach to updating the review process without limiting our ability to meaningfully engage in trade with partners around the world.\u201dMr. Mnuchin insisted on Wednesday that the Trump administration was not pursuing a protectionist approach and was actually trying to prod other countries, including China, to lower their trade barriers.Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mexico, Hitting Back, Imposes Tariffs on $3 Billion Worth of U.S. Goods", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Mexico hit back at the United States on Tuesday, imposing tariffs on around $3 billion worth of American pork, steel, cheese and other goods in response to the Trump administration\u2019s steel and aluminum levies, further straining relations between the two countries as they struggle to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement.The tariffs, which were announced last week, came into effect as the Trump administration threw yet another complication into the fractious Nafta talks. Officials are now saying they want to splinter discussions with Canada and Mexico and work on separate agreements rather than continue three-country discussions to rewrite the 1994 trade deal.Larry Kudlow, President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpreference now, and he asked me to convey this, is to actually negotiate with Mexico and Canada separately.\u201dMr. Kudlow, speaking on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d said pursuing separate deals might allow an agreement to be reached \u201cmore rapidly,\u201d adding: \u201cI think that\u2019s the key point. You know, Nafta has kind of dragged on.\u201dThe Trump administration hit Mexico and Canada with 25 percent steel tariffs and 10 percent aluminum tariffs on June 1 as part of a campaign to pressure the countries to agree to America\u2019s demands on a revised Nafta. The United States also imposed metals tariffs on the European Union, Japan and other countries as part of an effort to stop the flow of imported metals, which the administration has said threatens national security by degrading the American industrial base.The trade approach has only inflamed allies, including Canada and Mexico, which have threatened to strike back with their own targeted tariffs aimed at Republican states and areas that supported Mr. Trump.Mexico\u2019s list was designed to hit at parts of the United States represented by high-profile Republicans, Mexican officials have said, including steel from Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s home state of Indiana, motorboats from Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s Florida, and agricultural products from the California district of Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader.Farmers, who are among those most vulnerable to the Mexican tariffs, said the tariffs would devastate American agriculture.\u201cThese tariffs will exact immediate and painful consequences on many American farmers,\u201d Angela Hofmann, deputy director of Farmers for Free Trade, said in a statement. \u201cHog, apple, potato and dairy farmers are among those suddenly facing a 10 or 20 percent tax hike on the exports they depend of for their livelihoods. Farmers need certainty and open markets to make ends meet. Right now they are getting chaos and protectionism.\u201dIt is unclear which country will blink first, leaving the future of the trade deal, and the millions of jobs across the continent that are linked to it, so uncertain that many companies are withholding investments they might make to take advantage of the pact.Mr. Kudlow insisted that the president was not planning to withdraw from Nafta \u2014 which he has frequently threatened to do. However, splitting the current trilateral deal into two separate bilateral agreements would likely require nullifying the 25-year-old agreement.On Friday, Mr. Trump said he would be interested in pursuing separate deals. \u201cThese are two very different countries,\u201d he said.\u201cI like free trade, but I want fair trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cThey cannot believe they\u2019ve gotten away with this for so many decades.\u201dPeople familiar with the deliberations say the idea of separate talks is aimed at pressuring Canada, which American negotiators see as obstructionist and an impediment to the progress of the Nafta negotiations. The preference for bilateral negotiations has also emerged as one of the sole areas of agreement among Mr. Trump\u2019s warring trade advisers, who agree on little else but the ability to extract bigger concessions through one-on-one talks. Bilateral deals are also a longtime focus of the president.American officials say that splitting the negotiations could help the United States take advantage of what could be a short and crucial window to negotiate with the current government of Mexico, which could be ousted in national elections in July, and replaced by a government that is less inclined to cut a deal with the Trump administration.However, both Mexico and Canada insist that the idea is a non-starter.Mexican negotiators say they would not be willing to consider splitting the negotiations, a move they view as potentially damaging to North American supply chains and an unnecessary complication of a pact that many businesses rely on, according to people familiar with their thinking.They add that they do not view Canada as their biggest problem in the talks. The three countries have remained at an impasse over significant provisions, including manufacturing rules for autos and an American proposal for a five-year sunset clause that would cause the deal to automatically expire unless the countries voted to renew it.The clock has essentially run out for the administration to secure a Nafta deal this year. The Trump administration had been trying to conclude Nafta talks by the end of May in order to submit the deal for a vote in the current Republican-controlled Congress.Given the statutory deadlines the administration must meet to get a trade deal approved, it now appears likely that any vote would drag into next year, after midterm elections that could shift the political makeup of Congress.Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy in the negotiations with Canada and Mexico has drawn criticism from the business community as well as Democrats and Republicans.A spokeswoman for Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Tuesday that Mr. Brady opposed splitting the negotiations in two.\u201cA Nafta without both Canada and Mexico included is no longer a North American Free Trade Agreement,\u201d the spokeswoman, Julia Slingsby, said. \u201cChairman Brady believes one free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico is best for America. It provides the most certainty for American companies and is the best way we can sell \u2018Made in America\u2019 products.\u201dAnd a survey of chief executive officers released Tuesday morning by Business Roundtable showed that while executives have a positive view of the economy, they see the administration\u2019s trade policy and the prospect of retaliation from other countries as an escalating risk to their businesses.Joshua Bolten, the president of Business Roundtable, said that uncertainties about trade policy were \u201ca growing weight on economic progress \u2014 especially amid escalating trade tensions. America\u2019s current and future economic vitality depends on productive talks with China and a successful modernization of Nafta.\u201dPrivately, some congressional Republicans expressed an openness to the administration negotiating some trade issues bilaterally with Mexico and with China. But they expressed little support for scrapping Nafta entirely and replacing it with separate deals.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pipelines, the Stuff of Canadian Politics: the Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGiven that Canada\u2019s economy still relies to a substantial degree on chopping down trees, digging up minerals and pumping out oil and gas, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that pipelines are one of the nation\u2019s hot-button issues.That move had a familiar ring to any of us who have taken even a high school course in Canadian history. In 1956, a Liberal government\u2019s efforts to use public money to make sure the construction of a major pipeline could begin by a June deadline ended up in a legendarily raucous parliamentary debate \u2014 and became a key factor in the Liberals\u2019 defeat in the next election.Back then, the government of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent brought in a bill to spend 118 million Canadian dollars \u2014 1.1 billion in today\u2019s money \u2014 to build part of the Trans-Canada Pipeline from Alberta to Eastern Canada, and also to lend money to the group of companies set up to run and own the project. (TransCanada, as it\u2019s known today, is also the outfit now behind Keystone XL.)John Diefenbaker, the Conservative leader at the time, was known for his jowly speaking style, which allowed him to summon righteous indignation like few Canadian politicians before or since.Mr. Diefenbaker challenged the project\u2019s American control. Members of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, the precursor to today\u2019s New Democratic Party, pushed for public ownership. The volume rose and tensions flared in the House of Commons. Then the Liberals, with an anxious eye on their construction deadline, used a ham-handed parliamentary procedure to shut down debate and force a vote.Mr. Trudeau appears to be gambling on the notion that most Canadians sit somewhere in the middle, and like him believe that Canada can balance environmental protection and a strong energy industry.I\u2019ll bet this becomes a defining issue in next year\u2019s election.\u201cCanuck Lit Lover\u201d from British Columbia: \u201cI am finally relieved that our Prime Minister has stood up to the neighborhood bully.

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Widens Reach of Sales Tax for Online Retailers", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Americans have done more and more of their shopping online in recent years, drawn by the promise of low prices, wide selection and buy-from-home convenience. But e-commerce has also had another edge: Many of those sales were, in effect, tax-free.The Supreme Court on Thursday moved to close that loophole, ruling that internet retailers can be required to collect sales taxes even in states where they have no physical presence.\u201cState and local governments have really been dealing with a nightmare scenario for several years now,\u201d said Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington think tank. \u201cThis is going to allow state and local governments to improve their tax enforcement and to put local business on a more level playing field.\u201dBut as online retailing has grown, the dynamics have shifted. Online sellers are no longer scrappy upstarts competing with more established businesses. Amazon had $119 billion in revenue from product sales last year, making it bigger than all but the largest traditional retailers.And state budgets are increasingly feeling the pinch. Writing for the majority in the 5-to-4 ruling, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the Quill decision caused states to lose annual tax revenues of up to $33 billion.\u201cQuill puts both local businesses and many interstate businesses with physical presence at a competitive disadvantage relative to remote sellers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRemote sellers can avoid the regulatory burdens of tax collection and can offer de facto lower prices caused by the widespread failure of consumers to pay the tax on their own.\u201dJustices Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch joined the majority opinion.In dissent, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. agreed that the court\u2019s rulings in this area had been \u201cwrongly decided,\u201d but said there were insufficient reasons to overrule the precedents. \u201cAny alteration to those rules with the potential to disrupt the development of such a critical segment of the economy should be undertaken by Congress,\u201d he wrote.Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the dissent.South Dakota responded by enacting a law that required all merchants to collect a 4.5 percent sales tax if they had more than $100,000 in annual sales or more than 200 transactions in the state. State officials sued three large online retailers \u2014 Wayfair, Overstock.com and Newegg \u2014 for violating the law. Lower courts ruled for the online retailers, citing the Quill decision.Marty Jackley, South Dakota\u2019s attorney general, called Thursday\u2019s ruling \u201ca big win for South Dakota and Main Streets across America.\u201d He said the decision could be particularly significant for rural areas where local businesses have been hit hard by competition from online retailers.Mr. Jackley is a Republican. But South Dakota\u2019s appeal drew bipartisan support, including from attorneys general in 35 states and the District of Columbia.Mr. Jackley estimated that South Dakota would be able to begin collecting sales tax on online purchases in 30 to 90 days. Other states may be close behind: Anticipating Thursday\u2019s ruling, several states, including North Dakota, have passed laws modeled on South Dakota\u2019s.President Trump, who has previously accused Amazon of avoiding taxes, wrote on Twitter that the decision was a \u201cgreat victory for consumers and retailers.\u201dOther states will have to change their laws if they want to take advantage of the decision, said Hayes Holderness, a law professor at the University of Richmond. He predicted a flurry of activity in legislatures.Many of those laws could face their own legal challenges. Justice Kennedy\u2019s decision left open the possibility that some transactions were so small and scattered that no taxes should be collected. The court also did not decide whether states may seek sales taxes retroactively, which South Dakota\u2019s law does not.For consumers, the reversal of Quill could mean paying more for products bought online. In theory, most states already require consumers to pay a \u201cuse tax\u201d equivalent to the state sales tax when buying online. But in practice, few consumers do so.Owners of brick-and-mortar stores welcomed the ruling.\u201cI firmly believe that it\u2019s a huge stride in leveling the playing field,\u201d said Jason Patton, owner of Oz Music in Tuscaloosa, Ala. \u201cIn my record store, the average price point is around $20. I\u2019m not going to say I continually lost customers because of the sales tax, but on higher-ticket items, that tax absolutely matters.\u201dShares in Amazon fell 1.1 percent on Thursday, and other online retailers took a bigger hit. Overstock.com shares were down more than 7 percent.\u201cToday, the U.S. Supreme Court has reshaped the interstate commerce landscape in a move that could impact small business innovation on the internet, which has been a driving force behind our nation\u2019s economy for the last 15 years,\u201d said Jonathan E. Johnson III, a member of Overstock.com\u2019s board.Overstock said the decision would have little impact on its business but argued that with more than 12,000 different state and local taxing districts, the ruling would present a \u201ccompliance challenge\u201d for internet start-ups. Chief Justice Roberts made a similar argument in his dissent.Many experts, however, played down that problem. When the Supreme Court decided the Quill case in 1992, complying with various state and local tax laws would have been a major hurdle for small businesses. But today, many companies offer software that helps small businesses navigate local laws.\u201cThe digital and internet revolution contributed to the problem, but those same factors contributed to the solution, which is easy-to-use tax-automation software,\u201d said Daniel Hemel, a University of Chicago law professor.Wayfair, in a statement, said it already collected sales tax on approximately 80 percent of its orders in the United States. \u201cAs a result, we do not expect today\u2019s decision to have any noticeable impact on our business,\u201d the company said.The impact on Amazon could be even smaller: As of last year, the company collected sales tax in the 45 states that have one.But about half of Amazon\u2019s total online sales come from independent merchants who simply post their inventory on the online store. In most states, those merchants are responsible for calculating and paying the various state taxes if they are owed. In the past year, Washington State and Pennsylvania have enacted laws requiring internet retailers to collect taxes on third-party sales. More states are expected to follow suit.Amazon declined to comment on the ruling.In his ruling on Thursday, Justice Kennedy wrote that world had changed since 1992, when mail-order sales totaled $180 million. Last year, remote sellers racked up sales exceeding half a trillion dollars, he noted.That growth seems unlikely to slow. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a group that supports independent businesses, said the tax-free nature of online retail had given Amazon and other internet sellers a big advantage when they needed it most.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate how much not having to collect sales tax mattered in the first 15 years of Amazon\u2019s growth,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Ben Casselman and Julie Creswell from New York.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Overturning a unanimous 41-year-old decision, the court ruled 5 to 4 that state governments could not force public employees who don\u2019t join unions to pay fees that support collective bargaining. More than 20 states require these so-called fair-share or agency fees, which the court has upheld several times since that earlier ruling.But writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito Jr. said that the court had been wrong all this time and was violating the First Amendment rights of government workers by insisting they support unions whose positions they might not agree with. Or, in other words, someone\u2019s free speech rights can be violated by making the worker pay a union to do the very thing that it was formed to do. Right. It\u2019s hard not to agree with Justice Elena Kagan, who wrote in a sharp dissent that the majority was \u201cweaponizing the First Amendment, in a way that unleashes judges, now and in the future, to intervene in economic and regulatory policy.\u201dHistorically, unions played a crucial role in lifting living standards for millions of workers and creating a middle class. Many economists believe that their decline in recent decades contributed to anemic wage growth and rising income inequality.Lawmakers who believe that collective bargaining is the best way to strengthen American workers can pass measures like those approved in California and New Jersey that require government agencies to let union representatives meet new employees at orientation events, which should help stem their losses.There are no easy or quick responses to the challenges this persistent right-wing attack has posed for unions and their supporters. It will take the right political strategy and perseverance to defend hard-won gains. But workers have been in a far worse position in the past. It never hurts to remember that it took decades of bloody struggle to win the right to unionize in the first place.Advertisement"}

Now, there\u2019s another reason they aren\u2019t reading their textbooks and aren\u2019t paying attention in class: the siren song of the smartphone. Traditional-age college students are now iGen, the post-1995 generation who were the first to spend their entire adolescence with smartphones.They are spending an extraordinary amount of time on electronic devices \u2014 according to Common Sense Media, nine hours a day. Perhaps as a result, many students have a difficult time focusing, are distracted by devices during class and are sleep-deprived. As with many things, however, the solution is education.To help them focus while studying, we can tell students about the truth of \u201cmultitasking\u201d \u2014 it doesn\u2019t exist, because the human brain can only consciously focus on one thing at a time. Advise students to try setting aside their devices and reading their course materials for 10 minutes straight before doing anything else. The next day, it can be 15 minutes, and then 30, and then an hour.To improve classroom engagement, tell students about the research showing that students who take notes longhand, on paper, do better on exams than those who take notes on laptops. Consider having them put their laptops away during class time \u2014 laptops, with their temptations of social media sites and web surfing, are a distraction much more often than they are useful.Tell students to shut down their phones an hour before bedtime. In addition to being psychologically stimulating, phones are also physiologically stimulating. The blue light they emit inhibits the sleep hormone melatonin, making sleep significantly more elusive. Not sleeping enough is linked to not just the inability to focus but to unhappiness, depression, and poor physical health. None of this means giving up our technology \u2014 it just means using it for what it\u2019s good for, and then putting it away.A senior editor at Bloomberg News and the author of \u201cTrue Gentlemen: The Broken Pledge of America\u2019s Fraternities\u201dHistorically white Greek-letter organizations typically have few minority members, and some chapters have none at all. It\u2019s a legacy of their civil rights-era resistance to integration. This is no small matter. At many universities, these organizations offer grand houses \u2014 in some cases, on public land \u2014 that dominate the social scene. The rich returns on this social capital include student-college presidencies, internships and success in business and politics.African-American and other minority Greek organizations \u2014 separate and unequal \u2014 generally don\u2019t have houses of their own.A 2014 study of F.B.I. hate-crime statistics from 349 colleges found that campuses with large populations of historically white fraternities are more likely to report verbal and physical assaults involving bias against blacks and other minorities. Another study found that Greek life inhibits friendship across racial lines and promotes opposition to policies promoting diversity.Still, colleges often embrace fraternities and sororities for their philanthropy and leadership. There needs to be more oversight. Deans should require each chapter to demonstrate its openness by disclosing its demographics, including race and socioeconomic background. The resulting public pressure on segregated fraternities and sororities could help achieve the vision of inclusion enshrined in law and the Constitution.President, Pennsylvania State UniversitySociety\u2019s benefits from the innovations of higher education are priceless. The research, both fundamental and applied, holds great promise for everything \u2014 promoting economic vitality, protecting life and property and improving the quality of life.Yet universities today are operating in a relentlessly difficult fiscal environment. Public universities have experienced a decade of weak state support, and more tuition increases are in direct conflict with our mission of access and affordability. Major research universities are facing a huge issue with aging research infrastructure because many of our buildings were built as part of our nation\u2019s competitive posture more than 50 years ago.Continual belt-tightening is creating a number of negative outcomes. Harry Houdini was never bound this tightly.The challenge for colleges and universities, private and public, is to find funding for innovation in such a constrained fiscal environment.First, innovation has to be a core priority, as important as paying for salaries, health insurance, deferred maintenance and unfunded mandates.Second, we need to ensure that innovation deliberately drives job creation, economic development and student career success by bringing research discoveries to the marketplace. We must develop a culture that nurtures and rewards entrepreneurship \u2014 not just in STEM, but in the arts, health and human development, education and more.Third, we need to foster the power of partnership \u2014 with local government leaders, legislative representatives, communities, business leaders, faculty and students.Innovation is inspiring. It\u2019s also a wise investment with an even better return. Economists at Deloitte found that technology has been a \u201cgreat job-creating machine,\u201d increasing spending, creating a new demand and boosting jobs in knowledge-intensive sectors.Research and education have always opened doors that benefit the nation we serve. This is a challenge we are well equipped to conquer.Founder, Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies; mayor of New York City, 2002-13One of the biggest challenges in education today is an ideological disagreement over whether we should focus on getting every student accepted to a four-year college, or whether we should place far more emphasis on career preparation.The truth is, we need to do both \u2014 and the problem is, we\u2019re not doing either one very well.Right now, too many students are not prepared to enter either college or the work force \u2014 and too often, those who are ready for college don\u2019t go to competitive schools that match their abilities. Less than half of 1 percent of students from the poorest 20 percent of families attend a selective college, even though many have the grades to do so. At the same time, about four in 10 teenagers do not enter college immediately after high school, and many are left with few career choices and nowhere to turn for help.We need to do better for our kids, and our foundation is working to deliver for them.Bloomberg Philanthropies is supporting local leaders around the country who are adopting changes that have proven to raise student achievement and put more students on track for college. We have also launched the American Talent Initiative, a coalition of 100 of the most selective colleges and universities that are committed to increasing the number of lower-income, high-achieving students that they accept and graduate.Our goal is to have an additional 50,000 students at these schools by 2025. And through a second initiative we created called CollegePoint, which guides students through the application and financial aid processes, we\u2019re helping ensure they apply to and enroll in the kinds of schools they have earned the right to attend.Career and technical education is an even more difficult challenge. Many vocational programs across the country are trapped in the 1960s and \u201970s. We need states and districts to invest in new, higher-quality programs that train students for a wide variety of industries \u2014 from construction and advanced manufacturing to health care and information technology. Creating pathways to careers also requires forming partnerships with local employers, who can provide training and skill development in growing fields.Hopefully, more political leaders will step up to support these kinds of changes that will prepare students for college and careers, and we will support those that do.Director of college counseling, NYC Lab SchoolFueled from the top and fed by social media, anti-intellectualism challenges the core of higher education.And somehow, the fuel and fire have become indistinguishable. Social media honors the quick opinion, the lightning-fast response, the emotionally charged declaration. Every millisecond, anyone can weigh in on any conceivable matter. The writer, often anonymous, is inconsequential. Expertise is meaningless. Thoughtfulness, considered and informed opinion, hard-earned by those who have studied, debated, read and written, is suspect. Where is this feared hotbed of intellectualism? At today\u2019s colleges and universities.Of course, anti-intellectualism has been brewing before tweets; well before the days when my 12-year-old nephew and the president joined forces to weigh in on crucial world issues. Nor are we in a unique time and place where intellectuals have become the enemy of the people. So what can we do to honor the intellect \u2026 to tamp down the notion that intellectual rigor is detrimental to society?While we accept excellence and, dare I say, elitism in our athletes, and artists, so must we learn to honor, and not be afraid of intellectual excellence. These are lessons we learn young: paying homage to an extraordinary soccer player or a talented singer, while the exceptional thinkers and learners toil in obscurity, often ridiculed as socially inept.Professor of higher education policy and sociology at Temple UniversityAs colleges and universities try to raise graduation rates, college presidents, policymakers and philanthropists often focus on what students know when they enter college, how they perform on tests and what courses and majors they choose. Rarely do they consider whether their students have enough to eat or a safe place to sleep.Higher education neglects Abraham Maslow\u2019s lessons at its peril. Without their basic needs secured, large numbers of today\u2019s undergraduates are struggling to learn. Sleepless nights and empty stomachs distract them from going to class and passing their courses, prolonging or even preventing degree completion.Sizable numbers of students are also coping with homelessness. Two recent national studies suggest that 12 to 14 percent of community college students experienced homelessness in the last year.Delivering emergency aid to students in small amounts just when they need it can help keep them in school and connected to their institutions. These efforts yield strong returns on investments for both colleges and their partners \u2014 a housing dollar spent helping a displaced worker complete a technical certificate and obtain a job improves his or her earning potential and reduces the likelihood of needing public benefits in the future.College has always been a challenge for people without substantial resources, but now even students from middle-class families are struggling. Work opportunities are scarce, the value of the minimum wage is down, and college prices are higher than ever and continuing to rise.Colleges that want students to not only enroll but also graduate need to acknowledge this hidden crisis and take the lead in addressing it.Professor of history, race and public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and the Suzanne Young Murray professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.Affordability is the most significant challenge facing higher education. Year after year, tuition increases outpace the cost of inflation and growth in most sectors of the economy. Higher tuition means fewer people can afford to go to college. This isn\u2019t just a problem at the most elite, private universities: At every type of school, from community colleges to state universities, rising costs not only raise barriers to entry but decrease completion rates.Getting into college is one thing, but experiencing college at the precipice of financial insolvency is another. For too many middle- and low-income students, coming up short a few hundred dollars can send them over the cliff.In an economy of unprecedented wealth inequality, the affordability crisis further exacerbates social and racial stratification. Affluent white families leverage their resources, networks and legacy status on behalf of their children. Privilege begets privilege.Poorer families have few of these advantages, especially among historically marginalized populations. These students are at the mercy of debt schemes, too few scholarships, and poor-performing for-profit schools. More and more, where you go to school is becoming as predictive of your future as your ZIP code is.With globalization and automation, college is not just about a decent job. Despite widespread anti-intellectualism and state legislative divestment policies, higher education should be the foundation of a universal experience of civic participation that promotes cultural literacy, a fairer distribution of wealth and the common good. The very health of our democracy is at stake.What to do?Higher education leaders can fix affordability by building advocacy networks among alumni and mobilizing them to pressure state legislatures to reinvest in public higher education for all. This is an untapped reservoir of political muscle.Chief executive, Robin Hood FoundationI can\u2019t overstate how important my college education was to changing my trajectory. Raised by a single mom in Baltimore and the Bronx in the \u201980s and \u201990s, I joined the Army at 17, and enrolled in junior college on a journey that would take me to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Today, families across the country know what my family knew: College can change lives.The data bears this out. A study highlighted in The New York Times shows that college graduates earn 71 percent more than Americans who only graduate high school.But while this path to prosperity may still exist in America, it is far more precarious than many realize. We\u2019re promising too many young Americans a pathway to success, and instead setting them up for failure.Today, most students don\u2019t finish college in a traditional fashion. This is the untold college crisis in America \u2014 the college completion crisis. In today\u2019s America, the majority of college students do not graduate on time, racking up debt, and undermining the investment and potential that college is designed to offer. At the majority of public universities, just 19 percent of students earn a four-year degree in four years.This crisis constitutes a collective and systemic failure of our academic institutions. High schools, while graduating historic numbers of students, are not equipping them with the skills they\u2019ll need in college. Every year, 1.7 million students need remedial courses as they enter college. Just one in 10 of these students will ever graduate. Tuition costs raise at a rate far higher than inflation and wages, and throw families seeking opportunity into debt. Too many colleges are unprepared for the nontraditional students filling their classrooms.Addressing this collective breakdown will require a collective buildup with how we approach postsecondary education. We must do a better job preparing students for college in high school. We must also provide wraparound supports for students in their first years of college so they don\u2019t fall through gaps that are deceptively wide. We must make it easy to receive financial aid, as every year, nearly $3 billion in federal financial aid is left unclaimed because people don\u2019t fill out the paperwork correctly. And we must offer effective trade schools and training programs for those students for whom traditional college is not the right fit.We\u2019re promising too many young Americans a pathway to success, and instead setting them up for failure. We can and we must fix this. President, University of North Carolina; United States secretary of education, 2005 to 2009.When it comes to accountability in education, we\u2019re losing ground. After nearly three decades of bipartisan work, the effort to close achievement gaps and push for steady improvement in school performance has stalled.This drift away from accountability is hurting our most vulnerable students \u2014 those most in need of a strong education. And it\u2019s already eroding trust in our schools and universities.There\u2019s no question that measuring educational progress is complicated. But the only thing worse than imperfect accountability is none at all.Past administrations helped build a broad coalition of business leaders, civil rights advocates and policymakers from across the ideological spectrum to support high standards for all students. There was a shared recognition that honest assessment is needed for real progress. No more hiding underserved populations within statistical averages; no more acceptance of inequity as inevitable.My experience as a university president these past few years underscores the need to align policies and expectations. In a state, like all others, where minority college completion lags, where rural students are underrepresented and where low-income students graduate at far lower rates than their wealthier peers, our universities had excellent intentions but poor incentives.Only through straightforward accountability measures can we focus on our greatest challenges. In North Carolina, that\u2019s meant brokering performance agreements with each of the U.N.C. System\u2019s chancellors to outline goals that are measured publicly and tied back to our state\u2019s Strategic Plan.Chairman, Faith and Freedom CoalitionHigher education faces many daunting challenges: relevance to millennials seeking opportunity in a global, high-tech economy; rising costs and exploding student debt; big-money athletics crowding out the core educational mission. But the greatest challenge may be the need to inculcate character.The financial crisis of 2008-9 painfully reminded us that great wealth without integrity always goes up in smoke. The easy credit that fueled massive profits on Wall Street led to a loss of $8 trillion held by U.S. households. The same could be said for the privacy and advertising scandals that have lopped billions off the market cap of Facebook and other social media companies. When greed comes before character and the common good, we are all the losers.If colleges and universities teach the young people that are their charge how to think well but not how to act ethically, how to grow a business but not how to do so with moral standards, if they shape the intellect but fail to inculcate integrity, they fail in their ultimate mission.How best to do this? Universities should integrate instruction on ethics and morality into business and other curriculums. In most cases \u2014 though not all \u2014 these ethics derive from a faith tradition. The joint M.B.A. degree program between the Yale Divinity School and the Yale School of Management provides a good model. Man does not live by bread alone.That is as true today as it was when Jesus of Nazareth taught it 2,000 years ago.Theodore Roosevelt, who graduated from Harvard, once observed, \u201cA thorough knowledge of the Bible is worth more than a college education.\u201d The pioneers of American higher education understood this fact. Roughly two-thirds of American colleges founded in the 18th and 19th centuries were affiliated with a religious denomination and undergraduate curriculums for much of our nation\u2019s history included instruction in the Bible as well as the ancient languages of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew in which it was originally written.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making History, Saudi Arabia Issues Driver\u2019s Licenses to 10 Women", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Saudi Arabia issued driver\u2019s licenses to 10 women on Monday, a historic move that came 20 days before the government had planned to lift its longstanding ban on women driving.The surprise announcement followed the detention of a number of Saudis who had campaigned for women\u2019s right to drive. Some are still being held and have been accused of grave crimes that the government has said sought to \u201cundermine the security and stability of the kingdom.\u201dThe lifting of the driving ban was championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a son of the Saudi king. Prince Mohammed has ordered a number of changes that seek to diversify the kingdom\u2019s oil-dependent economy and improve life for Saudis.Many Saudis have applauded what they say are efforts to make life in their ultraconservative kingdom more like life elsewhere. But Prince Mohammed\u2019s critics say the changes have come with a heavy dose of authoritarianism that has further restricted Saudis\u2019 already limited margins for expression.It was not immediately clear why the 10 women received their driver\u2019s licenses on Monday, 20 days before the official lifting of the ban, or whether that meant that the driving ban had in effect been lifted early.A government press office announced the news and provided quotations from the women along with photographs of them and their new licenses.A short video clip of the first of the women being handed her license from a uniformed traffic official was widely shared on social media.One of the women posted a photo of her new license on Twitter with a blue sky behind it.\u201cThe dream became a reality,\u201d the woman, Ahlam al-Thunayan, wrote, thanking both King Salman and Prince Mohammed.The announcement said 2,000 more Saudi women could receive their licenses next week, but it provided no details about who they were or where the licenses would be issued.Allowing women to drive is a major social change in Saudi Arabia, where women have long been kept out of public life and limited to certain professions. This has begun to change in recent years, with more young Saudi women than men graduating from universities and many women working in fields that they used to be locked out of.Being able to drive could accelerate this process, making it easier for women to get themselves to and from work without having to pay for taxis or the foreign drivers who now shuttle them around.But parts of Saudi society remain deeply conservative, and some men could prevent their female relatives from driving, despite the lack of a legal means to do so.Among those who are still detained are Eman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef, both academics and women\u2019s rights campaigners; Loujain al-Hathloul, who was detained for more than 70 days in 2014 when she tried to drive her car into Saudi Arabia from the United Arab Emirates; and Ibrahim Mudaimeegh, a lawyer who defended her.Addressing the arrests, the kingdom\u2019s public prosecution office said on Sunday that 17 people had been detained on charges that included cooperating with people and organizations hostile to the kingdom and providing \u201cfinancial and moral support to hostile elements abroad.\u201dEight of those arrested were released after their cases were reviewed, the statement said, and five men and four women are still detained. The statement did not identify any of the detained by name.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Uncertainty Clouds Economy, Europe Pulls Back on Easy Money", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIGA, Latvia \u2014 A trade war with the United States looms. Populists have taken power in Italy, posing a new threat to the euro. Growth is sluggish, and there is even talk of another banking crisis.It would not seem the ideal time to put the brakes on Europe\u2019s economy. But that is what the European Central Bank is preparing to do.What will happen next is uncertain, because the European Central Bank has pumped unprecedented amounts of money into the economy. There may be unpleasant surprises: think real estate bubbles, more wobbling banks or a surge in bankruptcies.\u201cIt\u2019s not the right time,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, a monetary policy expert at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels. \u201cIf you look at what happened in the last few quarters, everything became more disappointing.\u201dIn countries like Italy, there lurk an unknown number of so-called zombie companies \u2014 businesses that have avoided bankruptcy only because of low interest rates and tolerant banks. A rise in interest rates could prompt a mass collapse of those weak companies.Some economists are even resurrecting the word \u201cstagflation\u201d \u2014 a dreaded condition in which inflation rises at the same time that growth stagnates. The region\u2019s residents would face the prospect of paying more for everyday goods even as their wages stayed the same.The central bank will cut stimulus in half after September, and end it altogether after December. In a concession to those who think it is being too hasty, the council said it would not raise its benchmark interest rates until after the summer of 2019. By historical standards, money will remain cheap.Still, those decisions mark a clear change of direction.Since 2015, the European Central Bank has been handing money around in a way possible only for an organization that has a license to print it.It bought almost 2.5 trillion euros, or $3 trillion, in debt that had been issued by not just governments, but all manner of public utilities, breweries, grocery chains, consumer goods conglomerates and automakers. In effect, the bank became the world\u2019s biggest bond fund.The point was to flood financial markets with so much cash that companies and governments would have to pay little or no interest to raise money. And the strategy worked.Interest rates fell so low that, for a time, blue-chip companies could borrow money essentially for free. Real estate prices recovered. In countries like Germany and the Netherlands, shops and restaurants are desperately trying to find workers because the labor market has bounced back so strongly. Growth in the eurozone in 2017 was the best since 2007, before the financial crisis.But early this year, warning signs started to appear. Factories reported fewer orders, and Mr. Trump issued a threat \u2014 since carried out \u2014 to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from Europe. On Thursday, the European Union\u2019s member states unanimously backed a plan to impose import duties on \u20ac2.8 billion worth of American products.The new disruptions to trade have unsettled businesses. Companies like ABB, a supplier of power equipment based in Zurich, or Voestalpine, an Austrian maker of steel components for the auto industry, have had to pay more to deliver special steel alloys to their American subsidiaries. The specialized steel is not available from United States suppliers, they say.Now, the 19 countries that share the euro must face these challenges with substantially less central bank support.Economists at the Swiss bank UBS estimated that the bond-buying program has added 0.75 percentage points per year to economic growth since 2015. Put another way, that means the central bank was responsible for about a third of the growth rate last year.The central bank\u2019s own estimates are more modest, but not by much. That means vulnerable countries could be in for a shock when the bank takes the money away.One of the biggest risks is Italy. Its national debt is among the highest in the world. Italy\u2019s new government includes leaders who have talked of leaving the euro. Growth is meager, and unemployment is 11.2 percent, more than three times the rate in Germany.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, is no stranger to Italy\u2019s issues \u2014 earlier in his career, he was the highest-ranking civil servant in the Italian Finance Ministry. He indicated on Thursday that the bank would take action only if there were signs that problems in Italy were spreading to other countries.Mr. Draghi also acknowledged that trade tensions with the United States had worsened considerably. Disruption of the world trade order could \u201ccreate very serious damage,\u201d he said.As insurance against such risks, the central bank kept its options open. The end of quantitative easing depends on \u201cincoming data,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. Mr. Draghi suggested that bond purchases could be ramped up again if needed.But his clear message was that the European Central Bank will not be thrown off course by the machinations of populist politicians, a few months of unsettling economic data or threats by Mr. Trump to impose duties on German cars.\u201cWe have taken these decisions knowing that the economy is in a better situation,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.In the same breath, though, he betrayed a trace of doubt.

{"Headline": "How China Got Sri Lanka to Cough Up a Port", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBANTOTA, Sri Lanka \u2014 Every time Sri Lanka\u2019s president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, turned to his Chinese allies for loans and assistance with an ambitious port project, the answer was yes.Yes, though feasibility studies said the port wouldn\u2019t work. Yes, though other frequent lenders like India had refused. Yes, though Sri Lanka\u2019s debt was ballooning rapidly under Mr. Rajapaksa.Over years of construction and renegotiation with China Harbor Engineering Company, one of Beijing\u2019s largest state-owned enterprises, the Hambantota Port Development Project distinguished itself mostly by failing, as predicted. With tens of thousands of ships passing by along one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes, the port drew only 34 ships in 2012.And then the port became China\u2019s.The transfer gave China control of territory just a few hundred miles off the shores of a rival, India, and a strategic foothold along a critical commercial and military waterway.The case is one of the most vivid examples of China\u2019s ambitious use of loans and aid to gain influence around the world \u2014 and of its willingness to play hardball to collect.The debt deal also intensified some of the harshest accusations about President Xi Jinping\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative: that the global investment and lending program amounts to a debt trap for vulnerable countries around the world, fueling corruption and autocratic behavior in struggling democracies.Months of interviews with Sri Lankan, Indian, Chinese and Western officials and analysis of documents and agreements stemming from the port project present a stark illustration of how China and the companies under its control ensured their interests in a small country hungry for financing.Mr. Rajapaksa and his aides did not respond to multiple requests for comment, made over several months, for this article. Officials for China Harbor also would not comment.Estimates by the Sri Lankan Finance Ministry paint a bleak picture: This year, the government is expected to generate $14.8 billion in revenue, but its scheduled debt repayments, to an array of lenders around the world, come to $12.3 billion.\u201cJohn Adams said infamously that a way to subjugate a country is through either the sword or debt. China has chosen the latter,\u201d said Brahma Chellaney, an analyst who often advises the Indian government and is affiliated with the Center for Policy Research, a think tank in New Delhi.Indian officials, in particular, fear that Sri Lanka is struggling so much that the Chinese government may be able to dangle debt relief in exchange for its military\u2019s use of assets like the Hambantota port \u2014 though the final lease agreement forbids military activity there without Sri Lanka\u2019s invitation.\u201cThe only way to justify the investment in Hambantota is from a national security standpoint \u2014 that they will bring the People\u2019s Liberation Army in,\u201d said Shivshankar Menon, who served as India\u2019s foreign secretary and then its national security adviser as the Hambantota port was being built.The relationship between China and Sri Lanka had long been amicable, with Sri Lanka an early recognizer of Mao\u2019s Communist government after the Chinese Revolution. But it was during a more recent conflict \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s brutal 26-year civil war with ethnic Tamil separatists \u2014 that China became indispensable.Mr. Rajapaksa, who was elected in 2005, presided over the last years of the war, when Sri Lanka became increasingly isolated by accusations of human rights abuses. Under him, Sri Lanka relied heavily on China for economic support, military equipment and political cover at the United Nations to block potential sanctions.So when the president began calling for a vast new port development project at Hambantota, his sleepy home district, the few roadblocks in its way proved ineffective.From the start, officials questioned the wisdom of a second major port, in a country a quarter the size of Britain and with a population of 22 million, when the main port in the capital was thriving and had room to expand. Feasibility studies commissioned by the government had starkly concluded that a port at Hambantota was not economically viable.\u201cThey approached us for the port at the beginning, and Indian companies said no,\u201d said Mr. Menon, the former Indian foreign secretary. \u201cIt was an economic dud then, and it\u2019s an economic dud now.\u201dThe Sri Lanka Ports Authority began devising what officials believed was a careful, economically sound plan in 2007, according to an official involved in the project. It called for a limited opening for business in 2010, and for revenue to be coming in before any major expansion.The first major loan it took on the project came from the Chinese government\u2019s Export-Import Bank, or Exim, for $307 million. But to obtain the loan, Sri Lanka was required to accept Beijing\u2019s preferred company, China Harbor, as the port\u2019s builder, according to a United States Embassy cable from the time, leaked to WikiLeaks.That is a typical demand of China for its projects around the world, rather than allowing an open bidding process. Across the region, Beijing\u2019s government is lending out billions of dollars, being repaid at a premium to hire Chinese companies and thousands of Chinese workers, according to officials across the region.There were other strings attached to the loan, as well, in a sign that China saw strategic value in the Hambantota port from the beginning.Nihal Rodrigo, a former Sri Lankan foreign secretary and ambassador to China, said that discussions with Chinese officials at the time made it clear that intelligence sharing was an integral, if not public, part of the deal. In an interview with The Times, Mr. Rodrigo characterized the Chinese line as, \u201cWe expect you to let us know who is coming and stopping here.\u201dIn later years, Chinese officials and the China Harbor company went to great lengths to keep relations strong with Mr. Rajapaksa, who for years had faithfully acquiesced to such terms.In the final months of Sri Lanka\u2019s 2015 election, China\u2019s ambassador broke with diplomatic norms and lobbied voters, even caddies at Colombo\u2019s premier golf course, to support Mr. Rajapaksa over the opposition, which was threatening to tear up economic agreements with the Chinese government.As the January election inched closer, large payments started to flow toward the president\u2019s circle.At least $7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbor\u2019s account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s campaign, according to a document, seen by The Times, from an active internal government investigation. The document details China Harbor\u2019s bank account number \u2014 ownership of which was verified \u2014 and intelligence gleaned from questioning of the people to whom the checks were made out.With 10 days to go before polls opened, around $3.7 million was distributed in checks: $678,000 to print campaign T-shirts and other promotional material and $297,000 to buy supporters gifts, including women\u2019s saris. Another $38,000 was paid to a popular Buddhist monk who was supporting Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s electoral bid, while two checks totaling $1.7 million were delivered by volunteers to Temple Trees, his official residence.Most of the payments were from a subaccount controlled by China Harbor, named \u201cHPDP Phase 2,\u201d shorthand for Hambantota Port Development Project.Some Chinese officials have become concerned that the nearly institutional graft surrounding such projects represents a liability for China, and raises the bar needed for profitability. President Xi acknowledged the worry in a speech last year, saying, \u201cWe will also strengthen international cooperation on anticorruption in order to build the Belt and Road Initiative with integrity.\u201dIn Bangladesh, for example, officials said in January that China Harbor would be banned from future contracts over accusations that the company attempted to bribe an official at the ministry of roads, stuffing $100,000 into a box of tea, government officials said in interviews. And China Harbor\u2019s parent company, China Communications Construction Company, was banned for eight years in 2009 from bidding on World Bank projects because of corrupt practices in the Philippines.Since the port seizure in Sri Lanka, Chinese officials have started suggesting that Belt and Road is not an open-ended government commitment to finance development across three continents.\u201cIf we cannot manage the risk well, the Belt and Road projects cannot go far or well,\u201d said Jin Qi, the chairwoman of the Silk Road Fund, a large state-owned investment fund, during the China Development Forum in late March.In Sri Lanka\u2019s case, port officials and Chinese analysts have also not given up the view that the Hambantota port could become profitable, or at least strengthen China\u2019s trade capacity in the region.Ray Ren, China Merchant Port\u2019s representative in Sri Lanka and the head of the Hambantota port\u2019s operations, insisted that \u201cthe location of Sri Lanka is ideal for international trade.\u201d And he dismissed the negative feasibility studies, saying they were done many years ago when Hambantota was \u201ca small fishing hamlet.\u201dHu Shisheng, the director of South Asia studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that China clearly recognized the strategic value of the Hambantota port. But he added: \u201cOnce China wants to exert its geostrategic value, the strategic value of the port will be gone. Big countries cannot fight in Sri Lanka \u2014 it would be wiped out.\u201dAlthough the Hambantota port first opened in a limited way in 2010, before the Belt and Road Initiative was announced, the Chinese government quickly folded the project into the global program.The seaport is not the only grand project built with Chinese loans in Hambantota, a sparsely populated area on Sri Lanka\u2019s southeastern coast that is still largely overrun by jungle.Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s advisers had laid out a methodical approach to how the port might expand after opening, ensuring that some revenue would be coming in before taking on much more debt.But in 2009, the president had grown impatient. His 65th birthday was approaching the following year, and to mark the occasion he wanted a grand opening at the Hambantota port \u2014 including the beginning of an ambitious expansion 10 years ahead of the Port Authority\u2019s original timeline.Chinese laborers began working day and night to get the port ready, officials said. But when workers dredged the land and then flooded it to create the basin of the port, they had not taken into account a large boulder that partly blocked the entrance, preventing the entry of large ships, like oil tankers, that the port\u2019s business model relied on.Ports Authority officials, unwilling to cross the president, quickly moved ahead anyway. The Hambantota port opened in an elaborate celebration on Nov. 18, 2010, Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s birthday. Then it sat waiting for business while the rock blocked it.China Harbor blasted the boulder a year later, at a cost of $40 million, an exorbitant price that raised concerns among diplomats and government officials. Some openly speculated about whether the company was simply overcharging or the price tag included kickbacks to Mr. Rajapaksa.By 2012, the port was struggling to attract ships \u2014 which preferred to berth nearby at the Colombo port \u2014 and construction costs were rising as the port began expanding ahead of schedule. The government decreed later that year that ships carrying car imports bound for Colombo port would instead offload their cargo at Hambantota to kick-start business there. Still, only 34 ships berthed at Hambantota in 2012, compared with 3,667 ships at the Colombo port, according to a Finance Ministry annual report.\u201cWhen I came to the government, I called the minister of national planning and asked for the justification of Hambantota Port,\u201d Harsha de Silva, the state minister for national policies and economic affairs, said in an interview. \u201cShe said, \u2018We were asked to do it, so we did it.\u2019 \u201dDetermined to keep expanding the port, Mr. Rajapaksa went back to the Chinese government in 2012, asking for $757 million.The Chinese agreed again. But this time, the terms were much steeper.The first loan, at $307 million, had originally come at a variable rate that usually settled above 1 or 2 percent after the global financial crash in 2008. (For comparison, rates on similar Japanese loans for infrastructure projects run below half a percent.)But to secure fresh funding, that initial loan was renegotiated to a much higher 6.3 percent fixed rate. Mr. Rajapaksa acquiesced.The incoming government, led by President Maithripala Sirisena, came to office with a mandate to scrutinize Sri Lanka\u2019s financial deals. It also faced a daunting amount of debt: Under Mr. Rajapaksa, the country\u2019s debt had increased threefold, to $44.8 billion when he left office. And for 2015 alone, a $4.68 billion payment was due at year\u2019s end.The new government was eager to reorient Sri Lanka toward India, Japan and the West. But officials soon realized that no other country could fill the financial or economic space that China held in Sri Lanka.\u201cWe inherited a purposefully run-down economy \u2014 the revenues were insufficient to pay the interest charges, let alone capital repayment,\u201d said Ravi Karunanayake, who was finance minister during the new government\u2019s first year in office.\u201cWe did keep taking loans,\u201d he added. \u201cA new government can\u2019t just stop loans. It\u2019s a relay; you need to take them until economic discipline is introduced.\u201dGovernment officials began meeting in 2016 with their Chinese counterparts to strike a deal, hoping to get the port off Sri Lanka\u2019s balance sheet and avoid outright default. But the Chinese demanded that a Chinese company take a dominant equity share in the port in return, Sri Lankan officials say \u2014 writing down the debt was not an option China would accept.When Sri Lanka was given a choice, it was over which state-owned company would take control: either China Harbor or China Merchants Port, according to the final agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, although it was never released publicly in full.China Merchants got the contract, and it immediately pressed for more: Company officials demanded 15,000 acres of land around the port to build an industrial zone, according to two officials with knowledge of the negotiations. The Chinese company argued that the port itself was not worth the $1.1 billion it would pay for its equity \u2014 money that would close out Sri Lanka\u2019s debt on the port.Some government officials bitterly opposed the terms, but there was no leeway, according to officials involved in the negotiations. The new agreement was signed in July 2017, and took effect in December.The deal left some appearance of Sri Lankan ownership: Among other things, it created a joint company to manage the port\u2019s operations and collect revenue, with 85 percent owned by China Merchants Port and the remaining 15 percent controlled by Sri Lanka\u2019s government.But lawyers specializing in port acquisitions said Sri Lanka\u2019s small stake meant little, given the leverage that China Merchants Port retained over board personnel and operating decisions.When the agreement was initially negotiated, it left open whether the port and surrounding land could be used by the Chinese military, which Indian officials asked the Sri Lankan government to explicitly forbid. The final agreement bars foreign countries from using the port for military purposes unless granted permission by the government in Colombo.China had a stake in Sri Lanka\u2019s main port as well: China Harbor was building a new terminal there, known at the time as Colombo Port City. Along with that deal came roughly 50 acres of land, solely held by the Chinese company, that Sri Lanka had no sovereignty on.When the new Sri Lankan government came to office, it sought assurances that the port would never again welcome Chinese submarines \u2014 of particular concern because they are difficult to detect and often used for intelligence gathering. But Sri Lankan officials had little real control.Sri Lankan officials are quick to point out that the agreement explicitly rules out China\u2019s military use of the site. But others also note that Sri Lanka\u2019s government, still heavily indebted to China, could be pressured to allow it.And, as Mr. de Silva, the state minister for national policies and economic affairs, put it, \u201cGovernments can change.\u201dNow, he and others are watching carefully as Mr. Rajapaksa, China\u2019s preferred partner in Sri Lanka, has been trying to stage a political comeback. The former president\u2019s new opposition party swept municipal elections in February. Presidential elections are coming up next year, and general elections in 2020.Although Mr. Rajapaksa is barred from running again because of term limits, his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former defense secretary, appears to be readying to take the mantle.\u201cIt will be Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s call. If he says it\u2019s one of the brothers, that person will have a very strong claim,\u201d said Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the central bank governor under Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s government, who still advises the family. \u201cEven if he\u2019s no longer the president, as the Constitution is structured, Mahinda will be the main power base.\u201dReporting was contributed by Keith Bradsher and Sui-Lee Wee from Beijing, and Mujib Mashal, Dharisha Bastians and Arthur Wamanan from Sri Lanka.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Just the Fear of a Trade War Is Straining the Global Economy", "Date": "2018-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the conflict broadens, shipments are slowing at ports and airfreight terminals around the world. Prices for crucial raw materials are rising. At factories from Germany to Mexico, orders are being cut and investments delayed. American farmers are losing sales as trading partners hit back with duties of their own.Workers in a Canadian steel mill scrambled to recall rail cars headed to the United States border after Mr. Trump this month slapped tariffs on imported metals. A Seattle customer soon canceled an order.\u201cThe impact was felt immediately,\u201d said Jon Hobbs president of AltaSteel in Edmonton. \u201cThe penny is really dropping now as to what this means to people\u2019s businesses.\u201dThe Trump administration portrays its confrontational stance as a means of forcing multinational companies to bring factory production back to American shores. Mr. Trump has described trade wars as \u201ceasy to win\u201d while vowing to rebalance the United States\u2019 trade deficits with major economies like China and Germany.Mr. Trump\u2019s offensive may yet prove to be a negotiating tactic that threatens economic pain to force deals, rather than a move to a full-blown trade war. Americans appear to be better insulated than most from the consequences of trade hostilities. As a large economy in relatively strong shape, the United States can find domestic buyers for its goods and services when export opportunities shrink.Before most trade measures fully take effect, businesses are already grappling with the consequences \u2014 threats to their supplies, uncertainty over the terms of trade and gnawing fear about what comes next.\u201cJust talking about protectionism is causing trouble,\u201d said Marie Owens Thomsen, global chief economist at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s an existential risk to the world economy.\u201dA gauge of world trade tracked by Oxford Economics, a research firm in London, recently registered its weakest showing since early 2017.\u201cLet us not understate the macroeconomic impact,\u201d the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, warned this past week about trade conflicts. \u201cIt would be serious, not only if the United States took action, but especially if other countries were to retaliate, notably those who would be most affected, such as Canada, Europe and Germany.\u201dThreats to trade are emerging just as the global economy contends with other substantial challenges.The Trump administration has embroiled the United States in increasingly acrimonious conflicts with huge trading partners.\u201cIf you seriously disrupt any of these three, you\u2019re going to feel the effects,\u201d said Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cIf you disrupt all three at once, you\u2019re going to feel it quite severely.\u201dThe Greater Port of Houston, a network of nearly 200 terminals lining 25 miles of channel, is one of the busiest seaborne cargo hubs on the planet. It is also a major local employer, and the largest importer of steel in North America. Steel imports have been surging, especially pipes used by the energy industry.Sixteen years ago, when President George W. Bush put tariffs on steel, imports fell substantially. Such memories now stoke modern-day fears.\u201cWe\u2019re kind of in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d said Roger Guenther, executive director for the Port of Houston Authority.For companies that make steel and aluminum, the American tariffs have presented a direct and menacing challenge to their businesses.At Alta, the steel mill in Edmonton, the metals tariffs delivered an immediate crisis. Roughly one-fifth of the company\u2019s business involves shipping steel to American customers.Suddenly, the border separating Canada from the United States was effectively enshrouded in fog. The company redirected rail cars destined for customers in the United States, incurring extra freight charges reaching 100,000 Canadian dollars (about $76,000).The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.Lawyers for some of Alta\u2019s customers have suggested that certain products might be classified to avoid tripping the American tariffs, which apply only to specific types of steel. Yet for now, the company is waiting for rulings from overwhelmed American customs officials.\u201cWe do not know when we will get an answer out of the U.S. government,\u201d Mr. Hobbs said. \u201cNobody, including the U.S. border protection agency, knows what to do.\u201dAcross Europe, steel makers fret about an indirect consequence of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 cheap Chinese steel previously destined for the United States, now redirected to their continent.\u201cWe have seen increases,\u201d said Mathias Ternell, international affairs director at Jernkontoret, a Swedish steel industry association in Stockholm. \u201cThis is what Swedish companies and European companies worry about the most.\u201dFor buyers of steel and aluminum inside the United States, the tariffs have increased prices, discouraging investment.Electrolux, the Swedish manufacturer of household appliances, recently postponed plans to upgrade a stove factory in Tennessee, citing uncertainties created by the tariffs.In the suburbs of Austin, Tex., Matt Bush, vice president of a small company that makes structures used in office buildings and retail spaces, said steel tariffs would force his company to pay as much as $50,000 a month extra for metal.\u201cYou have to imagine all the people who are purchasing raw steel and aluminum for input into their business are in the same predicament,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably staggering how far that reaches.\u201dIn the Spanish city of Toledo, Extol, a company that makes parts for the automobile and railroad industries, has recently seen customers demand supply contracts lasting no more than three months, rather than the usual one-year duration. With the price of aluminum rising, buyers are reluctant to commit, said the company\u2019s chief executive, Fernando Busto.\u201cWe are watching events with enormous worry,\u201d Mr. Busto said. \u201cThe political decisions of Donald Trump are resulting in turbulence and volatility.\u201dFar beyond the realm of metal, the impact of trade skirmishes are rippling out, hitting small businesses and consumers.In Mexico, anxiety about trade has persisted ever since Mr. Trump took office, given his threats to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement, and his designs on constructing a wall along the border. Ordinary Mexicans have absorbed the hit as the peso has plunged in value, raising the cost of everyday goods from the United States.\u201cThat president is driving us to bankruptcy,\u201d said Gustavo Ferreyra Olivares, a fruit seller who has operated a stall at a covered market in Mexico City for 35 years. \u201cTrump is the one who has raised the prices.\u201dMost of the fresh fruit at his stall was grown in Mexico. But Granny Smith apples nestled in molded cardboard bore the USA label. So did a pile of glistening Gala apples, and neat lines of Red Delicious.Under Nafta, Mexico has grown into the world\u2019s largest importer of American apples. But sales are down because the price has gone up by nearly one-fifth in the past week alone.\u201cMexico is a big importer of apples,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we decide to boycott them, they will all have to stay up there.\u201dGlobal commodities markets are wrestling with the impacts of trade conflict, especially as China seeks alternatives to American suppliers.In recent years, as the ranks of China\u2019s middle class have grown, so has the national appetite for pork. Raising growing numbers of pigs has forced China to import increasing volumes of American soybeans.But China has taken direct aim at American farms in retaliation for Mr. Trump\u2019s metals tariffs, threatening duties on soybeans from the United States. Chinese pork producers have turned their sights to Brazil and Argentina, the only countries that now produce enough soybeans to offer a potential alternative to the American supply.On the other side of the Atlantic, Jesper Pagh sat in his office in Copenhagen and watched the result \u2014 rising prices for soybeans on world markets.Mr. Pagh oversees the livestock feed business at the DLG Group, an agribusiness conglomerate that supplies customers in Sweden, Germany and Denmark. His company has traditionally tapped South America for soybeans. Now, Chinese competition was increasing the cost.American soybeans were suddenly available, but they presented a mismatch. Europe imports soybean meal, not the beans. In the United States, the crushing plants that make meal were already tied up by domestic customers.A veteran of the commodity world, Mr. Pagh is accustomed to prices that fluctuate. His company relies on long-term supply contracts, limiting its vulnerability to price shifts.Still, here was a new variable.\u201cIt\u2019s another factor that\u2019s affecting the volatility and the level of nervousness in the market,\u201d Mr. Pagh said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that really keeps me awake at night, but, of course, it can escalate.\u201dIan Austen reported from Ottawa and Elizabeth Malkin from Mexico City.

M. Watson, a conservation scientist at the University of Queensland. He points to Australia\u2019s Barrow Island Marine Park, granted a wealthy nation\u2019s highest level of protection because it is home to variety of rare mammals, reptiles, birds and invertebrates, many found nowhere else in the world.

I let out a shriek as I landed on the sharp gravel of the driveway. Splayed out on the stones now, I could hear the irritation in his voice. It was a Saturday; he had wood to stack for the long Northern New York winter ahead.He flipped the switch on the wood splitter and it went quiet. I glanced up and saw him still standing by the wood pile with one fist on his hip, head tilted, impatiently awaiting my response. Warm blood flowed from the gash on my left knee. \u201cI fell off my bike,\u201d I yelled back, trying to catch my breath between sobs.\u201cJesus. You\u2019d think someone died, screaming like that,\u201d he said, shaking his head. He flipped the splitter back on. \u201cGet up. You\u2019re fine.\u201dI wasn\u2019t fine. I was an 8-year-old girl, scared and bleeding on the ground. I should have gotten stitches that day; instead I got scolded.My mother and stepfather are blue-collar, no-nonsense forces of nature \u2014 hardworking, blunt and unbending. Maybe they came into the world that way, or perhaps the punishing economy and harsh weather of our forgotten rural town had worn away their sense of empathy over the years.I admire their strength, but I could never match it no matter how hard I tried.My stepfather built our house with his own hands and often worked construction jobs even in the winter when temperatures could dip below freezing, and my mother juggled multiple factory jobs, standing on concrete floors for long hours in order to put food on the table and presents under the Christmas tree for our family of eight.I knew they loved me. But I don\u2019t think they always liked me. While I inherited their strong work ethic, I\u2019m a far cry from their type of tough. I am naturally empathetic, optimistic and sensitive. Even as a child, I was acutely attuned to other people\u2019s emotions. I was too sensitive, too curious and too concerned for the sort of people who prefer not to feel anything at all.Dismissing pain was commonplace in our house, and weakness wasn\u2019t welcome. When my mother and stepfather said, \u201cOh, you poor baby,\u201d they weren\u2019t acknowledging my pain or expressing empathy. They meant: \u201cToo bad. Toughen up.\u201dYou can silence a child with those words, but you can\u2019t cure a neurological disease with them. I\u2019ve tried.\u201cGet up. You\u2019re fine,\u201d I told myself, as electric jolts pulsed through my brain.\u201cToo bad. Toughen up,\u201d I admonished, while orbs bobbed in front of my eyes.I tried.Despite the visual disturbances, pulsating headache and weakness, I carried on. My friend and I dropped by the department of motor vehicles to renew my license and cracked jokes about how I\u2019d never forget this license photo \u2014 taken when I couldn\u2019t even see the camera through the pseudo-psychedelic dance in front of my face.It was only when I picked up a magazine and couldn\u2019t grasp the meaning of the simple words written on the cover that I finally realized something was very wrong. My brain was cloaked in an impenetrable fog. I could not make out the shape of my own hands in front of me. I tried to form a short sentence, but couldn\u2019t recall a single word, or move my mouth to speak. No amount of \u201ctough\u201d was going to conquer this.I ended up in the emergency room that day. After monitoring me and pumping me full of medicine to abort the S.H.M. attack, the doctor delivered a diagnosis and a warning. \u201cYou have hemiplegic migraines,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou need to slow down.\u201dThere it was, on official hospital letterhead: I wasn\u2019t fine.This time, there was no one to dismiss my pain. The doctor had given it a name. He didn\u2019t tell me to suck it up. He\u2019d advised me to slow down. Even my mother \u2014 the hardworking woman who taught me much of what I know about being tough \u2014 echoed his concerns. Her advice was no longer \u201cToo bad. Toughen up.\u201d Instead she begged me repeatedly to slow down, rest often, and take care.I didn\u2019t listen.A lifetime of playing \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d couldn\u2019t be undone in one doctor\u2019s visit. It would take several more years, more attacks and more trips to the emergency room to convince me that this was not something I could tough my way out of.I survived that attack, but while my body recovered in the foggy days that followed, I realized it was time to let go of this need to appear tough enough \u2014 or risk more serious physical consequences. Since that childhood day when I lay splayed on the stones in my driveway, I\u2019d spent a lifetime believing that my pain wasn\u2019t real, despite concrete evidence and a doctor\u2019s diagnosis. Now, it was clear that acceptance of my pain was the only way I could ever hope to keep the symptoms of S.H.M. at bay.As Americans, we live in a culture of \u201ctoughness\u201d rather than one of empathy, one that values a stoic exterior no matter what sort of pain may be attacking the body or mind. And it\u2019s not just about my medical condition; it\u2019s practically universal. In trying to make sense in recent days of the apparent suicides of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain \u2014 two intrepid, wildly successful and outwardly high-spirited people \u2014 it seems a new segment of the public has also begun to think about the deadly costs of \u201ctoughing it out\u201d and putting on the show we think others want to see.We don\u2019t need to toughen up. What we need now is to take care \u2014 of ourselves, our health and one another.Advertisement"}

The winner is all the aggrieved people in our region, all the oppressed in the world.\u201d\u201cOur citizens should not be provoked, whatever the result is,\u201d he said, urging his supporters to continue their campaign for democracy through peaceful means.The victory means Mr. Erdogan will almost certainly make good on his desire to become the country\u2019s longest-ruling leader, surpassing Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded the modern Turkish republic out of the ruins of the collapsed Ottoman Empire.Under the new system brought in by last year\u2019s referendum, Mr. Erdogan can run for a second term as president \u2014 and a third, if he were to call an early election \u2014 opening the possibility that he could stay in office until 2032.In parliamentary races, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party placed first, with more than 42 percent of the vote, the Anadolu agency reported, enough to retain a majority in alliance with the Nationalist Movement Party, which received about 11 percent.Defenders of Turkey\u2019s multiparty democracy did receive some cause for hope: The H.D.P. party, a liberal democratic party that emphasizes minority rights and is led by an imprisoned Kurd, Selahattin Demirtas, surpassed the 10 percent threshold needed to enter Parliament.The deputy head of the Supreme Election Board said five parties had passed the threshold.Soner Cagaptay, a scholar and author who has called Mr. Erdogan a \u201cnew sultan\u201d in the vein of the absolute rulers of the Ottoman Empire, said the new Parliament would be the most politically diverse in 35 years, with nearly every major political faction represented.Support for Mr. Erdogan appeared to be similar to its level in last year\u2019s constitutional referendum, \u201csuggesting that polarization around his simultaneously adored and loathed persona continues to divide Turkey,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay said.Amanda Sloat, an Obama administration official who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that \u201cone of the country\u2019s biggest challenges for the foreseeable future remains the deep polarization of Turkish society.\u201dShe said Mr. Erdogan\u2019s reliance on the Nationalist Movement Party for its majority \u201cmeans foreign policy will likely remain influenced by nationalist considerations.\u201dBut she said the hard-fought election showed that Turkish democracy was resilient.\u201cThe opposition parties ran surprisingly strong, energetic and competitive campaigns,\u201d Ms. Sloat said. \u201cParliament will be diverse, with the coalition system ensuring the representation of a wide range of parties \u2014 including the Kurds.\u201dThe victory for Mr. Erdogan and his allies appeared to defy last-minute polls indicating that they were in danger. The final opinion poll conducted by the independent Metropoll suggested that Mr. Erdogan might suffer a double blow, being forced into a second round of voting for the presidency and losing control of Parliament.The election was seen in large measure as a referendum on Mr. Erdogan\u2019s rule, with many voters expressing concerns about what they say is his growing authoritarian streak and a struggling economy, which they blame on corruption and mismanagement.The economy, once a strong point for Mr. Erdogan, has stumbled badly in the last year. Turkey has accumulated significant foreign debt, the Turkish lira has lost 20 percent of its value and direct foreign investment has plunged as investors have been scared off by the president\u2019s increasingly belligerent and anti-Western tone.The economic turmoil may make Mr. Erdogan more careful about picking fights with the West, but it could also spell growing unrest and political challenges at home against a newly energized and unified opposition.Bekir Agirdir, founder of the polling firm Konda, predicted that Mr. Erdogan would struggle to rule the country: His constitutional changes in 2017 to create an executive presidency were approved narrowly, 51 percent to 49 percent.\u201cHe cannot rule the remaining 49 percent,\u201d Mr. Agirdir said in an interview before Sunday\u2019s election. He suggested that Mr. Erdogan was bound to see a showdown eventually. \u201cThis is the rehearsal. The real election will be in two to three years\u2019 time.\u201dMany in the opposition saw the campaign as a final chance to save democracy. \u201cWe are crossing the last bridge before it falls,\u201d said Burcu Akcaru, a founder of the new Good Party. \u201cThen we leave the country.\u201dWhen he came to power 15 years ago, Mr. Erdogan won wide support as a pro-European, moderate Islamist who supported democracy and economic liberalization. But over the years the earlier philosophy was replaced by a more personal and dictatorial rule, particularly after the failed coup in July 2016. Along the way, he either abandoned or alienated many of his allies.The new presidential system will codify the executive powers Mr. Erdogan has already been exercising under the state of emergency. Under the new system, the office of prime minister, which Mr. Erdogan held from 2003 to 2014, will be abolished. The cabinet will be composed of presidential appointees rather than elected lawmakers. And Parliament\u2019s powers are reduced, including oversight of the budget.Mr. Erdogan has imprisoned many of his critics, including thousands of Kurdish politicians and activists, members of civil society organizations, and Islamists accused of being followers of Fethullah Gulen, the cleric whom Turkish leaders accuse of organizing the coup attempt.Devlet Bahceli, the leader of the Nationalist Movement Party, whose result on Sunday ensures the alliance\u2019s parliamentary majority for Mr. Erdogan, said of the opposition: \u201cThey wanted to demolish us, they couldn\u2019t manage; they wanted to ravage us, they failed.\u201d\u201cThose who spell disasters hit the consciousness of Turkishness and fell apart,\u201d he said.The election\u2019s losers must now figure out how to maintain a voice in an increasingly authoritarian nation.Mr. Demirtas, the imprisoned Kurdish leader whose left-leaning minority-rights party won 11 percent of the vote, had urged Turks to vote against Mr. Erdogan and his allies, encouraging them to grab an opportunity before entering a \u201cdark and obscure tunnel.\u201d\u201cWhat you go through nowadays is only a trailer of the one-man regime. The most frightening part of the movie hasn\u2019t even started yet,\u201d he warned. \u201cEverything will be arranged in accordance with the desire, pleasure and interests of one man. You will feel unable to breathe in a regime of fear and despair; you will feel like you are strangled.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It Costs to Be Smuggled Across the U.S. Border", "Date": "2018-06-30", "News": "Bribes and shakedowns. Days in hideaways without food. For many fleeing violence in Central America, this is what thousands of dollars gets them on the journey to the United States.MATAMOROS, Mexico \u2014 Shortly before dawn one Sunday last August, a driver in an S.U.V. picked up Christopher Cruz at a stash house in this border city near the Gulf of Mexico. The 22-year-old from El Salvador was glad to leave the one-story building, where smugglers kept bundles of cocaine and marijuana alongside their human cargo, but he was anxious about what lay ahead.The driver deposited Mr. Cruz at an illegal crossing point on the edge of the Rio Grande. A smuggler took a smartphone photograph to confirm his identity and sent it using WhatsApp to a driver waiting to pick him up on the other side of the frontier when \u2014 if \u2014 he made it across.The nearly 2,000-mile trip had already cost Mr. Cruz\u2019s family more than $6,000 and brought him within sight of Brownsville, Tex. The remaining 500 miles to Houston \u2014 terrain prowled by the United States Border Patrol as well as the state and local police \u2014 would set them back another $6,500.It was an almost inconceivable amount of money for someone who earned just a few dollars a day picking coffee beans back home. But he wasn\u2019t weighing the benefits of a higher-paying job. He was fleeing violence and what he said was near-certain death at the hands of local gangs.\u201cThere\u2019s no other option,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cThe first thought I had was, \u2018I just need to get out of here at whatever cost.\u2019\u201dThe stretch of southwest border where he intended to cross has become the epicenter of the raging battle over the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. One clear consequence of the tightening American border and the growing perils getting there is that more and more desperate families are turning to increasingly sophisticated smuggling operations to get relatives into the United States.Mr. Cruz\u2019s story provides an unusually detailed anatomy of the price of the journey. The money paid for a network of drivers who concealed him in tractor-trailers and minibuses, a series of houses where he hid out, handlers tied to criminal organizations who arranged his passage, and bribes for Mexican police officers to look the other way as he passed.Even with his family\u2019s payment, he slept amid filth and vermin. He watched guides abandon some migrants who could not keep up, and guards prod others to become drug mules. Sometimes the smugglers identified him by a numeric code, other times by an assumed name. But as often as not, they simply called him \u201cthe package,\u201d to be moved for profit like an illicit good.For Mr. Cruz, it was worth it. \u201cThey can build as many walls as they want,\u201d he said, referring to American officials. \u201cThey can send as many soldiers to the border as they want, but a people\u2019s need and desire for a better life is stronger.\u201dPresident Trump and his supporters have called for greater vigilance along the border to keep out people like Mr. Cruz, a low-skilled worker who followed in the path of other family members who also arrived illegally, and who hopes those left behind will join him.The homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, told lawmakers in May that migrants paid $500 million a year to groups fueling violence and instability in the region. A decade ago, Mexicans and Central Americans paid between $1,000 and $3,000 for clandestine passage into the United States. Now they hand over up to $9,200 for the same journey, the Department of Homeland Security reported last year. Those figures have continued to rise, according to interviews at migrant shelters in Mexico.To trace Mr. Cruz\u2019s journey from El Salvador, The New York Times relied on extensive interviews with him and his family, and reviewed contemporaneous photographs, text messages, receipts and GPS positions.UNITEDSTATESHoustonSanAntonioTEXAS$6,500MEXICOMcAllenMonterreythat Mr. Cruz\u2019s family madeat each stage of his trip.Matamoros$180$2,800TAMAULIPASMr. Cruz\u2019srouteSAN LUISPOTOS\u00cdGulf ofMexicoHIDALGOGuadalajara$450Mexico CityPueblaVERACRUZ$1,900MalpasoDamCHIAPASPacificOceanGuatemalaCity$800GUATEMALAEL SALVADORSan SalvadorSan DiegoU.S. \u2014 MEXICO BORDEREl PasoUNITEDSTATESHoustonSanAntonioTEXAS$6,500MEXICOMcAllenMonterreythat Mr. Cruz\u2019s family madeat each stage of his trip.Matamoros$180$2,800TAMAULIPASMr. Cruz\u2019srouteSAN LUISPOTOS\u00cdGulf ofMexicoHIDALGOGuadalajara$450Mexico CityPueblaVERACRUZ$1,900MalpasoDamCHIAPASPacificOceanGuatemalaCity$800GUATEMALAEL SALVADORSan SalvadorUNITEDSTATESHoustonMr. Cruz\u2019srouteMEXICOTEXAS$6,500MonterreyBrownsville$2,800MatamorosNUEVOLEON$180TAMAULIPASSAN LUISPOTOS\u00cdHIDALGO$450Gulf ofMexicoMexico CityPueblaVERACRUZMalpasoDam$1,900CHIAPASPacificOceanGuatemalaCityHONDURASGUATEMALASan Salvador$800EL SALVADORUNITEDSTATESHoustonMEXICO$6,500MonterreyMatamoros$180$2,800Mr. Cruz\u2019sroute$450Mexico CityGulf ofMexicoPuebla$1,900MalpasoDamGuatemalaCityPacificOcean$800SanSalvadorHis uncle in the United States checked in constantly by Facebook Messenger during his weeks on the road.

Reporters reviewed more than 200 recent criminal complaints in smuggling cases along the southwest border, including those brought against drivers, stash-house operators, foot guides and migrants.That day at the Rio Grande last summer, a guide prepared to lead Mr. Cruz and some two dozen other migrants to the far side of the river while three lookouts perched in trees, scanning the horizon for any hint of the Border Patrol.When he arrived at the crossing, Mr. Cruz found that the river wasn\u2019t wide, at most a few hundred feet, but the water was murky and full of debris. The smugglers had gathered the migrants at the water\u2019s edge, with giant inflated inner tubes for those who couldn\u2019t swim. They said the makeshift rafts were slower than swimming, so Mr. Cruz pulled off his skinny-leg khakis and T-shirt and paddled to the other side in his boxer shorts.After climbing up the bank, his first tenuous toehold in the United States, he crouched, wet and shivering, in the brush and got dressed. Mr. Cruz\u2019s face had lost much of its roundness as he had shed 30 pounds over a month of hard travel. A life of skateboarding, tinkering with computers and eating his grandmother\u2019s cooking had not prepared him for the demands of the road.Mr. Cruz had climbed halfway up the fence when he heard a helicopter overhead and saw patrol cars converging. Agents grabbed those already over the fence and began to arrest them.\u201cWhen I saw that, I slid down and I ran back,\u201d Mr. Cruz recalled. He dived again into the Rio Grande, his only hope to escape back to Mexico.Mr. Cruz grew up in San Miguel, the fourth-largest city in El Salvador. Gang violence is virtually endemic in the country, and Mr. Cruz dropped out of high school when the infamous MS-13 became too dangerous there. His family relocated to Berl\u00edn, about an hour\u2019s drive away, which had less of a gang problem than the big cities.Mr. Cruz\u2019s mother lived in the United States, but he was much closer to her brother there, an uncle he considered a father figure and called \u201cPapi.\u201d Mr. Cruz lived with his grandmother and younger sister. He also had a 2-year-old son to provide for, though he and the boy\u2019s mother had broken up.During coffee-picking season he rose at 4 in the morning, walked an hour to the farm where he worked, then plucked ripe red coffee cherries until dark. He usually earned $15 to $20 a week. Outside harvest season, Mr. Cruz painted murals and cleaned streets for the local government. He briefly worked as a bartender at a restaurant an hour\u2019s bus ride away.The police had all but declared open season on gang-age men, Mr. Cruz said, and he and his friends were harassed and beaten by the security forces. Meanwhile, gang members regularly threatened him and shook him down for money because they realized he received support from his uncle in the United States.One night, Mr. Cruz and his friends were walking home when they noticed a blue Honda creeping behind them. When the young men started to run, the car accelerated, then followed Mr. Cruz as the group split up.\u201cI got to my house and it was locked,\u201d he recalled. He considered climbing over the front gate but worried the men who were following him might kill his grandmother and sister too. Over his shoulder he saw the gang members draw guns as he fled across a soccer field before taking refuge in a nearby health clinic.After that night, he resolved to leave. \u201cThat is the reality of El Salvador,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are scared of both, the gangs and the police.\u201d He did not consider trying to enter United States legally to seek asylum; even under the more lenient asylum policies a year ago only a fraction of gang-violence victims won that status.Mr. Cruz had never gone farther than neighboring Honduras. But in some Central American cities, smuggling services to the United States are openly promoted on the streets, with hawkers luring customers the way agents at tourist destinations advertise sailing or snorkeling excursions. They take potential customers to a back room of a nearby store, where salesmen pitch them on a smuggling route. Some would-be migrants give up homes, cars, livestock and even farmland tilled by their families for generations and take on debt to pay the fees.Mr. Cruz\u2019s uncle, who now has legal status in the United States after arriving illegally years ago, spoke to a woman in his local Salvadoran community. She told him of smugglers who brought her three children over for a flat $20,000 fee after gang members back home killed her husband. The uncle used WhatsApp to contact a woman in Mexico representing the smuggling network, who became the point of contact throughout Mr. Cruz\u2019s journey.\u201cWould it be possible to pick up my nephew as close as possible to the edge of San Salvador?\u201d the uncle asked her in one message. \u201cThe boy is 22 years old but acts more like 12.\u201d The uncle spoke on the condition of anonymity because he, like other relatives of unauthorized immigrants, feared he could be prosecuted for trafficking a family member.Mr. Cruz worried about the trip. His best friend had made the same journey the year before only to be kidnapped near the American border and held for two months. His family paid $20,000 to free him, and he ended up back in El Salvador. And a female friend of Mr. Cruz had been raped by smugglers on the American side of the border, caught by the authorities and then deported.His uncle assured him over Facebook Messenger that everything would be fine.Mr. Cruz\u2019s aunt and uncle earned enough to advance him the money for the journey, but Mr. Cruz would have to pay them back. They wired $800 to El Salvador the day he set out on the initial leg of the trip. \u201cAny opportunity you have to connect, send me a message with your location,\u201d the uncle wrote.\u201cActivate Find My iPhone so you can find out my location from the iCloud,\u201d Mr. Cruz answered. \u201cThat way you\u2019ll know the route I\u2019m taking.\u201d Mr. Cruz set off for the United States with a backpack carrying three changes of clothes, deodorant, cookies and a charger for the iPhone 5 that would be his connection and lifeline.His trip began with an idling pickup truck outside a mall in Soyapango, on the edge of San Salvador. The smuggler who would accompany him through El Salvador and Guatemala sat behind the wheel.MEX.GuatemalaCityHONDURASLa HachaduraGUATEMALASanSalvadorEL SALVADORPacific OceanIn the beginning, it was almost like being a tourist. Mr. Cruz crossed into Guatemala legally at La Hachadura, close to El Salvador\u2019s Pacific coast, with his national identity card. He even received a printed receipt.The driver left the pickup truck behind in El Salvador and chaperoned him by bus to the capital, Guatemala City. The two of them transferred buses and traveled a few hours further to Huehuetenango, in the western highlands, which serves as a jumping-off point for the Mexican border.They spent a night in a cheap hotel and traveled the next day to La Mesilla along the Mexican frontier. Vendors under colorful umbrellas sold drinks and snacks at the crossing. A blue sign wished travelers a \u201cfeliz viaje,\u201d or nice trip, above the gate separating the two countries.To skirt the border police outpost, the smuggler directed Mr. Cruz to a nearby industrial area where he walked alone up a gravel path and into Mexico. For the first time, he became an illegal immigrant.Mr. Cruz boarded a minibus, filled with local passengers, to begin his trip through the southern state of Chiapas. As instructed by the driver, at toll plazas he hunched down between the seats and covered himself with the passengers\u2019 backpacks, suitcases and packages. The driver whistled when it was safe to come out.He was vulnerable to criminals who might try to kidnap him, police officers seeking bribes and the more robust immigration enforcement that has taken root in recent years in southern Mexico. Under pressure from Washington, the Mexican government has cracked down on migrants passing through its territory. Because of the greater vigilance along the smuggling routes, between 80 and 95 percent of migrants bound for the United States used so-called coyotes in recent years, compared with fewer than half in the early 1970s, Border Patrol surveys of captured migrants found.Just two days into Mr. Cruz\u2019s journey, his family had to wire the smuggling network $1,900 to get him through southern Mexico.Mr. Cruz spent several days in a small house near Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, the capital of Chiapas, sleeping on a sofa. It was comfortable enough, but he wondered what the holdup was. \u201cThey want to move you even more than you do,\u201d his uncle assured him, \u201cbecause they have to pay for every day that you\u2019re there but I don\u2019t pay extra.\u201dWhen the smugglers finally continued the trip, Mr. Cruz spent a night on a hammock at an isolated spot near the Malpaso Dam, surrounded by trees. \u201cI was headed for Puebla yesterday, but immigration stopped two people who had gone ahead,\u201d he texted his uncle. \u201cSo they moved me here instead.\u201dThe next morning, Mr. Cruz climbed into the cab of a tractor-trailer and rode alongside the driver. At a toll area, he had his first run-in with the police. Officers stopped the truck for a routine check, and after seeing Mr. Cruz\u2019s Salvadoran ID, realized that he was in Mexico illegally. They demanded money or else they would deport him, Mr. Cruz said.Gulf ofMexicoPueblaPUEBLAVERACRUZMEXICOMalpaso DamOAXACATuxtla Guti\u00e9rrezHe fished out $170 he had hidden in his shoes. Mr. Cruz remembered one of the police officers telling him it was his lucky day. \u201cI was getting out of trouble. I was able to get away because I had this money on me,\u201d he said.The officers stole the truck driver\u2019s cash as well. Once they left, the driver threatened to hand the migrant over to violent drug traffickers unless Mr. Cruz got him $600. Panicked, Mr. Cruz called his aunt and uncle in the United States for help, but they didn\u2019t answer.Thousands of miles away, the couple emerged from a water park \u2014 a rare day off with their young daughter \u2014 to find the missed calls. They had been observing Mr. Cruz\u2019s progress on their smartphones and computers, watching him move northward through small towns, streets full of pastel houses and parking lots for Walmarts and Pemex gas stations.On the phone with his relatives, he described the police theft and the driver\u2019s threat. His uncle quickly turned to the Mexican woman at the smuggling network, who found another driver to carry Mr. Cruz to Puebla. The uncle asked Mr. Cruz to remain calm.\u201cStay calm, stay calm, everyone keeps saying that,\u201d Mr. Cruz responded in a Facebook message. \u201cKnowing I\u2019ve never been away from home. That I\u2019m easily frightened in a situation like this. And you want me to keep calm and keep calm. I can\u2019t.\u201dOn subsequent traffic stops, the bribe for the police was always the same: 1,500 Mexican pesos, or about $84. At first Mr. Cruz tried to lie, saying he wasn\u2019t a migrant but was on his way to Monterrey to make a delivery. Eventually he dropped any pretense. The fourth time he was stopped for a payoff, the cop simply said, \u201cYou already know how much this is.\u201dMr. Cruz made it as far as Puebla, southeast of Mexico City and a pivot point on the journey. His family wired $450 to the smugglers, including pocket money for Mr. Cruz for food and bribes.The woman he stayed with in Puebla treated him well, feeding him the local delicacy \u201cchiles en nogada,\u201d chiles in cream sauce with pomegranate seeds: green, white and red like the Mexican flag. She took him to buy soap, shampoo and toothpaste, but also got rid of his shoes \u2014 Bracos, a brand that the Mexican authorities would recognize as Salvadoran \u2014 and gave him another pair.After four days there the smugglers tried to move him north, but word came that some migrants had been killed near Monterrey, his next stop, so they brought him back to Puebla. After waiting three more days, Mr. Cruz hid with a young woman and her infant son in the sleeping compartment of a tractor-trailer for the overnight drive to Monterrey.The driver insisted they each take a pill, saying it was to keep them alert in case they were stopped. He then ground another pill into powder and mixed part of it in the baby\u2019s bottle before snorting the rest himself. Mr. Cruz said that he did not know what was in the pill but that after taking it he couldn\u2019t have slept even if he had tried.He arrived in Monterrey, the third-largest metropolitan area in Mexico and an industrial and commercial hub. Far from the booming downtown, behind a metal front gate, the windows and doors were shut and barred on the cinder-block house where Mr. Cruz was kept. Trash was everywhere. The small courtyard was filled with mud and debris. Ants and cockroaches crawled indoors. The only water ran brown and unfiltered from the faucet. A terrible smell wafted from the bathroom.U.S.TEXASMEXICOMcAllenMatamorosMonterrey\u201cIt was like a prison,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.Migrants like Mr. Cruz had to pay their captors to bring them bottled water or snacks, if they even had the cash to pay prices that were triple those at the local convenience store. Otherwise food arrived only every other day, in the form of a carton of 30 eggs to feed the dozen or so people typically there. At night, Mr. Cruz said, he lay on a thin mat on the floor but couldn\u2019t sleep with mice and insects running over him.Every day smugglers dropped off and picked up migrants, who were kept locked inside. A Guatemalan man everyone called \u201cel due\u00f1o,\u201d \u201cthe owner,\u201d was in charge because he had been there the longest. He had run out of money to continue his journey a month and a half earlier.Mr. Cruz was stuck there for four days. His uncle sent $2,800, and they carried him onward to the eastern Mexican border state of Tamaulipas, just below southern Texas. His journey took him first to Ciudad Miguel Alem\u00e1n, across from Roma, Tex., before he boarded a bus for Matamoros, two and a half hours away, with the assumed name Carlos Hernandez on his ticket.Tamaulipas has become known for violent confrontations between organized crime groups, and migrants caught in the middle have been massacred. In the summer of 2010, the corpses of 72 migrants killed by cartel members were discovered there in San Fernando. The message was clear: Crossing into the United States without permission from the drug traffickers, or narcos, who controlled the border territory could be lethal.Rodolfo Casillas, an expert on illegal migration at the Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales in Mexico, estimated that up to $1,000 of the total smuggling price went to pay off the narcos for the \u201cderecho de paso,\u201d or right to pass. One migrant testifying in a human-smuggling case in Texas last year told the authorities that he had paid 11,000 pesos, or about $630, for protection from the Zetas criminal organization, and just 1,500 pesos for assistance with the river crossing.The house where Mr. Cruz was kept in Matamoros was better maintained than the hovel in Monterrey. He and the 30 other migrants could bathe with buckets of water from a pair of concrete basins with spigots outside. The men watching the house, tied to the narcos, brought them beers and even offered them drugs from bundles of cocaine and marijuana.\u201cIf you ran out of money, that\u2019s when they would offer to cross you as a mule,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.Some migrants at the house agreed to ferry drugs.After sending off the migrants with drugs one day, the traffickers returned to the stash house seething. \u201cThey were extremely angry,\u201d Mr. Cruz recalled, not because the migrants had been arrested but because they had lost their shipment of drugs.Mr. Cruz was sick. The temperature along his journey had yo-yoed 40 degrees as the altitude climbed to 7,000 feet in Puebla before dropping to sea level in Matamoros. The unsanitary conditions in Monterrey probably hadn\u2019t helped.Mr. Cruz was eager to leave the house in Matamoros, but his coughing spasms gave the smugglers pause. They didn\u2019t want him giving their position away as a group tried to slip past Border Patrol agents.His uncle asked Mr. Cruz if the Mexican woman from the smuggling network could insist that they move him anyway. But Mr. Cruz realized she had little sway at the border. \u201cSomeone else decides who leaves,\u201d he told his uncle, \u201cand she pays them.\u201dHis family sent $180 to the smugglers, who said half would go toward medicine and half for a backup phone. Doses of cough syrup, along with several days of rest, seemed to help. That Saturday night Mr. Cruz wrote to his uncle, \u201cThey\u2019re going to say if I leave in the morning.\u201d Shortly after midnight he wrote again, saying, \u201cAt 4 o\u2019clock in the morning I go.\u201dThe region, where the Rio Grande coils and bends in switchbacks, has become the central battleground of the southwest frontier for illegal entries. Some 138,000 people were caught trying to cross here in 2017, close to half of all those apprehended from the California coast all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.For all the debate about Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed wall, a virtual barrier was steadily strengthened under previous administrations. Doughy blimps equipped with cameras provide video surveillance, with thermal imaging for nighttime. Migrants unknowingly trip advanced seismic sensors with their first steps on American soil. The number of Border Patrol agents has grown to about 20,000 from roughly 9,000 in 2001, while budgets have quadrupled, spent on everything from all-terrain vehicles and horse patrols to helicopters and advanced reconnaissance drones.That gives the Border Patrol a much better chance of combating criminal smuggling networks, which use Facebook and Craigslist to recruit drivers, satellite phones and encrypted communication applications to direct them, night-vision technology to scan for patrols, and off-the shelf tracking devices to monitor moving vehicles.\u201cThey have evolved as the technology has evolved, and we have as well,\u201d said Benjamine Huffman, chief of strategic planning and analysis for the Border Patrol.Early that morning, the smugglers gathered Mr. Cruz, one of two dozen migrants from two stash houses in town, and crammed them into the back of an S.U.V., stacking them like cordwood. Wedged into a corner of the trunk with the weight of his fellow migrants crushing down on him, Mr. Cruz struggled to catch his breath.Once at the Rio Grande, he swam to the other side, while those who couldn\u2019t swim were pulled on the inner tubes. The migrants in his group began to mount the border fence. But the Border Patrol descended, grabbing some of the first arrivals. He realized he had to turn back.\u201cThere was no other alternative but to cross the river,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.As was customary, the smugglers would give him three tries to make it across safely. One chance was gone. Mr. Cruz steeled himself to try again at a different bend along the river.The temperature had climbed to 93 degrees by midday Sunday when Mr. Cruz made his second illegal visit to the United States, at another crossing nearby. It was even shorter than his first.Border Patrol agents swarmed the group as they made landfall on the north bank again. One agent got a hand on Mr. Cruz\u2019s back but, instead of arresting him, sent him sprawling into the river. Swallowing water and struggling to stay afloat, Mr. Cruz said, he barely managed to swim back to Mexico.The sun was low and dusk approaching by the time the coyotes brought the migrants to their third crossing point. The smugglers said the spot, more isolated, was usually reserved for moving drug shipments, more valuable than migrants. Mr. Cruz would have to swim across the Rio Grande for the fifth time that day.Of the 17 people left from the two dozen in the morning, Mr. Cruz recalled, five were women, including one who appeared about eight months pregnant and another in her 50s, he guessed. He wondered how they would make it, but his family had warned him: Worry about yourself. Do not stop for anyone.Mr. Cruz could hardly believe the determination of the pregnant woman as they emerged from the river again and started to run. But the older woman slipped behind and fell to the ground. The guide did nothing. \u201cHe just left her there,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.The driver of the waiting S.U.V. honked his horn to get their attention. He was angry, expecting just a few migrants to crawl out of the South Texas field and instead finding 16 people. In a region full of Border Patrol agents, it was a risky load to carry.The driver told Mr. Cruz to ride shotgun, and he saw bundles of cocaine on the passenger seat. But it was only a short drive to a parking lot where the smugglers separated the group into different cars, depending on their destinations. Mr. Cruz and five others got into a Cadillac headed an hour northwest to a stash house in McAllen, Tex.Drop-offs and pickups are often meticulously planned so that migrants are ready to jump in as soon as the car pulls up. Smugglers sometimes mark migrants with colored tape to quickly sort who is going where. Smugglers often drive two cars, using one to draw the attention of law enforcement and another to carry the migrants.At the stash house in McAllen, the caretakers took away phones and even migrants\u2019 shoes so they wouldn\u2019t run away. \u201cOne particular person, they beat him up and kicked him because he wasn\u2019t paying attention,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.He estimated there were 70 people inside. They were given no food and were not allowed to speak to one another or even move without permission. Neighbors in border regions can be quick to report suspected stash houses. More than a third of all those busted by Customs and Border Protection last year \u2014 140 out of 407 in the Southwest \u2014 were in the Rio Grande Valley, where Mr. Cruz was.After just a day and a half in McAllen, Mr. Cruz huddled with four other migrants in the sleeping compartment of a tractor-trailer headed to San Antonio. They were nearly discovered by agents during a routine search at a highway checkpoint, cowering under blankets as they felt someone check the bedding they were hiding under. Mr. Cruz was transferred to a minivan with a concealed compartment built under the back seat, where he hid for part of the ride.Mr. Cruz was brought to one last stash house, stripped to just his boxer shorts in a room \u201cwith no electricity, no light coming through, no windows and one big bed with four men,\u201d as he described it, essentially a hostage until the final payments were made. Two days passed.Even with the precautions, one of the payments was flagged, canceled and had to be re-sent to a different recipient. Only when the final installment arrived in Mexico could Mr. Cruz go. \u201cThey gave me my clothes to put back on, and they blindfolded me again,\u201d he said.The smugglers drove him to a gas station. There he saw the familiar face of his uncle. Mr. Cruz began to cry.Relief at finishing his journey did not last long. Mr. Cruz was now in an unfamiliar country, where he did not speak the language and could not legally hold a job. He would have to hide in plain sight. He was $12,630 in debt. But, he said, at least he didn\u2019t fear for his life. \u201cHere I know I\u2019m safe,\u201d he said.His uncle found him tougher and more mature after the journey\u2019s hardships. Mr. Cruz looked ahead to earning enough money to begin the cycle again, paying for his son, his sister and his grandmother to join him in the United States. \u201cI dream of bringing them over here,\u201d he said.June 26, 2018June 24, 2018June 12, 2018Feb. 5, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going for Broke, the Middle Class Goes Broke", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesIt wasn\u2019t long ago that the term \u201cmiddle class\u201d suggested security, conformity and often complacency \u2014 a cohort that was such a reliable feature of postwar American life that it attracted not just political pandering but also cultural ridicule. The stereotype included everyone from men in gray flannel suits to the slick professionals of \u201cThirtysomething,\u201d stuck or smug in their world of bourgeois comforts.\u201cThey are people on the brink who did everything \u2018right,\u2019\u201d Quart writes, \u201cand yet the math of their family lives is simply not adding up.\u201dAs she puts it in her introduction, the concerns of her subjects \u201cwere not abstract to me.\u201d Quart is a sympathetic listener, getting people to reveal not just the tenuousness of their economic situations but also the turbulence of their emotional lives. A chapter on middle-age job-seekers who once worked as computer programmers or newspaper reporters captures the fallout of a discriminatory job market, which tells older unemployed people they should buck up and start over while also making them feel superfluous.\u201cI\u2019ve tried to reinvent myself so many times,\u201d an aeronautical-engineer-turned-website-designer-turned-personal-chef tells her. \u201cTo be honest, it hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d The woman is now in her 50s, with two grown daughters and plenty of debt from culinary school. \u201cThe world has evolved beyond me,\u201d she says.It\u2019s as if the apocalyptic thinking that Ehrenreich diagnosed in her 1989 book, \u201cFear of Falling: The Inner Life of the Middle Class,\u201d has finally gained a purchase on reality. The people Ehrenreich depicted were anxious and self-absorbed, terrified of downward mobility; the ones in Quart\u2019s book are anxious too, but now that they know firsthand the kind of profound vulnerability that used to be the domain of the poor, they may be on the cusp, she hopes, of pushing for genuine policy change. Even lawyers, a traditionally risk-averse bunch who tend to choose their profession for its stability, are getting caught in the vise between increasing law school tuitions and decreasing job prospects. Precarity, Quart suggests, can translate into solidarity.But then this reassurance is the kind of platitude that feels simplistic in a fully reported book. It still casts the discussion of financial hardship in familiar terms of who deserves help and who doesn\u2019t. People make imperfect, and often just bad, decisions. A truly humane system wouldn\u2019t only accommodate the blameless but would also make room for error \u2014 mistakes that, until humans are entirely replaced by robots, are inevitable.Quart knows this. But aside from some sharp points about how workers are expected to \u201cdeny their biology\u201d and \u201chow little American businesses and legislators care about care,\u201d the analysis in \u201cSqueezed\u201d is thin and altogether unmemorable. Quart herself can be a distracting presence, telling us how much iced coffee she drinks and cracking flat jokes (\u201cWhen I write the dastardly word \u2018domination\u2019 here, I do not use the word in either the sultry or the not-safe-for-work sense\u201d). At other moments, in what seem to be strenuous bids for lyricism, she comes perilously close to malapropism: \u201ca miasma of physical tasks,\u201d \u201ca palladium of the thoughtful,\u201d \u201chot aquiline wives.\u201dHer reporting, though, is reason enough to read \u201cSqueezed,\u201d especially as she brings to light how parents try to cope with the financial strain of caring for children. For all that legislators like to sentimentalize family values and hard work, they\u2019ve largely abdicated their responsibility toward families, who are left to navigate a job market that prefers its employees childless and unencumbered. The result is that hardworking parents resort to creative (but complicated and demanding) coparenting arrangements or, as detailed in one unforgettable chapter, 24-hour day care.\u201cJeans-clad, juice-box-wielding,\u201d Quart writes, \u201cwe are trying to find our way out of the maze of our country\u2019s idea of parenthood.\u201d Spare me the jeans and the juice box, but I\u2019ll take the rest; we could all use her expert guidance through the maze.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Critics Assail Trump, His Supporters Dig In Deeper", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEESBURG, Va. \u2014 Gina Anders knows the feeling well by now. President Trump says or does something that triggers a spasm of outrage. She doesn\u2019t necessarily agree with how he handled the situation. She gets why people are upset.But Ms. Anders, 46, a Republican from suburban Loudoun County, Va., with a law degree, a business career, and not a stitch of \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d gear in her wardrobe, is moved to defend him anyway.\u201cIt makes me angry at them, which causes me to want to defend him to them more,\u201d Ms. Anders said.In interviews across the country over the last few days, dozens of Trump voters, as well as pollsters and strategists, described something like a bonding experience with the president that happens each time Republicans have to answer a now-familiar question: \u201cHow can you possibly still support this man?\u201d Their resilience suggests a level of unity among Republicans that could help mitigate Mr. Trump\u2019s low overall approval ratings and aid his party\u2019s chances of keeping control of the House of Representatives in November.\u201cHe\u2019s not a perfect guy; he does some stupid stuff,\u201d said Tony Schrantz, 50, of Lino Lakes, Minn., the owner of a water systems leak detection business. \u201cBut when they\u2019re hounding him all the time it just gets old. Give the guy a little.\u201dMr. Trump has also retained support across a range of demographics other than the working-class voters who are most identified with him. This includes portions of the wealthy college-educated people in swing counties, like Virginia\u2019s Loudoun, in the country\u2019s most politically competitive states.Many of these voters say their lives and the country are improving under his presidency, and the endless stream of tough cable news coverage and bad headlines about Mr. Trump only galvanizes them further \u2014 even though some displayed discomfort on their faces when asked about the child separation policy, and expressed misgivings about the president\u2019s character.\u201cIt bothers me that he doesn\u2019t tell the truth, but I guess I kind of expect that, and I expect that from the media, too \u2014 not to always tell the truth or to slant it one way,\u201d said Julie Knight, 63, a retired personal injury case manager from Algona, Wash.The increasingly tribalized politics on the left and right have helped insulate Mr. Trump from the paroxysms that have jolted his party and eroded longstanding expectations of restraint, humility and honesty in American presidents. This era of tumult has left Democrats energized and determined to win back Congress and act as a check on Mr. Trump, and their intensity has been reflected by strong turnouts in the primaries so far. But still, in just the last year and a half, Mr. Trump has bounced back from crises that at the time seemed as if they might be too severe for him to recover politically.He tried to unilaterally bar visitors from several Muslim countries from the United States, angering U.S. allies and provoking clashes with Congress and the courts over the limits of executive power. He praised some \u201cvery fine people\u201d at a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in remarks that shook some members of his cabinet so deeply that they considered resigning. He defended Roy S. Moore, a Senate candidate in Alabama who was accused of fondling teenage girls, by suggesting that the allegations were old and possibly made-up.And so as another immigration crisis of his own making smoldered this past week, critics inside and outside Mr. Trump\u2019s party predicted another devastating, irremediable low point in his presidency. Yet many Trump voters said that they no longer had the patience or interest to listen to what they see as another hysterical outburst by Democrats, Republican \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d and the media.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like when you experience a sensation over and over and over again,\u201d said Daniel Arnold, 32, a warehouse manager from Leesburg, Va., about an hour outside Washington. \u201cA sensation is no longer a sensation. It\u2019s just, \u2018Oh, here we are again.\u2019\u201dFor many Republicans, the audio of children sobbing at a migrant detention center barely registered, because these voters don\u2019t pay attention to the left-leaning and mainstream media that have covered the family separation crisis far more than their preferred channel, Fox News.\u201cI think it\u2019s terrible about the kids getting split up from their parents. But the parents shouldn\u2019t have been here,\u201d said Lynn Dittbenner, 65, of Elk River, Minn., who took the day off from relaxing with her family at their lake cabin to hear the president speak at a rally in Duluth on Wednesday.Others said they saw a ploy by the president\u2019s enemies to obscure news that was more favorable to him, like the internal Justice Department investigation that recently uncovered evidence of F.B.I. officials speaking disparagingly of Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s just incredible what the nation is trying to do to disrupt this president and his agenda,\u201d said Jeff Butts, 58, an unemployed sales manager from Leesburg. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to hear about that. We only get to hear about the crying babies on the border.\u201dSometimes they seized on made-up or erroneous story lines that were mostly absent from the mainstream media.\u201cThose cages and those families \u2014 that was actually filmed during the Obama administration, not the Trump administration,\u201d said Clayton Smith, 57, a commercial lending underwriter from Cary, Ill., a Chicago suburb.As isolated as those examples are, they are validating for people who believe their political beliefs are constantly held under a microscope and vilified.\u201cI don\u2019t have friends anymore because I\u2019ve switched parties,\u201d said Judy Brana, 66, a retired music and art teacher from St. Cloud, Minn., who left home at 10:30 on Wednesday morning to make the two-and-a-half-hour drive up to Duluth for the president\u2019s rally.\u201cFriends I\u2019ve had for 40 years,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s insane, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll tell you.\u201dAnother factor that seems to be driving up support is a sense that no one is acknowledging Mr. Trump\u2019s successes, which they see as manifold, historic and irrefutable.\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d said John Westling, 70, of Princeton, Minn., reciting a list of the president\u2019s accomplishments that he said no one in the media wants to talk about. \u201cEconomy booming, check. Unemployment down, check. Border security being addressed, check. Possible end to the Korean War that started when I was 3 years old, 68 years ago, check.\u201d\u201cI suspect that if Trump walked across Lake Mille Lacs,\u201d Mr. Westling added, \u201cthe media would announce, \u2018Trump can\u2019t swim!\u2019\u201dYet some say their patience with Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive style is not limitless. Gary Winthorpe, a 17-year-old high school student who was on his way to see the president speak in Minnesota on Wednesday, said he hopes that the first vote he casts for president in 2020 is for Mr. Trump. But he acknowledged being wary at times, aware of protests against the president.\u201cI\u2019m not blindly for Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a fair bit of skepticism toward him. But I feel like he is trying his best.\u201dMr. Trump fared much worse than prior Republican candidates among well-educated and affluent white voters, and became the first Republican to win the presidency while losing white college graduates. But he nonetheless won considerable support among college-educated and affluent voters. He retains much of that support today. According to a Pew Research survey this month, approximately 31 percent of Trump approvers are white men without a college degree, and 66 percent are either college graduates, women or nonwhite.According to Gallup, Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity with college-educated voters has remained about equal to his popularity with Americans overall this year.There is some evidence that Mr. Trump\u2019s base of support may have shrunk slightly, though. In recent polls from Gallup and Morning Consult, the numbers of people who identified as Republicans were about 2 percentage points smaller than they were in early 2017.Among Democrats, Mr. Trump\u2019s initial approval has been historically low, failing to reach 15 percent since he took office. Presidents have traditionally come in with at least a moderate amount of support from the opposing party.Just as Mr. Trump has changed the makeup of the Republican coalition, he also appears to have helped change the views of the people who support him.The percentage of Republicans who say they have a favorable view of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president for whom Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed fondness, has doubled from 2015 to 2017 to 24 percent, according to Gallup. Among Democrats, Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity has plummeted.Even if Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t at the center of the national conversation, Ms. Anders, the Loudoun County business executive, said she thinks that the country would still be polarized. But as long as he is, she said, people on the right and the left will probably continue to dig in based on what Mr. Trump does and how his opponents respond.\u201cIt all coalesces around Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s either, \u2018Trump wants to put people in cages, in concentration camps.\u2019 Or, on the other side, \u2018Oh the left just wants everybody to come into the country illegally so they can get voters.\u2019\u201dShe concluded: \u201cWe can\u2019t have a conversation.\u201dReporting was contributed by Maggie Astor and Nate Cohn from New York; Matt Furber from Duluth, Minn.; Kirk Johnson from Seattle; and David Mendell from Cary, Ill.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nan Goldin Survived an Overdose to Fight the Opioid Epidemic", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe photographer is known for her gritty images of New York City life. Now she\u2019s become a leading activist in the struggle against addiction.ON A RECENT April morning, the artist Nan Goldin and around 100 protesters entered the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Arthur M. Sackler Gallery on the south side of the National Mall in Washington. The Sackler Gallery is a squat, geometric building that unspools into a subterranean museum beneath one of the Smithsonian\u2019s public gardens. Its founding collection of some 1,000 works of Near Eastern, Asian, and Southeast Asian art was donated along with $4 million in 1982 by a physician, Arthur M. Sackler, whose name is carved on the building\u2019s exterior gray granite walls. Goldin and the group marched past an exhibition called \u201cEncountering the Buddha\u201d and positioned themselves along the atrium\u2019s staircase and around a shallow fountain that sits at the bottom of the building. A lacquer wood sculpture called \u201cMonkeys Grasping the Moon\u201d by the Chinese artist Xu Bing dangled above, 72 feet long. The few visitors already present that morning observed the proceedings with curiosity. A tense hush had spread through the cool and dark gallery, which Goldin shattered, leading the group in a gravel-voiced chant: \u201cArthur\u2019s skills was marketing pills! Pills for profit! Addiction equals profit!\u201d When she finished, the gallery fell silent. Suddenly, everyone pulled oversize prescription pill bottles labeled as OxyContin, MS Contin and Valium from their bags and threw them across the floor, down the stairs, and into the fountain \u2014 the sound of their falling like rain on a roof. Goldin and the protesters around her briefly staged a \u201cdie-in,\u201d lying down on the stone floor. Then they assembled outside, placing more bottles atop a pink granite marker also bearing Arthur M. Sackler\u2019s name. Goldin spoke about the opioid crisis. Then she called out the people she believes are largely responsible for it: the Sacklers. It is rare these days to see a lone artist like Goldin \u2014 especially one both critically and commercially successful, whose work is in dozens of important museum collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art \u2014 step into the ring as an activist. By giving her name to this cause, Goldin has helped legitimize it and has become a figurehead for a group of people \u2014 those all too often dismissed as addicts \u2014 who have largely been treated as invisible. The fight against the opioid crisis is not one that draws easy sympathy. There are no breathtaking photographs of glaciers melting into the Arctic Ocean to pull at your heartstrings, and there aren\u2019t any fresh-faced high school students on CNN demanding better gun laws. Opioids are perceived as an embarrassing blight in already depressed areas of the country, and addiction is largely seen as a metaphor for weakness, a failure of the will. The movement\u2019s numbers are haunted by the ghosts of the most ordinary of people \u2014 an injured high school football player, an unemployed single mother, a former heroin addict. Which makes Goldin\u2019s story, and her involvement, all the more crucial. IF GOLDIN IS best known for romanticizing underground subcultures, there has long been a political subtext to her work. Her early photographs of drag queens were presciently unconcerned with gender. Her documentation of her own sexual abuse is profound, most notably in \u201cNan one month after being battered\u201d (1984). It is a deeply uncomfortable image: Goldin\u2019s left eye is still bloodshot, her face still bruised. The image is alarming, but most markedly, it is without shame. Because of the AIDS crisis, \u201cThe Ballad\u201d is also, however accidentally, a relic of a lost age. It serves as a hypothetical fork in the road, a bacchanalian path onto which the culture could have turned had AIDS never arrived.One of the show\u2019s catalog essays, called \u201cPost Cards from America: X-Rays from Hell,\u201d was written by the artist David Wojnarowicz, who would also die of AIDS-related complications in 1992. The piece provides the clearest bridge to Goldin\u2019s current work, summarizing the tragedy of a country\u2019s indifference to a generation left to die. \u201cMy rage,\u201d Wojnarowicz wrote, \u201cis really about the fact that when I was told that I\u2019d contracted this virus it didn\u2019t take me long to realize that I\u2019d contracted a diseased society as well.\u201dI MET GOLDIN again two weeks after the Smithsonian protest in her Brooklyn studio overlooking the East River. She greeted me from a brown velvet couch that looked as if it were an artifact from her Bowery apartment and studio of 38 years. (The novelist and essayist Darryl Pinckney once wrote of it: \u201cNan\u2019s Bowery loft had no windows or else they were covered and this made her parties long, hilarious, dangerous events. You had no idea what time it was or how light the sky was getting out there.\u201d) She moved in 2014. Petite, with cropped red curly hair, and dressed in black, Goldin was smoking a cigarette and drinking a ginger beer. An eclectic assortment of books were stacked on a shelf nearby: \u201cA Concise History of Posters,\u201d \u201cBorderline Personality Disorder: A Clinical Guide,\u201d monographs on Eva Hesse, John Kelly, and Joseph Cornell. Three skateboards from a recent collaboration with Supreme were still wrapped in plastic, leaning against a box.In the last few years, Goldin has been painting and drawing in addition to taking photographs. When she does take pictures, she uses a Fuji 6x7 camera, but she also takes a lot with her iPhone. \u201cEveryone is a photographer who takes a picture,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the most accessible medium in the world.\u201d She showed me a selection of paintings she made while sober. There is a surreal quality to them, an artful gentleness to the lines and colors that resembles that of her photographs. In a self-portrait from February, the canvas has been scratched so that the lips appear sewn shut \u2014 an echo of Wojnarowicz\u2019s iconic image from Rosa von Praunheim\u2019s 1990 documentary \u201cSilence = Death.\u201d \u201cI was alone for a while over New Year\u2019s, and I didn\u2019t speak to anyone for a few days,\u201d Goldin explained. In \u201cCleopatra Masturbating,\u201d a nude Cleopatra touched herself while a snake bit her left nipple, which bleeds. In the background are cats and dogs.Goldin asked if I ever tried an opioid. I told her that in college, I took OxyContin once; it made me feel sick. She nodded. I asked her what opioids felt like for her. \u201cThey make everything all right. They\u2019re like a padding between you and the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s this round warmth that\u2019s covering you.\u201d She looked away. \u201cEverything is bearable suddenly.\u201dThe drawings she made while high are shakier, and also, she said, more automatic, as if being high made it more easy to access the part of herself that her more conscious mind couldn\u2019t touch. \u201cAn Unknown Species With Unknown Substances\u201d depicts a four-legged creature smoking a cigarette surrounded by prescription bottles. (\u201cOxyContin?\u201d I asked. \u201cUnknown substances,\u201d she responded.) Despite the misery they were borne out of, the drawings were both bizarre and amusing.Two of Goldin\u2019s photographs were exhibited at the Matthew Marks Gallery booth at the Frieze art fair in May. I asked her if she felt that her critique of the source of cultural donations made her feel a responsibility to manage who buys her own work. Wasn\u2019t it possible that someone who profits from Purdue Pharma \u2014 or from any other variety of human misery \u2014 could buy one of her photographs? There are artists today who refuse to sell their work to the Zabludowicz family, whose wealth has historical roots in arms dealing. After the election of Donald J. Trump, Richard Prince disavowed one of his artworks depicting a screen grab from Ivanka Trump\u2019s Instagram feed and returned the $36,000 payment he received for it. Goldin deflected the question: \u201cSomebody said when I started this, they\u2019re going to deaccession you [at the Met], but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to.\u201d She shrugged. At first, this struck me as an unsatisfactory answer. The Sacklers\u2019 support of the arts is still a net good \u2014 their money has supported generations of artists over the decades, including, arguably Goldin. Goldin doesn\u2019t deny this: \u201cWe\u2019re not asking museums to give back money. We\u2019re asking them to refuse future donations. And to make statements.\u201d The firmness of her stance on the matter made me realize that the only responsibility an artist like Goldin has is to her own work. The same can\u2019t be said for the Sacklers.Goldin was pleased with how the Washington protest went, but her anger at Purdue Pharma was palpable. \u201cSupposedly, the brain can\u2019t tell the difference between emotional pain and physical pain,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are deeply connected, and Purdue has preyed on both.\u201d She indicates that she was afraid of being targeted by the Sacklers. The day before the Smithsonian protest, she attended the screening of a documentary by Madeleine Sackler, whose father Jonathan is on the Purdue board of directors. Goldin was escorted out of the screening by security. \u201cThey call me out by name,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are big people with a lot of power.\u201d\u201cI lost everybody who carried my history,\u201d she said, not really speaking to me anymore, but to the space in front of her. \u201cWe were supposed to grow old together. There is no one for me to even talk to about those years.\u201dI thought of her friends I\u2019ve seen in her pictures: Mueller, her husband Scarpati, Wojnarowicz. \u201cIt was like the plague,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bubonic plague.\u201dAs Goldin spoke about P.A.I.N., she suddenly changed, grew steely and distant. She began to talk about how she wants to put pictures on bus shelters of people who have recovered from opioid addiction \u2014 to \u201cbreak through the shame,\u201d she said. There was a protest she wanted to attend in front of the federal courthouse in Cleveland later that week, where hundreds of lawsuits by United States cities and counties against Purdue and other opioid manufacturers, distributors and retailers have been consolidated. Many of the protesters would like to see the potential settlement money go directly back into treatment. Goldin has been making a film about P.A.I.N. that includes visiting clinics in rural areas of the country. She threw out some statistics on overdoses, and how fentanyl can be found these days not just in heroin, but in cocaine as well. I got the distinct sense that all of this \u2014 the work of turning the personal political \u2014 had also helped make the world a little more bearable for Goldin, too.One of the story lines in \u201cThe Deuce\u201d follows Vincent Martino, an entrepreneurial working-class man played by James Franco who ends up running a bar called the High Hat, which is directly modeled after Tin Pan Alley. The bar was a watering hole for artists, prostitutes, pimps, drunks and whoever else might have walked in that night. For this particular episode, the High Hat\u2019s walls were hung with a small selection from \u201cThe Ballad.\u201d In the scene, Goldin, as a patron, regarded them, including one of herself called \u201cBuzz and Nan at the Afterhours, New York City\u201d (1980). Franco stood beside her. They were strangers to each other, yet they enacted that inexplicable moment that happens in art viewing, where a sense of familiarity can grow between two people and compel them to speak. (Goldin: \u201cThey call that art? I coulda done that.\u201d) In the photograph, Buzz, a pimp, leans toward Goldin, who is wearing a madras dress and pearls. There is a reluctant intimacy between the two. The black leather of the booth behind them is imposing, and the glasses on the table imply a night that has already passed into the next day.There is an obvious nostalgia for the late \u201970s in a show like \u201cThe Deuce.\u201d By the end of the \u201980s, the party was over. The city had ceded its bohemianism to its newfound wealth as the toll of the AIDS epidemic climbed higher and higher. Goldin will always be remembered for that period because of her work about it, but also because she survived it. Perhaps now she will be seen as standing for something else \u2014 for epitomizing the opioid crisis, for sticking up for those too poor or too weak to fight a shadowy corporation for themselves. As she put it earlier: \u201cI can\u2019t stand by and watch another generation disappear.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Cuts and Leprechauns (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistThe political news seems even more horrible than usual today. So to get away from the headlines a bit, I\u2019m going to commit some economics. Specifically, I want to pull together some thoughts \u2014 some inspired by Gabriel Zucman\u2019s recent work, some of my own \u2014 about the case or lack thereof for corporate tax cuts, the centerpiece of the only major legislation enacted under Trump.Tax cuts: The rationaleAs Figure 1 shows, the immediate effect of cutting the corporate tax rate has been, surprise, a big fall in taxes collected from corporations. We\u2019re looking at something on the order of $110 billion in revenue loss at an annual rate, which is real money \u2013 roughly the total cost of the insurance expansion under the Affordable Care Act. And of course the corporate tax cuts aren\u2019t the only source of revenue loss from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).Why give up this revenue? The story told by modern advocates of corporate tax cuts, like the Trump CEA and the Tax Foundation, hinges critically on international mobility of capital. The U.S. is now part of a global capital market, they say, in which investment flows to whichever country offers the highest after-tax rates of return.So cutting the tax rate, according to this story, will bring in lots of capital from abroad. This will drive the rate of return down and wages up, so that in the long run the benefits of the tax cut will flow to workers rather than shareholders.Even if this story were right, long run effects aren\u2019t the whole story for policy \u2013 in the long run, we are all dead, and meanwhile capital owners have a chance to take the money and run. So even if the eventual effect of the tax cut were to raise wages, there might well be years, even decades, when a tax cut for corporations is mainly a tax cut for wealthy shareholders.And as Figure 2 shows, so far there has been no visible effect on wages. All those stories about worker bonuses were essentially bogus; real wages of ordinary workers are slightly lower than they were a year ago, while after-tax profits are way up.You can argue that this was only to be expected \u2013 but it\u2019s not the way the bill was sold, or promoted when those bonuses were being hyped. In any case, is there good reason to believe that the tax cut will do what it promised even in the long run? Specifically, are international capital movements really all that sensitive to tax rates?Leprechauns everywhereThere is no question that multinational corporations like low-tax countries like Ireland, and report earning a lot of their profits in those countries. But does this really reflect large-scale capital movements to those low-tax jurisdictions?And as Figure 4, which focuses on Ireland, shows, this divergence has been growing rapidly over time.One interesting question is, how much actual inflow of capital has Ireland experienced since 1980, as it became the go-to-location for multinationals to report their profits? This is a bit tricky to answer, because the methods corporations use to shift their profits abroad also distort balance of payments statistics. But I think we can use Ireland\u2019s measured current account balance as a rough guide, because the strategies corporations use to shift profits to Ireland should affect the composition of that balance but not its overall level.For example, suppose a multinational shifts reported profits to Ireland by paying its Irish subsidiary an excessive transfer price on its exports. This will inflate reported exports \u2013 but it will also inflate reported investment income paid to foreigners. Or suppose it assigns intellectual property rights for some technology to its Irish subsidiary, and pays that subsidiary inflated royalties. Again, an inflation of Irish exports, in this case of services, offset by increased investment income paid abroad.So if I\u2019m doing this right, we can look at Ireland\u2019s current account deficit as a measure of true capital inflow. From 1980 to 2014 the cumulative deficit was $68 billion, which is less than a quarter of Irish GDP. That\u2019s significant, but not huge. And remember, this is a small country with dramatically lower taxes than other advanced countries.That\u2019s not to say that Ireland has done badly. It has in fact done quite well. But it\u2019s much less of a miracle than it seems, with real wages doing fine but nowhere nearly as well as measured productivity (Figure 5).But why aren\u2019t actual capital movements that sensitive to tax rates? There is, I think, an important point about business investment that a lot of discussion has missed.The business cost of capital doesn\u2019t matter very muchAnyone who follows real-world monetary policy is aware of a dirty little secret about what economists used to call the \u201ctransmission mechanism\u201d: interest rates don\u2019t have much direct effect on business investment. In fact, in general it\u2019s hard to find any effect at all. Monetary policy works through housing and, these days, the exchange rate; if it affects business spending, the effect is indirect, through changes in sales that were caused by housing and the exchange rate.You can see what I\u2019m talking about by looking at investment during the great slump of 1979-82, which was more or less deliberately engineered by the Fed to squeeze inflation down (Figure 6). Interest rates shot up, residential investment plunged, but nonresidential investment more or less kept plugging along.Why doesn\u2019t business investment respond more to interest rates? Because many though not all business investments are relatively short-lived. If you build a house, it\u2019s going to last for decades, generating implicit or explicit rents all the way, so the rate at which you discount those rents matters a lot. If you\u2019re buying a computer that will be obsolete in three years, the interest rate hardly matters at all.One way to say this is that a business considering investing a dollar will compare the marginal product of that dollar\u2019s worth of capital with a cost that includes both the cost of capital and the rate of depreciation. If the rate of depreciation is high, the cost of capital will be a fairly small factor. And if you compare average rates of depreciation for residential and nonresidential capital, the business rate is much higher (Figure 7).But given the relatively short lives of business investments, this effect should be fairly small. Tax cutting as a way to encourage investment is fairly ineffective for the same reasons that monetary policy has relatively little direct traction over business spending.No pot of gold in sightSo, am I saying that the case for cutting corporate tax rates is unadulterated nonsense? No, it\u2019s adulterated nonsense. There\u2019s some reason to believe that lower tax rates will, other things equal, have some positive effect on capital formation. But the vision of a global market in which real capital moves a lot in response to tax rates is all wrong; most of what we see in response to tax rate differences is profit-shifting, not real investment. And there is no reason to believe that the kind of tax cut America just enacted will achieve much besides starving the government of revenue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Vancouver, a Housing Frenzy That Even Owners Want to End", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "Facing a crisis of affordability, officials are trying to reduce real estate demand through a package of tax measures, some aimed at foreign buyers.Supported byHere is a new one: Vancouver is so expensive that politicians want to tax its real estate market into submission, and many homeowners \u2014 who will lose money if home prices fall \u2014 think it\u2019s the best idea they\u2019ve heard in years.\u201cI would like to see a correction to sober up this whole place,\u201d said Rob Welsh, a retired airplane mechanic who lives in a Vancouver suburb. Mr. Welsh bought his house in 2000 and has become a paper millionaire based on its appreciation. It makes him more anxious than happy.\u201cIf I got to lose 200 or 300 grand to keep the kids and the future of this place, so be it,\u201d he said.Like many cities around the world, Vancouver is grappling with punishing housing costs that have pushed out large swaths of residents \u2014 and are causing distress among young adults who can\u2019t afford rent today and take it for granted that they will never own a home.Part of the reason is the attraction of Vancouver itself, and not just among Canadians. Between its natural beauty, its temperate climate and Canada\u2019s liberal immigration policies, the city has become a magnet for foreign buyers, especially from China.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that many of the measures we are bringing in are bold, but we felt they were critical if we were really going to address this crisis,\u201d Carole James, British Columbia\u2019s finance minister, said in an interview.No doubt, many voters would think twice about that opinion if home prices actually crashed. Still, respondents \u201cwere clearly reacting from a place of deep anxiety, even desperation, about their own or their loved ones\u2019 ability to access the housing market,\u201d said Shachi Kurl, executive director of Angus Reid.\u201cUnbeknownst to many people in the local population, Vancouver has been sold as a subsidized resort town and retirement community to the world,\u201d said Josh Gordon, a political science professor at Simon Fraser University here. \u201cWe are now seeing the culmination of that dynamic.\u201dHow much of the city\u2019s housing demand is coming from China is hotly debated. Government statistics show that foreign buyers own about 5 percent of the housing stock in the metropolitan area, but the numbers are several times as high for new condominiums, which helps to explain why a surge of building hasn\u2019t done much to reduce prices, according to an analysis by Mr. Yan. And this almost certainly underestimates the influence of foreign capital, since the data exclude Canadian immigrants with money from overseas.The real estate industry contends that the issue is not an influx of Chinese, who have been coming to Vancouver for decades, but zoning restrictions that prioritize low-density living, outside of a few high-rise areas.\u201cI live 15 minutes from the downtown core in a house,\u201d said Keith Roy, a real estate agent. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. I should be in a townhouse at this distance, maybe even a low-rise condo building.\u201dThe figures show, however, that unlike other expensive West Coast cities like San Francisco, where the housing supply has long lagged behind population growth, Vancouver has consistently produced new housing. Over the past decade, the housing stock has grown by about 12 percent, while the population has grown by about 9 percent, according to the city.This disparity has persuaded the city to broaden its measures beyond just a push for new buildings to efforts like the empty homes tax.\u201cIt\u2019s getting out of the mind-set that just more is better,\u201d said Gil Kelley, the city\u2019s general manager of planning, urban design and sustainability.Tom Davidoff, an economist at the University of British Columbia, said it was all of the above. Vancouver is popular with foreign buyers, yes. But it also has strict zoning laws that reserve most of the city\u2019s land for single-family homes, as well as high income taxes but low property taxes of about a quarter of a percent of the property value.\u201cThe message we have sent the world is, \u2018Come and buy our real estate, but do not try to make a living here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Davidoff said. \u201cMission accomplished.\u201dWhile the new government\u2019s housing measures are popular with many voters, richer homeowners are fuming. A recent stroll through Vancouver\u2019s wealthier West Side turned up bright red signs protesting the tax on $3 million homes. \u201cAre you angry yet?\u201d read one. \u201cRally against the N.D.P. tax grab now.\u201dHowever it happened, Vancouver\u2019s transformation to an international gateway has given the city something of an identity crisis. For Vancouverites who a generation ago took it for granted that they could buy a home or condo near the urban core, the trade-offs for the steep rise in prices are hard to accept.\u201cPeople who live and work in Vancouver can\u2019t afford to live here,\u201d said Nathalie Baker, a lawyer who is in favor of measures to cool the market, even though she owns a home here. \u201cAnd that is a very significant problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mahathir Mohamad, Leading Malaysia Again at 92, Is on a Mission", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "Facing a mountain of national debt accumulated under his predecessor, the prime minister has no time for apologies, mincing words or President Trump.Supported byPUTRAJAYA, Malaysia \u2014 Racing to figure out the depth of the fiscal crisis that awaited him after his inauguration, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his aides first entered the Malaysian government offices last month to find an alarming sight: oversize garbage bags filled with shredded documents, a snowstorm of loose papers on the floor, even half-consumed food left by former occupants in a hurry to get out.Even without piecing together a single shredded document, Mr. Mahathir, who previously served as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, has discovered that the country is in far worse financial shape than he and his allies had feared. The national debt, tallied at $170 billion by Mr. Najib\u2019s administration, has been reassessed, along with other government liabilities, at $250 billion. That is 80 percent of Malaysia\u2019s gross domestic product.\u201cThe more we look into the previous administration, the more bad things we find,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said in an interview in the grand, Islamic-style prime minister\u2019s office in Putrajaya, the administrative capital he helped design in the late 1990s. \u201cAny organization that had money, the previous government found the means to take the money.\u201dBut the claims of theft from national coffers extend beyond 1MDB to encompass an astonishing array of government-funded initiatives, from a rural development program and a plan for religious pilgrims to a provident fund and a coal mine in Mongolia.\u201cAll have been raped by the previous government,\u201d said Mr. Mahathir, who defected from the governing alliance two years ago. \u201cThey have taken money. Now they have lost the money.\u201dMr. Lim, an accountant and former banking executive, was equally direct. \u201cThey were just robbing the country blind,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m having nightmares practically every day, wondering what land mines will I tread on the following day.\u201dIf Mr. Mahathir\u2019s Alliance of Hope had not scored its surprise victory in the elections last month, Mr. Lim said, \u201cthe nation would have become a basket case.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe would be at a terminal stage.\u201dCoaxing the nation back to health depends on Mr. Mahathir, whose first tenure as prime minister was marked as much by his authoritarian impulses as his success in shepherding Malaysia\u2019s transformation into a upper-middle-income country. During his 22 years in power, Mr. Mahathir was accused by critics of playing race politics, muzzling the news media and locking up his enemies.Yet even Mr. Mahathir\u2019s former detractors contend that he is a changed man, cognizant of how unchecked power in the wrong hands can devastate a country.\u201cHe has mellowed, and unlike his first time in office, he has now realized that independent institutions are not a bad thing,\u201d said James Chin, the Malaysian-born director of the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania. \u201cPreviously, he was all about centralization of power in the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201dThat assessment is shared by those whose political careers he once derailed. Mr. Lim, the current finance minister, was imprisoned twice during Mr. Mahathir\u2019s previous time in office.\u201cI think it\u2019s Mahathir version 2.0,\u201d Mr. Lim said of his new boss. \u201cI think it\u2019s very different from the version 1.0 we saw when he first became prime minister. He\u2019s more reformist.\u201dHe is also a man in a hurry. Mr. Mahathir is unquestionably Malaysia\u2019s most charismatic and popular politician, but he will turn 93 next month. Mr. Mahathir has committed to eventually handing power to Anwar Ibrahim, the longtime leader of the opposition who was in prison during the recent elections.\u201cHe\u2019s a man with a mission, driven by the need to get things done in the shortest possible time,\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cHe\u2019s moving at a frenetic pace.\u201dBut Malaysia\u2019s political malaise cannot be traced only to the nine years that Mr. Najib was in power.\u201cThe state in which the country is today is not just the result of Najib Razak\u2019s misgovernance but also decades of populist politics and semi-authoritarian practices,\u201d said Sophie Lemi\u00e8re, a Malaysia specialist at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University.Mr. Mahathir acknowledged that cleansing a political machine riddled with corruption, not to mention aiding at least six national governments that are investigating missing 1MDB funds, has proved taxing. \u201cWe have asked so many people to resign we are left with a skeleton,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said.\u201cIt is obvious that he has stolen money,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said, indicating that his government had already accumulated \u201cenough evidence\u201d to have Mr. Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, put on trial. The two have been barred from leaving the country.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of seeking revenge,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said. \u201cIt is just the application of the rule of law.\u201dMr. Mahathir, long known as a workaholic, has kept to a schedule that would be punishing for a leader half his age. This week, he made his first foreign trip, to Japan, to court investors who could counter China\u2019s hold on the Malaysian economy. After returning late Tuesday, he woke up before dawn to pray. He has been fasting for the holy month of Ramadan.\u201cI have no plans to go and see him,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said of Mr. Trump, whom he called \u201cvolatile.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can deal with a person who is so much like a chameleon.\u201dMr. Mahathir has already distanced himself from his vow to hand over power within two years to Mr. Anwar, his onetime deputy who was released last month from prison. After all, Mr. Mahathir joked, he had suggested that time frame only because some thought he might become senile at age 95.\u201cI didn\u2019t do it. It was done in the proper way,\u201d Mr. Mahathir insisted on Wednesday. \u201cIt was up to the judge to decide whether there was a case or not.\u201dMr. Lim, the finance minister, admitted that Mr. Mahathir had never expressed regret for jailing him \u2014 but also said it was vital not to let old grievances fester.\u201cI forgive, but that doesn\u2019t mean I will forget,\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cI think the most important thing is to look forward.\u201dAs for Malaysia\u2019s new prime minister, who now has a rare opportunity to reshape his legacy, transform himself into a democratic icon and erase his strongman reputation, Mr. Mahathir refuses to engage in sentimentality.\u201cWhen you die, they rewrite your story,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when I am not around, they can say what they like.\u201dDouglas Schorzman and Sharon Tan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robots or Job Training: Manufacturers Grapple With How to Improve Their Economic Fortunes", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "With unemployment low and wages creeping up, companies have an incentive to become more efficient \u2014 an exercise that tends to drive economic progress.Supported byHICKSVILLE, Ohio \u2014 For Anthony Nighswander, rock-bottom unemployment is both a headache and an opportunity. For businesses and workers, it could be the key to reversing one of the country\u2019s most vexing economic problems: slow productivity growth.Mr. Nighswander is president of APT Manufacturing Solutions, which builds and installs robotic equipment to help other manufacturers automate their assembly lines. Lately, business has been booming: With the unemployment rate now below 4 percent, he says he gets calls every day from companies looking for robots to help ease their labor crunch.The problem is that Mr. Nighswander faces a hiring challenge in his own business, especially because, in this town of fewer than 4,000 people near the Indiana border, the pool of skilled workers is shallow. But rather than turn to robots himself, he has adopted a lower-tech solution: training. APT has begun offering apprenticeships, covering the cost of college for its workers, and three years ago it started teaching manufacturing skills to high school students.\u201cI never thought that I would be training high school students in our facilities,\u201d Mr. Nighswander said. \u201cWhat I knew was that I was in survival mode. I knew the orders for robots and for automation were coming in faster than I could get the jobs out.\u201dThat kind of urgency could prove to be a powerful economic force. The investments in training and automation by Mr. Nighswander and his customers should, over time, make their companies more productive. Multiplied across thousands of companies, those decisions could have benefits for companies and workers that endure even after today\u2019s hot economy inevitably cools.Productivity \u2014 how much value the economy generates in an average hour of work \u2014 gets less public attention than more intuitive economic concepts such as employment and wages, but it may be even more fundamental.Rising productivity \u2014 whether through better technology, more educated workers or smarter business strategies \u2014 is why people\u2019s economic fortunes, on average, improve over time. When productivity growth is strong, companies can afford to pay workers more without eating into their own profit margins, letting a rising tide lift all boats.Since the end of the Great Recession, however \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, even during the stronger economic times that preceded it \u2014 productivity growth has been confoundingly weak, forcing business owners and workers to compete over a relatively meager sliver of economic growth. There have been peaks and valleys, but not since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s has the American economy consistently delivered productivity growth above 2 percent a year.\u201cWe have customers continually coming to us and they\u2019re needing packaging done, and we\u2019ll have to say, \u2018We can\u2019t do that for you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Maletto said. \u201cThere were days when we might have to shut a line down.\u201dMr. Maletto tried raising pay, first by 25 percent and then by an additional 20 percent. He now offers up to $12 an hour for unskilled jobs and has tried offering signing bonuses. But workers can earn as much as $5 an hour more elsewhere, a wage Mr. Maletto says he can\u2019t afford, in part because multiyear contracts with some customers make it hard for him to raise prices.So Mr. Maletto is turning to automation. Late last year, he installed a machine that loads filled boxes onto pallets; more sophisticated robots from APT, Mr. Nighswander\u2019s firm, are set to arrive in August. Mr. Maletto took out a $1 million loan to pay for the equipment, a big gamble for a family-owned company. But with the labor pool shrinking, he said he had little doubt it was the right decision.\u201cIf we don\u2019t get things automated and we don\u2019t start moving things forward, we\u2019re going to be the ones who get left behind,\u201d Mr. Maletto said.Decisions like Mr. Maletto\u2019s aren\u2019t the way economists have historically thought about productivity growth. In traditional economic models, productivity is determined by technological advances and business innovations that aren\u2019t tied to the ebb and flow of recessions and recoveries. The economic boom of the 1920s, according to the standard narrative, was enabled in part by the spread of electric power. A similar pattern played out in the 1990s with the rise of personal computers. In both cases, technology paved the way for productivity, which in turn led to higher pay and faster growth.\u201cRight around the middle of that decade, you did start to get rising real wages for the first time in quite a long time,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cEmployers will be driven to, or be more likely to, think about ways to economize if the labor\u2019s more expensive.\u201dIf Mr. Wright is correct, it could have significant implications for economic policy. If productivity growth is essentially fixed in the short term, as traditional models assume, then rising wages will most likely lead to faster inflation, as companies pass on higher costs to customers. That would most likely force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively to prevent the economy from overheating.But if companies instead respond to the tight labor market by taking steps to increase productivity, then wages could rise without causing inflation. Under that approach, raising rates too quickly could be a costly mistake for the Fed, snuffing out the recovery before companies can make productivity-enhancing investments. That would be a particularly costly mistake because those investments carry long-term benefits \u2014 robots installed during a boom can keep running even when the economy slows.\u201cThe cost of running policy too tight is not just what we don\u2019t produce this year, it\u2019s all the lost production and lost income for many years ahead,\u201d said J. W. Mason, an economist for the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning think tank.If that happens, the beneficiaries could be people like Mike Steffel. Mr. Steffel, 39, grew up near here and never went to college, instead finding work in various low-paying factory jobs. In one position at a local manufacturer, he found himself drawn to the work done by skilled toolmakers.\u201cI saw what the journeymen were doing there, and I thought that was something that I\u2019d like to be doing as a career,\u201d Mr. Steffel said. \u201cYou have this raw stock of steel that\u2019s just sitting there, and making it into something useful, I like the thought of that.\u201dEventually, Mr. Steffel saw an ad from APT saying it was hiring and would pay for classes at the local community college. Mr. Steffel works at APT as an apprentice during the two-year certificate program, and is committed to staying a year after it ends. In return, he gets training as a toolmaker, a skill that could ultimately earn him more than $70,000 a year with overtime. And the skills he is gaining are less easily replaced by robots.\u201cThis is the career that I have chosen,\u201d Mr. Steffel said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get rich off it, but hopefully in the end I\u2019ll do well.\u201dFor Mr. Nighswander, training people like Mr. Steffel is an investment. For years, he said, he complained that the people graduating from local high schools and colleges didn\u2019t have the skills needed. But eventually he realized that he had to tackle the problem himself.In 2015, APT opened a training center inside its 75,000-square-foot headquarters. Every afternoon during the school year, eight to 10 students from the local high school spend two hours taking hands-on classes in electrical engineering, machining, practical math and other subjects. The students earn school credit, and many also work at APT after hours.Mr. Nighswander acknowledged that many trainees would never work at APT after graduation. Some may even work for his competitors. But when skilled labor is scarce, he said, companies have to start taking matters into their own hands.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of gearheads out there, and there always have been, and they\u2019re smart,\u201d Mr. Nighswander said. \u201cIf manufacturers are not willing to invest in education, then the only thing they can do is steal an employee from another employer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Parents Bringing Their Children on Treacherous Treks to the U.S. Border?", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump hopes to deter the flow of migrants into the United States, but near the busy border crossing in Arizona, some said that the threat of separation from their children would not deter them.TUCSON, Ariz. \u2014 When Luis Cruz left behind his wife, four of their children and the house he\u2019d built himself, he\u2019d heard that American officials might split him from his son, the one child he took with him. But earlier this month, the two of them set out from Guatemala anyway.The truth, he said this week, moments after they arrived at a cream-colored migrant shelter in Tucson, was that he would rather be apart from his child than face what they had left behind. \u201cIf they separate us, they separate us,\u201d said Mr. Cruz, 41. \u201cBut return to Guatemala? This is something my son cannot do.\u201dFor years, children and parents caught crossing the nation\u2019s southern border have been released into the United States while their immigration cases were processed, the result of a hard-fought legal settlement designed to keep children from spending long months in federal detention. In the eyes of the Trump administration, this practice has served as an open invitation for people like Luis Cruz, and has played a major role in driving thousands of families across the border with Mexico.Mr. Trump\u2019s newest immigration policies \u2014 first an effort to separate families crossing the border, and now an effort to change the legal settlement on migrant family detention \u2014 represent an aggressive effort to rescind that invitation, one that has plunged the nation into a debate about the limits of its generosity.But interviews at shelters and passage points along both sides of the border this week, as well as an examination of recent immigration numbers, suggest that even with tightened restrictions on families, it\u2019s going to be difficult for the president to stanch the flow.Though it\u2019s impossible to know yet whether the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d crackdown on illegal border crossers will have a significant deterrent effect, one thing was clear this week at the Arizona-Mexico border: Many families \u2014 especially those from countries in Central America plagued by gang violence and ruined economies \u2014 are making the calculation that even separation or detention in the United States is better than the situation at home.\u201cWhy would you undertake such a dangerous journey?\u201d said Magdalena Escobedo, 32, who works at the migrant shelter here in Tucson, called Casa Alitas. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a gun to your head, people threatening to rape your daughter, extort your business, force your son to work for the cartels. What would you do?\u201dAttorney General Jeff Sessions in April announced a policy of prosecuting all illegal border crossers, yet federal agents caught nearly 52,000 people at the border in May, marking a steady rise in illegal entries after a sharp decline during the first year of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. More than 250,000 migrants had been arrested this year as of late May, according to data by United States Customs and Border Protection; that number is close to the total number arrested in all of 2017, about 311,000.Casa Alitas, a low-slung building down a dusty street in Tucson, takes in families who\u2019ve presented themselves to border officials to ask for asylum. Once they\u2019re processed at immigration facilities, authorities drop them off here for a meal and a shower before they head off to stay with friends or relatives and wait for their day in court.On Thursday, men like Ren\u00e9 P\u00e9rez, 40, who made it into the United States with his son this week, said he was well aware that they might have been separated or placed in custody. \u201cIf it happens, it happens,\u201d said Mr. P\u00e9rez.Across the border in the Mexican town of Nogales, many parents preparing to cross the border said temporary separation from their children in the United States would be better than facing the violence back home.\u201cI\u2019d rather accept that, to know that my son is safe,\u201d said Lisbeth de la Rosa, 24, who was waiting in line to enter the United States with her 4-year-old son.\u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d said Lidia Rodr\u00edguez-Barrientos, 36, standing with her 9-year-old daughter. \u201cWhy? Because we\u2019re afraid to go back.\u201dWhat has guided much of border detention policy in recent years is a 1997 agreement in the case Flores v. Reno, in which the federal government was barred from detaining migrant children, save for a short period and under certain conditions. The agreement was interpreted later to include children traveling with their families.Critics, including Mr. Trump, have long said that allowing migrants to go free while their immigration cases are pending encourages parents to enter the United States with children, and some conversations bear that out.\u201cThis is the reason I brought a minor with me,\u201d said Guillermo T., 57, a construction worker who recently arrived in Arizona. Facing unemployment at home in Guatemala, he decided to head north; he had been told that bringing his 16-year-old daughter would assure passage. He asked that only his first named be used to avoid consequences with his immigration case.\u201cShe was my passport,\u201d he said of his daughter.Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a global fellow at the Wilson Center who has interviewed hundreds of Central American migrants in the field, said that they are primarily motivated to leave their countries by violence and lack of economic opportunities, phenomena which she described as closely connected.She said these migrant families choose the United States because they often have networks in the country already and know that there are many job opportunities. \u201cThere are push and pull factors. The push factors are the lack of economic opportunities and the security problems in their countries. It\u2019s a mix of these conditions. The pull factors are of course the jobs and the families.\u201dEven with steep drops in the number of recorded murders in the past year, El Salvador and Honduras, the home countries of many migrants, are still among the most dangerous countries in the world. Poverty is hammering away at livelihoods in much of Central America, and for some, the decision to leave is a gamble on a better life.For others, it\u2019s a matter of saving the one they have.On Thursday, federal officials dropped Mr. Cruz and his 16-year-old son, also named Luis, at Casa Alitas. Both wore black, despite the southwestern heat, and inside, they sat at a table covered with a cloth of bright sunflowers.They eagerly consumed big bowls of soup before explaining why they had come.The elder Mr. Cruz, a lemon and orange grove worker, had hoped to live his life in his home state of Suchitep\u00e9quez. Then in late May, his son was approached twice by a gang who demanded he join them, flashing a gun and urging him to commit his first extortion. \u201cThey kill you if you don\u2019t obey,\u201d said Mr. Cruz.On June 3, the pair left for the United States, and then presented themselves at the border to ask for asylum. After lunch at the shelter, the younger Mr. Cruz pulled a piece of paper from his pocket, unfolding it to reveal a letter his school director had written before he left \u2014 a note they hoped would be the evidence they needed to win asylum in the United States.\u201cThe student had to withdraw himself from school due to violence and gang persecution,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe decided to move to save his life.\u201dJulie Turkewitz reported from Tucson and Jose A.

{"Headline": "Europe Retaliates Against Trump Tariffs", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGOTEBORG, Sweden \u2014 The European Union fought back on Friday against the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs, slapping penalties on an array of American products that target the president\u2019s political base, like bourbon, motorcycles and orange juice.The European counterattack on $3.2 billion of goods, a response to the administration\u2019s measures on steel and aluminum imports, adds another front to a trade war that has engulfed allies and adversaries around the world. China and Mexico have already retaliated with their own tariffs, and Canada, Japan and Turkey are readying similar offensives.The risk of escalation is high since Mr. Trump has promised even more tariffs. Taking particular aim at German car manufacturers, the president has started an investigation into automobile imports to determine whether they pose a national security concern, the same justification used for his metal tariffs.\u201cYou look at the European Union,\u201d the president told a crowd in Duluth, Minn., on Wednesday. \u201cThey put up barriers so that we can\u2019t sell our farm products in. And yet they sell Mercedes and BMW, and the cars come in by the millions. And we hardly tax them at all.\u201d He added in a tweet on Friday that he would place a 20 percent tariff on European cars, if the barriers \u201care not soon broken down.\u201dBut in a trade war no sides are left unscathed. Although Mr. Trump has sought to exert pressure on other countries, the global nature of supply chains means the tit-for-tat tariffs are ricocheting in unexpected ways and may ultimately cost jobs in the United States. Sales of Mercedes S.U.V.s, made in Alabama by the German automaker Daimler, could be hit by the American trade dispute with China. The Swedish manufacturer Volvo faces rising prices on the imported steel it uses at its Mack Truck factory outside Allentown, Pa.The path to reconciliation is shrouded in uncertainty, creating the potential for broader strain in the global economy. While the Trump administration has sought to use economic force to exert concessions, the successive drumbeat of attacks has left little time to negotiate. Formal trade talks between Brussels and Washington have broken down, although informal channels have remained open.The European Commission, the European Union\u2019s administrative arm, applied its sanctions more than a week earlier than expected, in what analysts said was a show of strength.\u201cIt\u2019s a signal that the E.U. is striking back and taking this seriously,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London.As Mr. Trump pursues a nationalistic agenda, leaders in Europe and elsewhere are eager to demonstrate that they will continue to dismantle barriers to commerce, with or without the United States. Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, was in New Zealand on Thursday negotiating a free-trade pact with the government there, the latest in a series of treaties signed or in the works, including ones with Japan, Canada and Australia.\u201cWe did everything we could to avoid this situation, but now we have no choice but to respond,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom said in a speech in Wellington, New Zealand. \u201cThe E.U. has a responsibility to stand up for open global trade.\u201dThe new slate of European tariffs focuses on products that tend to be manufactured in Republican strongholds: whiskey and playing cards from Kentucky, recreational boats from Florida and rice from Arkansas.But trade wars don\u2019t play out that neatly. It\u2019s not easy to strike precise targets without collateral damage.Take the Mack Truck factory in Pennsylvania. Mack may be a quintessential American brand, but it\u2019s owned by Volvo Group, which is based in this seaport on Sweden\u2019s southwestern coast.The Mack plant uses specially treated steel imported from Europe. American substitutes are not readily available, if at all. That means the Allentown factory has to pay 25 percent more for some kinds of steel, putting it at a disadvantage with its competitors who manufacture in Mexico and can get the same high-quality steel without paying the Trump tariffs. At least for the moment, vehicles made in Mexico are not subject to tariffs when they are imported into the United States.Billy Joel sang about Allentown as the city where \u201cthey\u2019re closing all the factories down.\u201d The Mack Truck factory, in the suburb of Lower Macungie Township, has been an exception. It is \u201cpacked with orders,\u201d said Martin Lundstedt, the chief executive of Volvo Group, a manufacturer of trucks, buses and heavy equipment that is separate from the company that makes Volvo cars.But he worried that demand could slip if costs in the United States rose and the trade dispute triggered an economic slowdown. \u201cYes, it will affect us, and we need to live with it,\u201d Mr. Lundstedt said. \u201cIt could be that if you have production in the U.S. you are punished.\u201dIt\u2019s a similar concern for ABB, a supplier of heavy electrical equipment based in Zurich. ABB makes electrical transformers in South Boston, Va., and Crystal Springs, Miss.\u201cWe use a very specific kind of steel,\u201d said Ulrich Spiesshofer, the chief executive of ABB. \u201cThe capacity and the number of players for that kind of steel is very limited. The steel that we import from other places is being punished.\u201dEventually the competitiveness of the United States plants could suffer, Mr. Spiesshofer said.In retaliation for tariffs imposed by the United States on Chinese goods, China has threatened to increase penalties on American cars to 40 percent from 15 percent. That would hurt sales in the huge Chinese market by raising sticker prices for Mercedeses from Alabama as well as BMWs made in Spartanburg, S.C.\u201cFewer than expected S.U.V. sales and higher than expected costs \u2014 not completely passed on to the customers \u2014 must be assumed because of increased import tariffs for U.S. vehicles into the Chinese market,\u201d Daimler said in a statement late Wednesday.Last year, BMW exported about 80,000 vehicles to China, including its X5 S.U.V., from the Spartanburg plant, its largest factory in the world. BMW said in a statement on Thursday that it did not need to revise its outlook for profit because of trade tensions, but the company added that it \u201ccontinues to observe international developments closely.\u201dShares of major German and American carmakers fell sharply Thursday on worries of a trade-related slowdown. Daimler shares closed off more than 4 percent in Frankfurt trading, and BMW shares slipped 3 percent.If the trade conflict continues, companies could consider relocating assembly lines to other countries, leading to job losses in the United States. BMW already has factories in South Africa and China, among other countries.Carmakers would not make such a decision lightly. Moving manufacturing is expensive and takes years to carry out. The German carmakers continue to hope that the conflict will blow over and perhaps even provide a catalyst for removing trade barriers with the United States.Currently the United States charges a 2.5 percent levy on imported foreign cars while Europe imposes a tariff of 10 percent on cars from the United States. German automakers would be happy if tariffs fell to zero in both directions, though only as part of a broad trade pact, Eckehart Rotter, a spokesman for the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said Thursday.Ironically, the tariffs could have a small \u2014 if somewhat short-lived \u2014 upside for Europe. Local steel and aluminum may eventually fall in price because producers in countries like Russia or Japan will divert supplies that otherwise would have gone to the United States, creating a glut in the market. That would be bad for steel producers but good for machinery makers and other companies that use a lot of steel, potentially giving them an edge over their American competitors in overseas markets.But any benefits for Europe would be erased by a sizable disruption to global commerce. The biggest problem for companies, regardless of nationality, is that they don\u2019t know how much more the trade conflict will escalate. The uncertainty may already be gnawing on growth.An earlier version of this article misstated the location of Goteborg in Sweden. It is on the southwestern coast, not the southeastern coast.An earlier version of this article misstated the day of President Trump\u2019s speech in Duluth, Minn.

{"Headline": "The Lessons of a Stunning New York Primary", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistNever sated by the amount of attention that he gets and congenitally inclined to cast himself in the center of everything, President Trump tweeted about the most stunning of Tuesday\u2019s primary results \u2014 New York Representative Joseph Crowley\u2019s defeat by a 28-year-old newcomer named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 and suggested that Crowley\u2019s comeuppance reflected his insufficient deference and kindness to Trump.I can say with great certainty that their relationship is not the first, second or third explanation for what happened to Crowley, the fourth-highest-ranking Democrat in the House. But I can\u2019t tell you definitively what the moral of the story is, because there are many possible lessons here. Democrats should and will spend the weeks ahead analyzing them carefully.Crowley, 56, has been in Congress for nearly two decades and, since 2013, has represented New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District, which includes parts of the Bronx and Queens. He hadn\u2019t even drawn a primary challenger since 2004.He\u2019s the chairman of the Queens County Democratic Party. His name came up frequently in discussions about who might succeed Nancy Pelosi as the party\u2019s leader in the House. In other words, he\u2019s the establishment incarnate.Ocasio-Cortez is the insurgency galore. She worked as an organizer for Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. She ran on a progressive platform that included Medicare for all, a federal jobs guarantee and the abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Emphasizing her gender and her Latina heritage, Ocasio-Cortez said in a biographical video, \u201cWomen like me aren\u2019t supposed to run for office.\u201d But a woman like her is wise to campaign when a man like Crowley gets too comfortable and too assumptive and lets his guard down. Her video went viral, and she just won.Crowley\u2019s loss was characterized in The Times as the \u201cmost significant for a congressional incumbent since Eric Cantor, then the No. 2 Republican in the House, was defeated in 2014 by a Tea Party activist, David Brat.\u201d The comparison is exactly right. Different parties, same dynamic: Someone associated with the status quo and with entrenched interests ran afoul of an anti-establishment, pro-change impulse in contemporary American politics that flares in different places under different circumstances at different times.But there are other aspects of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory that are important to note. An understandable rap against the Democratic Party is that it\u2019s too old, especially in its leadership ranks, and Ocasio-Cortez is young. She\u2019s a woman in an election year when women are exerting their power. She\u2019s a minority at a moment when many voters are less indulgent of privilege and more determined to look at governing bodies and see faces that mirror the mosaic of America.She fashioned herself as a champion of people whom the economy has passed by, a message with proven resonance on both sides of the aisle. She spurned corporate PAC donations and didn\u2019t even try to win the money race against Crowley. That intensified her aura of independence and accentuated his status as an insider.Is her triumph also a validation of the progressive banner and of candidates who ally themselves with Sanders?That\u2019s harder to conclude, because before Tuesday, when she prevailed and the former N.A.A.C.P. head Ben Jealous won the Democratic primary in the Maryland governor\u2019s race, Sanders-aligned candidates weren\u2019t performing as well across the country this year as their backers had hoped they would.Just last weekend, The Times\u2019s Sydney Ember and Alexander Burns wrote that while Sanders\u2019s \u201cpolicy agenda had caught on widely among Democratic candidates and succeeded in moving the party to the left, Sanders himself has struggled so far to expand his political base and propel his personal allies to victory.\u201dWhat\u2019s indisputable is that Ocasio-Cortez ran a spirited, pointed, smart campaign and that Crowley erred, especially when, less than two weeks before the primary, he skipped a debate with her and sent, as his surrogate, a Latina former city councilwoman.He showed that in politics, absolutely nothing can be taken for granted. Ocasio-Cortez just demonstrated that to Democrats. I promise you that the party is perking up and paying heed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: When Asylum Is Your \u2018Only Shot\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.A heavy flow of Central American migrants and refugees has continued toward the U.S.-Mexico border despite intensifying obstacles to entering the United States: the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to illegal border crossings; the separation of thousands of migrant families; and tightening of \u201ccredible fear\u201d qualifications on asylum requests.Victor Clark-Alfaro, an adjunct professor at San Diego State University and director of the Binational Center for Human Rights in Tijuana, said that he did not believe the flow of migrants would stop. Mr. Clark-Alfaro said that in his extensive experience on the border working with migrants, an abundance of violence back home remained by far the most prevalent reason people have left their countries.\u201cIt\u2019s the gang violence. That is the biggest factor that is forcing them out. The economic situation is second; the violence is the primary reason,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the gang violence goes right along with the economy. There aren\u2019t any options.\u201dHe said that, from his vantage point, more and more Central Americans migrants were seeking entry into the United States through legal asylum claims, rather than \u201ccrossing through the desert or the mountains like before.\u201dAsylum denials are especially high from Central America, from which 75 percent to 80 percent of asylum cases were denied between 2012 and 2017, according to data from Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.\u201cOf everyone who is crossing, the vast majority will not get asylum,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying,\u201d he said, because \u201cthey see this as their only shot.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)What does Zsa Zsa\u2019s owner think put her over the top \u2014 or, should we say, down to the bottom \u2014 with the judges?\u201cShe was eating part of a Slim Jim on the table and just sneezed all over them and was drooling on them,\u201d the owner, Megan Brainard said.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Trump Arms an Adversary", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistIn a word: Trumpian.In an era of American baby prisons and Melania meta-messaging, it can be difficult to pay attention to the things that used to matter. So here\u2019s a quick primer on our former ally Turkey, which on Sunday goes to the polls for presidential and parliamentary elections.Good news? Well, yes, there is some. Precisely because Erdogan has driven the economy off a cliff, there\u2019s a modest chance he\u2019ll have to face a runoff election next month, and a decent chance his A.K.P. party won\u2019t get a majority in Parliament. Opposition candidates are more united against Erdogan than they\u2019ve ever been, and they\u2019ve drawn huge numbers at their rallies.What\u2019s an American administration to do?Turkey poses honest quandaries for U.S. policymakers. Are we better off, to use Lyndon Johnson\u2019s line about J. Edgar Hoover, with Erdogan \u201cinside the tent, pissing out, than outside pissing in\u201d? Turkey dominates NATO\u2019s southern flank, and the air base at Incirlik has served a useful role in the fight against the Islamic State. There have been calls to kick Turkey out of the Alliance \u2014 exactly how isn\u2019t clear \u2014 which might be emotionally satisfying and morally justified. But it would do nothing to improve Ankara\u2019s domestic or international behavior and would probably worsen it.The F-35 was leverage. We just squandered it.Worse, we did it just days before the election, handing Erdogan a political prize that he can wield as evidence that the United States doesn\u2019t dare to oppose him and that he can continue to behave as he pleases. In the meantime, a country now moving into Russia\u2019s orbit will acquire one of the most sophisticated pieces of military hardware ever made.If and when Erdogan goes fully anti-American \u2014 he\u2019s already nine-tenths of the way there \u2014 what\u2019s to keep him from allowing Russian technicians to take a closer look, so they might gain a better idea of how to shoot it down? Or from using it against American allies in the region, including Israel? If Obama were making this delivery today, Republicans would call it treason.It will be a lucky thing for Turks if Erdogan fails to win another mandate for five more years of political, social and ethnic repression. Turkey is a beautiful country of remarkable people that could yet show that a Muslim state can also be prosperous, tolerant and democratic.Should that happen, history will record that the United States did nothing to help, and much to hinder, the forces of freedom. As with so much that the Trump administration does, it\u2019s not a surprise, but it\u2019s still a shock.Gail Collins is on book leave.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Coming Tech Battle With China", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sharma is\u00a0the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Arriving in Beijing last month, I knew I would not be able to connect to Google, Facebook or Uber. As strange as it was to go without these staples of online life in the West, it was even stranger to find that local Chinese didn\u2019t seem to feel deprived at all. They search through Baidu, get their social media fix on WeChat, hail rides on Didi, curate news through sites like Toutiao. And while they know Beijing is watching, they accept this surveillance as normal.The Chinese government has carved out an alternative internet universe with its own brands, rules and culture, in which privacy doesn\u2019t exist. But its real ambition is to break out of this parallel universe and dominate not just the internet but the technology industry worldwide. To contain Beijing, the United States and its allies are fighting back with a campaign of technoprotectionism, opening a perilous new front in the global trade battles.President Trump is the unlikely leader of the fight against Chinese tech dominance. Widely seen as a champion of rust belt industries, he recently slapped heavy tariffs on all the leading aluminum and steel exporters, drawing fierce protests not only from China but also from American allies like Germany and Canada. But steel is a side show compared with the emerging tech battle with China.Technology will decide which country emerges as the world\u2019s dominant economic power in the long run. While about 20 percent of per-capita gross domestic product growth is driven by labor and capital, the remaining 80 percent is determined by how rapidly an economy is developing and applying new technology to increase production. China\u2019s ambition to catch up to Western living standards thus depends largely on how rapidly it can match or surpass Western technology.Mr. Trump is both accelerating and expanding trade battles that began before he took office. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, countries around the world began to restrict cross-border flows of trade, capital and migrants. Globalization\u2019s champions predicted that borders would continue to fall in at least one area \u2014 digital tech and the internet \u2014 but China has shown that a determined government can build walls in the virtual sphere, too.The president\u2019s tough stand on trade with China may be more popular than he is. The overwhelming consensus in the West is that Beijing is catching up illegitimately, by forcing companies that invest in China to share their best technology, or dispatching hackers to steal it. Though borrowing from the leading tech power is a standard development strategy \u2014 think of 19th-century America copying British industrial technology and Japan\u2019s great success replicating American technology \u2014 the scale and organization of China\u2019s campaign makes the threat feel new.Beijing has banned some foreign competitors like Google and Facebook outright, and regulated others so heavily that they have been compelled to sell themselves to Chinese rivals (Uber) or forced to consider pulling out of China (Amazon). In essence, China has created domestic internet monopolies that are generating enough cash in their vast local market to finance aggressive expansion abroad. I have been told, for example, that Toutiao already sells its novel content curating service to one in 10 Japanese.Last year Beijing rebranded the manufacturing centers of the Pearl River delta as the \u201cGreater Bay Area\u201d and began urging the main cities there \u2014 Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong \u2014 to cooperate to become China\u2019s rival to Silicon Valley, which the Chinese would like to make the lesser Bay Area.In Beijing, the buzz was about how \u201cCreated in China\u201d is replacing \u201cMade in China,\u201d with some claiming that Shenzhen is now more innovative than Silicon Valley in key industries. Instead of just assembling simple goods from parts built elsewhere, China is now increasingly seen as a cutting-edge designer and developer of artificial intelligence, drones and other advanced technologies.Mr. Trump was willing to lift the ban on ZTE after the company paid a $1 billion fine and fired its top executives, but Congress was not. The Senate voted to reinstate the ban, which is likely to fuel trade battles to come. When I was in Beijing, many Chinese were talking about how the humiliation of ZTE was inspiring an official push to reduce China\u2019s dependence on the United States for semiconductors, software and other critical tech imports.The European Union recently imposed new data protection rules written largely to give consumers more control of information now in the hands of corporate giants like Facebook, but also to guard against the spread of a China-like surveillance state. The European Union is also pondering a new digital single market, in part to give European companies a market in which they have a chance to grow as large as Chinese rivals.This is how a digitally interconnected world could die by a thousand cuts, and technoprotectionism may get a further push during the next global downturn. From the United States to Europe and Japan, public debts are high and deficits are rising, which means these governments are poorly positioned to spend their way out of any slowdown. Central banks can\u2019t help much, either, since interest rates are still very low, with little room or reason to drop further right now. In this environment, governments may see protectionism as the only lever they have left to pull.For most of the postwar era, the consensus in support of free trade was so strong that governments rarely resorted to raising tariffs even when times were tough. The trade wars that broke out after 2008 have involved mainly nontariff or \u201cstealth\u201d trade barriers, including cheap state loans and subsidies for favored industries. But in the last two years, the rise of Mr. Trump and other antiglobal populists has given new currency to protectionism in all its forms, including technoprotectionism.The global financial markets had largely ignored the brewing trade battles, until recently. As the tariff threats grow in scale, and the battleground shifts from rust belt industries to new technologies, the markets are growing more skittish. So far, stocks have been hit harder in China than in the United States, but there will be no winners. The latest surveys of American investors and manufacturers show that their biggest concern is the threat of a trade war.The risks from deglobalization are growing. If the current skirmishes turn into a full-blown trade war, blame will fall heavily on the thousandth cut. But the real fault will lie with the 999 that came before.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Los Angeles Times, Searching for Stability, Names Norman Pearlstine Top Editor", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn turning to Mr. Pearlstine, 75, who has led major news organizations like Time Inc., Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, Dr. Soon-Shiong was sending a message to the newspaper\u2019s beleaguered staff that he was emphasizing traditional journalistic values and aimed to have The Los Angeles Times return to the top echelon of American news outlets.\u201cHe\u2019s the perfect person to guide us into this new era,\u201d Dr. Soon-Shiong said in an interview Monday morning, as he sat in traffic on his way to The Los Angeles Times\u2019s office to make the announcement.From the start, Dr. Soon-Shiong, who in February announced that he would purchase the newspaper for $500 million, had promised to choose a prominent editor who would be well respected by the newsroom. For months he had sounded out a range of figures in journalism, including Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times, and Martin Baron, the editor of The Washington Post, seeking advice on whom to hire and even offering them the job.He started talking to Mr. Pearlstine shortly after he announced the deal, which closed Monday after a wire transfer went through to Tronc, the Chicago-based company that had owned the paper.\u201cI said over breakfast, \u2018I really need your help,\u2019\u201d Dr. Soon-Shiong said, recalling that first meeting with Mr. Pearlstine after he decided to buy the paper.At first, Mr. Pearlstine served as an adviser to Dr. Soon-Shiong, helping him identify possible candidates for the top job. But as their relationship evolved, Dr. Soon-Shiong came to see him as the right choice to stabilize the newsroom.Over his half-century career, Mr. Pearlstine has held some of the most prestigious positions in journalism. He was the executive editor of Forbes magazine for two years in the late 1970s. He was the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal from 1983 to 1991 and then the paper\u2019s top editor for a year. He was the editor in chief of Time Inc. for a decade, until 2005, overseeing prominent magazines like Time, Sports Illustrated and Entertainment Weekly. He was later the chief content officer for Bloomberg and then returned to Time Inc. for a short time before retiring.Although those jobs naturally brought him to Los Angeles over the years, Mr. Pearlstine has for decades been a Manhattan mainstay, hosting dinners and enjoying power lunches at Michael\u2019s restaurant. And despite boasting one of the most notable r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in the industry, he surprised some by stepping back into the fray of daily journalism. With his years of experience and deep connections to most of the powers in the industry, he is expected to recruit new talent and develop a leadership bench to whom he can eventually turn the paper over.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of attrition, a lot of talent has walked out the door,\u201d Mr. Pearlstine said in an interview. In meetings with the staff in recent weeks, \u201cwhat I heard was a lot of frustration, a lot of fatigue,\u201d he added. \u201cA lot of problems, but none that can\u2019t be addressed by a lot of care, of listening.\u201dSo the newsroom viewed the emergence of Dr. Soon-Shiong as a new owner with relief.\u201cThe message he\u2019s trying to send is \u2018I stand by the tenets of this industry,\u2019\u201d John Geddes, a former editor at The New York Times who worked with Mr. Pearlstine at The Wall Street Journal, said of Dr. Soon-Shiong.\u201cIn those conversations, he showed a pretty granular grasp of the newsroom\u2019s internal dynamics,\u201d said Matt Pearce, a national reporter at the paper who is also the vice chairman of its union, the Los Angeles Times Guild.\u201cPeople like him,\u201d Mr. Pearce added. \u201cHe\u2019s met with a ton of us behind the scenes and has come off as smart and approachable.\u201dDr. Soon-Shiong, who will take on the role of executive chairman at the paper, also said he immediately planned to invest $150 million in building a 10-acre campus for the newspaper in El Segundo, an area near the Los Angeles airport, that will include a museum to honor the newspaper\u2019s past. The property will also include event space and a state-of-the-art studio for producing podcasts and documentaries.The staff will begin moving there in July, vacating the downtown Art Deco headquarters, the paper\u2019s home since 1935 and a signature building in the Los Angeles skyline.Dr. Soon-Shiong also said that under Mr. Pearlstine the newspaper would start hiring new journalists, adding, \u201cMy quest is to get the best talent.\u201dDr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s acquisition of the newspaper returns it to local control after 18 years of out-of-town management. In 2000, the Chandler family, which had owned the paper for decades, sold it to the Tribune Company. As it went through other iterations of management, including the real estate tycoon Sam Zell and hedge funds, the once storied paper fell into disrepair with steep staff cuts and, at times, a frat-house culture that further diminished morale.In its heyday, the newspaper was an essential institution in the city, helping bind together a vast metropolis. In the 1960s and 1970s, under the guidance of Otis Chandler, the paper expanded nationally and internationally, earning a place among the country\u2019s greatest newspapers.\u201cIf I could speak for Otis Chandler, who I worked for for a number of years, Otis would be very proud of this choice,\u201d said Tom Johnson, a former publisher of The Los Angeles Times, who consulted with Dr. Soon-Shiong as he prepared to take ownership of the paper.Dr. Soon-Shiong said he wanted to see expanded coverage of Hollywood, sports and especially national issues that are resonant in California, particularly immigration.\u201cWe should own this immigration issue, this horrific issue with the children,\u201d he said.Mr. Pearlstine said he would put a new focus on subjects like sports, technology, the environment and food. He noted that several years ago, The Los Angeles Times had a larger staff than The Washington Post, and is now less than half its rival\u2019s size.In purchasing the paper, Dr. Soon-Shiong, who in addition to his biotech businesses owns a piece of the Los Angeles Lakers, is positioning himself to become an important power broker in the city.With its diversity \u2014 the population of Los Angeles is roughly half Latino \u2014 and a dynamic economy that is the world\u2019s fifth largest, California hasn't been well served by its journalistic institutions in recent years, he said.\u201cThe Times has not taken advantage of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at the paper, it\u2019s a shadow of its former self. We need to fix that.\u201dSydney Ember contributed reporting from Washington.Follow Tim Arango on Twitter: @tarangonytAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fighting Privilege: The Senate Finally Wants to Pay Its Interns", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the past two years, DaQuawn Bruce received news \u2014 not once, but twice \u2014 that he had dreamed of since middle school. He had been accepted into two competitive internship programs on Capitol Hill, opportunities that swarms of students vie for every year.But Mr. Bruce, who graduated last month from Carthage College in Wisconsin, had to turn down both of them. The internships were unpaid, and his family in Chicago, which relies solely on his mother\u2019s income, could not afford to send him to Washington to work for nothing.\u201cBy the time I got offers for internships,\u201d he said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a place to accept them, no matter how great the opportunities were.\u201dNow, in a bid to open Washington\u2019s halls of power to more economically diverse students like Mr. Bruce, the Senate has allocated $5 million to compensate all of its interns. The money \u2014 approximately $50,000 per Senate office \u2014 will become available if it is approved by the House, and then only at the start of the next fiscal year, Oct. 1. But the Senate measure is the first widespread organized congressional effort in two decades to ensure such payments.For years in Congress, wealthier students have had far greater access to the perks exclusive to interning on the Hill: a networking gold mine of legislators and lobbyists, and experience like conducting research and compiling briefing materials that makes them more attractive job candidates.Such a system fuels a glaring inequity: Already privileged students are able to access prestigious opportunities that open doors to competitive jobs, leaving their peers who cannot afford to work for free behind.And Congress\u2019s own version of the law, the Congressional Accountability Act, specifically excludes interns from receiving the same benefits, like minimum wage, as government employees.Advocacy groups are now pushing the House to follow the lead of the Senate, which approved a package of spending legislation on Monday that included the intern pay fund.\u201cInterns do good work in our office, and they should be compensated,\u201d said Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland and a sponsor of the intern pay provision. \u201cWe need to make sure that every qualified candidate has the opportunity to intern on the Hill regardless of their financial circumstances.\u201dThe drive by Mr. Van Hollen and the advocacy groups is an attempt to end a well-known and increasingly criticized fact of interning on Capitol Hill: Those who are lucky enough to be offered a competitive congressional internship will most likely lose money in order to accept it.Research conducted by Pay Our Interns, an advocacy group based in Washington, found last year that just over half of Republican senators compensated their interns, while barely a third of their Democratic peers followed suit. Those statistics were bleaker in the House: 8 percent of Republican representatives and 4 percent of Democrats paid their interns.Having to pay for housing, food and transportation \u2014 not to mention a professional wardrobe \u2014 in a city that is routinely ranked among the top 10 most expensive places to live in the United States can be a deal breaker for students who are unable to work without being paid.\u201cInternships can often be the gateway to working on the Hill, and we need to make that ladder of opportunity available,\u201d Mr. Van Hollen said.That opportunity eventually came to Mr. Bruce, the Carthage College graduate, through a scholarship from College to Congress, a nonprofit that provides low-income students with a $10,000 stipend. Thanks to that scholarship, he is now working as a summer intern with Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina.College to Congress was founded in 2016 by Audrey Henson, who experienced firsthand the difficulty of being a low-income student interning on Capitol Hill. In order to accept an internship with Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, Ms. Henson took out a $6,500 student loan and got a second job working at a bar near the Senate.\u201cI didn\u2019t see students like me\u201d interning in Congress, she said. \u201cMost of the people I interned with, their parents were lobbyists or congressmen or journalists.\u201dThat inspired Ms. Henson to start College to Congress, with a long-term goal of opening up the pipelines to diversity on Capitol Hill. \u201cThese are the first doors that open,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why these internships are so important.\u201dThose opportunities have been largely blocked off to low-income students since 1994, when Congress stopped funding a 20-year-old program that allocated to each House member\u2019s office funds for two-month paid internships. (No such program had existed in the Senate.)\u201cFor the longest time, it\u2019s been understood that with Congress and other very selective internships, they won\u2019t have to worry about compensating because they\u2019ll be flooded with applications,\u201d said David Yamada, a professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston who specializes in employment law with a focus on the intern economy.But groups like Pay Our Interns, led by Carlos Vera, a former House intern, say they will continue to push House members to allocate funds to pay interns. Mr. Vera said that he is working with Representative Betty McCollum, Democrat of Minnesota and a member of the Appropriations Committee, and that he hopes that funding can be approved within the next year.The recent legislation \u201csends a strong message that the Senate is ready to invest in the country\u2019s youth,\u201d Mr. Vera said. \u201cNow, the goal is all of Congress.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Head of Brazil\u2019s State Oil Company Resigns Amid Period of Unrest", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The top executive of Petrobras, Brazil\u2019s state oil company, resigned on Friday, fueling uncertainty about the future of the country\u2019s energy sector, a pillar of Brazil\u2019s economy that has drawn enormous interest from foreign investors in recent years.Critics said the government\u2019s move represented a return to the type of heavy-handed state meddling in oil prices that Mr. Parente had advised against when he took the helm of the company two years ago.Petrobras\u2019s fuel price policies have enormous impact in Brazil, a country of about 208 million people, because the company has a near monopoly on the refinery system. As the price of oil rose in recent months, and Brazil\u2019s currency dropped in value against the dollar, consumers began paying considerably more at the pump.Lawmakers across the political spectrum have been critical of Mr. Parente\u2019s market-tethered fuel price policies ahead of October\u2019s national elections.The company named Ivan Monteiro, its current finance director, as its interim chief executive on Friday night.Five days before the strike began, Petrobras hit an eight-year record market valuation of 388.8 billion Brazilian reais, or $103.7 billion. But since the beginning of the strike, it has lost over a third of its value.The company controls 90 percent of the oil and gas sector in Brazil, which in the past decade has represented roughly 2 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.Mr. Parente\u2019s departure caused the company\u2019s stock price to plunge and is certain to chill investor interest in Brazil\u2019s oil sector, compounding broader uncertainty about the country\u2019s political future ahead of the presidential election, which is shaping up to be the most splintered and unpredictable in generations.\u201cClearly that freedom ended,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the signals the government has sent through these decisions are negative. They have created a new cloud of uncertainty about the future of Brazil\u2019s oil industry.\u201dThe truckers\u2019 strike and Mr. Parente\u2019s resignation underscored the political weakness of Mr. Temer, who over the past few days has made progressively larger concessions as the strike over oil prices transformed into a broader outcry over corruption and a lack of faith in the political elite.Mr. Parente\u2019s resignation came two days after Senator Vanessa Grazziotin proposed an inquiry into the company\u2019s fuel price policies. Ms. Grazziotin said international oil companies stood to benefit from the subsidies Mr. Temer authorized in recent days, which will divert funds that had been earmarked for health and education programs.\u201cWe\u2019re living a moment of what I would almost call social convulsion,\u201d Ms. Grazziotin said in an interview. \u201cThe government says the only way of reducing the price of fuel is by making the population pick up the tab.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a measure the Brazilian government took in response to a truckers\u2019 strike. The government agreed to subsidize only the cost of diesel, not the cost of diesel and gasoline.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Have We Lost Our Civic Consciousness?", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:It seems that David Brooks has found, in Steven Brill\u2019s new book on meritocracy, a new angle from which to view the roots of our country\u2019s myriad ills as primarily cultural and moral, instead of economic and political. A boomer myself, I see much gone astray, but I hesitate to ascribe our current state to the disappearance of some mythical sense of community and civic consciousness.These are red herrings, diversions from the realities (and evils) of the frequent wars, increasing economic inequality and political corruption that have marked America\u2019s trajectory, beginning in the early 1960s. The fragmentation that Mr. Brooks laments has little to do with the encouraging recent history of expanded educational opportunity and social freedom. Diversity is hardly the culprit.A pervasive spirit of community can grow only in a society that aims to provide fairly for all, which appears to be a receding goal in the present climate of untethered capitalism and political venality.G.L. LOMAX, SAN FRANCISCOTo the Editor:David Brooks admires our country\u2019s progress to a meritocracy, while clearly explaining its weaknesses. What we need, he claims, is \u201ca new ethos to reconfigure it.\u201d Actually, what we need is quite an old one: \u201cIf I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am not for others, what am I? And if not now, when?\u201dAren\u2019t these concise questions from Hillel, the ancient Jewish sage, exactly what Mr. Brooks is recommending we ask ourselves now?To the Editor:Mr. Brooks, I take it you are talking about the baby boomer generation when you say \u201cus\u201d and \u201cwe.\u201d Born in the late 1960s, I am solidly Gen X. I did grow up understanding the importance of community, of working together, of having a life with meaning, not just money. I see the echoes of the boomer belief in independence and meritocracy in the millennials. They are incredibly focused on individual success as opposed to what is better for all.I am very hopeful that the new generation that is coming of age will begin to change what you boomers and your children have created. These young people, like the Marjory Stoneman Douglas students, are looking to make this a better world for all of us. I believe they will. Don\u2019t worry, we and they will clean up your mess.To the Editor:David Brooks asks why has so much talent produced such poor results. One answer is that the explosion of material gains in the second half of the 20th century, following the Great Depression and a world war, led to a misplaced sense of values, in which success was measured by the pursuit of wealth and its ostentatious display.If meritocracy was intended to replace a society based on inherited entitlement, then there had to be a way for the successful to proclaim their superiority. If they couldn\u2019t point to their ancestral tree to prove their worthiness, they had to show off the physical manifestations of their success: mega-mansions and vacation homes, luxury cars and private planes.If one were inclined to support worthy causes, how better than to have your name carved into the facade of a hospital building or an arts center to shout out your generosity? But meaningful investment in the community and its institutions, the sweat labor of day-to-day involvement in their activities, could be left to others.What does it matter if inequality rises, faith in institutions plummets, social trust declines, government becomes dysfunctional and our society is bitterly divided? The position of the educated elite atop the economic pyramid serves as testament to the elite\u2019s worthiness.To the Editor:David Brooks\u2019s excellent column neglects to mention the Vietnam War as a source of disillusion and disaffection on the part of the educated elite coming of age in the 1960s. The civil rights movement, which engaged the best of my generation, segued into the antiwar movement, which undermined trust in the government and the leaders who misled the public and exacted a high and bloody price in the lives of that generation.To the Editor:David Brooks ponders why American meritocracy has failed to deliver good government. How about this: While there may indeed be important exceptions (the sciences, for example), American meritocracy is largely a myth.Yes, opening the doors to women and minorities is great. But that in itself doesn\u2019t guarantee meritocracy any more than providing a choice of 50 flavors guarantees good ice cream.A century ago, artists needed talent to succeed. Now they are largely products of marketing machines. Rich dealers and collectors finance museum exhibitions to make the works of their chosen artists more valuable. Music has followed a similar downward spiral toward the lowest common denominator. University humanities departments have become something of a joke.I could provide many more examples, but one will suffice: Before concluding that America is a meritocracy, just look who\u2019s in the White House, and who\u2019s in the cabinet.WILLIAM COLE, SITGES, SPAINTo the Editor:I disagree with David Brooks on at least one point. The \u201ceducated elite\u201d did not lead to the rise of Donald Trump. Rather, Mr. Trump, his followers and the current dysfunctional government are the result of a last-gasp throwback to the time when, as Mr. Brooks describes, you \u201cclimbed the corporate ladder if you golfed at the right club\u201d \u2014 a time that Mr. Trump would like to return to.ELLYN ROTH, NEW YORKTo the Editor:David Brooks astutely lays out many reasons behind the recent weakening of the social bonds that hold us together as a society and the related loss of faith in our governing institutions. However, I was surprised to see no mention of the contribution to this trend made by the conservative movement, which has represented our guiding cultural and political philosophy over much of the past 40 years.It was, after all, Ronald Reagan who famously said, \u201cThe most terrifying words in the English language are \u2018I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.\u2019 \u201d While reasonable people can certainly disagree over the proper size and role of government, an ideology that constantly trumpets the importance of individuals working on behalf of their own personal ambition and denigrates the contributions of our civil servants is bound to have a detrimental effect on our view of these institutions over time.Government guided our country through the Great Depression, and with the help of the Greatest Generation won World War II. Surely, conservatives\u2019 more recent drumbeat of attacks on government is part of the story.David Brooks\u2019s explanation for \u201cThe Strange Failure of the Educated Elite\u201d is right about everything except the value of diversity, which he argues is a midpoint, not an endpoint, in establishing a more fair social system. But diversity is the loftiest of goals: Being able to understand someone radically different \u2014 and appreciate what you cannot know for yourself \u2014 is what art, philosophy and literature all help us do, sharpening our sensitivity to what is outside our own narrow experience.Building a government that recognizes this diversity, an economy that rewards it, a politics that honors it and a justice system that guarantees it are equally (and still not impossible) lofty goals.The writer is a professor and chairwoman of the English department at the City College of New York.Advertisement"}

Her husband, Daniel Lopp, 47, who works for a hedge fund, prefers the Who and the Grateful Dead.In their three years of marriage, they\u2019ve come to expect other differences, too: She doesn\u2019t get tired until around midnight; he usually calls it a night before 9. And while Ms. Lowsley-Williams likes to text and check her Instagram feed on her cellphone while doing just about everything, Mr. Lopp has no trouble putting his phone away.\u201cIf I don\u2019t have a screen next to me, I get antsy,\u201d Ms. Lowsley-Williams said. \u201cI always need to be doing something else \u2014 I can\u2019t even watch a movie, and it drives him crazy.\u201dSo it\u2019s not too surprising that when a millennial marries a member of Gen X or even someone older, their age difference can stir up some funny (and maybe frustrating) intergenerational drama. (Of course, there are plenty of older spouses who are just as obsessed about their phones and social media, and younger people who eschew Facebook or Twitter.)Kathleen Johnston, who is 32 and a development officer for Cornell University, says she often checks her \u201cmillennial tech habits at the door\u201d when she\u2019s with the family or friends of her husband, Neal Johnston, 44, an owner of a flour mill in Ithaca, N.Y.Ms. Johnston, who goes by the name Kaki, says she doesn\u2019t want to be considered rude and be \u201cone of those millennials who is always on their phone.\u201d Yet when she and her husband are alone \u2014 when her stepdaughter is asleep and she\u2019s finally winding down after a long day of work and commitments on two local nonprofit boards \u2014 she will sometimes pick up her smartphone. Mr. Johnston will then encourage her to put it down. She often obliges.On their Hawaiian honeymoon in Kauai this past January, she decided to leave her phone in their hotel room when they went to the pool or hiking. Even at home, she never brings her phone to restaurants. \u201cI\u2019m trying to meet him halfway,\u201d she said.Typically, however, Ms. Johnston spends lots of her downtime while she\u2019s alone on her phone, looking at memes or texting with friends. If she\u2019s not with her husband, she\u2019s texting him, too. Mr. Johnston will text her back, but he\u2019s often puzzled when she sends him bursts of texts in a row rather than just pick up the phone.\u201cI\u2019ll be up on a ladder at work, and then she\u2019ll wonder why I\u2019m not responding right away,\u201d he said, chuckling. Still, she says, at least she\u2019ll get on the phone now and talk. When he called her after one of their first dates, she cringed. \u201cI was like, O.M.G. What\u2019s wrong with him? Why is he calling me?\u201d she said.But communication isn\u2019t the only sticking point. Social media can put pressure on marriages, too. Many millennials are accustomed to posting edited photos of themselves for friends to see at every life stage. And just because they marry someone who is older hardly means they\u2019ll stop.\u201cGeneration X is more private \u2014 they are more careful about what they share online,\u201d said Jason Dorsey, the president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, a research firm that studies generational differences in baby boomers, Gen Xers and millennials. \u201cThey don\u2019t look for that same external feedback that millennials do.\u201dVeronica London, a 35-year-old photographer living in Manhattan\u2019s Soho neighborhood, says she \u201ccould take selfies all day.\u201dWhen Ms. London and her husband, Patrick Michael Wickham, a music composer and part of Generation X, went on their honeymoon in the Italian island of Capri, she was snapping photos of them on her camera phone at every turn. She was particularly thrilled when they hiked up a mountain. At the summit, she immediately took out her phone and began posing with Mr. Wickham, trying different filters.Mr. Wickham would have preferred she live more in the moment. \u201cMy private life is private,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to share everything with everyone.\u201dThe couple\u2019s differing approaches to social media couldn\u2019t have been more obvious than when Mr. Wickham refused to change his relationship status on Facebook. Ms. London wanted him to switch from \u201csingle\u201d to \u201cin a relationship,\u201d but Mr. Wickham didn\u2019t think it was important. He resisted until they tied the knot in 2017. That\u2019s when he changed it to \u201cmarried,\u201d much to Veronica\u2019s relief.\u201cIt really bothered me,\u201d said Ms. London, adding that she and Mr. Wickham had numerous conversations about why he wouldn\u2019t change the designation. \u201cI wanted him to be more transparent about us on social media.\u201dTechnology isn\u2019t the only way generational differences play into a marriage. For some, it\u2019s coming into the relationship from different life stages.Kate Bittman, a 40-year-old public relations consultant from Manhattan, says that as happy as she was after falling in love with her husband, Nick Traverse, 32, she was worried that he wouldn\u2019t want to have children soon enough. They met in 2010 while working at The New Yorker; she was a 32-year-old public relations associate and he was a 24-year-old editorial assistant. Sparks flew, and as things grew more serious, she dreaded the idea of bringing up marriage and children so early, but she felt like she needed to.\u201cDeep down, I was worried, \u2018My eggs! My eggs!\u2019 I wasn\u2019t even sure I wanted to have kids, but when you fall in love, you need to at least talk about it,\u201d she said.Mr. Traverse, now an editor at Architectural Digest, felt he was too young at that point, but he said he would begin to consider it, which eased her fears that she\u2019d get too old to have a baby. After he proposed in 2014, Ms. Bittman was thrilled and said yes. But something nagged at her: When would he be ready for children? She asked him, heart racing.\u201cI\u2019m all in,\u201d he reassured her after the proposal, adding that he was ready to try for a baby right after the wedding in 2015. Today, they have a 2-year-old son.\u201cMillennials are approaching marriage differently than previous generations,\u201d said Laura Heck, a licensed marriage therapist in Salt Lake City and a host of \u201cMarriage Therapy Radio,\u201d a podcast that counsels couples online. She\u2019s also a 33-year-old millennial. \u201cThey don\u2019t think their parents got it right, so they\u2019re saying: How can we do this better?\u201dMr. Dorsey of the Center for Generational Kinetics said that his research has found many millennials are looking to become more established in their careers and finances before committing to a life partner. A Gallup poll published in 2016 showed that only 27 percent of millennials were married at the time, versus 62 percent of Generation Xers.Jared Stanisci, a 39-year-old lawyer from Manhattan, says he envies the way that his husband, Chad Newman, 34, has sought out work that feels meaningful to him. \u201cI\u2019ve taken a more traditional path,\u201d Mr. Stanisci said.Mr. Newman, who works in the development office of the Picture House Regional Film Center, a nonprofit organization based in Pelham, N.Y., says his career has been a direct reflection of the economy.\u201cWhen I got out of school, there wasn\u2019t a clear path waiting for me, like there was for Jared,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t as much opportunity.\u201dSo he had to get creative, he says. He worked at a public relations firm, then went back to school for a master\u2019s degree in film studies. He applied for dozens of jobs in the entertainment sector, then after a \u201csoul sucking\u201d experience at a talent agency, decided he would rather make less money and do something he believed in.\u201cIf I\u2019m feeling restless, I\u2019m always up for something new,\u201d said Mr. Newman, who recently started taking guitar lessons just for fun.Satya Doyle Byock, a psychotherapist in Portland, Ore., whose practice specializes in treating people in their 20s and 30s, notes that many of her millennial clients also aren\u2019t willing to endure an unhappy or stagnant relationship. And that, she said, is a good thing.\u201cSome might view that as entitled,\u201d Ms. Doyle Byock said, \u201cbut I see that as hopeful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uses and Abuses of Economic Formalism (Wonkish and Self-referential)", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistSo what\u2019s Gruen\u2019s beef with me? He really, really doesn\u2019t like the formalization of economies of scale and imperfect competition in trade that went along with the rise of the \u201cnew trade theory\u201d, and compares it to the excessive faith in formalism that I myself have condemned in much of macroeconomics.Obviously I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair, and could say a lot about why I think the formalism was helpful. What\u2019s really important here, however, is to point out the essential difference between the attitudes of new trade theory and \u201cfreshwater\u201d macroeconomics toward real-world experience.This attitude, I\u2019ve argued, had major negative consequences, not just for research, but for policy: it helped cultivate a sense of learned helplessness in the face of mass unemployment.What about new trade theory? What us new trade theorists did was say, \u201cIt looks as if there\u2019s a lot going on in world trade that can\u2019t be explained in existing formal models. So let\u2019s see if there\u2019s a different approach to modeling that can make sense of what we see.\u201d In other words, the attitude toward formalization was almost the opposite of the macro wrong turn: it was there to help clarify our reality sense, not deny it.Now, we can argue about how much good this formalization did. I still believe that the formal models provided a level of clarity and legitimacy to trade discussion that wasn\u2019t there before; your mileage may differ. Certainly nothing I wrote on trade has done as much to provide policy guidance as, say, my writing on the liquidity trap.But one thing new trade theory certainly didn\u2019t do was lend support to really bad ideas, or induce policy paralysis. And another thing it didn\u2019t do was divert trade economists away from studying the real world. On the contrary, trade has become a far more empirical, open-minded field than it was when I first entered it.Anyway, this isn\u2019t about me (well, it sort of is, but never mind.) The important point shouldn\u2019t be \u201cdon\u2019t formalize\u201d; it should be that formalism is there to open your mind, not close it, and if the real world seems to be telling you something inconsistent with your model, the problem lies in the model, not the world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Election: What to Watch For", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a decade and a half, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has increasingly governed as a strongman, first as prime minister and then, since 2014, as head of state. In that time, he has transformed the country into a diplomatic heavyweight in the Middle East, while eroding much of its internal democratic infrastructure.In the international arena, Turkey has become a major actor in the Syrian war, a crucial player in the attempts to curb the European migration crisis and an unreliable ally to the United States and in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.On Sunday, Turks headed to the polls to elect both a new president and Parliament, in an election that will give the country\u2019s next president sweeping new executive powers. Two months ago, Mr. Erdogan appeared to have both votes locked up. But thanks to a tanking economy and an unexpectedly spirited performance by the opposition, the race is proving tighter than expected, both for him and his Justice and Development Party.Mr. Erdogan has been mainly a ceremonial head of state \u2014 exerting his will on Turkey through force of personality rather than constitutional right. But if he retakes the presidency, he will be formally granted broad new executive powers, effectively codifying into law the authoritarian way in which he has informally governed up to now.The new system will abolish the post of prime minister and transfer executive power to the president, giving the newly empowered president the right to issue decrees and to exert far greater influence over the judiciary and the Civil Service.The new version of the Parliament will have some ability to curb the president\u2019s actions. But if Mr. Erdogan and the Justice and Development Party win both the presidential and parliamentary elections, power will be centralized around Mr. Erdogan in a manner not previously known in Turkey\u2019s democratic history.\u201cWe\u2019re moving in full force into a new system \u2014 some would call it a new regime,\u201d said Soli Ozel, an international relations professor at Kadir Has University in Istanbul.One presidential candidate \u2014 Selahattin Demirtas, of the pro-Kurdish opposition group, the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party \u2014 has had to run his campaign from jail. He has been imprisoned on politicized charges for nearly two years, along with several of his lawmakers and dozens of his party\u2019s local officials.Under the state of emergency, political intimidation has become routine, government opponents have been accused of terrorism, and press freedom and the right to protest have been significantly curtailed.Pro-government companies own 90 percent of the news media, allowing Mr. Erdogan hundreds more hours of television time than most of his opponents.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s main challenger is Muharrem Ince, a fiery former physics teacher from the Republican People\u2019s Party, a centrist and secularist political grouping that has historically seemed removed from the struggles of ordinary people in Turkey\u2019s rural heartlands.Mr. Ince is polling at just below 30 percent, some 20 percentage points behind Mr. Erdogan but 20 ahead of the next two challengers, Meral Aksener and Mr. Demirtas.Mr. Erdogan has historically maintained his popularity in two main ways.The first was by championing Turkey\u2019s pious majority, who felt marginalized by the secular-leaning elites who ruled the country for much of the 20th century. The other was his transformation of a struggling economy into a strong one.But with the value of the Turkish lira in free fall and with food prices rocketing, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s reputation as the guardian of the economy is much diminished.That has made for a tighter race than analysts expected \u2014 as has Mr. Erdogan\u2019s comparatively lackluster performance on the campaign trail.The opposition has also put up a more coordinated fight. The mild-mannered leader of the Republican People\u2019s Party stepped aside to allow his feistier colleague, Mr. Ince, to run.The presidential race could be close if Mr. Erdogan does not win more than 50 percent of the vote in the first round, which would prompt a second round, on July 8.If that happens, most of the main opposition candidates have indicated that they will rally round his remaining challenger, who might have enough support for a narrow victory.The Justice and Development Party has said that the vote will be free and fair, and that fraud claims will be investigated.\u201cWe have by now taken every measure about security,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said of the voting procedures at a rally in Istanbul on Saturday.The main areas to watch will be the ones heavily populated by Kurds in eastern Turkey, where the result will be critical to deciding whether Mr. Erdogan will get a majority in Parliament.The polls opened at 8 a.m. and closed at 5 p.m. (10 a.m. Eastern), and the presidential election results will be announced first. The results are expected to start coming in about 9 p.m. in Turkey.The opposition has warned that Mr. Erdogan may announce his victory while the ballots are still being opened.Advertisement"}

The administration is scheduled to release on June 15 a final list of Chinese products covered by $50 billion of tariffs. It said that it will impose the tariffs shortly thereafter. China has threatened to retaliate.The Trump administration has two choices. It can settle for relatively unambitious gains and try to spin them as significant. Investors would welcome that outcome. Voters may, too. Alternatively, Mr. Trump can keep demanding big changes in China, and possibly plunge the U.S. into a drawn-out trade war. The imposition of the metals tariffs shows that he is willing to follow through. But it\u2019s still not clear how he will respond when his trade measures do significant harm to businesses or the financial markets.That moment may not be far away.-- Peter EavisReplacing him will be Hans Vestberg, currently the president of the company\u2019s global networks.\u2014 Michael de la MercedDuring his tenure as Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Mr. McAdam helped reshape the telecom giant \u2014 and part of that was through deal making. Not all of the transactions were particularly flashy, but they tended to follow one of two paths: Overhauling the company\u2019s network operations or building up its digital media division (which is now called Oath).Here are Verizon\u2019s top transactions since Mr. McAdam became C.E.O. in 2011, according to data from Thomson Reuters:\u2022 Verizon had asked Shari Redstone, the media company\u2019s controlling shareholder, if it would ever come up for sale, according to CBS\u2019s lawsuit against Ms. Redstone last month.\u2022 It briefly looked at buying the assets of Fox that Walt Disney ended up agreeing to acquire for $52.4 billion, including the 20th Century Fox movie studio and cable channels like FX.We\u2019ve looked at that over the years, and we made our decision to go digital. That\u2019s why we bought AOL and Yahoo, and we talk now about superchannels of sports and finance and news and some entertainment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIn his seven years as Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Mr. McAdam was known for his relentless focus on his company\u2019s wireless network and his aversion to striking big, splashy deals.As Verizon prepares for the telecom industry\u2019s future \u2014 where the only certain things are the rise of 5G wireless technology and online video streaming \u2014 here\u2019s what two research analysts think about what the company has done and where it\u2019s headed.Craig Moffett, MoffettNathansonMr. McAdam will be defined by the deals that he didn\u2019t do. Unlike AT&T \u2014 which paid nearly $50 billion for the satellite TV service DirecTV and is trying to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion \u2014 Verizon never struck splashy acquisitions, aside from those of Yahoo and AOL (combined purchase price: $9.2 billion).But that conservatism has worked in Verizon\u2019s favor. DirecTV has steadily lost customers in this age of cord-cutting, dragging down AT&T\u2019s financial health.\u201cI think he deserves a lot of credit for avoiding some of the traps that some of his peers have fallen into,\u201d Mr. Moffett said of Mr. McAdam.As for the fear underpinning many telecom companies\u2019 deal-making \u2014 that sticking to basic internet and phone service is boring \u2014 Mr. Moffett said Verizon has shown that worry to be unfounded.\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about being a distribution channel?\u201d he told me. \u201cVerizon fully understood and embraced that there will always be a place for an advantaged network \u2014 and people will pay a premium for it.\u201dAmy Yong, MacquarieMr. McAdam\u2019s relentless focus on making Verizon\u2019s network the best in the U.S. has paid off handsomely, with the company earning a premium from investors based on the strength of its core business.The big question is whether that will be enough going forward, as rivals AT&T and T-Mobile pursue bold moves.Verizon\u2019s cautious strategy may ending up costing the company. Though AT&T\u2019s bet on wireless video streaming hasn\u2019t paid off yet, if it works, it will make that company a formidable creator and distributor of content. And T-Mobile and Sprint could prove to be a strong new rival if their proposed union works out.\u201cThe future is looking very different,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat worked in the past may not be what works in the future.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedA new report suggests that Apple is preparing to sell fewer phones later this year. It may sound worrying. But we\u2019ve seen similar news before, and the fallout is unlikely to be all that bad.But Apple\u2019s phones are getting more expensive, so every sale counts for more. And its services businesses \u2014 things like Music and Pay \u2014 are becoming an increasingly valuable revenue stream, meaning that the company can make more money off existing users even if they don\u2019t upgrade to the latest device.\u2014 Jamie Condliffe\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe job faced by investigators of car collisions is getting more difficult as autonomous car features become more advanced, and the way they do their jobs might need to change to accommodate that.In March, a Tesla Model X collided with a concrete lane divider as it was driven down a highway in Mountain View, Calif. A new report by National Transportation Safety Board investigators suggested that Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology played a role in the death of a Tesla owner.The driver was using the advanced driver assistance features traffic-aware cruise control and autosteer lane-keeping assistance, which Tesla refers to as \u201cautopilot.\u201d As the Tesla approached the paved gore area dividing the main travel lanes of US-101 from the SH-85 exit ramp, it moved to the left and entered the gore area. The Tesla continued traveling through the gore area and struck a previously damaged crash attenuator at a speed of about 71 mph.Information isn\u2019t recorded in most cars\u2019 event data recorders, the automotive equivalent of airplane black boxes. Instead, the boxes show more basic information such as steering-wheel input and throttle.While automakers commonly provide the information if it is requested by the vehicle owner, accident investigators\u2014typically contractors hired by insurance companies\u2014say they sometimes have to seek a court order to obtain crash data.An update to the rules published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could change that situation, by demanding that automakers log more details about the vehicle\u2019s behavior.The complexity of the mathematical calculations involved means it\u2019s not straightforward to take the network apart to understand how it makes its decisions. This can make unintended behavior hard to predict; and if failure does occur, it can be difficult to explain why. If a system misrecognizes an object in a photo, for instance, it may be hard (though not impossible) to know what feature of the image led to the error.Many artificial intelligence researchers are trying to develop ways to make it easier to understand the inner working of A.I. systems. But for now, that\u2019s likely to involve looking at complex computer code. That suggests that crash investigation teams, as well as the regulations that are applied to automakers, might require an update in the near future, too.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeComcast is threatening to challenge Walt Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion bid for most of 21st Century Fox. Behind the scenes, it\u2019s playing down investors\u2019 and analysts\u2019 fears of an antitrust response. We may have just gotten a clue about whether it\u2019s right.The head of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, appears unruffled about a Disney-Fox deal, at least. From an interview at The Deal\u2019s conference yesterday:\u201cThey had good advice and carved out surgically what a transaction is that might be doable and who knows where that transaction leads.\u201dBut Mr. Delrahim also defended his team\u2019s effort to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, saying it was a merger of a kind that federal regulators had sought to block for decades. (A federal judge is expected to rule on the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against the deal on Tuesday.)Mr. Trump is the black sheep of this family, the estranged sibling who decided to pick fights with his relatives just before arriving to dinner. The dispute, Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, acknowledges, is \u201cmuch like a family quarrel.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 any of that will affect America\u2019s trade policies. But diplomatic tensions look set to rise, and economic uncertainty would rise with them.Elsewhere in trade:The Trump administration removed crippling penalties on the ailing Chinese telecom company in exchange for $1.4 billion in fines and other measures. But did some other big gain drive the deal?Getting Beijing to approve Qualcomm\u2019s takeover of another chip maker, NXP Semiconductors? Maybe. China\u2019s latest trade concessions, which were linked to the Trump administration not imposing certain tariffs? Unlikely.More from Jane Mayer:A business associate who declined to be identified, in order not to jeopardize his ties to the family, told me, \u201cCharles pushed David out. It was done with a wink, and a nod, and a nudge.\u201dSF Bloodstock and SF Racing Group, a company controlled by top executives at the billionaire\u2019s investment firm, has a 15 percent stake in the horse, which is the heavy favorite to win tomorrow\u2019s Belmont Stakes.SF Bloodstock, which according to court filings is owned by SF Agricultural Holdings L.L.C., employs a for-profit model and focuses on the breeding side of the industry, purchasing stallions, or shares in them, and broodmares while selling yearlings at auction. In 2015, it entered into a three-year partnership with WinStar Farm and China Horse Club that allowed them to spend big while spreading risk at yearling and 2-year-old sales.

That is, \u201cif you can figure out how not to get expropriated,\u201d Mr. Hastings added, citing Pyongyang\u2019s history of seizing assets.Nearly three-quarters of South Korean businesses would be willing to make an investment in North Korea once sanctions were lifted, according to a survey of 167 companies published last week by the Maeil Business Newspaper in South Korea.Of the few Chinese, Japanese and South Korean companies that have ventured into the North, many have seen their assets confiscated.Xiyang Group, a Chinese mining company, finished building its first mine there in 2012 only to see North Korea kick its employees out of the country and take over.

{"Headline": "E-Commerce Might Help Solve the Mystery of Low Inflation", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment is sinking and businesses are churning out more goods and services. Yet even with the economy standing on tippy toes, prices and wages are climbing a lot more slowly than anyone has expected.The studies reinforce the views of Federal Reserve officials who see the internet\u2019s increasing influence as a leading suspect in a continuing mystery: why inflation routinely falls short of their 2 percent target, considered the sweet spot for keeping the economy humming without overheating.But some of the latest findings suggest that those fears could be unfounded \u2014 and that the official statistics are overstating inflation.An analysis of that information by Austan Goolsbee of the University of Chicago and Peter Klenow of Stanford found that prices for goods sold on the internet rose much more slowly from 2014 to 2017 than indicated by barometers like the Consumer Price Index, or C.P.I.Online prices of personal computers fell by 12.3 percent, for example, but the C.P.I. showed just a 6.9 percent drop. Toy prices online slumped 12 percent, while the C.P.I. put the drop at just 7.8 percent. Online prices for photographic equipment and supplies fell 9.2 percent compared with the 0.6 percent decline registered by the official measure.\u201cPrices are going down a whole lot faster than the C.P.I. shows for the same things,\u201d he said.New online research offers more evidence that \u201cthe more efficient method of selling through e-commerce is holding inflation down compared to what it would have been otherwise,\u201d said Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University.Figuring out just how much of an impact online shopping has had on inflation, however, remains a challenge.The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which calculate those two measures, look at a typical basket of goods and sample prices, at times adding or eliminating items, like food and energy, that can vary widely from one month to the next.Even with thousands of price inspectors, the government can sample only a tiny portion of goods and services sold across the country. The traditional measures are also not well suited to take account of the constant introduction of new and upgraded products \u2014 like Instapots and athleisure yoga pants.Cellphones, for example, were not included in the C.P.I. until 1996, when about 40 million Americans, or 15 percent of the population at the time, were already using them. In many cases, prices for those new goods \u2014 like computers \u2014 plunge over time, but price indexes fail to capture the change.Putting aside apparel, where designers offer new fashions every season, the research found that 44 percent of the products sold online did not exist in the previous year. And nearly a quarter disappeared from one year to the next.\u201cWhat we have never had before is the quantity of stuff online,\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said. Online spending now accounts for 10 percent of all retail spending, and in some categories 50 percent.This isn\u2019t the first time innovations in shopping have upended pricing structures. Over time, the introduction of the Sears catalog similarly held down prices compared with the small, local stores where people had always shopped, said Mr. Gordon, the Northwestern economist.Stephen Reed, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that \u201cwe constantly re-evaluate our methods and consider new research.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen and Jim Tankersley on Twitter: @PatcohenNYT and @jimtankersleyAdvertisement"}

But the Regents rejected as too costly Mr. Ambach\u2019s call for a longer school day and an extended school year.\u201cIn retrospect,\u201d he added, \u201cthis strategy seems to have been sound.\u201dGordon MacKay Ambach was born on Nov. 10, 1934, in Providence, R.I., to Russell Ambach, an engineer, and Ethel (Repass) Ambach, a teacher and school administrator.He graduated from Yale in 1956 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in American studies and earned a master\u2019s in teaching and an advanced certificate in education administration from Harvard.Mr. Ambach taught history to seventh and eighth graders at the Wheatley School in East Williston on Long Island for three years, then served in education jobs in Washington and Boston before joining the New York State Education Department in 1967.

For the past few days the president has been engaged in a campaign of words over his trade plans with another of the state\u2019s businesses \u2014 Harley-Davidson, the 115-year-old motorcycle maker that has long been an icon of Wisconsin.He added: \u201cBuild them in the U.S.A. Your customers won\u2019t be happy if you don\u2019t.\u201dPlans for the Foxconn factory, too, have been a matter of great debate. Advocates have held it up as opening a new high-tech manufacturing era for the southeastern portion of the state, once a major center for auto assembly.State officials say the jobs would pay, on average, $53,875 a year plus competitive benefits packages. Gov. Walker called it the state\u2019s largest-ever economic development project and said it could help reverse a \u201cbrain drain\u201d problem the state has long grappled with.With campaigns underway, Mr. Trump\u2019s pointed remarks about Harley-Davidson have also left Mr. Walker and other Wisconsin Republicans in a difficult position: How to support one of the state\u2019s beloved companies without crossing the president?Mr. Walker, who has a 2003 Harley Road King and has ridden it regularly during his campaigns, did not mention the company on Thursday.

{"Headline": "With Jobs to Fill, Businesses Play the Visa Lottery", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRonda Fox finally got the news last week, three months into planting season: The federal government approved her application to employ more than a dozen temporary foreign workers for her family-owned landscaping business in Aurora, Colo.She had hoped to have her crew in place by April 1, but had initially lost out in this year\u2019s visa lottery. \u201cBetter late than never,\u201d Ms. Fox said.In Centennial, a quick car ride away, Phil Steinhauer faced the same hiring challenge for his landscaping business. But his application for 150 temporary foreign workers was selected through the federal lottery in the first round, and his hires were in place when the season started.Mr. Steinhauer, though, is far from satisfied with the way he had to fill the jobs. \u201cYou can\u2019t build a business on a lottery,\u201d he said.Debates over using foreign workers for seasonal labor \u2014 lower-wage jobs that Americans have spurned \u2014 have been as constant as the calendar. But a tight labor market and the fraught politics of immigration have added new urgency to the issue in an election year when Republicans and Democrats are wrestling for control in Congress.The visa program also feeds the increasingly bitter debate over immigration.To Mr. Steinhauer, \u201cit\u2019s a labor issue that gets thrown into the immigration debate because people are coming from foreign countries, and the country is so divided on that.\u201dCongress has capped the annual number of H-2B visas at 66,000 \u2014 evenly split between the winter and summer seasons \u2014 although administrations have at times increased the allotment.Last month, after frantic requests, the Department of Homeland Security agreed to issue an additional 15,000 visas. Ms. Fox got lucky and snagged a dozen of those slots, though her crew, all veterans of previous seasons, is unlikely to arrive from Mexico until next month.A certified public accountant, Ms. Fox shakes her head when she hears economists insist that theory dictates that wages should rise until they are high enough to attract workers.Her company, All Seasons Landscaping, is in Colorado\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, which wraps around Denver like a question mark. It has an unusually high proportion of college graduates and an unusually low unemployment rate; the average annual salary for workers who are not self-employed is nearly $63,000.Landscape work is harsh. Digging in the dirt and heaving equipment in blistering heat produces aching backs and raw hands. Low-skilled workers can earn a similar wage making a sandwich or working in an air-conditioned warehouse.\u201cWe put a $5,000 ad in The Denver Post, and we didn\u2019t have one applicant,\u201d Ms. Fox said. Paying a wage high enough to attract local workers would put her out of business, she said, because her customers would balk at the resulting price increases.Like Ms. Fox and other landscapers, Mr. Steinhauer signed planting contracts with customers last year based on the assumption that his crews would earn roughly $15 an hour. \u201cThese are unskilled positions,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you pay $50 to plant a bush in your garden?\u201d\u201cWith the economy as good as it is, I don\u2019t know many families who are telling their kids to become landscape laborers,\u201d Mr. Steinhauer said. \u201cAnd who wants to work a job where you get laid off in November and then come back?\u201dThese political crosscurrents are coursing through the Sixth District, which has one of the most closely watched midterm House races. A revision of the district\u2019s boundaries combined with waves of immigrants and refugees from Ethiopia, Mexico and Nepal in recent decades has turned it into one of the state\u2019s most diverse. It is one of 25 districts that sent a Republican representative to Washington in 2016 at the same time it gave Hillary Clinton a plurality \u2014 in this case, by a nine-point margin.Defeating the five-term Republican incumbent, Mike Coffman, is a critical part of the Democrats\u2019 push to win back the House in November.Ms. Fox, who describes herself as a fierce independent and a \u201cconservative by nature,\u201d said that the Dreamers should be protected from deportation and that she was disturbed that children were being separated from their parents at the border.\u201cI don\u2019t agree with any of it,\u201d said Ms. Fox, who wants a long-term immigration policy. She hasn\u2019t settled on her midterm vote yet, but said she liked Mr. Coffman.As for the H-2B program, Mr. Steinhauer and Ms. Fox said they did not blame Mr. Trump for its flaws, noting that there were similar problems under Presidents Barack Obama and George W.

What did the United States want? What did they both want?President Trump has said he does not need to prepare for his summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. But if Mr. Trump or an adviser were to make a similar set of notes, what might they say?Nixon answered this question for China in three concise answers: Build up their world credentials. Taiwan. Get the U.S. out of Asia.Mr. Trump might also reduce North Korea\u2019s concerns to three points:1. SecurityMr. Kim\u2019s top priority is the security of his nation and the survival of the totalitarian regime that he inherited from his father and grandfather. He has said this is why he needs a nuclear arsenal: to deter the United States from attacking North Korea and attempting to overthrow him, as some in Washington have advocated.But he has also committed to denuclearization, as long as the North can be guaranteed of its security. That is one reason a formal peace treaty ending the Korean War is under discussion. It could include assurances from both China and the United States and might lead eventually to the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea.2. RespectIf Mao was interested in China\u2019s \u201cworld credentials,\u201d Mr. Kim may be more interested in building up his reputation at home.Being treated as an equal by Mr. Trump confers prestige on Mr. Kim that he can use to strengthen his grip on power.Recognition as a nuclear state and acceptance in the international community would also bolster his position and allow him to boast of an achievement that eluded his father and grandfather. It is also a reason he may be reluctant to give up the weapons.3. Economic reliefMr. Kim has long called for the simultaneous pursuit of nuclear weapons and economic growth, but he abruptly announced in April that he was adopting a \u201cnew strategic line\u201d that focuses on rebuilding the economy.\u201cThis is our biggest point of leverage,\u201d said Suzanne DiMaggio, a director and senior fellow at the New America research group who has been involved in unofficial talks with North Korea.Nixon\u2019s wish list from China included both immediate and long-term items \u2014 help ending the Vietnam War, restraining the spread of communism in Asia and reducing \u201cthe threat of a confrontation by Chinese Super Power.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s list for North Korea may be a similar combination of short- and long-term goals:1. DenuclearizationThis is the holy grail. It is critical to the balance of power in the region and global efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. But the vast scope of North Korea\u2019s program \u2014 and the fact that it has already tested and built nuclear weapons \u2014 means it would be the most challenging case of nuclear disarmament in history.2. StabilityBut Mr. Kim said in April that the North no longer needed to test nuclear weapons or long-range missiles. If Mr. Trump persuades him to extend the moratorium, that would ease tensions while also slowing the development of his arsenal.3. Reduce threat to alliesMr. Trump has shown a disregard for America\u2019s traditional alliances around the world, but the United States is bound by treaty to defend both South Korea and Japan. Reducing the threat posed by North Korea would make it less likely for America to be drawn into a conflict in Asia.Japan in particular is worried that even if North Korea gives up its nuclear arsenal and its ICBMs, it would still have shorter-range missiles as well as chemical and biological weapons. \u201cYou can say you\u2019ve protected Americans,\u201d said Daniel Sneider, a scholar at Stanford University. \u201cOf course, you\u2019ve left Japanese and Koreans and 80,000 American troops plus their dependents at risk.\u201dThis is where there is room for a deal to emerge. Nixon noted that China and the United States both wanted to reduce the risk of a conflict, and that both favored a more stable Asia and a restraint on the Soviet Union.Mr. Trump might find common ground with Mr. Kim in these areas:Both men have expressed frustration at the lack of progress in previous negotiations and may be interested in a game-changing breakthrough that redefines the relationship between the two nations.\u201cIf you just look at it as, \u2018Give up your stuff,\u2019 that framework is why we\u2019ve been banging our head against the wall for so long,\u201d said John Delury, a North Korea scholar at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cIf we say we need to fundamentally change the relationship, then you have a framework where there can be real progress.\u201d2. Reduce danger of confrontation and conflictMr. Trump threatened to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea last year, and a North Korean official warned of a \u201cnuclear-to-nuclear showdown\u201d just a few weeks ago.But a war would mean devastating casualties, including of American troops in South Korea, and American cities would also be at risk of suffering a nuclear strike because of the North\u2019s recent advances. For Mr. Kim, a war would almost certainly result in the end of his rule and the destruction of his country.3. Make our countries \u2014 and our leadership \u2014 great againMr. Trump and Mr. Kim are both looking for political victories that will help them at home.\u201cThe imagery of Kim and Trump holding hands, embracing and declaring an end to the Korean War, is probably something they both individually want,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, a senior fellow and director of the Washington-based Alliance for Securing Democracy.4. More independence from China (?)North Korea once enjoyed two sponsors, China and the Soviet Union. But China has been its main economic benefactor since the Soviet collapse, accounting for more than 90 percent of foreign trade. In recent years, Beijing has also helped keep the North afloat by blocking or resisting tighter sanctions against it.There is evidence, though, that suggests Mr. Kim is worried about growing too dependent on China.As the United States and China compete for influence in Asia, any shift by North Korea away from Beijing might work to America\u2019s advantage.[Could North Korea move out of China\u2019s orbit?

{"Headline": "The Roberts Court Protects the Powerful for a New Gilded Age", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Purdy is a professor of law at Duke.Faith in courts runs deep in the American liberal imagination. Remembering Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade and the recent marriage-equality decisions, we keep hoping that wise and fair-minded judges will protect the vulnerable and lead the country toward justice.When it comes to economic inequality, today\u2019s Supreme Court is not only failing to help but is also aggressively making itself part of the problem in a time when inequality and insecurity are damaging the country and endangering our democracy.Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the court has consistently issued bold, partisan decisions that have been terrible for working people. Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, decided on Wednesday, was one of them.Just hours after that decision, Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement. With this \u201cswing\u201d vote gone, Chief Justice Roberts is now likely to take even more control over the direction of issues related to economic inequality \u2014 a direction that is earning him a legacy as chief justice of bosses, not workers.It\u2019s the kind of knotty technical issue \u2014 one type of fee for nonmembers of one variety of union \u2014 that makes law boring. Unlike the Masterpiece Cakeshop case the court decided in June, Janus isn\u2019t an obvious morality tale: Even many liberals often have mixed feelings about the public-sector unions that represent bureaucrats, subway employees, police officers and teachers.But Janus is big. As Justice Elena Kagan explained in her dissent, allowing employees to opt out of paying union fees while getting the benefits of representation risks starving the unions of resources, leading to ineffectiveness and collapse. Moreover, knifing unions at a time of intense controversy over state austerity budgets and widespread teachers\u2019 strikes suggests, as Justice Kagan wrote, that the court \u201cwanted to pick the winning side\u201d in these fights by \u201cweaponizing the First Amendment, in a way that unleashes judges, now and in the future, to intervene in economic and regulatory policy.\u201dThe New Deal shook American law. Its triumph brought new attention to economic power. Antitrust law worked to cut back corporate concentration and control. Labor unions were essential to what the Progressive-Era jurist Louis Brandeis called \u201cindustrial democracy\u201d \u2014 democracy adapted to a complex modern economy.Some people still imagine \u201cworkers\u201d as white men, but the American working classes are increasingly female, immigrant and nonwhite. There\u2019s no separating these hierarchies.The 1970s court also returned to its old habit of dressing economic power in constitutional principle. The dominance of the very rich in American politics is often attributed to the Citizens United decision of 2010, but that case only amplified a 1976 opinion, Buckley v. Valeo, in which the court shredded post-Watergate campaign-finance regulation and announced that private individuals could spend unlimited sums on candidates (including themselves). When the Roberts court used the First Amendment to protect corporate (and union) political spending in Citizens United, it was extending a longer-running trend. This is part of what Justice Kagan means when she observes that the conservative majority is weaponizing the First Amendment.These cases have the potential to make economic and political inequality significantly worse. Take the mandatory arbitration cases. In 1992, as the Supreme Court began to allow arbitration to enter employment relationships, only 2 percent of non-unionized companies imposed arbitration on their workers. Today the figure is 54 percent and sure to grow because it conveniently ties the hands of disgruntled or mistreated workers. These cases have replaced a majority of employees\u2019 legal protections with a system of private agreements that replicates the unequal bargaining power of workers and companies. Arbitration agreements will become only more important as \u201cgig\u201d employers such as Uber devise their contracts to get around labor law.And as the court used to recognize explicitly, there is no keeping economic power separate from political power. The remaining (disproportionately public-sector) unions are bastions of support for Democrats. The partisan overtones of suits seeking to weaken union influence are uncomfortably overt: The court was asked, in effect, to shift the rules in favor of Republican constituencies, and the votes fell out along squarely partisan lines.It is especially damaging for the court to rule with such unmistakable partisan implications when many still hope to see it stand as a forum of principle against the Trump administration\u2019s self-dealing, attacks on immigrants and other vulnerable groups, and general disregard for the procedural regularity that is the day-to-day life of the rule of law.But the challenge is deeper than partisanship. Democracy treats people as equals. An economy that makes them increasingly unequal undermines it.Justice Frankfurter was right. Economic and political matters are inseparable, and the law decides how they are stitched together. The Supreme Court can defend bosses\u2019 bargaining power, the political spending power of the very wealthy and the prerogative of states to deny health care to their low-wage workers \u2014 or it can curb these powers to support a modern safety net. It can tilt organized labor closer to a death spiral, as it did with Janus; but with different justices, it might recognize the importance of unions to postindustrial democracy, as previous courts did.These are choices. A different law of economic power is possible. In a time of significant economic inequality, we need campaign-finance laws that limit the influence of wealth and treat citizens as equals. We need a labor law that helps workers organize in new kinds of workplaces, such as home health care and the gig economy. We need antitrust law that can wrestle with the new quasi-monopoly power of platform-based companies such as Amazon and Facebook. We need forms of social caretaking and security that are even stronger and more universal than Obamacare.These aren\u2019t tasks for the Supreme Court. They are jobs for better legislators and presidents \u2014 and for scholars, unions and mobilized citizens. What is at stake is whether American democracy can overcome the new Gilded Age of inequality and insecurity. The justices, meanwhile, are part of the problem: In Janus and other rulings, they have retrenched on the side of private power and budgetary austerity. A different law of economic power will have to wait for a different court, and that will come only through winning elections. Those victories get more uphill every year, thanks in no small part to the current court.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Fed Will Remain Focused on Bankers\u2019 Ethics", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street\u2019s front-line regulator intends to keep pushing big banks to improve their ethics.The new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, John C. Williams, on Monday gave his backing to his predecessor's campaign to clean up bank culture. \u201cI do commit to continue the New York Fed\u2019s leadership on this in future years,\u201d he said at a New York Fed conference on bank governance.More than four years ago, after a number of big scandals on Wall Street, William C. Dudley, who was until Sunday the president of the New York Fed, started the initiative to improve the culture at large financial institutions. Mr. Dudley succeeded in getting top bankers to participate in regular discussions about how they could overhaul the culture of their institutions, and in some cases, boards of major banks have started to focus on the issue of employee conduct. But some of his more ambitious ideas have not been taken up.Mr. Williams, previously the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, did not specify the policies that he might pursue to try to bring about a lasting improvement in bankers\u2019 ethics. Instead, his main message on Monday was that bankers and regulators must be careful not to relax their efforts at a time when banks\u2019 financial performance looks strong.Good times such as these, Mr. Williams said, can create the circumstances that lead to scandals. He said:First, there\u2019s a risk of complacency setting in \u2014 an \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d mentality.Second, in a strong economy, the hard numbers that we tend to focus on when examining profits, losses, capital and liquidity can look like everything\u2019s coming up roses, even when an uncomfortable reality lies beneath.And, finally, culture is a long-run investment that takes many years to develop and requires constant reinforcement to preserve. If you let it erode, you can\u2019t go to the market and obtain a new \u201cculture\u201d overnight.Mr. Williams can use the New York Fed\u2019s bully pulpit to press for changes, but putting new measures into effect might prove hard. Mr. Dudley favored an industry database of banker misconduct, similar to the one for brokers, that banks could consult before hiring. He recently said legal issues made such a register difficult to set up.Mr. Dudley also proposed that banks pay bankers, in part, out of a pool of money that could be tapped if the bank had to pay regulatory fines or got into financial trouble. On Monday, he again promoted the idea.\u201cWhat\u2019s more, a similar regime governs compensation of senior managers and material risk takers in the United Kingdom,\u201d Mr. Dudley said, \u201cThis demonstrates that the concept can work on a broad scale. But, to the best of my knowledge, no firm in the United States has voluntarily adopted such a regime.\u201dWhether other top bank regulators also favor a strong focus on bank culture is not clear. Officials appointed by the Trump administration might, for instance, decide to oppose a measure proposed by the New York Fed on the grounds that it would add too much new regulation.But, because of the way the New York Fed is set up, Mr. Williams operates with a degree of additional independence, compared with other prominent regulators. And on Monday, he sounded like he was committed to taking up Mr. Dudley\u2019s cause. He said:Strong culture and robust corporate governance are our first lines of defense. They\u2019re a critical part of the tool kit when it comes to protecting people, banks and the economy from risk, scandal, and harm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Excerpts From the Higher Ed Leaders Forum", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe live in this tribal time in our politics; there\u2019s deep polarization. And let\u2019s be honest, if you look at the vote in the last election, Hillary Clinton won overwhelmingly among people with postgraduate degrees, college-educated whites; she lost by 40 points among noncollege-educated whites. Young people voted overwhelmingly for her over [Donald J.] Trump. And so campuses generally have a skew. And in this deeply polarized environment there is a lot of pressure. One of the professors at the University of Chicago invited Steve Bannon recently for a debate with Austan Goolsbee, the former chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers on globalism. And what could be richer than that?And the campus was in an uproar. A lot of students and 100 faculty members signed a petition saying we shouldn\u2019t allow Steve Bannon on campus. The invitation was not rescinded. He himself decided, unfortunately in my view, not to come. But I don\u2019t think we can yield to that, and I think, you know, there may be some campuses that react differently than ours. We have a very strong commitment to free expression.Colleges are supposed to be places where you learn how to deal with the world you\u2019re about to be in. And if you\u2019re in a funk by 10 a.m. because somebody wrote an offensive tweet, you\u2019re going to be in a safe house for the rest of your life. You need to deal with it. You need to learn how to counter it or ignore it, or whatever needs to be done. That\u2019s what a good academic experience should be. I was very fortunate to be invited to be on the faculty of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, to go to the faculty meetings and stuff, for two years. And I told the students, \u201cThe ones getting the best education here are the conservative students, because their views are challenged every day.\u201d About 3.7 percent of the registered voters in Cambridge are Republicans. That\u2019s a fact. So the dominant view is a little different. That\u2019s fine. But you need to have different ways to have your views challenged.I think it\u2019s quite apparent that there are a host of people who feel left out. And what we see around the country is a reaction to, and to a certain degree of anger at, institutions that promote the idea that I am unworthy somehow, because I hold the wrong ideas, because my lifestyle is not appropriate in some way, because I\u2019m not smart enough.We talk about inclusiveness all the time, but we don\u2019t really mean it. When we say \u201cinclusion,\u201d we mean inclusion if you agree with me, and if you believe in the same things. But we are so diverse and we believe in a lot of different things, some of which are admittedly pretty heinous things. But still, we\u2019re part of the human family. And the trick for us in higher education is to figure out a way to promote the values that we believe in, the standards that we know to be important, and at the same time make people feel included in that.Higher education has historically been \u2014 and still is \u2014 an important bridge to opportunity and an engine for economic and social mobility. And for many people, that seems inaccessible. Either it doesn\u2019t meet the needs or it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s a place for me or it\u2019s unaffordable. So building on that, I think as a system there\u2019s a view that it\u2019s not keeping up, it\u2019s not supporting and meeting the needs of students, and therefore one\u2019s ability to access the American dream is perceived as less.I can\u2019t really identify a tipping point, but what I have seen is there\u2019s a sort of steady trend in the direction of increasing fragility and increasing vulnerability in students. Your impulse as a teacher is to sort of put your arms around them and make sure they don\u2019t hurt themselves, and that you don\u2019t hurt them, and that other students don\u2019t hurt them, in a way that wasn\u2019t an issue when I first started teaching. It looks like they\u2019re going to break if one bad thing happens. So certainly I think in the last 20 years of my time at Swarthmore, I was dealing with much more fragile people than I was in the preceding 20 years \u2014 there\u2019s no question.The economy has changed so much, and now nearly every employer creating any new job is requiring some sort of postsecondary credential. So we have an entire population in California, over eight million individuals, who are in the work force but only have a high school diploma or some college but no credential. Those are nontraditional learners \u2014 those individuals who are stranded, who are stuck in the work force, who don\u2019t have any real opportunity to have wage gain, promotional opportunities, unless they get some sort of credentials.So that\u2019s why we now look at them as students. These are individuals who need learning and certification and credentialing. So those are our students, and I guess you would consider them nontraditional, although pretty soon they\u2019ll be just as traditional as everybody else.I think here is where income plays an advantage, and that well-off families, families that can pay the full fare at any institution, will find a home. And oftentimes they will find not only a home but may likely have money given to them to attract them into an institution. I think that many institutions are trying to address the students of the lowest income levels and for them they\u2019re finding students are getting full fare or all tuition and cost of attendance paid for.And so a lot of institutions, many at sort of this private level, are becoming bimodal. So I think it\u2019s the families in the middle, the families able to pay some portion but maybe not all, who are finding themselves squeezed and challenged, and maybe are not able to meet that ideal of being able to go to the college they most want to go to. They\u2019re going to the college they most feel they can afford.Without a just cause, we start feeding people what they want rather than what they need. Ted Koppel talks about this in the news. He says: \u201cWe used to give people the news they needed, whether they wanted it or not. Now we give the news they want, whether they need it or not.\u201d And I don\u2019t have to go into the polarizing nature of news in America today, and what a vicious cycle that creates, and these echo chambers. I would argue that universities are leaning toward that same direction. We\u2019re giving people the classes they want whether they need them or not, and we\u2019re sometimes avoiding giving them the classwork they need, whether they want it or not \u2014 real important things that will help advance your just cause but, more important, will help advance them as human beings.Because I can tell you in my work the people who make choices based on salary alone end up unhappy, end up in broken marriages and end up doing rather unethical things because they\u2019re so driven by the mighty dollar. Why aren\u2019t we teaching people? Let\u2019s put that in affirmative: You should teach. I strongly urge you to include things like confrontation, effective confrontation, communication skills.You\u2019ve heard already from younger generations with increasing rates of anxiety, increasing rates of depression, increasing rates of suicide. We\u2019re seeing it in these school shootings, where something like 80 percent of them are perpetrated by a kid \u2014 by children who are lacking good relationships. It\u2019s human relationships that are missing.When we first learned that [the conservative scholar] Charles Murray was coming on our campus \u2014 he\u2019d been invited by a student group \u2014 the first thing that we did is we put together an engagement team. That engagement team included the academic leadership of the university, our student affairs people, our public safety people, our facilities people, to have a dialogue with the students who were organizing the talk. To learn about what their goals were. To let the students know that we were fully committed not only for the right of the speaker to speak but the right of the audience to hear and the right of those who wanted to express dissent to be able to do so in a way that didn\u2019t preclude the others\u2019 rights.Those discussions were about lots of tactical things, including what they\u2019ll wear, what the location of the talk would be, what access would look like. The students decided that they wanted to limit it to just University of Michigan students, which made things a little bit easier. Our public safety folks put together a plan to figure out how we were going to do things in case there was a disruption.I think it\u2019s a great part of Brown\u2019s history that in the \u201960s this very clear policy was articulated. It says that any student organization or faculty member can invite any speaker of their choice onto campus. I remind students when they object to it that this was during the \u201960s. It was a time when the university president did not want antiwar protesters coming onto campus. So the policy was really put into place to protect people who wanted to bring in antiwar protesters or civil rights activists, and it\u2019s persisted over time. So if I have students who complain about it, I say, look, this policy has stood all groups well for over 50 years.The hierarchy in the real world is very different than the hierarchy at universities. In the real world, Christians and today Jews \u2014 Jews are today\u2019s WASPs. You know, when I went to school, Jews were discriminated against. We couldn\u2019t get jobs in law firms, and we couldn\u2019t get jobs. But today, Jews can get jobs everywhere, and so we are not in any way marginalized in the major society.But on university campuses, the hierarchy is totally and completely different. Minorities are the most empowered. If they want to shut down a professor, if they want to claim they\u2019re victims of hate speech, they\u2019re going to get more attention than a Christian student or a Jewish Zionist student.And so, you know, maybe that\u2019s fair. You give students four years or six years or eight years where the hierarchies are very different but you have to recognize they are very different. Affirmative action is not only an admission criteria today: It is a criteria for free speech. You get more free speech if you are a minority and less free speech if you\u2019re not, and I think that safe spaces are mostly reserved for minorities. Zionists and Christians and others aren\u2019t entitled to safe spaces.In spite of the current occupant of the White House, we are living in a global era, and unless the president messes up higher education by making it difficult for international students to come to the United States \u2014 and he\u2019s well on his way to get that done \u2014 we have a comparative advantage as a consequence of the international footprint that we have with our universities. People from all over the world come here, not just to go to school but to become members of the faculty. So it is an international operation to begin with, higher education, and there\u2019s no question in my mind that the students get tremendous value.And by the way, 75 percent of our students are international, not because we want it to be 75 percent \u2014 we don\u2019t have any geographic preference at all. But there\u2019s no question that they get tremendous benefit from being involved together, getting to know each other and working in international communities.Carolina at this point has a 36 percent study abroad rate, which is in the top 20 of the public universities in the country. Thirteen percent of those students are going to Asia. We saw a 2 percent increase in the last year of student interest in Asia. But it\u2019s not a problem of interest, it\u2019s really a threefold problem.There\u2019s a financial barrier; some of these students work so hard to get to Carolina and then they say, now I want to go to Shanghai, and that feeds into another barrier, which is a cultural family barrier. Some of these students have a very difficult time convincing their families this is something that they should do.And I think the third one is maybe institutional, where these kids are so focused on their majors, particularly the science majors or the pre-meds, that getting off those tracks are difficult sometimes to study abroad. So what we\u2019ve been trying to find and create and encourage over the last 12 years is more faculty-led programs, more partnerships with science labs, getting musicians to study abroad, getting linguists to study abroad, really opening it up as wide as we can. But certainly access and affordability will always be the challenge.The four-year colleges and community colleges are a perfect opportunity to bring people together to live together, to work together, to socialize together. We have to do a better job, I think, of fostering interpersonal relationships. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a very good job \u2014 I mean we don\u2019t even teach civics in many places anymore in America in the K-through-12 system. If you wait until college, it\u2019s too late. We\u2019ve got to start earlier understanding people come from different faiths, different cultures, different races, religion. We\u2019re a melting pot. That\u2019s who we are as a country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Handmaids of Capitalism", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistYou can tell a number of stories about why this happened. Defending the legal logic of abortion rights \u2014 my body, my choice \u2014 pushed feminism in a libertarian direction. The benefits of in vitro fertilization made a lively trade in eggs and embryos seem desirable or at least inevitable. The gay rights movement created strong social pressure in favor of allowing male same-sex couples to have children as close to the old-fashioned way as possible. And biotechnology advanced to a point where most commercial surrogacy became \u201cgestational,\u201d meaning that the surrogate carries someone else\u2019s child rather than her own \u2014 which reduces the particularly agonizing aspect of the Whitehead case, where it was her own biological child that she had sold and wanted back.But perhaps the simplest way to describe what happened with the surrogacy debate is that American feminists gradually went along with the logic of capitalism rather than resisting it. This is a particularly useful description because it\u2019s happened so consistently across the last few decades: Whenever there\u2019s a dispute within feminism about a particular social change or technological possibility, you should bet on the side that takes a more consumerist view of human flourishing, a more market-oriented view of what it means to defend the rights and happiness of women.For most conservatives this reforming vision is assumed to be religious \u2014 the Christian moralism that attacked the vicious capitalism of slavers and gentled the ruthless capitalism of robber barons and sustained nonmarket institutions like the family and the church across the long ascent of global wealth. But I am not under any illusions about the cultural position of my own faith in the late-modern West. At best, Christians may hope to build a counterculture, but in the wider landscape our ability to shape trends or resist them is at a historical low ebb.Whereas feminism in this age of #MeToo inquisitions (I mean that in a good way) and \u201cthe future is female\u201d ambition does have real capital to burn. So as feminists look around for places to turn their moral energy, the consumerist trajectory of their movement is worth contemplating, and the suspicious gaze that 1980s feminism once turned on the flesh trade in all its forms might be worth recovering.At the very least it is a grave mistake for feminists to assume that because the moralism of the past was often patriarchal and sexist, they must always choose \u201cconsenting adults\u201d individualism over a more holistic morality, a presumption for choice over a defense of human dignity, the logic of the market over more communitarian alternatives, a consumerist interchangeability of the sexes over a social architecture that respects their differences.Something needs to pull our society back from its dehumanizing and commodifying drift. It might yet be a form of feminism \u2014 if feminists can stop going with a current that their foremothers wisely attempted to resist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kirstjen Nielsen Was a Target of Trump\u2019s Immigration Ire. Now She\u2019s His Protector.", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week, confronted by images of children in cages after they had been separated from their families at the Southwest border, Ms. Nielsen served as a shield for the Trump administration against global criticism for its hard-line attempts to discourage illegal immigration.Smiling as she took the White House lectern on Monday, Ms. Nielsen read from a script defending Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which has separated 2,300 children from their parents yet failed to reduce the number of families trying to cross the border. She falsely said that Mr. Trump\u2019s family separation strategy was not administration policy, wrongly insisting it was the result of legal \u201cloopholes\u201d that only Congress can fix.Asked whether images of young children packed into detention centers and an audiotape of them keening for their parents were intended or unintended consequences of the administration\u2019s decision making, Ms. Nielsen replied: \u201cThey reflect the focus of those who post such pictures and narratives. The narratives we don\u2019t see are the narratives of the crime.\u201dAsked \u201chow is this not child abuse,\u201d she responded coolly, \u201cBe more specific, please.\u201d\u201cSurely a nation as big, generous and compassionate as the United States can find a way to prevent separating children from their parents at the border,\u201d Thomas J. Donohue, the chamber\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement on Tuesday.The reasons for the increase in border traffic are many, including the cyclical nature of migration and a booming American economy. But Mr. Trump has become increasingly enraged and focused on a crackdown, heaping new pressure upon Ms. Nielsen.Ms. Nielsen\u2019s comments to reporters at the White House on Monday appeared to appease Mr. Trump, who on Tuesday night said she \u201cdid a fabulous job.\u201d\u201cWe want \u2018heart\u2019 and security in America!\u201d the president wrote in a Twitter post.The Department of Homeland Security, which has a budget of more than $40 billion and a staff of more than 240,000, is a sprawling amalgam created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that cobbled together 22 government agencies. The department is responsible for everything from protecting the nation from cyberattacks to responding to natural disasters.The steps taken once families are apprehended by agents at the United States-Mexico border, and how adults and children are processed differently.But as the president rails about illegal immigration, Ms. Nielsen\u2019s attention has been increasingly drawn to the department\u2019s border security role.\u201cYour priority, once you accept the job, is to echo the president\u2019s priorities. She has done that,\u201d said Tom Ridge, the first homeland security secretary, who said Ms. Nielsen has often sought out his advice. \u201cBut this president, with some of the things he sometimes does and says, has made her job harder.\u201dAt 46, Ms. Nielsen is the youngest person to lead the sprawling agency, and an unlikely choice for the job. She was a staff member at the agency before leading it, helping to set up the Transportation Security Administration, now an agency within homeland security, after the Sept. 11 attacks. She was later tapped to be a special assistant to President George W. Bush, working on the White House Homeland Security Council.After Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise election victory, Ms. Nielsen volunteered for his transition team and helped prepare John F. Kelly, then the president-elect\u2019s nominee for homeland security secretary, for his confirmation hearings. Mr. Kelly named Ms. Nielsen his chief of staff, and the two have moved in tandem through the Trump administration, becoming personal friends in the process.In a recent interview, Ms. Nielsen said she was quietly trying to put her own stamp on the agency, focusing on beefing up the cybersecurity division and doing a critical assessment of other programs at the department.\u201cIt\u2019s time we took a look at what works and what might work better,\u201d she said.She defended the department\u2019s withdrawal of Temporary Protected Status for nearly 300,000 Hondurans, Salvadorans and Haitians, many with American-born children, who were granted haven in the United States after natural disasters and civil unrest. The decisions prompted a diplomatic outcry.In February, after the administration began pulling back the temporary protections, the department\u2019s assistant secretary for international engagement in the office of strategy, policy and plans decided to resign. The official, James D. Nealon, a former United States ambassador to Honduras, had reportedly also clashed with the White House over immigration policy.In the interview, Ms. Nielsen insisted she was simply doing her job. \u201cIt\u2019s not partisan,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should all care about securing our borders and our country. We\u2019re talking about stopping criminals, criminal gangs and terrorist suspects. We need to know who is trying to come into the country.\u201dOver her six months in office, Ms. Nielsen has tried to straddle the line on immigration policy, between critics on the left who wanted her to be a voice of conscience and those on the right who accused her of being soft on illegal immigrants.\u201cUnder the best circumstances, D.H.S. is a hard place to run,\u201d said Jay Ahren, a former commissioner of Customs and Border Protection during the administration of President George W. Bush. \u201cNo single person can run an organization of that size without a strong team.\u201dEven before her Monday briefing, Ms. Nielsen had become a political lightning rod. Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee, accused Ms. Nielsen of politicizing the department. \u201cI think she has been distracted by overthinking how well something is going to be received at the White House,\u201d he said.In the White House, Ms. Nielsen\u2019s political fortunes have hewed closely to those of Mr. Kelly. A department spokesman disputed that she drafted a resignation letter last month and described as \u201cfalse\u201d reports that she had been close to resigning.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Ruthless\u2019 Mexican Candidate Goes Far. But Maybe Only So Far.", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 If the candidate was nervous about his chances, few could tell.Ricardo Anaya was 21 years old and running for elected office for the first time. The prize was a congressional seat in the Mexican state of Quer\u00e9taro, representing a poor, rural area far from his home in the state capital where he had grown up on a country club. It was enemy territory: His party had never won the seat, and this time would be no different.But until the final vote tally was announced, the candidate betrayed no sense, beyond his inner circle of confidants, that he might lose.\u201cHe was giving everyone confidence that he could win,\u201d said Jacob Morado Garc\u00eda, who was then the local president of Mr. Anaya\u2019s party, the center-right National Action Party, or PAN, in the municipality of Pinal de Amoles. \u201cHe did everything possible to win.\u201dEighteen years later, Mr. Anaya now finds himself in a somewhat similar position, though the stakes are many orders of magnitude higher.Were Mr. Anaya to win, it would crown a vertiginous rise to the top of the Mexican political firmament, a climb driven by a consummate political savvy \u2014 some say genius \u2014 and a ruthlessness that has stunned even the most seasoned political operatives in Mexico.Despite several recent polls showing Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador with a commanding lead of at least 17 points, Mr. Anaya and his advisers insist that he still has a chance and cite internal polling showing him trailing by only seven percent.\u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced we\u2019re going to win the election,\u201d Mr. Anaya told a university gathering this month.But his confidence is not widely shared, and, indeed, many in the political world have already begun to refer to his candidacy in the past tense. His fast and ambitious bushwhacking to the cusp of the nation\u2019s highest office, they say, may have come at too high a price, alienating too many people, both inside and outside his party, who would have been crucial to his effort to secure the presidency.\u201cHe\u2019s the most interesting politician of the last eight years, the way he has risen to the top so unexpectedly,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Merino, a political analyst who supports Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador. \u201cIt was the fastest-growing political candidacy. It might be the fastest dying.\u201d Mr. Anaya\u2019s campaign declined requests to interview the candidate for this article.Short and slim, with a buzz cut and glasses, Mr. Anaya, who practices yoga and meditation, cuts a bookish, boyish figure.On the campaign trail, he has excelled in more refined settings \u2014 with business groups, for instance, or in academia \u2014 laying out his agenda in measured tones, his arguments smooth and precise, against the backdrop of an artful PowerPoint presentation, or nimbly engaging in question-and-answer sessions. In debates, he has demonstrated excellent preparation and a masterful command of the issues, running verbal circles around Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 though apparently to limited effect in the polls.Mr. Anaya, who is married and has three young children, is known for being remarkably punctilious and disciplined.\u201cHe isn\u2019t a guy you\u2019ll find in a restaurant having a drink \u2014 never, never,\u201d said Juan Ignacio Zavala, a newspaper columnist and brother of Margarita Zavala, who was a member of the PAN until, marginalized by Mr. Anaya, she quit last year to run for president as an independent. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of politician we haven\u2019t seen often in Mexico.\u201dWhile both Mr. Anaya and Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador have pitched themselves as candidates who can offer a departure from the corruption and violence that has dogged the deeply unpopular administration of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Mr. Anaya portrays himself as the safer, more moderate bet.He has also tried to project himself as technologically savvy and future-thinking; he speaks of transforming Mexico from a manufacturing economy to a \u201cknowledge economy,\u201d and he launched his campaign with a hackathon. He has sought to cast Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador as anachronistic.But Mr. Anaya\u2019s campaign has been burdened by corruption allegations, as well as by internal disorganization, analysts say, and a shifting, unfocused vision that underestimated both the electorate\u2019s anger at the political system and the popularity of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, commonly known by his initials, AMLO.The candidate has also had difficulty connecting with voters on a personal and emotional level, analysts said, an area where Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has excelled.Mr. Anaya has been called too nerdy, too lacking in a common touch. And while he has cast himself as a fresh new option for the nation, he is running under the banner of one of the nation\u2019s two dominant parties and has apparently not convinced enough people that he represents a significant break from the past.Born in Mexico State, just outside Mexico City, Mr. Anaya grew up in the central Mexican city of Quer\u00e9taro, among the city\u2019s elite.After his failed run for the delegate seat representing Pinal de Amoles, Mr. Anaya sprinted from political job to political job, first in the state and then in the federal government, including serving a term in the lower chamber of Congress.In 2015, he was elected as the PAN\u2019s national president, and a year later engineered the party\u2019s remarkable successes in regional elections, gaining seven of the nine governorships in play and walloping President Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s party, the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party.His momentum seemed unstoppable. By late 2017, he had brokered a coalition between the PAN and the center-left Democratic Revolution Party, or P.R.D., to jointly field a presidential candidate for the first time in history. (The left-right ticket also includes the smaller, left-leaning Citizens\u2019 Movement party.)He then handily vanquished the other contenders for his party\u2019s presidential nomination, including Ms. Zavala, whose rejection caused a schism in the PAN.\u201cHis philosophy since he came is: You\u2019re either with me or you\u2019re my enemy,\u201d said Senator Jorge Luis Lavalle, a party member who has been openly critical of Mr. Anaya. \u201cHe did terrible damage to the PAN.\u201dCarlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at Mexico City\u2019s Center for Economic Research and Teaching, said Mr. Anaya has been \u201ca beast\u201d in defeating his rivals.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s politics, it\u2019s rough and tumble,\u201d Mr. Bravo said. \u201cBut he played it particularly rough.\u201dNot even Mr. Anaya\u2019s closest allies deny this assessment. \u201cHe screwed everybody over in order to get there,\u201d said Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda, co-manager of Mr. Anaya\u2019s campaign. \u201cOn the other hand, a lot of people try to screw a lot of other people over and don\u2019t get there.\u201d\u201cIn Mexico, you\u2019re supposed to be ruthless without anybody noticing,\u201d Mr. Casta\u00f1eda continued. \u201cHe neutralized people in a spectacular way. There\u2019s obviously a cost to that.\u201dMr. Anaya and his supporters have accused President Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s party, the PRI, of manufacturing money-laundering allegations that have weighed down his bid, and using the offices of government to promote them.Things got even uglier in recent days. Mr. Anaya\u2019s enemies have circulated videos that purport to corroborate some of the allegations, which the candidate has emphatically denied. Mr. Anaya and his team, in turn, have accused Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador of making a pact with President Pe\u00f1a Nieto to shield the president from prosecution during the next administration, an allegation Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s campaign and the PRI deny.Mr. Anaya\u2019s campaign is now counting on undecided voters and those voters who are uncertain enough to switch allegiances at the last moment. But few outside Mr. Anaya\u2019s inner circle seem to believe a victory is even remotely possible.Analysts say that with or without the corruption allegations or the flaws in his campaign, Mr. Anaya has been too closely tied to one of the main political parties blamed for the nation\u2019s ills and has not convinced enough people that he represents a break from the past.\u201cIt may be just inevitable,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Weldon, director of the political science department at ITAM, a Mexico City university, before switching to the past tense as if the results of the July 1 vote were a foregone conclusion.\u201cPeople had already decided it was time for a change,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd the only candidate that sounded like change was AMLO.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So, for example, \u201csplendid\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d fit the bill. Those are the kinds of terms that are appropriate when the United States economy adds 223,000 jobs in a month, despite being nine years into an expansion, and when the unemployment rate falls to 3.8 percent, a new 18-year low. \u201cSalubrious,\u201d \u201csalutary\u201d and \u201chealthy\u201d work as words to describe the 0.3 percent rise in average hourly earnings, which are up 2.7 percent over the last year \u2014 a nice improvement but also not the kind of sharp increase that might lead the Federal Reserve to rethink its cautious path of interest rate increases.And a broader definition of unemployment, which includes people who have given up looking for a job out of frustration, fell to 7.6 percent. The jobless rate for African-Americans fell to 5.9 percent, the lowest on record, which we would count as \u201cgreat.\u201dIf anything, some of the thesaurus offerings don\u2019t really do these numbers justice. But some aspects of the report would be fairly described as \u201csolid,\u201d \u201cdecent\u201d or \u201cbenign,\u201d such as the uptick in the ratio of the adult population that is employed to 60.4 percent, which only matches its recent high of earlier in the year. Then there are other thesaurus synonyms for \u201cgood\u201d that we don\u2019t normally use in reference to employment numbers, but which are apropos this month. For example, \u201ccongruous,\u201d in the sense that the various pieces of the report align with each other: Employers are creating more jobs, leading more people to work and fewer people to be unemployed, and leading wages to rise. And the numbers are \u201cpropitious\u201d and \u201cagreeable\u201d in that they affirm that the United States economy is in basically sound shape, displaying neither the slightest warning signs of recession nor any clear evidence of overheating and inflation risks. I would also argue against viewing economic data through the kind of philosophical lens that might lead a person to view employment data as \u201cvirtuous\u201d or \u201crighteous.\u201d Macroeconomics is more like a really unpredictable machine than it is a morality play in which one set of policies is inherently more righteous than the other. (German economists, with their fierce opposition to deficits and fear of inflation, might disagree.)So in an era of geopolitical risks and potential trade wars, the thing to take away from the May numbers is that the United States economy just keeps humming along at a steady pace, putting more people to work and at gradually higher wages.It isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 wage growth remains unexceptional despite its growth spurt in May, and the ratio of prime-age adults working remains below its historical levels.But it has been a strikingly durable and steady expansion, which is what the nation needed after the scars of the 2008 recession. And that\u2019s just plain \u201cgood.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Despite months of talks, the two countries remain at an impasse.All the scrutiny may be making China\u2019s leaders nervous.Even before the latest orders, however, the media coverage in China of the recent economic tensions with the United States has been largely free of nationalistic or inflammatory language. Absent official guidance against covering certain issues, Chinese media organizations often self-censor, wary of drawing the ire of authorities.But China\u2019s leaders might not want the domestic media to whip up excessive public outrage, lest it constrain their ability to negotiate with Washington.\u201cThese days, restrictions on information by the Chinese Communist Party are predominantly strategic and contextual, and not ideological or necessarily about judgments of the intrinsic sensitivity of a story or topic,\u201d said David Bandurski, who is a co-director of the China Media Project, a research program in Hong Kong, and a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin.\u201cThat means just about any story, fact or image can instantly become sensitive given the right extrinsic factors, like too much online attention and speculation,\u201d Mr. Bandurski said.Western companies have long protested Chinese policies that privilege local firms over foreign ones. Made in China 2025 has drawn particular attention, though.At the time, the Chinese government seemed eager to play down certain controversial aspects of the plan, such as targets for domestic firms\u2019 share of the Chinese market in specific industries.Lance Noble, a senior analyst in Beijing at the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, said that in 2016, when foreign business groups raised concerns about a technical road map for carrying out the plan, Chinese officials responded by saying that it was \u201cjust a think tank exercise,\u201d with no formal standing in policy.Beijing has used state media to try to hit back at criticism of the campaign, too.Raymond Zhong reported from Shanghai, and Li Yuan from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

But the patterns of migration from the poor South of people seeking a better life in the rich North are likely to change.While instability in Central America continues to drive people north, the vast traffic of low-skilled immigrants into the United States across the southern border has slowed. The demographic bulge of Mexican men in their teens and early 20s who flocked illegally to the United States from the 1990s until the Great Recession has petered out, in part a consequence of declining Mexican fertility since the 1970s. Today, Mexicans are older, on average. Fewer are willing to take the risk. And Mexico\u2019s economy is in better shape than in the 1980s and 1990s, when repeated crises drove many Mexicans from their homes.30%AustraliaSwitzerland25IsraelNewZealand20CanadaIrelandForeign-bornshare ofpopulationEstoniaAustriaBelgiumSpainSwedenLatviaUnitedStatesGermanyFranceBritainNorwayNetherlandsSlovenia10ItalyDenmarkRussiaPortugalGreeceCzechRepublicLithuania5HungaryFinlandChileJapanKoreaMexicoPoland0$10,00020,00030,00040,000G.D.P. per person30%AustraliaSwitzerland25IsraelNewZealand20CanadaForeign-bornshare ofpopulationIrelandEstoniaAustriaBelgium15SpainSwedenLatviaUnitedStatesGermanyFranceBritainNorwayNetherlandsSlovenia10ItalyDenmarkRussiaPortugalGreeceCzechRepublicLithuania5HungaryFinlandChileJapanKoreaBulgariaMexicoSlovakRepublicRomaniaPoland0$5,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,00045,000G.D.P. per person30%AustraliaSwitzerland25IsraelNewZealand20CanadaForeign-bornshare ofpopulationIrelandEstoniaAustriaBelgium15SpainSwedenLatviaUnitedStatesGermanyFranceBritainNorwayNetherlandsSlovenia10ItalyDenmarkRussiaPortugalGreeceCzechRepublicLithuania5HungaryFinlandChileJapanKoreaBulgariaMexicoSlovakRepublicRomaniaPoland0$5,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,00045,000G.D.P. per person30%AustraliaSwitzerland25IsraelNewZealandCanada20IrelandEstoniaAustriaBelgium15SpainSwedenLatviaUnitedStatesForeign-bornshare ofpopulationGermanyFranceBritainNorwayNetherlandsSlovenia10ItalyDenmarkRussiaPortugalGreeceCzechRepublicLithuania5HungaryFinlandChileJapanKoreaBulgariaMexicoSlovakRepublicRomaniaPoland0$5,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,00045,000G.D.P. per personAlthough immigration into the United States might have passed its high-water mark, other parts of the rich world \u2014 Europe, notably \u2014 are likely to experience more immigration than they have before.Demand for immigrant labor will probably rise in Europe as its population ages. The number of working-age people is already shrinking in many countries.

Across the countries in their study, people exposed to positive images of immigrants -- say, about their strong commitment to work -- become much less negative in general about immigration.Natives\u2019 views can also be manipulated in a negative direction, though, something currently reflected in the politics of many countries. Professor Stantcheva argues that negative portrayals of immigrants in the media could help explain the biased and erroneous views about immigrants\u2019 behavior. And as Professor Alesina notes, \u201cAnti-immigration parties foster these misperceptions in a variety of ways strategically to gain support for their anti-immigration stands.\u201dBut there are already plenty of walls, and they have done little to stop immigration. If rich countries want fewer immigrants, their best shot might be to help poor countries become rich, so that fewer people feel the urge to leave. That would include helping them adapt to climate change, and simply opening up their own markets to developing countries\u2019 exports. \u201cIf you want to have fewer immigrants, you would want poorer countries to take advantage of trade,\u201d Professor Alesina said. \u201cThe idea that because there is too much immigration you should restrict trade makes no sense.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, as Mr. Clemens argues, rich countries should probably start writing new rules and creating new institutions to manage the large immigration flows of the future. They could work to promote new destinations and develop mutually beneficial forms of migration (say, varieties of temporary work visas). They could establish mechanisms to assist vulnerable native-born people, whose jobs might be at stake.If properly handled, Mr. Clemens says, immigration is an opportunity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Jersey Legalizes Sports Betting", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a law designed to restore some of the glitz and glamour to Atlantic City\u2019s casinos, the governor\u2019s bill signing was the opposite: a signature behind closed doors and a statement emailed to the news media.\u201cToday, we\u2019re finally making the dream of legalized sports betting a reality for New Jersey,\u201d Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said in the statement. \u201cIt means that our casinos in Atlantic City and our racetracks throughout our state can attract new business and new fans, boosting their own long-term financial prospects. This is the right move for New Jersey and it will strengthen our economy.\u201dThe last remaining hurdle standing between would-be bettors and, say, a 6-to-1 wager on Spain to win the World Cup, is the licensing process that is being expedited to get betting operations up and running as soon as possible.Dennis A. Drazin, the operator of Monmouth Park who helped lead the charge to make sports betting legal in the Garden State, heralded the governor\u2019s action as \u201ca great day for New Jersey.\u201d\u201cI look forward to the governor joining us at Monmouth Park Racetrack on Thursday morning to usher in a new era for New Jersey by placing the first bet,\u201d Mr. Drazin said.The Meadowlands Racetrack, which announced last week that it would be partnering with Betfair US for retail and online sports betting, is still weeks away from being able to offer sports betting because it needs to build venues and train employees. The state\u2019s other racetrack in Freehold is also not ready to open for sports betting.The casinos are governed by the state\u2019s Division of Gaming Enforcement, which follows a process similar to the racing commission: It posts regulations, accepts applications and then distributes licenses.The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa is the only casino that is prepared to immediately begin taking bets, transforming some betting windows at its horse-racing facility into a temporary sports-gambling site until a permanent venue is completed. Casino officials, however, would not specify when the Borgata would begin taking bets.\u201cWe are moving ahead with all possible speed to begin accepting legal sports bets as soon as required regulatory approvals are in place,\u201d said a statement from MGM Resorts International, which owns the Borgata.Atlantic City\u2019s six other casinos continue to prepare for sports betting. Some need to build space; others need a sports-book partner to help set up a gambling operation.Those hoping to place bets online or through a mobile device will still have to wait to gamble: The legislation includes a clause stating that online sports betting cannot start within 30 days of the bill signing.Mr. Drazin had been hoping to start taking bets last Friday, in time for Game 4 of the National Basketball Association finals and the Subway Series between the Yankees and Mets.A last-minute effort that amended the legislation by removing language that threatened punitive action against any operator that accepted wagers before the bill was signed into law was not enough to clear the way for gambling without Mr. Murphy\u2019s signature. The governor held off signing the bill until Monday afternoon, saying that his office needed time to review the legislation for potential legal issues.Mr. Murphy, a die-hard soccer fan who used to sit on the board of the U.S. Soccer Foundation and owns a majority stake in Sky Blue FC, a professional women\u2019s soccer team, is scheduled to be the keynote speaker on Thursday at the East Coast Gaming Congress in Atlantic City.Mr. Murphy\u2019s office would not divulge which team the governor might bet on Thursday at Monmouth Park, or even which sport. He could bet the lone New Jersey team \u2014 the Devils \u2014 to win the Stanley Cup in 2019 at odds that are about 80 to 1, or wager on the Jets or Giants, who play in New Jersey, as underdogs to win the Super Bowl. But if he bets the World Cup, which the United States failed to qualify for, Germany, where Mr. Murphy served as ambassador under President Barack Obama, is a 4-to-1 favorite.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Anti-Immigration Passion Was Inflamed From the Fringe", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller spent years on the political fringe in the nation\u2019s capital as high-decibel immigration hard-liners, always warning about the dangers of open borders but rarely in a position to affect law or policy.It was Mr. Sessions who ordered prosecutors to take a new \u201czero tolerance\u201d attitude toward families crossing into the United States, part of his plans to reshape the country\u2019s law enforcement priorities to limit immigration. It is Mr. Miller who has championed the idea inside the White House, selling Mr. Trump on the benefits of a policy that his adversaries have called \u201cevil,\u201d \u201cinhumane\u201d and equivalent to child abuse or the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.\u201cThe U.S. government has a sacred, solemn, inviolable obligation to enforce the laws of the United States to stop illegal immigration and to secure and protect the borders,\u201d Mr. Miller said in a recent interview. Asked if the images of children being taken from their parents would eventually make the president back down, Mr. Miller was adamant.\u201cThere is no straying from that mission,\u201d he said.On Monday, as an audio recording became public of children crying for their parents after being separated at the border, Mr. Sessions vigorously defended his zero-tolerance policy. \u201cWe cannot and will not encourage people to bring children by giving them blanket immunity from our laws,\u201d Mr. Sessions declared in a speech to law enforcement officers.Mr. Sessions, 71, had strong views shaped by his experience as a young politician in rural Alabama, where he saw immigrants take jobs at a poultry plant away from poor, unskilled Americans.During more than a decade as a federal prosecutor and state attorney general, and 20 years in the Senate, Mr. Sessions came to believe that immigrants, whether here legally or illegally, posed a direct threat to the country by depressing wages, committing crimes and competing for welfare benefits. He was deeply influenced by the work of George Borjas, a Harvard economist who has said that immigrants have an adverse impact on the economy.Mr. Miller, 32, had gone from California to Duke University. While a student, he met David Horowitz, a right-wing provocateur and the founder of Students for Academic Freedom, which opposed progressive thought on college campuses. After Mr. Miller graduated, Mr. Horowitz helped him get a job with Michele Bachmann, then a Republican congresswoman from Minnesota, and recommended him highly to Mr. Sessions.Together Mr. Miller and Mr. Sessions often drew on the work of anti-immigration groups like the Federation for American Immigration Reform, NumbersUSA and the Center for Immigration Studies \u2014 some of which are derided as hate groups by immigration activists and civil rights organizations.The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white nationalists and other hate groups, describes FAIR as having \u201ca veneer of legitimacy\u201d that \u201chides much ugliness.\u201dBy 2013, Stephen K. Bannon, then the head of Breitbart News, invited Mr. Miller and Mr. Sessions to a dinner at the Capitol Hill townhouse that served as the headquarters for the conservative news outlet. The three bonded over an article titled \u201cThe Case of the Missing White Voters,\u201d foreshadowing the case they would help Mr. Trump build during his presidential campaign.Later that year, Mr. Sessions and Mr. Miller worked tirelessly to defeat a bipartisan immigration bill. The senator spent hours on the floor arguing with his colleagues while Mr. Miller churned out a nonstop flurry of news releases. He cast the fight against immigration in dramatic terms, with the future of the nation at stake.The bill passed the Senate, but Mr. Sessions worked with conservatives in the House to ultimately defeat it.In 2014, Mr. Miller presented Mr. Sessions with an award at the Breakers resort in Palm Beach, Fla., as part of the ceremony held by the David Horowitz Freedom Center. Mr. Bannon was there as well.But it was Mr. Trump who pulled Mr. Miller and Mr. Sessions \u2014 and their views about immigration \u2014 out of the political shadows. In January 2015, when few were watching, Mr. Sessions wrote a 23-page memo that predicted that the next president would most likely be a Republican who spoke to the working class about how immigrants had stolen their jobs.Most mainstream politicians ignored the memo, but its contents influenced Mr. Trump. At a raucous 2015 rally in Mobile, Ala., he sensed the power of the immigration issue as a crowd of 30,000 supporters roared with approval at his promise to build a wall across the southern border and crack down on illegal immigration.Both men have something else in common: They are largely unfazed by criticism or bad press.Mr. Sessions is known for proudly holding opinions thought to be retrograde. Under his high school yearbook photo was the caption: \u201cHe is a host of debaters in himself.\u201d While serving as Alabama\u2019s attorney general, he supported reviving chain gangs of volunteer inmates and tighter identification requirements for Alabama voters.Mr. Miller is similarly immune to critiques from establishment Republicans, who often view his immigration positions as far out of the mainstream and politically dangerous. In the recent interview, Mr. Miller dismissed as ignorant the hand-wringing of Republicans about the family separation controversy.\u201cYou have one party that\u2019s in favor of open borders, and you have one party that wants to secure the border,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cAnd all day long the American people are going to side with the party that wants to secure the border. And not by a little bit. Not 55-45. 60-40. 70-30. 80-20. I\u2019m talking 90-10 on that.\u201dOn Monday, as Mr. Trump vowed that \u201cthe United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,\u201d he continued to falsely blame congressional Democrats for a policy driven by Mr. Miller and Mr. Sessions. He once again called for legislation that would crack down on immigrants and decrease the need to separate families at the border, even though there is no law that requires families to be separated.Echoing the president, Mr. Sessions urged lawmakers to pass legislation to build a wall along the southern border and impose new restrictions on immigration that he said would end legal \u201cloopholes\u201d that let illegal immigrants in.\u201cIf we build the wall, if we pass legislation to end the lawlessness,\u201d Mr. Sessions said, \u201cwe won\u2019t face these terrible choices.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly named an organization that tracks white nationalists and other hate groups. It is the Southern Poverty Law Center, not the Southern Policy Law Center.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Balkans, a Chance to Stabilize Europe", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe authors are leading officers of the Open Society Foundations, which work to advance justice, democratic practice and human rights around the world.It has taken almost 25 years to get an agreement between the governments in Athens and Skopje on what to call the entity once known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It would be a mistake to dismiss this as a minor development \u2014 particularly now, when the unity of the trans-Atlantic alliance is at its lowest point since World War II and the unity of the European Union is under challenge in every national election.In fact, the historic compromise to rename the country the Republic of Northern Macedonia, thus softening a rivalry over national histories, opens a window of opportunity for leaders in Europe and the United States to defy current trends and begin shaping a secure future for the Balkans, an achievement that would help secure stability for all of Europe.The hard-won agreement on Macedonia could still be undermined. The region is known for its tragic history. It\u2019s where World War I began, and it is the site of the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II.Since the violent disintegration of Yugoslavia, however, the region\u2019s prospects have brightened as states have moved toward European Union and NATO membership. Slovenia and Croatia are already in the European Union; Montenegro and Serbia are candidates; Albania can follow, as can Northern Macedonia, now that the naming dispute has been resolved.However, the United States and Europe are not the only players in the region. Russia has made it clear that it will interfere if its interests are threatened, especially when it comes to potential NATO membership. It has already done so, in a failed putsch in Montenegro in 2016. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is making his presence felt in every state, and China is now one of the largest investors in the region, with ambitious plans to make the Balkans the main entry point into Europe of its One Belt, One Road initiative.A resolute response is needed to counter these trends, but it will not prove easy. The European Union is suffering from accession fatigue. Some of its thorniest problems come from countries that have joined since 2004 \u2014 the longstanding border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia; Turkey\u2019s presence in Cyprus; and, perhaps most significantly, the antidemocratic actions of Poland and Hungary. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, said last month that there can be no further European accession until Europe reforms itself.The vast majority of the Balkan region\u2019s population wants close links with the West, particularly European Union membership. That is true even in relatively pro-Russia Belgrade. Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vucic, was in Slobodan Milosevic\u2019s government during the NATO bombings in 1999, yet he has pinned his entire legacy on his ambitions for Serbia\u2019s integration into Europe. He and Albania\u2019s prime minister, Edi Rama, have forged a strong relationship that has helped stabilize the region.A bold regional initiative to create a Balkan economic union modeled on the laws of the European Union could take advantage of the people\u2019s pro-Western ambitions. This has already been endorsed by the region\u2019s leaders, particularly Mr. Vucic. Even an informal union would deliver tangible benefits to the estimated 18 million inhabitants of the region as well as Europe and the United States, and would ease the member states\u2019 integration into the European Union.The union is not an imposition; it is a choice. Last July, the countries of the western Balkans pledged to intensify cooperation. Now they must follow through and create a common market. That would allow the region to modernize financial markets and improve their governments\u2019 finances without policy solutions being dictated from Brussels or Washington. The free flow of people, goods and capital would make the entire region more attractive for investment and strengthen transport and infrastructure. This would create more jobs and help stem the rampant flight of young people to Western Europe.Improving each country\u2019s economy and governance is the best way to build deep and broad political support to join the European Union. It would also give the European Union an option not to admit each state one by one, but to admit them as a unit that might be more aligned with European laws and standards than some existing members are. This union would help avoid reigniting regional rivalries. States could also work together to resolve the most significant political barriers to European Union admission of any single country, including territorial disputes, corruption and organized crime. Bosnia and Herzegovina, which remains mired in the complicated legacy of the Dayton agreement and Kosovo, has the furthest to go.Still, the resolution of Macedonia\u2019s dispute with Greece presents a historic opportunity. Both Europe (Britain included) and the United States need to become enthusiastic supporters of this economic union in the Balkans. Such a union would not be a reincarnation of the former Yugoslavia. It would be a loose association of states united by free trade and the movement of people and goods, along the lines of the European Union in its early days. Increased prosperity and cohesion among these states would make them less susceptible to influence \u2014 economic, diplomatic or military \u2014 from Beijing, Ankara or Moscow.The consequences of inaction would be dire. If the Western powers fail to keep the Balkan countries on track toward local cooperation and eventual European Union membership, these states will be pushed, and possibly divided, into the spheres of influence of Russia, Turkey and China, effectively Balkanizing the Balkans once again.George Soros is the founder and chairman of the Open Society Foundations.

{"Headline": "Trudeau\u2019s Challenge: Managing Trump and Domestic Politics", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 The security fences are coming down. And the world leaders have jetted off.But for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, the troubles have just begun.After the disastrous finale of the Group of 7 summit meeting, Mr. Trudeau is now caught in a tight spot between the unpredictable President Trump and the powerful Canadian dairy industry, the current target of Mr. Trump\u2019s escalating trade threats. The prime minister\u2019s challenge is how to manage both the most important Canadian ally and his own domestic politics.\u201cTrudeau is in a very difficult place because the G-7 summit signals the approach the Trudeau government took to deal with the Trump administration has failed,\u201d said Wesley Wark, a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Ottawa. \u201cThe charm offensive has produced little of what the prime minister hoped.\u201dEven before Mr. Trump came to power, Mr. Trudeau, and his closest aides and cabinet members rushed to connect with the new president and his advisers. And despite Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity in Canada, Mr. Trudeau scrupulously avoided criticizing the president.Now Mr. Trump is challenging Canada\u2019s longtime dairy system, which uses high tariffs to largely exclude imports. He is also angry about exports from the Canadian automotive industry, the backbone of the country\u2019s manufacturing.The prospect of a full-on trade war is an alarming proposition; trade with the United States is the economic lifeblood of Canada. But Canadian political, and economic, realities also dictate that Mr. Trudeau cannot give in to the president\u2019s trade demands.Oddly, though, Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks \u2014 and especially his extraordinarily personal vitriol about Mr. Trudeau over Twitter as he departed the Group of 7 talks \u2014 may have revitalized the prime minister\u2019s political career even as his popularity in polls was falling and questions about his leadership growing.It also condemned the attacks on Mr. Trudeau and voiced Parliament\u2019s support for the country\u2019s dairy system.\u201cIn the short term he\u2019s getting huge support from everybody,\u201d said Jack Granatstein, a prominent Canadian historian who has long written about relations between the United States and Canada.\u201cBut if Nafta sinks or there\u2019s a serious trade war, he will carry the can,\u201d Mr. Granatstein continued. \u201cWe cannot win a trade war with 75 percent of our trade going to the U.S. We\u2019re highly vulnerable to American actions. He has to deal with the survival of the Canadian economy.\u201dIn recent days, Mr. Trump has focused mainly on Canada\u2019s dairy system, known as \u201csupply management,\u201d which is a longstanding irritant between Canada and several other countries, including the United States.Under supply management, which came into existence during the 1970s, the amount of milk that dairy farmers in Canada can produce is set through a tightly controlled quota system. That keeps prices high and stable. Tariffs of up to 300 percent largely shut out competition from imported milk, cheese, butter and other dairy products.Still, the United States sells about five times more dairy products to Canada than Canada exports south.Nonetheless, the supply management system riles up Mr. Trump, who says the Canadian market should be fully opened to American dairy farmers. At the moment, those American farmers are producing too much milk and facing lower prices.\u201cThe U.S. position on supply management hasn\u2019t changed since President Obama,\u201d said Meredith Lilly, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University in Ottawa and the former international trade adviser to former Prime Minister Stephen Harper. \u201cThis president is certainly talking about it more openly and aggressively.\u201dWhile dairy farming is a relatively small part of Canada\u2019s economy, its farmers are a powerful political force in parts of Ontario and Quebec.Farmers own their valuable milk quota assignments and trade them like taxi medallions in the age before Uber. Many often rely on those sales as their pensions and vigorously protest any perceived threat to the system.Exactly how much Canadians generally know about the system and support it is an open question.Many economists, including Sylvanus Kwaku Afesorgbor, an assistant professor of agricultural economics at the University of Guelph in Ontario, say that while it allows Canadian farmers to prosper, it unfairly inflates the grocery bills of all Canadians.\u201cThey are trying to protect a few thousand farmers at the expense of millions of Canadians,\u201d he said.There have been signs that Canada might consider some changes to supply management. Professor Wark, however, and many others, said that by bringing this issue into his trade battle, Mr. Trump had ensured that Canada would not back down when it came to the system, which also covers poultry and eggs.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s options now are not certain.Professor Lilly, the former adviser to Mr. Harper, said she did not believe that Mr. Trudeau\u2019s efforts to influence the president\u2019s inner circle had been in vain and that they might yet produce some kind of settlement.But Professor Granatstein, who is retired from York University in Toronto, said he did not think that Mr. Trudeau had a winning hand to play.\u201cYou either resist and ruin the economy or you give in and get creamed in the next election for selling out,\u201d he said, adding that one thing now seems clear. \u201cI thought that anti-Americanism was over in Canada. Clearly I was wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grim Trends in Good Times", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistIn the United States in the years after the Great Recession, pessimists had a lot of material to work with. Economic doomsayers looked at the stubbornly elevated unemployment rate and discerned a depressing new normal, in which technological and social change had rendered many Americans simply unemployable, and stagnation and sclerosis loomed ahead. Social pessimists looked at the disarray in working-class culture, the retreat from marriage and child rearing and civic and religious life, the spread of loneliness and depression and addiction, and saw a society where ordinary forms of flourishing were slipping out of reach.Five years ago it was easy to tell a story where these two problems were straightforwardly conjoined, with economic disappointment driving social dysfunction and vice versa.Since this column sometimes inclines to grim readings of our situation, it\u2019s important to stress how genuinely good recent economic trends have been. Yes, structural problems are still present \u2014 wage growth should be faster, work-force participation should be higher. But a lot of commentary circa 2012 seemed to assume that unemployment might never get down below 4 percent, either because Obamacare was killing jobs and a debt crisis was looming, or because Republican obstruction was sabotaging the economy, or because technological change was automating too many jobs and dooming the less-skilled to the dole.And yet: The hope that material growth would heal our social problems hasn\u2019t been vindicated so far. And as long as that\u2019s the case, the improved economy shouldn\u2019t be treated just as an end unto itself, but as an opportunity to look for social cures as well.Of course, the wall-to-wall frenzy of the Trump era, in which everyone is constantly being asked to take sides in a battle to the death, makes these kinds of cultural efforts harder to formulate and pursue. But they\u2019re what our moment, with its partially regained prosperity and ongoing cultural crisis, may be asking of us \u2014 because this welcome growth won\u2019t last forever, and social problems unsolved now will be that much worse when it is gone.Advertisement"}

Its members voted with the majority in closely divided cases 23 percent of the time. The five more conservative justices voted with the majority 83 percent of the time.That 5-to-4 decision was one of many that would almost certainly have been decided the opposite way had President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court pick, Judge Merrick B. Garland, joined the court instead of being blocked by Senate Republicans.\u201cIn several momentous decisions, it seems quite plausible that a Justice Garland would have altered the court\u2019s outcome,\u201d Professor Driver said. \u201cIt is crucial to appreciate that this dynamic extends well beyond the court\u2019s 5-to-4 decisions.\u201dA Justice Garland, Professor Driver said, might have joined the court\u2019s liberals to decide that central question \u2013 in favor of gay rights.Similarly, while the court unanimously turned away challenges to partisan gerrymandering on technical grounds, the four liberal justices indicated that they were ready to address the issue of whether the Constitution forbids voting districts warped by politics. A Justice Garland might have supplied a fifth vote to condemn a practice that critics say undermines democracy.In Justice Gorsuch\u2019s early months on the court last term, he seemed ready to ally himself with its most conservative members, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.Now that he has completed a full term, though, a different picture has emerged.

{"Headline": "Luxury Sales Are Rebounding in China. Just Not in Stores.", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 After several years of slumber, China\u2019s luxury market is finally returning to growth. You would not know that, though, from peering into its \u2014 mostly empty \u2014 high-end stores.Western luxury brands have banked for years on rapid growth in China to drive global profits. The country\u2019s breakneck economic expansion created legions of wealthy consumers keen to flaunt their newfound status. Many traveled overseas, buying high-end handbags and exotic watches in London, Milan, Paris and elsewhere.But when luxury retailers invested heavily to bolster their marketing and expand their store networks within China, the bet never quite paid off. A slowdown in the Chinese economy, as well as an anti-corruption campaign led by the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, left customers less willing to splash large amounts of money.That is now changing. Sales of luxury goods in mainland China are forecast to grow by between 20 and 22 percent this year, according to a report by the consulting firm Bain & Company. The authors of the study, one of the most closely watched overviews of the global high-end retail market, predicted that such expansion would drive up growth across the global luxury market by as much as 8 percent.On the streets of Beijing, Shanghai and other Chinese cities, however, luxury shoppers are hard to find. And that is because the country is increasingly leading a shift in how such shopping is carried out.Take the Taikoo Li shopping center, regularly touted as proof of the rising power of the Chinese consumer.Its 19 buildings, in one of Beijing\u2019s busiest retail areas, house some of the world\u2019s biggest brands \u2014 Versace, Balenciaga and a two-story Apple store that was once pelted with eggs by customers angry over a botched iPhone launch.The sight of would-be buyers in any of those luxury shops, however, is extremely rare. Salespeople have little to do except mill around and stare through the front windows.Instead, customers in China buy their luxury goods from elsewhere \u2014 and increasingly online. Whereas groups like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering have traditionally invested heavily in a flawless in-store experience, catering to consumers who want to be pampered and doted upon, Chinese shoppers are typically younger and heavily influenced by social media.More and more, they like to spend their money in a digital shopping culture that is distinct from that of Europe and North America, and they are well versed in price differences across the world.\u201cBuyers of luxury in China are young, increasingly fashion-savvy and well aware of the price-value equation,\u201d said the lead author of the study, Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a Bain partner. According to Ms. D\u2019Arpizio, the strong performance of the mainland China market suggests that luxury brands\u2019 new strategies are bearing fruit.\u201cThe Chinese are accelerating the shift of the luxury industry to a more millennial state of mind,\u201d she added, \u201cand are responsible for much of the sales growth we have seen so far this year.\u201dGrowth in the luxury market in China has also been helped by the government in Beijing.When authorities enacted capital controls in late 2016, making it harder to move money overseas, many Chinese looked for ways of spending at home.The government has also cracked down on the \u201cdaigou\u201d industry, in which shopping agents help consumers buy goods overseas for a fee, while import tariffs on almost 200 consumer goods categories were cut in December, lowering prices for everything from cashmere to cosmetics.\u201cAfter a period where many mainland Chinese shoppers traveled to Europe to make their purchases in the search of better deals, the tide has turned, and more and more now choose to buy online or in foreign locations closer to home like Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Arpizio said.Aside from China, bright spots cited in the Bain report for this year included the United States, where a weaker dollar should lift sales to tourists, and Asian markets excluding China, where sales figures are expected to grow by between 9 to 11 percent.The only major region expected to struggle is Europe, where a stronger euro is expected to weigh heavily on luxury sales, particularly to tourists.As in China, though, the key for luxury brands will be targeting younger, tech-savvy shoppers, according to Bain.\u201cCustomers are responding to targeted strategies,\u201d said Federica Levato, a Bain partner and the report\u2019s co-author. \u201cThe best performing brands are already winning over the customers of tomorrow.\u201dElizabeth Paton reported from London, and Sui-Lee Wee from Beijing.Advertisement"}

After a court ruling found that Mr. Rajoy\u2019s party had benefited from a slush fund, Mr. S\u00e1nchez orchestrated a parliamentary revolt, winning the backing of a majority of lawmakers to oust Mr. Rajoy through a vote of no confidence.Spain now faces an uncertain situation, with a fragile Socialist government formed by an establishment party whose leader was believed to have missed his best chance to govern the country.The challenge for Mr. S\u00e1nchez will be how to keep together an unwieldy alliance with the far-left Podemos and nationalist parties from Catalonia and the Basque region, which helped him replace Mr. Rajoy. Mr. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist party holds only one-quarter of the seats in Parliament.Still, Mr. S\u00e1nchez has defied the odds before. An economist by training, he was a relative unknown when he was first elected leader of his party, in 2014. His credentials at that point were limited \u2014 he had entered Parliament not by winning votes in an election, but as an internal party substitute for a lawmaker who was leaving his seat early.But the Socialists apparently hoped that a younger, more photogenic leader would allow them to turn the page on the fiasco of 2011, when Mr. Rajoy won a landslide election victory after voters punished the Socialists for Spain\u2019s financial crisis and record unemployment.By the time Spain held its next election, in 2015, however, Mr. S\u00e1nchez was no longer the new kid on the block. Two other parties had emerged \u2014 Podemos and Ciudadanos \u2014 to break up Spain\u2019s bipartisan politics and take on the established parties with more youthful leaders even than Mr. S\u00e1nchez.Mr. S\u00e1nchez led the Socialists to their worst-ever election result, and then lost even worse six months later, when a political deadlock forced Spain to hold another inconclusive vote. After these electoral setbacks, he came under heavy personal criticism, accused of prolonging the deadlock by putting his own ambitions ahead of those of the Socialists and of Spain as a whole.Eventually, Mr. S\u00e1nchez was forced out by his own party. His opponents called on a new Socialist leadership to allow his archrival, Mr. Rajoy, to continue in office. A defiant Mr. S\u00e1nchez not only left the leadership, but he also resigned his seat in Parliament so that he would not have to follow his fellow Socialists in endorsing Mr. Rajoy\u2019s re-election.Rejected in Madrid, Mr. S\u00e1nchez set off on a road trip, driving around Spanish towns in a bid to rebuild support among the party\u2019s grass-roots supporters. To the dismay of the Socialist politicians who had orchestrated his ouster, Mr. S\u00e1nchez returned after only seven months to win re-election to the party\u2019s leadership, defeating their favorite, Susana D\u00edaz, the regional president of Andalusia, the country\u2019s largest region and a Socialist stronghold.Over the past week, Mr. S\u00e1nchez has come across as a leader who has matured after returning from the political wilderness. He debated forcefully in Parliament while striking complicated alliances with other parties, outflanking Ciudadanos, the party that wanted a snap election.The next step for Mr. S\u00e1nchez is to deliver on his latest pledges, including to \u201crebuild bridges\u201d with the separatist parties that govern Catalonia and that helped him oust Mr. Rajoy.Mr. S\u00e1nchez faces a difficult task in Catalonia; Spain\u2019s judiciary is prosecuting former leaders of the separatists for rebellion. Last month, before he got his opportunity to become Spain\u2019s leader, Mr. S\u00e1nchez called Mr. Torra \u201ca racist\u201d in reference to past insults from Mr. Torra toward Spaniards and their values. Last October, the Socialists also backed Mr. Rajoy when he imposed rule from Madrid on Catalonia to stop unilateral secession.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be complicated for S\u00e1nchez, but the fact that both sides are ready to dialogue is in itself a step forward,\u201d said Jordi Hereu, a former Socialist mayor of Barcelona. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for these new leaders to show that they understand that this conflict has been going nowhere but has had a high cost, not least for the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Kim Meets Trump, China Gets Jittery About North Korea\u2019s Intentions", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey say the Chinese leaders, who are unused to being on the outside looking in, are growing anxious about whether they can keep their Cold War-era ally firmly in its current orbit around China. Leaders in Beijing are worried, experts say, that Mr. Kim might try to counterbalance China\u2019s influence by embracing the United States, North Korea\u2019s longtime enemy.\u201cIf you look at history, North Korea is not sure of China, and has a kind of revenge mentality,\u201d said Shen Zhihua, a prominent Chinese historian on North Korea. \u201cThe worst outcome is that the United States, South Korea and North Korea all get together and China gets knocked out.\u201dAnalysts said China worried that the United States could also use the Singapore meeting to engineer a united Korean Peninsula that joins the North with South Korea, one of Washington\u2019s closest allies. For China, that raises the uncomfortable specter of American troops on China\u2019s doorstep, erasing North Korea\u2019s traditional role as a buffer.There is even the remote possibility that North Korea could flip allegiances, just as China did in 1972. When President Richard Nixon visited Beijing that year, Mao Zedong further distanced China from the Soviet Union in favor of friendship with the United States.Some analysts ask whether the United States could now flip North Korea to its side and away from China.\u201cChina can see some shocking resemblance to Nixon coming to China with Trump and North Korea,\u201d said Yun Sun, a China analyst at the Washington-based Stimson Center. \u201cIf China could do it, why not North Korea?\u201dThat would leave the entire peninsula open to China\u2019s influence, while eroding the confidence of American allies in Asia regarding Washington\u2019s commitment to the region.Either way, a strategic realignment in Northeast Asia appears underway, with North Korea apparently intent on preserving its independence from China, and China not wanting to lose its leverage over the North and its young leader.There have already been signs that Mr. Kim is bridling under China\u2019s influence.During his first six years of rule, Mr. Kim kept China at arm\u2019s length, not even meeting with China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping. He finally met Mr. Xi in Beijing in March and then again in the Chinese port city of Dalian in May as part of the gamesmanship before his landmark meeting with Mr. Trump.What went on in those two meetings in China remains shrouded in secrecy. Chinese experts speculate that Mr. Xi promised hefty financial help or security guarantees.Some Chinese analysts also note a long-simmering resentment in North Korea about being considered the little brother of its much bigger neighbor. They said this touchiness was apparent in the lack of monuments in North Korea honoring the estimated 400,000 Chinese soldiers who died helping protect the North during the 1950-53 Korean War.Still, the odds of North Korea shifting its allegiance toward the United States are not great, Western experts say. That is particularly true in the era of President Trump, who is seen as an uncertain partner even for Washington\u2019s existing Asian allies.\u201cNorth Korea has no reason to believe that the U.S. would be willing or able to defend it from China,\u201d said Hugh White, an Australian defense strategist. \u201cWho in Pyongyang would believe that America could fight and win a land war against China on China\u2019s borders?\u201d\u201cLike any middle power, Kim is aiming to be independent of any great power \u2014 both China and America \u2014 and he is already a fair way towards that goal,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the nukes are for. What Kim wants is to keep as much of his independence as possible and hence as much of his nuclear capability as possible.\u201dFor Mr. Kim, an embrace of the United States would also have its limits.Although Mr. Trump has chosen largely to ignore the human rights abuses in North Korea, there is still enormous hostility in Washington toward what remains a Communist dictatorship. Some members of Congress and of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, including his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, have advocated regime change in the North.Already, trade across China\u2019s border with North Korea is stepping up. Last week, the state airline, Air China, renewed flights to Pyongyang after a six-month hiatus.China, which reluctantly enforced United Nations sanctions at the urging of Mr. Trump, is now anxious to mend ties with the North by helping with its economy, said Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea expert at Renmin University of China.\u201cThe United States and China are moving away from the uneasy cooperation on North Korea of last year,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cChina doesn\u2019t trust Trump, and the U.S. doesn\u2019t trust China.\u201dStill, Beijing\u2019s past efforts to help build the North\u2019s economy have often ended in misery for Chinese companies, making them leery of new investments.Chinese investors in coal mines and other natural resource ventures have complained of being duped by the North Koreans, and then having no legal protection. A major bridge built by the Chinese over the Yalu River between the border town of Dandong and North Korea after Premier Wen Jiabao visited Pyongyang in 2009 remains unfinished. The North has refused to connect the road on its side of the river.No senior Chinese officials are expected to be in Singapore during the Trump-Kim summit meeting. China will have to wait to hear what happened from the American secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who is planning to travel to the South Korean capital, Seoul, and to Tokyo before going to Beijing to give briefings about the meeting\u2019s results.Apparently eager to maintain China\u2019s own diplomatic momentum, Mr. Xi has accepted an invitation from Mr. Kim to visit North Korea. He could go as soon as the end of this month, some analysts suggest.\u201cIt would be natural to expect Xi to make his first visit as president to Pyongyang in the not-too-distant future,\u201d said John Delury, an associate professor of Chinese Studies at Yonsei University in South Korea.The visit would be part of Mr. Kim\u2019s careful post-Singapore strategy, a move to show that he was his own man, a creature of neither the United States nor China.\u201cKim seems to be pursuing a rebalancing of dynamics, rather than an out-and-out \u2018defection\u2019 to the U.S. side,\u201d Mr. Delury said.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s an early example of the incentives created by the looming Trumpian trade war, which will hurt many more American companies and workers than Trump or the people around him seem to realize. It\u2019s an indication of the hysterical reactions we can expect from the Trump crew as the downsides of their policies start to become apparent \u2014 hysteria that other countries will surely see as evidence of Trump\u2019s fundamental weakness.And what Trump\u2019s alleged experts have to say about the controversy offers fresh confirmation that nobody in the administration has the slightest idea what he or she is doing.And Harley is one of the companies feeling an immediate squeeze: It\u2019s paying more for its raw materials even as it faces the prospect of tariffs on the cycles it exports. Given that squeeze, it\u2019s perfectly natural for the company to move some of its production overseas, to locations where steel is still cheap and sales to Europe won\u2019t face tariffs.So Harley\u2019s move is exactly what you\u2019d expect to see given Trump policies and the foreign response.Now, I suppose it\u2019s possible that Trump will, in fact, manage to bully Harley-Davidson into backing down on moving some production from the U.S. At the moment, however, there\u2019s no sign of that.So the Harley incident reveals the pervasive cluelessness behind the administration\u2019s signature economic policy. But it also reveals something else: the deep weakness at Trump\u2019s core.So the Harley story, while quantitatively small, may tell us a lot about the shape of things to come.

{"Headline": "Medicare\u2019s Trust Fund Is Set to Run Out in 8 Years. Social Security, 16.", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The financial outlook for Medicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund deteriorated in the last year, and Social Security still faces serious long-term financial problems, the Trump administration said on Tuesday.The Medicare trust fund will be depleted in 2026, the administration said. By contrast, the government said last year that the trust fund would be exhausted in 2029.In a companion report, federal officials said the Social Security Trust Funds for old-age benefits and disability insurance, taken together, could be depleted in 2034, the same year projected in last year\u2019s report. The fund that helps tens of millions of retirees is expected to be depleted a year earlier than projected last year, while the outlook for the disability trust fund is more favorable.Still, tax collections would be sufficient to pay about three-fourths of promised Social Security benefits for 75 years.The report, prepared mostly by nonpolitical actuaries and economists, predicts a 2.4 percent increase in Social Security benefits next year, to keep up with the cost of living. The increase this year was 2 percent.More than 60 million people are on Social Security, Medicare or both. The two programs account for about 40 percent of all federal spending.But Mr. Trump has paid relatively little attention to either program, declining to embrace a major restructuring of Social Security or Medicare, as some previous Republican presidents have. Nor has he endorsed higher taxes to finance the programs, as some Democrats have suggested.Trump administration officials instead are counting on a strong economy to improve the solvency of Social Security and Medicare.\u201cThe administration\u2019s economic agenda \u2014 tax cuts, regulatory reform and improved trade agreements \u2014 will generate the long-term growth needed to help secure these programs,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday.So far that does not appear to have happened, to judge from the annual report of the trustees of Social Security and Medicare, a group that includes three Trump cabinet officers.The report said the less favorable outlook for Medicare\u2019s hospital trust fund resulted from \u201cadverse changes\u201d in program income and costs. Income to the Medicare fund is expected to be lower than estimated last year because of \u201clower payroll taxes attributable to lowered wages in 2017 and lower levels of projected gross domestic product,\u201d the Treasury said in a \u201cfact sheet\u201d accompanying the report.At the same time, it said, outlays from Medicare\u2019s hospital trust fund \u201care expected to be higher than last year\u2019s estimates due to higher-than-anticipated spending in 2017, legislation that increases hospital spending\u201d and higher payments to private Medicare Advantage plans.\u201cThe current trajectories in health spending are both unsustainable and unmatched by increases in quality,\u201d Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services and a trustee of Medicare and Social Security, said on Tuesday.Democrats have for months asserted that Republicans would use the deficit \u2014 swollen by tax cuts \u2014 as \u201can excuse to cut Social Security and Medicare,\u201d in the words of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. Republicans say the programs must be revamped to ensure they will be solvent for baby boomers and their children.The report said the 2017 tax law would have relatively modest effects on the finances of Medicare and Social Security.About half of Social Security beneficiaries owe some income tax on their benefits. This revenue will be lower than previously expected while the cuts in individual tax rates are in effect through 2025, the actuaries said. But after that, they said, revenue from the taxation of benefits will be somewhat higher than expected because the tax law alters the way in which income tax brackets will be adjusted for inflation.In addition, the tax law repealed the penalty for people who go without health insurance. As a result, the report said, Medicare payments to certain hospitals for \u201cuncompensated care\u201d are expected to increase.Another factor contributing to the increase in Medicare costs is Congress\u2019s decision last year to eliminate the Independent Payment Advisory Board, created by the Affordable Care Act to help slow the growth of Medicare.The trustees said the outlook for Social Security\u2019s disability trust fund had improved because the number of applications had declined steadily since 2010 and the total number of beneficiaries had been falling since 2014. In addition, they said, average benefit levels for disabled workers \u201cwere lower than expected in 2017 and are expected to be lower in the future.\u201dMedicare now spends an average of about $13,600 a year per beneficiary, and in five years the annual cost is expected to average more than $17,000, the report said.The standard Medicare premium paid by most beneficiaries is expected to rise next year by just $1.50 a month, to $135.50. But for the most affluent beneficiaries \u2014 those with annual incomes exceeding about $160,000 \u2014 the premium is expected to be about $460 a month.Federal officials predict that enrollment in private Medicare Advantage plans will continue growing at a rapid clip, to 29 million in 2027, from 20 million last year.A major reason for Social Security\u2019s long-term financial problems is a decline in the number of workers for each beneficiary.In 1960, there were about five workers for every Social Security beneficiary. The ratio of workers to beneficiaries fell to 3.3 in 2005 and then to 2.8 in 2016. It will decline further to about 2.2 by 2035, when most baby boomers will have retired, officials said.The aging of the population is another factor in the growth of the two entitlement programs. The number of Medicare beneficiaries is expected to surge to 87 million in 2040, from 60 million this year, according to Medicare actuaries. And the number of people on Social Security is expected to climb to 90 million, from 62 million, in the same period.Speaker Paul D. Ryan has repeatedly tried to overhaul entitlement programs, converting Medicare into a voucherlike program that could shift more retirees to private insurance and turning Medicaid into a block grant to state governments. He has faced bipartisan opposition to that effort, but many Republicans say they hope to continue the push after he retires next year.For their part, Democrats hope to expand Social Security, to address what they see as a looming crisis in retirement income.\u201cWe will fight every effort to cut, privatize or weaken Social Security, including attempts to raise the retirement age, diminish benefits by cutting cost-of-living adjustments or reducing earned benefits,\u201d the 2016 Democratic platform said. \u201cDemocrats will expand Social Security.\u201dThe trustees of the two programs \u2014 the secretaries of the Treasury, labor and health and human services and the Social Security commissioner \u2014 normally unveil the annual report at a news conference. But none of the four attended the press briefing this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside a Heist of American Chip Designs, as China Bids for Tech Power", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJINJIANG, China \u2014 With a dragnet closing in, engineers at a Taiwanese chip maker holding American secrets did their best to conceal a daring case of corporate espionage.As the police raided their offices, human resources workers gave the engineers a warning to scramble and get rid of the evidence. USB drives, laptops and documents were handed to a lower-level employee, who hid them in her locker. Then she walked one engineer\u2019s phone out the front door.What those devices contained was more valuable than gold or jewels: designs from an American company, Micron Technology, for microchips that have helped power the global digital revolution. According to the Taiwanese authorities, the designs were bound for China, where they would help a new, $5.7 billion microchip factory the size of several airplane hangars rumble into production.Politicians in Washington and American companies accuse China of veering into intimidation and outright theft to get there. And they see Micron, an Idaho company whose memory chips give phones and computers the critical ability to store and quickly retrieve information, as a prime example of that aggression.Then Micron was the target of the heist in Taiwan, according to officials there and a lawsuit the company has brought against the Taiwanese company that employed the engineers, UMC, and the Chinese company it says wanted access to the technology, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company.Other companies may face predicaments similar to Micron\u2019s, industry experts said.One state-backed factory in the city of Wuhan, owned by Yangtze Memory Technology Company, or YMTC, will be turning out chips that look similar to those made by Samsung, the South Korean chip maker, said Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein.\u201cThe YMTC one is virtually identical to Samsung\u2019s, which makes it pretty clear they\u2019ve been copying,\u201d Mr. Newman said.China defends Made in China 2025 as necessary for its economic survival. It still depends on other countries for crucial goods like chips and software, and China is offering funding for homegrown labs and for entrepreneurs who hope to grab a piece of the future.American business groups worried about Made in China 2025 point to Micron. The account of its struggles was based on Taiwanese and American legal documents.In 2015, representatives from Tsinghua Unigroup, a Chinese chip maker with major state backing, approached Micron with an acquisition offer, which the company rejected. It later also turned down several partnership offers from Chinese companies out of concern for protecting its technology, said a person with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be identified because the person lacked authorization to speak publicly.That was when one Chinese company resorted to theft, Micron said in documents filed last December in Federal District Court for the Northern District of California.Micron\u2019s accusations focus on efforts by Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a state-backed chip maker, to build a $5.7 billion factory in China\u2019s Fujian Province. Two years ago, Jinhua tapped UMC, a Taiwanese company, to help it develop technology for the factory. Instead of going through the lengthy steps required to design the technology, Micron said in its suit, UMC and Jinhua decided to steal it.A UMC spokesman denied the allegations and declined to comment further. Jinhua did not respond to requests for comment.First, UMC lured away engineers from Micron\u2019s Taiwan operations with promises of raises and bonuses, according to the Taiwanese authorities. Then, it asked them to take some of Micron\u2019s secrets with them, according to Micron\u2019s court filings and the authorities. The engineers illegally took with them more than 900 files that contained key specifications and details about Micron\u2019s advanced memory chips, the authorities said.Micron grew suspicious, according to its court documents, after discovering that one of its departing engineers had turned to Google for instructions on how to wipe a company laptop. Later, at a recruiting event in the United States aimed at Micron employees, Jinhua and UMC showed PowerPoint slides that used Micron\u2019s internal code names when discussing future chips it would make, according to the court documents.Alerted by Micron, the Taiwanese police tapped the phone of one Micron engineer, Kenny Wang, who was being recruited by UMC. According to an indictment in Taiwan against Mr. Wang and others, UMC reached out to Mr. Wang in early 2016 using Line, the smartphone messaging app, while he was still working for Micron. UMC explained it was having problems developing its memory chip technology. Mr. Wang then grabbed the information it needed from Micron\u2019s servers, and later used it to help UMC\u2019s design. The police said Mr. Wang received a promotion at UMC.When investigators showed up at UMC\u2019s offices early last year, the police said, some employees rushed to hide what they had taken from Micron. Mr. Wang and another former Micron employee gave laptops, USB flash drives and documents to an assistant engineer, who locked them in her personal locker. She then left the office with Mr. Wang\u2019s phone \u2014 the one that the police had tapped, which was quickly tracked down.UMC filed its own criminal complaint against Mr. Wang last year, which Taiwanese prosecutors rejected. Mr. Wang and other engineers who were charged said they had taken the trade secrets for personal research. Mr. Wang did not respond to emails and phone calls for comment.In January, Micron was hit with a patent infringement suit by Jinhua and UMC over several types of memory. As part of the suit, the companies requested that the court bar Micron from making and selling the products and pay them damages. The case is being heard by a court in Fujian Province. The Fujian provincial government is an investor in Jinhua.In a letter sent to President Trump, Senators Jim Risch and Michael D. Crapo, Republicans of Idaho, expressed concern about the entire case and specifically the rapid pace with which the patent lawsuit has proceeded. The case could block Micron from selling some products in China.\u201cIf the case against Micron moves forward, and the Chinese government once again rules in favor of itself, it would cause substantial damage to Micron and the U.S. tech industry as a whole,\u201d said the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times.Jinhua and others are spending big to get there. In Jinjiang, a city in Fujian Province once known as a shoe-manufacturing center, Jinhua\u2019s new factory is almost finished. Rising five stories and stretching several football fields long, the structure boasts 100,000 square feet of new office space.Economic planners in Jinjiang said they were hoping to attract more talent from Taiwan. In addition to adding more flights there, the town was in the process of building out a bilingual international school, a hospital with international accreditation and upscale apartments. The new plant is just a short drive from the airport.\u201cMost of Made in China 2025 is likely to succeed. Not all technologies are rocket science,\u201d said Dan Wang, a technology analyst in Beijing with Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm. \u201cWith enough subsidies, Chinese firms have a good shot at catching up to the technological frontier.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Kim Arrive in Singapore for Historic Summit Meeting", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut on Sunday, Mr. Trump arrived just after 8:20 p.m. local time at Paya Lebar Air Base in Singapore aboard Air Force One, a few hours after Mr. Kim landed at Changi Airport on a commercial Air China plane.Mr. Trump has questioned the need for a strong American military presence in Northeast Asia. Most analysts do not believe that Mr. Kim is prepared to give up his weapons.Earlier Sunday, reporters scrambled to track three planes headed from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, to Singapore. Mr. Kim landed a little after 2:30 p.m. and was greeted at the airport by Singapore\u2019s foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan.The international news media have descended on Singapore, with the United States, Japan and South Korea sending the most journalists. According to Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Communications, about 2,500 journalists have registered to cover the meeting.A contingent of reporters spent the steaming hot day staking out the St. Regis Hotel, where Mr. Kim\u2019s motorcade arrived shortly after 3:30 p.m. with North Korean flags flapping on the front hoods of Mercedes-Benz stretch cars. Traffic was snarled along roads leading to and from the hotel.Although there were nowhere near royal-wedding-level crowds, curious onlookers joined camera crews and journalists on the road outside the St. Regis to watch Mr. Kim\u2019s motorcade depart for a meeting with the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong.\u201cIt is a big thing for Singapore,\u201d said Patrick Han, 29, an energy research analyst who came out with his mother to wait near the St. Regis on Sunday afternoon. But after seeing how Mr. Trump had alienated allies at the G-7 meeting, Mr. Han said, \u201cI am not really hopeful that a single summit will have tangible results.\u201dRuairi Gogan, an American who has lived in Singapore for 20 years, began tracking Mr. Kim\u2019s flight on flightradar24.com on Saturday.\u201cHe is like Dr. Evil,\u201d Mr. Gogan quipped while waiting near the St. Regis, though he added that the summit meeting \u201cmight be a good thing.\u201dThe St. Regis is less than half a mile from the Shangri La Hotel, where Mr. Trump is staying. But while the Shangri La is set on a residential stretch of road, the St. Regis sits on a busy commercial boulevard next to a run-down strip mall with two money changers, a pet store and \u201cMaids R Us,\u201d a hiring agency.There were road cordons and a heavy police presence outside the St. Regis, although officers took a gentle approach when urging those who had gathered outside the hotel with smartphones and video cameras to move back from the wire barricades.Outside the Shangri La, about two hours before Mr. Trump was scheduled to land, the road was deserted except for a few bystanders.Stanley Peck, 49, a doctor who lives nearby and was finishing up an evening run, stopped to snap a photo of a large sign with a silhouette of a machine-gun-toting police officer just outside the entrance to the hotel. \u201cPolice checks comply with orders,\u201d the sign read.\u201cIt is interesting to know that a small country like ours can have these two big boxers coming in for a fight,\u201d Mr. Peck said. \u201cWe are proud to host something like this.\u201dGiven that just two weeks ago the summit meeting had been canceled, Mr. Peck said, the prospects for the meeting had already \u201ccome a long way.\u201d He added, \u201cAt least they are here and at least they get to shake hands. Hopefully.\u201dAcross the city, Singapore has tightened security for the long-awaited meeting. According to Kasiviswanathan Shanmugam, Singapore\u2019s minister for home affairs, about 5,000 police officers and emergency responders are on duty throughout the events.Already, he said, one traveler from a \u201cregional country\u201d was turned away at the airport on Saturday. Immigration and customs officers had stopped the man after determining that he was \u201cbehaving very nervously,\u201d Mr. Shanmugam said.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t answer their questions,\u201d Mr. Shanmugam said at a news briefing on Sunday. \u201cThey checked his mobile phone and saw that he\u2019s been checking through and visiting sites on suicide bombings, and they made an assessment\u201d that he should be barred from entering Singapore.Mr. Shanmugam said \u201ctwo or three\u201d other individuals had also been barred from entering the country in recent days.At the international media center, at Singapore\u2019s Formula One Racing Center, journalists gathered in a building overlooking a racetrack to wait for the arrival of Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump.Some locals were capitalizing on the attention. In a dining hall set up for reporters, the Common Good Company, a consortium of Singaporean food businesses, gave away ice cream in flavors like Kimchi (in honor of Korea) and Durian, a Southeast Asian fruit.Playing on the themes of the summit meeting, the company displayed signs saying, \u201cDurians May Be Thorny but Relations Needn\u2019t Be\u201d and \u201cFeeling More Trump-ish or Kim-ish today?\u201dJames Kwan, a co-director of Common Good, said the company had decided just five days ago to offer the summit-themed items. \u201cWe are doing what we can to facilitate peace through food,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Analysis Finds Tariffs Will Hurt Growth, as Officials Insist Otherwise", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe findings from the White House Council of Economic Advisers have been circulated only internally and not publicly released, as is often the case with the council\u2019s work, making the exact economic projections unknown. But the determination comes as top White House officials continue to insist publicly that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade approach will be \u201cmassively good for the U.S. economy.\u201d\u201cIf you model a future where everybody else reduces their trade barriers to ours, then that\u2019s massively good for the global economy and massively good for the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Hassett said.But the immediate effect of the administration\u2019s trade agenda has been the opposite, as other nations retaliate against the United States with their own tariffs.The administration has hit Canada, Mexico, Japan and the European Union with steel and aluminum tariffs and threatened tariffs on a range of Chinese goods. In return, many of those countries have either imposed or threatened reciprocal tariffs on everything from steel to pork to orange juice, a move that economists say will depress economic growth.Chris Rogers, research director for Panjiva, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence, said Mexico\u2019s recently enacted tariffs would hit the American agricultural sector hardest.\u201cUnsurprisingly, the American suppliers hit most by the restrictions on consumer products shipments are the meat producers Swift Pork (JBS) and Tyson,\u201d Mr. Rogers wrote. \u201cThe largest non-pork category was processed foods, which includes sweeteners and chewing gum, among others. That has left Wrigley and Costco (including its own-brand products) similarly exposed to the new duties.\u201dRepublican lawmakers and many economists have been warning that the administration\u2019s trade approach will undercut economic growth and partially offset any boost from the $1.5 trillion tax cut that Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed last year.On Wednesday, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, criticized the Trump administration for throwing \u201ca huge wet blanket of uncertainty on an economy that otherwise they were responsible for making red hot.\u201dPursuing a trade approach that actually dampens economic growth would be a significant self-inflicted wound for the Trump administration, which has made achieving sustainable 3 percent economic growth a top priority. Mr. Trump has said his tax cut plan, along with his effort to roll back regulations, will provide \u201crocket fuel\u201d to the economy.Wall Street research firms have warned that those tariffs, and the retaliatory tariffs that trading partners have threatened in response, will slow growth in the United States. Researchers at Goldman Sachs said this month that the latest round of tariff escalations could reduce economic growth by as much as 0.15 percentage points this year.Asked about the Council of Economic Advisers analysis, a White House spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters, said in an email on Wednesday that \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on internal, deliberative documents.\u201dIn her email, Ms. Walters pointed to a report issued on Wednesday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which includes an economic model predicting positive outcomes if nations around the world reduce tariff levels. Such reductions, Ms. Walters said, are \u201cwhat the president\u2019s trade reform agenda is focused on: getting the rest of the world to lower their tariffs and get American exports on a level playing field.\u201dSo far, that has not come to pass. At an event unveiling the organization\u2019s report in Washington, its secretary general, Angel Gurr\u00eda, warned against tariff escalation. \u201cWe regret the proliferation of tariffs announced in the last couple of days,\u201d Mr. Gurr\u00eda said. \u201cWe believe they are a threat to the global recovery.\u201dOther Trump administration officials have also expressed confidence that the White House\u2019s trade policies will not undermine the president\u2019s broader economic agenda.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, told CNBC on Thursday that the tariffs would probably shave a fraction of a percentage point off the rate of economic growth. He said he expected the rise in gross domestic product to top 3 percent for 2018.In March, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said he did not think that tariffs would weaken economic forecasts.\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019re going to manage through this so that it is not detrimental to our growth projections,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.The Trump administration has faced criticism from outside economists for its optimistic projections that show the United States economy growing at an average of 3 percent a year for the next decade. Administration officials have publicly tried to discredit nonpartisan reports from organizations such as the Congressional Budget Office that have forecast slower growth over the course of the decade.The Treasury Department came under fire last year for producing a thin, three-page analysis of the effects of the Republican tax plan on the economy, and Mr. Mnuchin has been criticized for insisting that the Trump tax cuts will be self-financing. Most analyses have concluded that the cuts will add more than $1 trillion to the national debt.On Wednesday, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, told reporters at the White House briefing that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies, along with tax cuts and deregulation, were lifting growth, calling the president \u201cthe strongest trade reformer of the past 20 years.\u201d\u201cThe world trading system is a mess,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cIt is broken down. Insofar as fairness and reciprocity and, ultimately, free trade, I think this is contributing to our economic growth and our confidence.\u201dThe internal findings from the Council of Economic Advisers echo the widely shared view by most economists that tariffs hurt economic growth.This week, the World Bank said in its Global Economic Prospects Report that if tariff threats led to trade wars, the consequences could be \u201cdevastating.\u201d It pointed to intensifying protectionism around the world as a risk to economic growth.And last year, a group of former Council of Economic Advisers chairmen from both political parties wrote a letter to Mr. Trump urging him not to move ahead with steel tariffs, warning that \u201ctariffs would raise costs for manufacturers, reduce employment in manufacturing, and increase prices for consumers.\u201dVeterans of previous councils said that sometimes the office initiates its own analyses, and sometimes other senior White House officials request an analysis for policy development purposes. But much of the research is held closely for internal consumption, and the administration is unlikely to publicly release a report that contradicts the president\u2019s policy approach.\u201cThe West Wing folks alone determined whether the results of C.E.A. research entered into the public domain, and if so, how and when,\u201d said Harvey Rosen, a Princeton economist and former chairman of President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret Life and Value of Trees", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterTrees are sociable, it turns out, and even somewhat selfless, nurturing their drought-stricken or wounded arboreal siblings. They share nutrients. They suffer when a big arm is lopped during the growing season, or a crown is next to an all-night light. Some trees warn other trees of danger by releasing chemical drifts.I found these relatively new discoveries not long after a giant fir came crashing down in my front yard during a freakish windstorm, nearly crushing my family and our century-old house. We were spared by six inches. But a question remained: What was the big guy trying to say?Trees are fighting back, helped by others doing the talking for them. Sadly, we are past the point when an appeal to our better angels does any good. \u201cIt is worse than boorish, it is criminal to inflict an unnecessary injury on the tree that feeds or shadows us,\u201d wrote Henry David Thoreau. \u201cOld trees are our parents, and our parents\u2019 parents, perchance.\u201d A lovely sentiment, but largely futile.\u201cI have mixed feelings about monetizing the geography of hope,\u201d said Peter Jackson, a writer and conservationist, using one of the best-known phrases of Wallace Stegner. A wilderness in the Cascade Mountains is named for his late father, Senator Henry M. Jackson, a giant of Congress from an era when support for purple mountain majesties was bipartisan.The president is a fossil fool, but beyond that, he\u2019s never taken a view that extends to the world that Ivanka\u2019s grandchildren will inherit. His bias for dirty 19th-century energy is based on pleasing a coal industry that has gone from employing 883,000 people in the 1920s to barely 50,000 now. If the free-market philosophy were still the bedrock principle of governing Republicans, coal would be left to the creative destruction of capitalism.Beyond the economic value, trees force us to measure time in epochs. In 1870, Victor Hugo planted a tree outside his home in exile on the island of Guernsey. His hope was that when the little sapling was a mighty oak, Europe would be unified. The European Union and Hugo\u2019s plant are still standing, though the tree may be in better shape than the E.U.A spruce in Sweden, which sprouted sometime after the last ice age, is 9,500 years old, having survived all the upheavals of history and weather. But will it live through the current era?In \u201cThe Hidden Life of Trees,\u201d an international best seller by Peter Wohlleben, and \u201cThe Overstory,\u201d a masterful new novel by Richard Powers, forests are main characters, crying to be heard. In the summer, Powers writes, water traveling through a single chestnut \u201cdisperses out of the million tiny mouths of the undersides of leaves, a hundred gallons a day evaporating from the tree\u2019s airy crown into the humid Iowa air.\u201dSome scientists think it\u2019s wrong to anthropomorphize trees. They aren\u2019t sentient life-forms, and can\u2019t really \u201ctalk\u201d like that grumpy apple tree Dorothy encounters on the way to Oz. But surely they communicate, through a system that foresters compare to the neural networks of humans. It\u2019s worth a listen.Advertisement"}

To flip the dynamic, Mr. Navarro has advocated the type of aggressive trade policy toward China that Mr. Trump is now pursuing, including stiff tariffs on as much as $150 billion worth of Chinese goods and as investment restrictions.Mr. Navarro came to the White House with multiple trade actions written and ready for the president\u2019s signature, including a directive to begin withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement.Mr. Navarro is a former a professor at the University of California, Irvine, who holds a doctorate from Harvard. He is one of the only credentialed economists in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle.But Mr. Navarro has objected to that approach, saying that China has been given too many chances to change. Mr. Navarro says that China needs to feel the heat of tariffs in order to make changes the United States has long been seeking, including opening its market more fully to American companies and ending its practice of pressuring businesses to hand over valuable technology in order to operate in Beijing.Mr. Navarro\u2019s tenure within the White House has been somewhat of a bumpy ride.Mr. Mnuchin has since sought to play down tensions between the American officials, saying on CNBC that Mr. Navarro was \u201can important part of the team.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Doctrine Is Winning and the World Is Losing", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs.\u00a0Schake is the deputy director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Decades from now, we may look back at the first weeks of June 2018 as a turning point in world history: the end of the liberal order.At a summit in Canada, the president of the United States rejected associating the country with \u201cthe rules-based international order\u201d that America had built after World War II, and threatened the country\u2019s closest allies with a trade war. He insulted the Canadian prime minister, and then, just a few days later, lavished praise on Kim Jong-un, the world\u2019s most repressive dictator. Without consulting America\u2019s allies in the region, he even reiterated his desire to withdraw American troops from South Korea.Such reckless disregard for the security concerns of America\u2019s allies, hostility to mutually beneficial trade and willful isolation of the United States is unprecedented. Yet this is the foreign policy of the Trump administration. Quite explicitly, the leader of the free world wants to destroy the alliances, trading relationships and international institutions that have characterized the American-led order for 70 years.According to the president, the liberal world order is a con job \u2014 he insists America is paying too much and being swindled by its friends. He wants the United States to pull back from its alliances and let its partners fend for themselves, and devote its money to its domestic needs.Those criticisms resonate in a time when Americans are fearful of how the world is changing, and when the country\u2019s leaders have done a poor job of explaining those changes and easing their impact on workers and their families.Widening disparity of outcomes and fewer avenues of opportunity call the fundamental fairness of the current system into question. Terrible, costly mistakes like the Iraq war and the 2008 financial crisis destroyed the credibility of experts who are culpable for the failures but insulated from the consequences. And America\u2019s allies celebrate the generosity of their social welfare systems and disparage ours, while spending less than America does to defend their countries.These are all fair points, and they help explain the rise of Mr. Trump and the declining appreciation for a liberal order. But none of these things invalidates the importance of sustaining a system in which America benefits more than other geometries of order will permit.Let\u2019s review what, exactly, that order is. Beginning in the wreckage of World War II, America established a set of global norms that solidified its position atop a rules-based international system. These included promoting democracy, making enduring commitments to countries that share its values, protecting allies, advancing free trade and building institutions and patterns of behavior that legitimize American power by giving less powerful countries a say.That last point is critical, and it is the genius of the system. America benefits from supporting others. The American security umbrella enables friendly governments to attract investment and grow peacefully. It encourages cooperation. The system allows America and other countries to share the costs of preserving common defense and the free movement of goods and people (although sometimes others put in less than Americans would like).The world has never seen anything like this \u2014 a superpower constraining itself to such a degree \u2014 or the peace and stability it brings. America doesn\u2019t always get it right; often it\u2019s clumsy, fails to live up to its ideology, and breaks its own rules.But the results speak for themselves. It has been over 70 years since the last great-power conflict. Democracies fight lots of wars, but they do not fight other democracies. The wars they fight are about enlarging the perimeter of security and prosperity, expanding and consolidating the liberal order.The global economy has grown about sevenfold since 1960, adjusted for inflation. Free people and free markets have produced most of the strongest and most prosperous states in the international order, and those states have linked themselves through alliances, institutions and trade regimes that are mutually beneficial.Contrary to the president\u2019s core complaint, the American-led order isn\u2019t that expensive, especially as compared with the alternatives. About 40 percent of America\u2019s gross domestic product was allocated to the military during World War II. It now stands at less than 4 percent \u2014 not an unreasonable price for a tried-and-true insurance policy.The president and his fellow critics argue that if America does less, others will do more \u2014 that its largess facilitates free riders. That hasn\u2019t proved true with its closest friends: Since the end of the Cold War in 1991, the United States has reduced its military forces in Europe by about 85 percent. But Europeans have even more significantly cut their defense spending, and become more tentative about the use of military force. Far from emboldening allies, the American drawdown has made them less likely to act.And if others do more, they may not be the right others, and what they do may not serve America\u2019s interests. Russia has been doing more in Europe since the United States drew down, and more in Syria as a result of America\u2019s doing so little.China is doing more in the South and East China Seas, and its activities will greatly complicate American military operations in defense of allies, in preserving the free flow of commerce and even in protecting its own territory.The Islamic State in part grew out of the United States doing too little to consolidate the gains of the surge in Iraq and caring too little about the Syrian government\u2019s depredations against its people. None of these are outcomes that advance American interests.Now imagine the longer term. China is already demonstrating that not only will it not play by the rules of the American-led order, but it also intends to write and enforce new rules. Absent American opposition, it will continue to force smaller, weaker states in East Asia into submission and expand its control over sea traffic. It will use technology to monitor, restrain and penalize critics worldwide. A Chinese-led world order would be one of privileges rather than rights, power rather than law, tribute rather than alliance.That\u2019s a very costly peace \u2014 if it even succeeds at sustaining peace. More likely, if the United States does not sustain the order, a rising power will eventually force it to defend its interests or succumb. That is what happened in every power transition except the one between Britain and the United States \u2014 an exception born of their democratic similarities, and one unlikely to be repeated with the United States and China.Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on the liberal world order is not just about the price America pays for it. He seems bent on destroying the friendships and respect that bind America and its allies. If he succeeds, America will be seen as \u2014 and may even become \u2014 no different from Russia and China, and countries will have no reason to assist America\u2019s efforts rather than theirs.America has been dominant for so long that it takes for granted outcomes that support its policies and interests, and undervalues the systemic advantages of institutions and norms. Yet Mr. Trump may end up proving an illiberal preserver of the liberal international order. By calling into question so many fundamental elements of the system that the United States built in the devastated aftermath of World War II, he is forcing Americans to imagine a world in which the United States does not tend the garden of international order, as George Shultz describes foreign policy.Americans want an international order that makes them safe and prosperous. And no doubt this fall, when Mr. Trump gets his military parade in Washington, we will hear no end of boasts about American power. And during the midterm elections, we will hear all sorts of talk about how the president has made America great again.But those boasts will ring hollow if, at the same time, America lets go of the world order that is its greatest achievement. Tending the garden that the hard men who fought World War II labored to create is a much less expensive undertaking than allowing it to fall into disrepair and having to recreate it.Kori Schake is the deputy director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the author of \u201cSafe Passage: The Transition From British to American Hegemony.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Americans Love Families. American Policies Don\u2019t. ", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFalling short of other countries, from the left and the right, in meeting real needs.Politicians are united in their love for families. The very word \u2014 \u201cfamilies\u201d \u2014 was among those said most often by Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton in campaign speeches. Democrats and Republicans have platforms for middle-class families, working families, military families. And candidates in need of character witnesses or podium backdrops routinely turn to their own. But this past week was a reminder of a deep contradiction about the family in American politics: Families make powerful symbols, valuable to politicians and revered by voters. But American policies are inconsistent and weak, relative to many countries, in supporting them. The focus of recent days was on the Trump administration\u2019s separation of immigrant children from their parents at the Mexican border. The contradiction is also clear in many other realms, say critics on both the right and left: criminal justice, child welfare, family leave, child care, health care and education. Over this time, the family has come to sit at the center of a core philosophical divide between the left and the right, even as both claim to care about families the most. As the left sees it, government plays an essential role protecting and supporting families, through programs like Medicaid or a higher minimum wage. To the right, it seems government too often burdens families, who need lower taxes and less regulation.\u201cFamily and parenting is just such a potent political symbol,\u201d said Mr. Greene, a political scientist at North Carolina State University. \u201cPoliticians have learned that whatever the policy is, wrapping it in the language of family and children \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans, regardless of policy \u2014 is really effective.\u201dHe worries that the politicization of the family is bad for policymaking. As the family becomes a culturally loaded symbol, evocative of everything and used to justify anything, it becomes harder to devise real policies that address real needs, he said.In this climate, families have become the focal point of partisans charging hypocrisy, on both sides. Conservatives, critics say, value traditional nuclear families and yet support the separation of immigrant families. Liberals, critics charge, say children should not be separated from their parents and yet condone relatively easy divorce and single parenthood.\u201cBy focusing only on family structures that are beneficial, it\u2019s easy to gloss over structural barriers that make it hard,\u201d said Michelle Janning, a sociologist at Whitman College and a senior scholar at the Council on Contemporary Families. \u201cInstead of saying, \u2018Support all families,\u2019 it\u2019s saying, \u2018Support certain families,\u2019 and ignores the inequalities that exist.\u201dThere is a fair amount of agreement between the right and left, however, on the principles of what would benefit families \u2014 like helping parents support their children financially and keeping their children healthy. And there\u2019s strong consensus among researchers about what families need and what happens when children don\u2019t have that support. What, then, would American policy look like if policies for families more closely resembled the political language celebrating them? Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kim Jong-pil, Political Kingmaker in South Korea, Dies at 92", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Kim Jong-pil, a two-time South Korean prime minister who helped engineer a military coup, founded the country\u2019s intelligence agency and facilitated the rise of three presidents, but who never managed to win the presidency himself, died on Saturday in Seoul, the capital. He was 92.Mr. Kim\u2019s death was announced by his family and by the South Korean government. He had been taken to Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital in Seoul early Saturday after having difficulty breathing and was pronounced dead on arrival. No specific cause was given.A suave, witty deal maker, Kim Jong-pil stood out from the other two Kims, both of whom were known for being fiery and headstrong. He was the original kingmaker in South Korea\u2019s fractured, regionally based political system, in which parties were dispersed and realigned at their leaders\u2019 whims.Mr. Kim had little in common ideologically or in political background with the other two Kims, both of whom were dissidents during military rule. To become president, each had to form an alliance with Mr. Kim, who had decades earlier played a central role in bringing the generals to power.Mr. Kim was elected to Parliament nine times, a record. He helped create, and lead, four political parties. He was prime minister, the second-highest position in the government, from 1971 to 1975. Twenty-three years later, in 1998, he assumed the post again, becoming the first person to hold the job twice.But the presidency always eluded Mr. Kim, who was widely known as \u201cthe perpetual No. 2.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even step on the shadow of the president,\u201d he once quipped, a remark that both encapsulated his runner-up status and helped explain his political longevity.Kim Jong-pil was born in 1926 in Buyeo, a town in the central region of Chungcheong. He was the fifth of seven children, all boys; their father was a scholar in Chinese philosophy and a low-ranking government official.Mr. Kim graduated from the national military academy in 1948, two years before the outbreak of the Korean War, in which he served as an intelligence officer. He became a friend of Park Chung-hee, a fellow army officer who, in 1961, would seize control of the country in a military coup.Mr. Kim, who had married a niece of Mr. Park\u2019s, was deeply involved in both the planning of the coup and the management of the dictatorship, which lasted 18 years. Mr. Kim was the founding director of the infamous Korean Central Intelligence Agency, which buttressed Mr. Park\u2019s rule through arbitrary arrests and the torture of dissidents.Under Mr. Park, Mr. Kim also left an indelible mark on South Korean foreign affairs.He helped broker a deal in 1965 that established diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan, which had ruled Korea as a colony for decades until Tokyo\u2019s defeat in World War II. As part of that agreement, Mr. Kim helped secure free grants and cheap loans from Japan. Mr. Park\u2019s regime used the money to build factories and highways, laying the groundwork for South Korea\u2019s rapid evolution from war-torn agrarian country to export powerhouse.But the deal with Japan fueled enormous protests in South Korea, where many complained that Tokyo had not offered a clear apology or sufficient reparations for brutalities committed during the colonial period \u2014 an issue that still haunts the two countries\u2019 relations.He was unapologetic to the end about the deal with Japan. \u201cEven if I was vilified as a national traitor, I was convinced that it was the best way for my country,\u201d he said years later. \u201cWe needed the money to establish factories and learn technologies and build the economy.\u201dAfter a period of exile in the United States, Kim Jong-pil returned to South Korean politics in the late 1980s, as military rule was nearing its end amid huge street demonstrations. All three Kims ran for president in 1987, splitting the opposition vote against Mr. Chun\u2019s handpicked successor, Roh Tae-woo, a former general. Mr. Roh won the election; Kim Jong-pil received just 8.1 percent of the vote.Mr. Kim\u2019s geographical power base was modest, essentially limited to his native region of Chungcheong. But he wielded outsize influence because Chungcheong was well known as a swing-vote region. Any politician with presidential ambitions had to pay respects to Mr. Kim and win his favor.He helped Kim Young-sam win the presidency in 1992, forming a political alliance with him and Mr. Roh, in which their three parties merged. Later, after a falling-out with Kim Young-sam, he merged his new party with that of Kim Dae-jung, who went on to be elected president in 1997. He became prime minister under President Kim Dae-jung, who would win a Nobel Peace Prize for his policy of outreach to North Korea, including a historic summit meeting with Kim Jong-il, then the North\u2019s leader.Kim Jong-pil remained a conservative and a hawk on North Korea. But he never hesitated to form alliances across the political spectrum, because he knew his modest regional power base limited his own ambitions. His dream, never fulfilled, was that South Korea would adopt a parliamentary system like Japan\u2019s, which he hoped would make it more likely that a political boss like him could come to power.Mr. Kim, who is survived by a son and daughter, retired from politics in 2004. But politicians continued to visit him for years, especially during election seasons, well after a stroke in 2008 limited his mobility.\u201cBeing a politician should be an empty-handed job,\u201d Mr. Kim told the opposition leader Moon Jae-in in 2015 \u2014 his way of saying that South Korean politicians driven by personal greed always come to a bad end. Mr. Moon is now president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s Lumber Tariffs May Have Helped Increase Home Prices", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWant to better understand what may happen in the United States economy as President Trump pursues his combative trade policies?Look no further than the lumber that goes into many houses in the United States.Long before the sharp clash with Canada at the Group of 7 meeting this weekend, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on lumber imports from Canada, which American home builders use in large quantities. The United States Commerce Department contended that Canadian companies were selling lumber into the United States at unfair, subsidized prices.Those tariffs, which took effect last year, combined with other factors to drive up the price of lumber in the United States. As a result, the anti-dumping and countervailing duties, as the tariffs are officially known, have added to the cost of housing in the United States at a time when homes are becoming less affordable. The Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum, and any others that follow, could also contribute to rising costs for businesses and consumers.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, defended the lumber tariffs. \u201cAnti-dumping and countervailing duty determinations provide the domestic industry with relief from dumping and improper subsidies,\u201d he said in a statement to The New York Times last week. \u201cPrice fluctuations from other factors are not part of the calculus.\u201dTariffs might be expected to push up the price of a good to a certain level, but in this case, the price of Canadian lumber kept rising.The cost of 1,000 board feet of western Canadian lumber is up nearly 80 percent over the past 12 months, including about 40 percent this year, according to data from Random Lengths, a publication that covers the lumber market.What caused this unusual rise? Paul F. Jannke, a principal at Forest Economic Advisors, a firm that analyzes the lumber market, said that the tariffs had contributed to the ascent. But, he added, a reduction in the supply of Canadian lumber, caused by recent rail slowdowns and tree disease, played a big role. Mr. Ross, in his statement, noted these causes.\u201cThe prices have gone up by much more than the tariffs because of supply and demand factors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe purpose of the tariffs was to level the playing field for the Americans.\u201dIn the first quarter of 2018, the United States imported 3.07 billion board feet of Canadian lumber, down 15 percent from 3.63 billion board feet a year earlier, according to data from Forest Economic Advisors. Also, Canadian lumber imports in the first quarter were equivalent to 36 percent of United States domestic lumber production, down from 42 percent in all of 2017.Is this evidence that the tariffs have priced the Canadians out of the United States market, allowing American producers to fill the gap? Probably not. The declines in Canadian shipments are more the result of tree disease and the slower rail transportation than tariffs, Mr. Jannke said. Also, United States lumber production does not appear to be growing at a faster rate. In the first quarter, it was up 3 percent over a year earlier. In 2017, it grew at a 4.4 percent annual rate. It will take a long time for American producers to add a significant amount of new capacity, Mr. Jannke added.Large Canadian lumber producers have done well financially despite the trade friction. The stock of West Fraser Timber, a big Canadian producer, has gained 53 percent in the last 12 months, and its 2018 first-quarter earnings rose 60 percent from a year earlier.\u201cThe tariffs did not constrain Canadian production nor was that their purpose,\u201d Mr. Ross said in his statement. \u201cTheir purpose was to protect the U.S. lumber industry from subsidized softwood lumber dumping. These tariffs will be most beneficial to the U.S. producers in the next down cycle. In an up cycle, everyone benefits.\u201dBut such words may not satisfy United States home builders, who are grappling with the much higher lumber prices while other costs \u2014 like wages \u2014 are also going up.\u201cWe\u2019ve had conversations with the White House, Secretary Ross directly and the U.S. trade representative,\u201d said Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders. \u201cWe are trying to sound the alarm here.\u201dDespite the rise in housing prices, the number of homes being built has not picked up to the levels of past upswings.In the past 12 months, monthly housing starts, expressed at an annual rate, have averaged 1.24 million units, well below the 1.96 million average units from 2003 through 2005.For now, many home builders are passing on their higher costs to home buyers. In recent months, executives from publicly traded home builders have told their shareholders that they expect to maintain their profit margins even as their costs rise.The profitability of home builders has not escaped Mr. Ross\u2019s notice. \u201cHome prices have risen by much more than the increase in lumber prices, and this is reflected in the strong profit margins of the home builders,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Perhaps you no longer even hear the beeping, it has become so integrated into the city\u2019s aural tapestry.For me, however, this sound induces an immediate hyperarousal. My heart races and my blood pressure spikes, like when I\u2019m forced to sample a neighbor\u2019s raisin-infused potato salad at a cookout. My fight-or-flight response kicks in because I\u2019m terrified that the beeping belongs to a tow truck that will snatch my car \u2014 a cruel and bloodless sentinel, sent by an auto-financing company to seek, destroy and repossess.I\u2019ve already paid for my car in full, though. The title sits in the same shoe box in my closet as my passport, birth certificate and a pocket-size Bible I displayed in my living room when I was single, to convince women I was sufficiently yoked.The terror of repossession began one day in November 2012 when I thought my car had been stolen, called the police to file a report and then learned it had been taken by Ally Auto.A spate of late paychecks from the publication where I was employed as a full-time freelancer catalyzed a series of events that forced me to prioritize payments on food, rent, electricity and car insurance. My car payments and cable bill went unpaid for three months.I ignored the dozens of calls from the folks at Ally \u2014 perhaps thinking that if I just pretended I didn\u2019t owe them money, they\u2019d forget. They didn\u2019t.It took a week to scrounge together the money needed to get my car back. I joined a local church\u2019s credit union. I borrowed cash from three friends, telling each the same lie: \u201cThe city towed my car because of unpaid parking tickets.\u201d That was less embarrassing than the truth.For four years afterward, my financial circumstances improved, but in moderate increments. And in the fall of 2016, a stretch of professional fortune \u2014 a very generous book deal and the purchase of my blog by a network \u2014 changed things so sharply I still have whiplash.And yet I still feel the same as I did that morning my car was taken. I don\u2019t have impostor syndrome. I believe I deserve my success. I am, however, waiting for the other shoe to drop. I\u2019m so used to mundane financial setbacks \u2014 an overdraft fee here, a cellphone temporarily disconnected there \u2014 that my new status is too surreal for my brain to accept.Even admitting aloud that I\u2019m not struggling, but thriving, feels egregious, like I\u2019m taunting those sentinels of brokeness, daring them to snatch me from my stoop.I will be 40 in December. And for my first 35 or so years, I was either broke or broke-adjacent, which is another way of saying still broke-ish, but temporarily held together with duct tape.But I am well acquainted with payday loans and check-cashing spots; with food stamps and utility bills in my name as a toddler; with Rent-A-Center and \u201criding dirty\u201d for so long you forget how it feels to be clean; with bright red shut-off notices taped to front doors, knowing that when you\u2019re evicted, landlords don\u2019t usually throw your things out on the sidewalk like in the movies. Instead, you\u2019ll just come home and the locks will be changed.I\u2019m so familiar with the myriad signals of brokeness, and the sub-economy that feeds off the desperation it cultivates, that I can detect when someone is lying to conceal the shame of not having as much money as he or she believes is appropriate. I know it because I\u2019ve done it repeatedly.Some people believe they possess gaydar. I have brokedar.Even now, as I\u2019ve evolved from ashy to nasty to classy enough to shop at Whole Foods instead of going there only for the free samples, I\u2019m the sole person in my immediate family to experience such a change. This makes my new status even more surreal, as if I\u2019m getting Punk\u2019d, which is not an uncommon feeling among black people who\u2019ve undergone similar financial changes.Hundreds of years of structural and intentional anti-black bias have left us with a race-based financial dichotomy so stark that the racial wealth gap looks like a typo. For every $100 in white family wealth, for instance, black families hold just $5.04. (Those four cents feel insulting. We couldn\u2019t even get a full nickel?)But these pressures and angsts just keep the feeling of brokeness fresh and unshakable, stuck to your skin and planted in your head.America shames people who have the audacity to struggle, fastening a scarlet letter to those of us forced to stretch and bend and cheat and break resources just to stay afloat. These days, that\u2019s most of us.But then if you happen to experience some moderate financial fortune (and you also happen to be black), you\u2019re marooned on a paradoxical terra firma where you\u2019re doing much better but somehow left feeling a bit worse. Where the \u201cbeep \u2026 beep\u201d still stirs you in a way it shouldn\u2019t.Maybe this is a good thing. It tethers you to reality and forces you to remain cognizant of how delicate success can be.Advertisement"}

We\u2019ll See in November", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Draper, who made his fortune investing in start-up companies, is proposing that the state of 40 million people be split into three entities with roughly the same populations. Northern California would comprise the upper part of the state, including Silicon Valley and San Francisco; Southern California would include a vast swath of the inland\u2019s verdant farmland, stretching to San Diego; a third state, simply called California, would hug the coastline from Monterey to Los Angeles.If Californians approve the controversial ballot measure, which academics and others say faces many obstacles, it would still need the blessing of the California Legislature and the United States Congress. Politicians, for one, may be wary of splitting up a state that has long voted Democrat.Vikram Amar, a professor and dean of the College of Law at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, said California\u2019s conservative-leaning inland empire (which would be part of the new Southern California) could swing Republican.\u201cThat is a risk Democrats in California and Washington, D.C., will be loath to run,\u201d he said.Californians have long debated whether they were better as a whole or in parts.On Tuesday, the California secretary of state\u2019s office certified that Mr. Draper, who submitted more than 600,000 signatures from voters, had garnered enough for the initiative to appear on the ballot.A breakup would be complex as the state\u2019s businesses and universities \u2014 even its water system \u2014 are interconnected and dependent on one another. Employees and entrepreneurs who split their time between Hollywood and Silicon Valley would essentially be working in two different places with their own tax structures.College students from Northern California who go to school in Los Angeles (and vice versa) would also be affected. \u201cNow they would be going to out-of-state schools and paying higher tuition,\u201d said Mr. Amar.And, of course, there is the psychological shift.While Californians in the northern and southern parts of the state have long perceived themselves as different from each other, they all identify with their home state.\u201cWho gets to be called the real Californian?\u201d said Mr. Amar, who grew up in Walnut Creek. \u201cEven though there is a rivalry, we are frenemies.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the boundaries of a prospective state that would hug the coast of California.

{"Headline": "Ethiopia\u2019s New Leader Raises Hopes. Now Comes the Hard Part.", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia \u2014 They call themselves a book club. Usually they meet one Saturday a month, men and women mostly in their 20s and 30s, to discuss a literary classic.At 41, Mr. Abiy is one of the youngest leaders in all of Africa, itself the continent with world\u2019s youngest population. And he is shaking up some of the old ways of doing things.Since taking office, Mr. Abiy has held town hall meetings around the country and listened to what people had to say. He has apologized for the killings of protesters by government forces and called for unity among the country\u2019s many ethnic groups.\u201cHe feels our pain,\u201d said one member of the book club, a university lecturer named Mekonnen Mengesha, 33. \u201cBecause he\u2019s our contemporary. We have a generation gap with the old leaders.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s refreshing,\u201d said Makda Getachew, 31, a public policy expert.Ethiopia is Africa\u2019s second most populous country after Nigeria. And even for Africa, it is astonishingly young. The median age of its 100 million people is 18.Satisfying their demands \u2014 both economic and political \u2014 will be Mr. Abiy\u2019s biggest test. Already, he has made some uncommon, politically savvy moves.It was classic Abiy: a big symbolic gesture but without specific steps toward the things that critics have agitated for such as opening up space for civil society activities or a national dialogue with opposition groups.\u201cPrime Minister Abiy is the kind of guy who is good at saying the right things to a domestic audience and giving the right gestures to international development partners,\u201d said Tamrat Giorgis, editor of Addis Fortune, an English language weekly paper.What he has yet to see, Mr. Giorgis said, is whether those words and gestures add up to a strategy of liberalization.Still, Mr. Abiy did make a number of bold moves this month.I went to Ethiopia in May for the first time in nearly 15 years. In some ways, it reminded me of India in the early 1990s, where I visited as a child, when the Indian government, also faced with a foreign currency crisis, cautiously began to open its economy to the world.Addis Ababa, the capital, is on the cusp of change. Where it\u2019s headed, however, is hard to tell.The population has galloped in recent years to more than three million inhabitants and the city resembles a construction site. Half-finished buildings are everywhere. The airport is being revamped with the help of Chinese investors. A new light rail network snakes across the city, though Addis is swathed in darkness for hours when the power goes out.Old Volkswagen Beetles share the streets with late-model Toyota sport utility vehicles. At a karaoke bar, Coolio and Rihanna share time with Oromia-language pop.Buying a new SIM card for a cellphone takes hours at the offices of the country\u2019s one provider \u2014 Ethio Telecom. Credit cards are rarely accepted in shops. And illegal movie downloads are common and \u201cguilt free,\u201d as one consumer of American movies put it, because there is no legal way to stream them.The announced sale of stakes in the country\u2019s two most valuable assets \u2014 Ethio Telecom and Ethiopian Airlines \u2014 could be a boon for foreign investors, not least the cash-flush Chinese who have nurtured close relations with the Ethiopian government.But privatization does not mean opening the floodgates to private competition \u2014 at least not yet. Mr. Giorgis, the Addis Fortune editor, described it as \u201ca desperate response made to the kind of macroeconomic challenge the country finds itself in today.\u201dIf the economy is the prime minister\u2019s most pressing challenge, the peace deal with Eritrea is the riskiest, said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa director for the International Crisis Group. That is because it could invite blowback against Mr. Abiy from the old guard of his party, which he has unseated.Beyond that, there is the broader risk of setting Ethiopians up for disappointment.\u201cHe has raised huge expectations through his bold policy pronouncements and, inadvertently perhaps, by his rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Abdi said. \u201cManaging them could prove daunting.\u201dMr. Abiy is also different from his predecessors by virtue of who he is. He is part Oromo, one of the country\u2019s largest ethnic groups. Its members have long complained of being marginalized.Mr. Abiy is no stranger to the Ethiopian establishment, though.A former military officer, he came up through the ranks of the political coalition that calls itself the Ethiopian People\u2019s Democratic Revolutionary Front and has a virtual monopoly on power. The party controls Parliament entirely, along with the justice system. It enjoys the backing of a powerful military. Civil and political rights are limited. Land is controlled by the government.Mr. Abiy represents the younger, more reformist wing of the party, though it has yet to carry out systematic political or economic reforms. He has not said anything about negotiating with opposition groups inside the country and abroad, for instance. And he has done little to assure ordinary citizens that their institutions \u2014 the police, the judiciary, the press \u2014 can be independent.\u201cIs it possible for him to deliver under this system?\u201d asked Mr. Mengesha, the university lecturer.Another member of the book club, Friat Weldekian, 25, praised the prime minister for what she called his emotional intelligence. \u201cHe touched on all our issues, especially what the young think,\u201d she said. She wasn\u2019t sure, however, whether he was doing so simply to quiet them down, like giving a pacifier to a baby.Ms. Weldekian used an old Amharic proverb that made the room burst into laughter. \u201cIs it like fooling chickens into thinking they\u2019re bulls?\u201d she asked.As they sipped tea and water and reviewed printouts of one of Mr. Abiy\u2019s speeches, several book club members observed that the new prime minister seems to steer clear of the stilted, anachronistic jargon of his predecessors.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t use those words,\u201d Ms. Getachew said. \u201cHe acknowledges, I think in a very genuine way, what people feel \u2014 the failures of the party, the failure of government. He really is an Ethiopian, very unity focused. That\u2019s also very new for us.\u201dI spoke to Ms. Getachew again after the book club meeting. She pointed out that the prime minister had yet to organize a national dialogue with the opposition. Nor had he proposed a road map for political reforms leading to the next elections.\u201cHe is raising a lot of expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the end of the day, he is still leading the country with the old party structure, the old government structure, the old laws.\u201dWhere their own story would go the members of the book club couldn\u2019t say. The protagonist of this story was turning out to be as complicated as the central figure in the last book they read: \u201cThe Prince,\u201d by Machiavelli.Hadra Ahmed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The public education system, perhaps. American high school students can recite Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets, derive advanced calculus theorems, and explain the Chinese spheres of influence. Yet these same students know little to nothing about economics and personal finance. They know of income tax only as the fifth square on the Monopoly board.Currently, only five states \u2014 Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia \u2014 require personal finance courses for high school students. The results speak for themselves: four of these states rank in the top 20 of best average credit card debt. This is a logical correlation. Learning about debt will help someone stay out of it. Yet economists continually blame consumerism and tactics of credit card companies rather than addressing the cause: a fundamental void in our education system.When students graduate high school, they are thrust into adulthood, whether they join the work force or pursue higher education. They assume immense financial responsibilities almost immediately. How can the government expect 19-year-olds to complete tax forms if they\u2019ve never learned about them in school? Young adults who lack basic knowledge of economics and personal finance are vulnerable to fraud, debt, commercialism and worse.In the 2012 New York Times article \u201cBack to Classroom for Skills not Taught in High School,\u201d Matthew R. Warren discusses a personal finance course in the Bronx where students learn vital information not taught in their high schools. Warren quotes 22-year-old student Regina Rice, \u201cI can\u2019t manage my money \u2026 Yesterday, I bought two pairs of headphones, and I don\u2019t even know why.\u201dIdeally, parents with lifelong experience would teach their children about personal finance. But, 61 percent of parents only discuss money when prompted by their children. The average American parent lacks the knowledge necessary to teach this information, as many of them live in severe debt themselves, including the 32 percent of U.S. households that carry credit card debt.The solution? A required course \u2014 Personal Finance and the Modern Economy \u2014 taught to second-semester high school seniors. It\u2019s vital that students learn basic information about taxes, insurance, mortgages, credit, loans, personal banking, consumerism and the stock market before they are forced to learn it the hard way.Financial literacy should not be a privilege reserved for children of the Wall Street elite. It is a skill that must be taught, just as vital in today\u2019s economy as reading, writing and arithmetic. So why do we keep treating it like an elective?Works Cited\u201cT.

{"Headline": "Hedge Funds Look to Profit From Personal-Injury Suits", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHedge funds and private-equity firms are deepening their involvement in big-ticket personal-injury lawsuits against drug companies and medical device manufacturers.Investment firms are lending money to law firms that bring so-called mass torts and providing cash advances to plaintiffs involved in such litigation. The activity is increasing just as prosecutors and lawmakers intensify their scrutiny of the industry.Earlier this year, EJF Capital, a $6 billion hedge fund, began raising money for its third investment vehicle that will lend money to lawyers bringing mass-tort cases, according to a February email to prospective investors. The new fund aims to raise $300 million on top of the nearly $450 million the Arlington, Va., hedge fund has already lent to personal injury law firms.EJF was an early mover in the business of financing mass tort litigation. Such loans can carry annual interest rates as high as 18 percent.The field is getting crowded. Wall Street firms and other investors have become go-to financiers for many of these cases, which feature large numbers of plaintiffs who have suffered similar injuries from a consumer product.Adam J. Levitt, an attorney in Chicago who has brought mass-tort cases, said there was an \u201cever-increasing influx of hedge funds into the litigation-funding space.\u201d One cause, he said, is their eagerness for investments that won\u2019t perform in lock step with stock markets or the overall economy.Hedge funds such as Fortress Investment Group, Pravati Capital and Virage Capital Management have lent money to mass-tort law firms in recent years, according to lawyers and lending executives.Marketing documents for EJF\u2019s new fund said the firm saw an opportunity to take advantage of the \u201ccurrent banking regulatory environment,\u201d which has led some banks to pull back from lending to mass-tort firms.Meanwhile, a slew of newer firms \u2014 including hedge funds and those affiliated with hedge funds \u2014 that specialize in lending to mass-tort lawyers are cropping up.Deer Finance, a small Manhattan firm with a board member who works for the hedge fund Fir Tree Partners, began focusing on such loans last year. An Arizona investment firm, Stillwell Madison, signed a financing agreement in 2016 with Girardi Keese, the Los Angeles mass-tort firm involved in the case that the movie \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d made famous.Some hedge funds are considering providing law firms with loans to buy large mass-tort cases from rival firms in order to bulk up their caseloads, according to a person involved in negotiating one such deal.Tom Girardi of Girardi Keese, one of the nation\u2019s most successful mass-tort lawyers, said funding from alternative lenders was necessary to battle companies with unlimited budgets. \u201cIf you are going to fight them, you better have the money to properly present these cases,\u201d he said.The litigation-finance business has been around for a long time, but until recently it was mostly focused on the financing of complex, long-term commercial litigation. The emphasis on bankrolling consumer suits is newer and potentially even more profitable for lenders.Analysts estimate that litigation finance is at least a $10 billion industry, and they expect it to keep growing.As the industry booms, state and federal authorities are beginning to look into a specialized corner that provides high-interest cash advances to litigants waiting for settlements or jury awards.Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn recently opened an investigation into a network of lawyers, finance firms and others that may have lured women into getting unnecessary surgery to remove pelvic mesh implants, according to people familiar with the matter. Removing the implants improved the chances that the women would win large legal settlements from medical device manufacturers.The people familiar with the nascent investigation, who were not authorized to speak publicly about it, said prosecutors had recently asked some lawyers involved in the litigation to hand over transcripts of depositions in which plaintiffs discussed how their mesh-removal surgery was paid for.A spokesman for Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney for Brooklyn, declined to comment.In New York, state lawmakers are trying to crack down on finance firms that offer cash advances to litigants, introducing legislation that would cap the interest rates. Critics say that the fine print of these deals is often incomprehensible and that the loans can leave plaintiffs with only a small fraction of the settlement money they thought they would receive.\u201cWe have turned our civil justice system into a profit center, and now the Wall Street sharks are circling,\u201d said Tom Stebbins, executive director of the Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York, which represents a number of industries. \u201cThey see litigation as a low-risk investment. They see this as a sure thing with so many cases settling.\u201dThe firms say they are serving a valuable role and helping litigants in need of short-term cash while their lawsuits spend years making their way through the legal system.Settlement advances help individuals \u201cmeet pressing financial needs and have the financial wherewithal to pursue cases against often-powerful interests,\u201d said Jim Terlizzi, chief executive of DRB Capital, a company that offers such advances and that is owned by Blackstone Group, the private-equity firm.The broader business of lending to mass-tort firms is also facing growing pressure.Last month, three Republican senators introduced a measure that would require attorneys in class actions and mass torts to disclose if a third party is financing their case.A federal judge in Cleveland overseeing hundreds of mass-tort cases against opioid makers last month ordered plaintiffs\u2019 law firms to disclose any financing they were getting from third parties.Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and investment firms argue that the money the firms provide makes it possible to pursue costly litigation against large companies. But some hedge funds impose higher interest rates if a case drags on too long.Elizabeth Burch, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, said she found that problematic because it \u201cencourages quick settlements that, at least in the mass-tort context, are unlikely to be in plaintiffs\u2019 best interests.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

A key part of the city\u2019s efforts is expanding its population of retirees, and it has adopted some unusual tactics \u2014 including subsidizing a few people to move there.Tallahassee\u2019s economy is fueled by state government as well as Florida State University, Florida A & M and a large community college. Some 66,000 students attend those institutions, but most are passing through.To better compete for baby boomers \u2014 and improve its chances against other college communities like Athens, Ga., or Tuscaloosa, Ala. \u2014 Choose Tallahassee ramped up last fall and expanded from an all-volunteer organization to one with a paid staff. It hired a part-time executive director. The group now has a budget of $150,000, three times its old budget, which comes from the city and county governments as well as banks, real estate firms and other companies.It rolled out a social media campaign in early May to promote some of the city\u2019s offerings, including the Tallahassee Senior Center, where $5 and $7 classes include American folk music, Florida geology and excursions to a wildlife refuge center.Using paid targeting, dedicated landing pages and the tagline \u201cThings Aren\u2019t the Same Since You Left,\u201d the ads are aimed at boomers who grew up in Tallahassee, went to college there or once worked there, said Gregg Patterson, Choose Tallahassee\u2019s executive director.Some ads will target \u201canchors,\u201d who are Tallahassee residents with parents living elsewhere, to \u201cshowcase the advantages of having your parents live there, such as free babysitting,\u201d said Amanda Handley of the public relations agency BowStern, which oversees the campaign.Parents who live elsewhere see only a message about the potential benefits typically provided by adult children, like free tech support and manual labor, she said. Each audience, anchor or boomer, will see only messages designed to appeal to it.\u201cNo one really wants to relocate to babysit,\u201d Ms. Handley said. \u201cSo the grandparents don\u2019t see that part of the message.\u201dChoose Tallahassee came up with the idea to pinpoint exactly who was interested in moving there. The campaign started trying to make Tallahassee better known nationally with a contest on Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets several years ago that offered a year\u2019s free housing and other perks to the winners. Glenn and Loujean Nelson of Chicago won in 2016. The couple, both retired teachers, had been set to move back to their hometown in Alabama when they heard about the contest.\u201cWe made a list of what we wanted in a retirement area, and Tallahassee had everything plus more, including college sports, which I love, along with plays and musicals and lifelong learning for people over 50,\u201d Mrs. Nelson said. In the semifinals, the couple submitted a brief video about why they wanted to move to Tallahassee, and later had a Skype interview with volunteer judges, who selected the winners.The four couples who were finalists received a free weeklong visit to Tallahassee, which included tickets to a Florida State football game. The Nelsons \u2014 she is 70, and he is 71 \u2014 received the housing money and other perks, like tickets to musical and other events. They applied $24,000 of their prize money to the down payment on a single-family home with a yard where they can entertain their eight grandchildren during visits, and moved in last year.And the city has begun to fix what some see as a serious drawback \u2014 a relatively sparse stock of retirement complexes that are common in established retirement locales. About 10 communities catering to those 50 and over who want amenities like swimming pools and golf courses are underway or planned in the area. One is operated by Brookdale Senior Living, which runs hundreds of communities around the country.After two contests that attracted retirees, Choose Tallahassee is skipping a third, at least for now, and instead focusing on helping residents persuade out-of-state relatives, friends and acquaintances to move to the city.One reason is that campaign organizers want to learn what attracts people to Tallahassee and improve outreach.\u201cOne of our earlier efforts was looking at the number of new driver\u2019s license applications from out-of-state residents who were 60 and over,\u201d Ms. Bono said. \u201cWe expected small numbers \u2014 it was up about one-third over the five years ending in 2016 \u2014 but we wanted a more precise way to track who the campaign is reaching.\u201dCathy and Bill Campbell moved to the area from New Hampshire in 2015, a year after they won the first Choose Tallahassee contest. Their advice to the city: Attract more multigenerational families.\u201cOur daughter and grandson moved here, too, and our daughter set up a business,\u201d said Cathy Campbell, 69, a retired graphic designer, whose husband was a meteorologist.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s a capital city, people don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s a quiet place that is family friendly,\u201d she said. \u201cMore and more people our age who are thinking about relocating end up moving closer to their kids.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wrap Your Mind Around a Whale", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Pyenson is a paleobiologist who studies marine mammals.The facts of a blue whale seem improbable; it is hard to wrap your mind around an animal with jaws the height of a football goal post. Those jaws are not just the ocean\u2019s utmost bones (to borrow from Melville) but the utmost bones in the history of life on Earth.We are living right now in the age of giants. Blue whales, fin whales, right whales and bowhead whales are the largest animals, by weight, ever to have evolved. How did this happen? And what does this tell us about how evolution works?If you were somehow able to return to an ancient shoreline and happened upon the entire assemblage of early whales, you wouldn\u2019t be able to guess which four-legged creature would beget the whales we know. In their own times and habitats, each was as well adapted as any sea lion or otter living today. But it was the whales that completely severed their ties to land that eventually won the evolutionary sweepstakes.This brings up a theoretical question: Can whales continue to get bigger?A lot about an animal\u2019s biology \u2014 how quickly its heart races, how many young it produces, how long it lives \u2014 can be predicted from its size alone, whether it is enormous or microscopic. The mathematics that describes how biology changes across these scales is called allometry (the same math is used to explain economies and traffic jams). Applying allometry to the study of whales is the key to understanding not just what it takes to be a giant, but also the limits of living things on Earth.There are disadvantages to being enormous. The largest whales are so big and thick with blubber that overheating in warmer waters is a risk.Whale lungs are so large and specialized that they present their own quandaries. They must be able to collapse quickly enough to avoid rupturing when the whales dive deep (as some toothed whales do), but also to reinflate rapidly at the surface after two hours underwater. Blue whales don\u2019t dive anywhere close to the depths you\u2019d expect for their body size. In part it\u2019s because their prey live near the light, but it also seems that it takes too much energy to breathe all the oxygen necessary for a deeper plunge.In other words, the largest whales ever measured, at 109 feet, are theoretically the largest whales that can exist.Human hands have imperiled other cetaceans. Not a whistle or splash of the Yangtze River dolphin has been recorded since the first decade of the 21st century. Responsibility for the extinction of this species can be placed squarely on our shoulders: We dammed the only river in which it lived. Other species such as the vaquita, a small porpoise that has never been spotted outside the Gulf of California, remain on the extinction watch list; there are only one or two dozen left.The news isn\u2019t all dire: Some whale species, such as humpbacks, have rebounded from the brink; gray whales, icons of the West Coast, are even expanding to new habitats as climate and oceans change.Their size can also be a liability if the environment changes rapidly, which we know is happening now, thanks to the behavior of our own species. Features of past whale worlds, such as sea-level rise and the acidification of ocean water, will return in the near future as a result of widespread burning of fossil fuels driving climate change.How successfully whales and humans can share this evolutionary moment is a high-stakes story that\u2019s still being written. The more we learn about these giants that can live more than twice as long as we do, and whose migrations take them across entire oceans, the better their chances of survival on Earth in the age of humans.I think we have reason to hope that these largest creatures on the planet will continue to awe us for centuries to come, living, as they do, on the knife-edge between perfect and perilous adaptation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Canal Through Turkey? Presidential Vote Is a Test of Erdogan\u2019s Building Spree", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 From soaring bridges to a giant mosque to plans for the world\u2019s biggest airport, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has used gargantuan building projects as an engine of growth and a signature way of leaving an indelible stamp on his nation.As he campaigns for re-election on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan has promised his most ambitious project yet: a canal that would bisect the country and create a Turkish-owned trade route, which he says would make Turkey a great power and leave a legacy for the history books.\u201cWhat makes Panama is the Panama Canal,\u201d Mr. Erdogan told supporters at a rally in Istanbul last weekend. \u201cSuez is the biggest source of revenue for Egypt. Let\u2019s have a vote. God willing the Istanbul Canal will be another fresh breath for our city.\u201dThe election is shaping up as an up-or-down vote on how Mr. Erdogan has transformed Turkey during 15 years in charge. He has amassed sultanlike powers, jailed political enemies and trimmed civil liberties, even as average annual economic growth of 5 percent has spawned and nurtured a middle class.But the most obvious way Mr. Erdogan has left his mark stands before the eyes of any visitor: grandiose monuments and infrastructure investments in just about every town.There are signs that the public is weary of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s building mania. The canal is the latest dividing line between those who see Mr. Erdogan\u2019s projects as visionary, and those who say the works are guided by an insatiable construction industry that has enriched his ruling circle, raising questions about his management of a faltering economy.He lists his big canal project in first place on his campaign posters. Not one shovel has been put in the ground, but Mr. Erdogan has vowed to begin construction immediately if he is re-elected as president and assumes sweeping new powers.All of his megaprojects have been about creating symbols of his strength as he aims for a place in the pantheon of great Turkish leaders, from the Ottoman sultans to the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.But the 28-mile canal linking the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara \u2014 estimated to cost $15 billion, though critics say the figure is closer to $65 billion, and displace some 800,000 people \u2014 has been dubbed his \u201ccrazy idea\u201d since Mr. Erdogan first conceived it seven years ago.\u201cIt means crazy, wow, in a good sense,\u201d said Mehmet Akarca, head of Turkey\u2019s general directorate for press and information and an adviser to the president. \u201cIt will make money, and ships will use it, and they will pay tolls to use it.\u201dThat is the hope, at least, though many doubt whether it will ever happen \u2014 or whether it will work if it does.Environmentalists warn that the canal would damage the ecosystem so much that Istanbul could become uninhabitable. Archaeologists caution that it would threaten a top-class Paleolithic site. Economists say the project is not financially viable.\u201cIt\u2019s like playing Moses,\u201d said Serkan Taycan, an artist and opponent of the canal who has mapped the area that would be disturbed.\u201cOne aspect of the big projects is that they are generating growth,\u201d Mr. Unluhisarcikli said.But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s opponents say his economic model is dubious, even corrupt.Abdullatif Sener, a former deputy prime minister, has alleged that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s way of governing is all about the profit that the president and his close circle can gain in kickbacks.Mr. Sener was a co-founder of the Justice and Development Party, as was Mr. Erdogan, but he resigned from the party in 2008 because of corruption, he says, and is now running for Parliament with the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party.\u201cThey don\u2019t think about the concerns of the citizens,\u201d Mr. Sener said of the government at a campaign rally in Aziziye, in central Turkey. \u201cThey think about \u2018How can I make my friend, my family, my close circle, my buddy richer.\u2019 With this mentality, this country could not escape disaster.\u201dMr. Erdogan has accused his opponents of peddling lies. \u201cWe invested billions in Istanbul, and now they say we robbed the country?\u201d he said last week at a rally in Istanbul. Others criticize Mr. Erdogan for prioritizing construction over industry and trade, which would generate more income.\u201cWe are not using the resources in the best way to earn money,\u201d Durmus Yilmaz, a former chief of the Turkish central bank and a co-founder of a new opposition party, the Good Party, said in an interview at his home in Ankara.\u201cThis is all financed through foreign borrowing,\u201d he said. \u201cAre these investments generating enough income so we can pay back the loans?\u201dTurkish industry has shrunk since 2002, when Mr. Erdogan first came to power \u2014 to 16 percent of gross domestic product from 22 percent \u2014 and the construction sector has grown in its place.The decline has left new ports and tunnels underutilized and Turkey lacking enough exports to finance its ballooning foreign debt, Mr. Yilmaz said.Then there are the extravagant projects \u2014 such as the presidential palace, four times the size of Versailles \u2014 that seem to be more about Mr. Erdogan\u2019s legacy than profitability.On Istanbul\u2019s highest hill above the Bosporus, Mr. Erdogan is building the white marble Camlica mosque, appointing it with six minarets, the insignia of greatness.Many wonder if he plans to build a mausoleum for himself beside his project, as did the sultans of old.\u201cSome are white elephants, that\u2019s very clear,\u201d said Refet Gurkaynak, a professor of economics at Bilkent University in Ankara.The government has said that growth has been more than 7 percent in the last two quarters, but the economy is already stumbling, Mr. Gurkaynak said.\u201cWe are in recession,\u201d he said, and \u201cwe are going to have a painful recession.\u201dHousing construction has reached its limit, and two million apartments are unsold in the country. Construction work is grinding to a halt, and companies are offering real estate on soft loans or barter.In such a climate, Mr. Gurkaynak said, \u201cCanal Istanbul makes no sense whatsoever and will be impossible to finance.\u201d It does not help that the proposed canal route would run parallel to the Bosporus, where transit is free under the 1936 Montreux Convention.Officials insist there will be enough traffic to make the canal profitable. But Mr. Gurkaynak and others argue that shippers would be unlikely to pay when there is a free passage a few miles away.New oil and gas pipelines are already reducing tanker traffic through the straits, according to a report by Istanbul\u2019s Chamber of Environmental Engineers.The looming pitfalls are familiar. Two of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s much vaunted bridges \u2014 the Osman Gazi Bridge over the Gulf of Izmit, and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, which spans the Bosporus \u2014 have little traffic partly because of the high tolls charged. The government is paying the shortfall.Mr. Akarca, the presidential adviser, defended the projects\u2019 financing system, which has been mostly a variety of public-private partnerships.\u201cTurkey actually is not borrowing any money,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the Turkish firms that are borrowing money; it is individual debt.\u201dBut the government has guaranteed the loans and the revenue, so some economists have said that the financing model is enriching private firms while saddling the country with debt.Other resistance to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s building spree is centered on the environment and conservation.To the horror of archaeologists, Mr. Erdogan started the $4 billion Marmaray railway project beneath Istanbul\u2019s historic peninsula, and built a highway along the Byzantine city walls of a World Heritage site, over Unesco protests.The protests, which left eight people dead and hundreds more injured, drew many citizens to oppose Mr. Erdogan\u2019s headlong drive to modernize Turkey\u2019s cities.Yet instead of listening to them, Mr. Erdogan doubled down on his projects. Taksim became a symbol of his determination to impose his will.\u201cHe needed opponents and victories and symbols,\u201d said Mucella Yapici, an activist and a member of Istanbul\u2019s Chamber of Architects. \u201cTaksim is the most important.\u201dLast month, Istanbul\u2019s cultural center, an emblem of Ataturk\u2019s openness to the West, was pulled down at the site, and a vast domed mosque raised opposite it, dwarfing Ataturk\u2019s statue and robbing the square of its republican nature.\u201cThis is an attempt to erase the collective memory of the space,\u201d Ms. Yapici said.Much more stands to be erased in the canal project \u2014 entire towns and villages, as well as the ecology of Istanbul\u2019s main water source.The greatest concern is the potentially huge inflow of nutrient-rich water from the Black Sea, which scientists say would encourage the growth of algae and kill life in Sea of Marmara.The Bosporus is so deep that it allows a countercurrent. The canal would have no such balancing effect.One scientist has warned that Istanbul will come to stink of bad eggs from hydrogen sulfide. Other environmentalists warn that the vital wetlands used by migratory birds will be destroyed.The government held a single meeting in March with landowners to introduce an environmental impact assessment. It claimed the canal would have negligible effect.Istanbul\u2019s Chamber of Environmental Engineers produced its own assessment, warning that the canal project \u2014 which includes plans for a new city for as many as three million people \u2014 would cause irreversible harm.\u201cIn the long run we will lose the Sea of Marmara and do damage to the Black Sea,\u201d said Sedat Durel, an environmental engineer who worked on the report.Mr. Durel estimated that as many as 800,000 people would be displaced.They include several thousand Crimean Tatars, refugees from the Crimean War who settled in the Sazlidere Valley west of Istanbul 150 years ago, after being granted the land by the sultan of the Ottoman Empire.Their descendants, mostly farmers and factory workers, are anticipating with some dread any official orders to be uprooted again.\u201cOf course the canal is important,\u201d said Oktay Teke, the mayor of Sazlibosna, a village amid meadows beside the river. \u201cBut what about all these villages? What will happen?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Selling MetroCard Swipes Remains Illegal, and a Way of Life", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll day long, stolen supply meets demand at the 125th Street subway station in East Harlem.The underground MetroCard economy is a dance of hand gestures, knowing looks and expressions of gratitude, as riders buy illicit $2 swipes from opportunistic sellers.The hustle, which is about as old as the MetroCard, is a measure of the pressures on New Yorkers to make a dollar or save a dollar amid deepening income inequality and fare increases that have far outpaced inflation.\u201cIt appears to be stop and frisk under the guise of a MetroCard,\u201d Ms. James said.The criminal charge for swiping is generally unauthorized sale of certain transportation, a class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum three-month jail sentence. But when swipers bend the cards to crease the magnetic strip in a way that creates a free ride even on a card with a zero balance, they face forgery charges that can carry yearslong sentences.Though swiping happens all over the city, Ms. James\u2019s office analyzed 10 years of arrests through 2016 and found that nearly 20 percent, 638 of the 3,300 arrests, occurred at the 125th station where the 4, 5, and 6 trains run. Another station in East Harlem, one stop away at 116th Street, and two stations in the Bronx are among the top seven swiping arrest sites. By comparison, the Times Square station that serves the 1, 2, 3, N, R and Q trains had just one arrest in those 10 years, according to the analysis.The Police Department could not confirm the public advocate\u2019s analysis because before 2010, swipers were charged with petit larceny, not unlawful sale of transportation services, said Phillip Walzak, a spokesman for the Police Department. But Mr. Walzak said the same seven stations that Ms. James identified are currently the top arrest sites.He said the Police Department is \u201czeroing in\u201d on frequent offenders in stations where there are fewer patrolling police officers, cameras and MetroCard machines.The Police Department did its own analysis of 2015 through 2017, and 86 people had an average of 22 arrests each, Mr. Walzak said.The police say swipers sometimes break the machines to force people to buy rides from them.The transit agency spent about $26.5 million to repair MetroCard vending machines in 2017, and 47 percent of the machines vandalized were in Manhattan, according to data provided by the M.T.A.The M.T.A. did not have a current estimate of money lost to fraudulent swipes, but Mr. Walzak said stolen swipes contribute to tens of millions of dollars lost by the M.T.A. to fare-beating crimes.\u201cThis is a sophisticated crime perpetrated by offenders who have professionalized the scam, and know which stations increase their best chances of success,\u201d he said in a statement.Swipers view their arrests as aggressive enforcement against mostly black and Hispanic men who are offering a discounted rate that the M.T.A. does not, said Patrick Byer, a longtime swiper who said he has \u201cretired\u201d from the practice.\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t charge so much,\u201d he said of the M.T.A., adding that he frequently gave commuters free rides at the end of what he called his \u201cshifts.\u201dIt\u2019s a justification that plays out at the 125th Street station, located in a census tract where Hispanic people make up about 47 percent of the population and black people make up about 31 percent. About 39 percent of residents in the census zone live below the poverty level and 77 percent of residents report using public transportation.Late last month in the 125th Street station, Faith Blake, 24, handed her $2 to a swiper and headed down the steps to take a train to the Bronx. She did not hesitate or even remove her earphones as she made the exchange for a single-ride card that would have otherwise cost her $3. \u201cI was in a rush. I didn\u2019t feel like standing in line, and I only needed a single ride,\u201d Ms. Blake said.There are several ways to sell illegal swipes, according to swipers: Pick up discarded cards with remaining balances; buy an unlimited card for $121 and sell individual trips; or manipulate spent cards by bending them along the magnetic strip. It is not illegal to buy a swipe, Mr. Walzak said. It is also not illegal to give away a swipe from an unlimited card.But for the sellers, the risk is high.On a recent Thursday afternoon, a half-dozen swipers swapped stories about running through stations to avoid arrests. But, they said, everyone eventually gets arrested.Asked how many times he had been arrested, a 35-year-old man, who said he dominates swipe sales in the 125th Street station, let out a breath and guessed, \u201c40?\u201d\u201cI do this to support myself,\u201d said the man who lives in a shelter and asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in criminal activity.For three hours, the man served his regulars and also talked to strangers, hoping to increase his client base. Often, he said nothing, putting up two fingers, nodding and following customers to the turnstile. Some regulars told him they could afford to pay full price that day but would be back when they could not.Shortly after 3 p.m., the man and a young woman looked like a couple saying goodbye at the turnstile. He slid the MetroCard along the reader, she stepped through and then dug into her purse for two $1 bills that she folded and placed in his palm.At one point, he stopped a woman who works for a human resources company and handed her his resume. \u201cI\u2019m tired of getting arrested,\u201d he said.Mr. Byer, the 42-year-old who said he has retired from swiping, arrived at the station after work at his job as a laborer for a construction company.He said he had served several jail sentences for swipe-related charges and was last released in August 2017.Among the swipers, Mr. Byer had earned the nickname \u201cAce Swipe.\u201dHe said he began swiping in 2003 when he lost his fare to a malfunctioning machine as he was trying to reload a card while running late for his first day on a job. He bent the card as friends had instructed. \u201cIt worked. After that day, I collected a whole bunch of MetroCards,\u201d he said.Drug addiction then took his life off track, he said.Swiping helped him stay afloat. On a good day, Mr. Byer said, he could make more than $350, helping him when he was homeless and sleeping on the train or in a park. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy way to get money without selling drugs or robbing people,\u201d he said.At the 125th Street station, swipers greeted Mr. Byer with congratulatory handshakes and hugs. He was wearing a hard hat. His jeans and work boots were covered in paint. \u201cMy swiping days are over,\u201d said Mr. Byer, who now lives with his girlfriend in an apartment in the Bronx. He said he did not want to risk his new job and home for swiping.\u201cAfter I got my first paycheck, I said, \u2018No.\u2019 One swipe? It\u2019s enough to kill everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump May Soften Sweeping Plan to Restrict Chinese Investments", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump signaled on Tuesday that the White House may soften a plan to impose sweeping new investment restrictions on China, saying he supported giving more power to an existing government body that reviews foreign investments for national security threats.No final decisions have been made and Mr. Trump could ultimately decide to move ahead with the type of tough bans on Chinese investment in American companies that he has been threatening as part of his crackdown on Beijing\u2019s trade practices. The administration, which has already threatened China with tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of its products, had promised to outline by Saturday proposed restrictions on Chinese investment to protect American companies it says were pressured to hand over valuable technology and trade secrets to operate in China.The White House is still expected to unveil by Saturday restrictions on exporting sensitive American technologies abroad. That could have a more significant effect on United States companies than restrictions on Chinese investment, since it would limit the ability of American companies to sell a range of products to China. The White House has targeted specific products that it wants to prevent China from dominating, including robotics, artificial intelligence and new energy vehicles.But people familiar with the discussions said that, at least on the issue of Chinese investment, the White House was now leaning toward endorsing a current effort in Congress to expand the authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, which reviews investments for security threats.\u201cWe have the great scientists, we have the great brains,\u201d the president said Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect it. And that\u2019s what we were doing. And that can be done through Cfius. We have a lot of things we can do it through. And we\u2019re working that out.\u201dIn a statement on Wednesday, China\u2019s commerce ministry said that officials \u201care playing close attention to it and will assess the potential impact on Chinese companies.\u201dThe congressional overhaul to Cfius would include a list of \u201ccountries of special concern\u201d that allow it to review investments from those nations, but stops short of specifically naming China as the target.Such an outcome would be a victory for Mr. Trump\u2019s more moderate economic advisers, including Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who has tried to use his clout with the president to de-escalate trade tensions with China. Mr. Mnuchin has argued internally that congressional efforts to strengthen current security checks were both sufficient to guard against threats to American technology and targeted enough to avoid disrupting the American economy.Mr. Trump, who campaigned on punishing China over its trade practices, has been pushed by his hard-line trade advisers, Peter Navarro and Robert E. Lighthizer, to embrace more aggressive measures.That has frustrated Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive, who has counseled Mr. Trump against pursuing restrictions that would target China specifically, warning that could create unnecessary diplomatic and legal complications, according to people familiar with the discussions.Congress is expected to vote on the legislation as part of a defense-spending bill this year. On Tuesday, the House passed its version of the bill, which would grant Cfius broader authority to block investments over national security concerns.Mr. Mnuchin has privately expressed frustration that other members of the administration\u2019s economic team were trying to box him in to taking a more hawkish approach to China, and he has expressed concern to the president that such an approach, combined with the escalating tariffs, could dampen the economy and disturb financial markets.The president appeared to endorse Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s statement on Tuesday, saying that \u201cit\u2019s not just the Chinese.\u201dThe tariffs, investment restrictions and export controls are all part of the administration\u2019s plans to combat what it describes as intellectual property theft from China and slow the country\u2019s efforts at dominating cutting-edge technologies that will be critical to future economic growth, an industrial plan known as Made in China 2025.The White House had previously said that it would release details on investment restrictions and export controls before Saturday, and put the measures into place days after that deadline.Some lawmakers have also been looking for ways to curb Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist tendencies, which go against the Republican Party\u2019s embrace of free trade. On Tuesday, some senators tried to restart an effort to force a floor vote on legislation that would require the president to seek congressional approval before imposing tariffs over national security concerns.A bipartisan effort to add such language to a defense policy bill this month was derailed by Senate Republican leaders, who raised procedural concerns. This time around, however, it appeared more likely that the senators, led by Bob Corker of Tennessee, would secure a vote through an amendment to the farm bill under consideration by the Senate this week.Maggie Haberman and Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade Skirmish or War? Who Gets Hurt? ", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnswers to questions about the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on China and beyond. In the first year of the Trump administration, the president\u2019s threats to upend the global trade system seemed like mostly bluster \u2014 lots of threats, not much action.Not anymore.All of which prompts some important questions: Is the United States engaged in what should be classified as a trade war? And what are the economic consequences likely to be?Definitely maybe.A \u201ctrade war\u201d refers to measures and countermeasures on import restriction that escalate over time, causing trade between two countries to break down.But there is no specific definition. Everyone would agree that the Depression-era period of escalating tariffs was a trade war. Everyone would agree that, say, George W. Bush\u2019s 2002 steel tariffs and the retaliation by Europe was not. But the exact line between trade skirmish and trade war is subjective. \u201cYes, we are now in a trade war,\u201d said Mary Lovely, an economist at Syracuse who studies trade. She emphasizes two factors. First, the Trump administration is signaling that it will meet Chinese retaliation with further retaliation, and second, \u201cthe two sides are no longer engaged in productive talks to defuse tensions.\u201dChad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, is more cautious. Is this a trade war? \u201cIn my view not yet,\u201d he said. \u201cMy view of a trade war is when all countries start responding unilaterally, and without respect to international rules in terms of the levels of tariff retaliation that they engage in.\u201dSo far, China, the European Union and other trading partners have responded within the confines of World Trade Organization rules.For many years, American companies have complained of being treated shabbily as they try to do business in China. They often must partner with Chinese companies to be allowed to do business in the country, and frequently complain that their most advanced technologies are being stolen, among other concerns.The Trump administration\u2019s list of goods to be subjected to the tariffs is aimed at these high-tech sectors, including aerospace, telecommunications equipment and robotics.China has said it will place tariffs on $50 billion worth of American imports in retaliation. That\u2019s where things get interesting. The Trump administration is threatening to escalate things further if China retaliates, pulling another $100 billion of goods into the mix. This increases the possibility that the dispute will spiral to encompass ever larger swaths of goods.China views development of its high-tech industries as core to its economic strategy of the future and won\u2019t want to give up advantages in those sectors lightly. On the other hand, the substantial U.S. trade deficit with China means the American side has more potential Chinese imports on which to slap punitive tariffs than the Chinese do, a potential source of leverage.The Trump administration\u2019s negotiating strategy has been erratic. At one point last month, there seemed to be progress toward an accord in which China would buy more American agriculture and energy products. That would have helped reduce the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China, one of the president\u2019s major goals. But it wouldn\u2019t have done much of anything about the longer-term issues around technology theft, and those talks fell apart.The United States might have a stronger negotiating position if it were joined by allies like Canada, Japan and the European Union. But given the steel and aluminum tariffs and tensions with Canada, the United States finds itself on its own in talks with China.Probably not.The United States has gross domestic product of nearly $20 trillion, so a new tax on $50 billion (or, eventually, $150 billion or more) of Chinese imports is a rounding error. Even when you count the costs of steel and aluminum and other tariffs that have resulted from the president\u2019s aggressive trade, it\u2019s hard to get to numbers that move the dial much on overall growth.As countries retaliate, they can certainly cause damage for individual American industries that export, but the reality is most of the economic activity in the United States is for domestic consumption. Exports constitute about 12 percent of G.D.P.That\u2019s not to play down the potentially heavy damage in the industries caught in the middle. Soybean futures prices fell Friday, as commodities traders predicted China would buy fewer soybeans in retaliation. Some major industries that use steel and aluminum are complaining of sharply higher prices, which in turn makes them less competitive against global competitors.\u201cThe questions are does this escalate from here, is this part of a much bigger process, and how do business confidence and financial markets respond?\u201d said Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura. \u201cWith these relatively modest first-round things, it\u2019s hard to make the case that it\u2019s material\u201d to the overall economy.The initial tariffs on Chinese goods are not focused on consumer products. They are to be levied on products mainly purchased by businesses, such as industrial equipment. That could mean upward pressure on inflation eventually, but in subtle ways.Even if the dispute spreads to consumer goods, the actual amount American consumers will pay depends on many factors, including the availability of domestic substitutes and the competitiveness of the industry. For any given product, it is hard to predict how much of a 25 percent tariff will be passed through to consumers versus absorbed by producers and retailers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Charts That Show How Big Business Is Winning", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAll of these companies have decided that their best strategy for raising profits involves getting bigger. Larger companies simply have more power \u2014 to compete with other giants, to restrain workers\u2019 pay, to influence government policy and, in the long run, to increase prices.It\u2019s true beyond the media industry, too. Airlines, banks and oil companies have merged in recent decades. So have retailers, hospitals, hotels, manufacturers, drug companies and law firms. The resulting behemoths have then taken advantage of their newfound scale, as well as globalization and digital technology, to grow further.So I set out to create one, with help from an obscure Census Bureau data set known as Business Dynamics Statistics. It shows how many American workers are employed by different-size companies, now and in the past.The changes over the past quarter-century are pretty remarkable.In the late 1980s, small companies were still a lot bigger, combined, than big companies. In 1989, firms with fewer than 50 workers employed about one-third of American workers \u2014 accounting for millions more jobs than companies with at least 10,000 employees.Since then, though, many small businesses have struggled to keep up with the new corporate giants and with foreign competition. You can probably see a version of the story in your community. The hardware store has given way to The Home Depot. The local hospital and bank are owned by a chain. The supermarket is Whole Foods, which is now owned by Amazon. The family-owned manufacturer may simply be out of business.The share of Americans working for small companies fell to 27.4 percent in 2014, the most recent year for which data exists, down from 32.4 in 1989. And big companies have grown by almost an identical amount. Today, companies with at least 10,000 workers employ more people than companies with fewer than 50 workers.\u201cThis has been a blind spot for the last 20, 30 years,\u201d Ro Khanna, a Democratic member of Congress who represents Silicon Valley, told me. \u201cOne of the things that people are rebelling against in this country is large, growing institutions.

{"Headline": "Betting on Crisis, Hedge Funds Short Italian Bonds", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive Star politicians, including the group\u2019s founder and current leader, pondered such radical cures to Italy\u2019s economic woes as restructuring its enormous debt and establishing a currency in addition to the euro.\u201cIt was clear to me then that these guys wanted to renegotiate the status quo in Europe,\u201d said Mr. Ondruch, the founder of Astellon Capital Partners, an investment manager based in London. In the months after the conference, he increased his bet that the prices of Italian bonds would fall sharply. \u201cI am surprised it took the markets so long to wake up to this,\u201d he said.The prices of Italian stocks and bonds plunged, and yields on short-term bonds rocketed to 2.7 percent from 0.24 percent. The euro\u2019s value relative to the dollar fell to an 11-month low.For hedge funds that were wagering on a new Italian debt crisis, the market turmoil was a profit bonanza. And they are betting there is more to come.Hedge funds have been building up their short positions for months, betting that Italian bonds will face another bout of selling pressure once investors recognize that the new government might consider taboo topics such as adopting a currency other than the euro and restructuring Italy\u2019s debt.Call it the return of the bond vigilantes \u2014 a term for investors who sell the bonds of governments when they run big deficits and appear to have unsustainable debt burdens.From 2010 to 2012, a parade of investors, deeply skeptical about the eurozone\u2019s ability to hold together, wagered that the bonds of debt-plagued countries like Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain would keep falling. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy as pension funds, mutual funds and banks sold these suddenly risky securities.The Continentwide fire sale was halted only when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, put in place an aggressive program to buy the bonds, which made their prices soar and their interest rates fall.Now, as the E.C.B.\u2019s bond-purchasing program draws to a close, the same strains that prompted the earlier bout of selling \u2014 weaker countries running up potentially unsustainable debts \u2014 are showing again.In Italy, for example, the new government is promising an aggressive spending program to spur the country\u2019s stagnant economy. The populists are not deterred by the fiscal restraints imposed on eurozone countries by Brussels.\u201cThese people feel very strongly that deficit limits make no sense,\u201d said Jens Nordvig, the founder of Exante Data, a financial research firm that provides trading ideas to hedge funds.Many large investors, he said, now \u201chave a short bias\u201d toward Italy, believing that a clash between Rome and Brussels over eurozone rules and regulations could lead to a sell-off. If Italy flouts European deficit restrictions, for example, investors and large banks are likely to sell the government\u2019s bonds, fearing deep losses.Mr. Nordvig said that a robust market for futures contracts tied to Italian government bonds had made it easy to bet against Italy. Futures contracts oblige an investor to buy or sell an asset at a specified date in the future. The popularity of the futures market in Italian bonds means it is simpler and cheaper than before to place speculative bets about coming price swings.According to Eurex, Europe\u2019s main exchange for trading derivatives, volume in short-term Italian bond futures was up 33 percent through April of this year compared with the same period in 2017.In addition to betting against bonds, many prominent hedge funds are calculating that the share prices of large Italian companies will fall drastically.For example, Bridgewater, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, has a number of short positions on Italian financial institutions, including UniCredit, Italy\u2019s biggest bank, according to data from Consob, Italy\u2019s financial regulator. Other funds betting against Italian companies include Steven Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management, Marshall Wace in London and the quantitative specialist AQR Capital Management. Bridgewater, Point72 and Marshall Wace declined to comment.Mr. Ondruch\u2019s Italian trade has been one of his most profitable positions this year. He has since pared his bet, pocketing the profit, but expects to make a similar wager soon.\u201cWhat we have had so far is a political event, not a credit event,\u201d he said, referring to the point when a country runs out of money. \u201cThe endgame is still 12 to 24 months out.\u201dWhat has spooked investors the most has been the Italian ruling party\u2019s flirtation with a second currency. Since the dire days of the Greek crisis, economists and bankers have floated the idea of another currency for highly indebted eurozone countries. Strapped Greek and Italian citizens could use this alternate currency to pay taxes and for things like gasoline or health care from the state.Such proposals have been opposed by officials in Brussels as a first step to abandoning the euro.The topic was taken up with gusto at the Five Star conference last year.\u201cIt was scary \u2014 it looked to me like a Plan B to get out of the euro,\u201d said Massimo Bonansinga, a portfolio manager for CI Investments, a fund management firm based in Toronto.But unlike many of his peers, Mr. Bonansinga took the view that more moderate minds would prevail and that an Italian government would not take such drastic steps.Accordingly, he has stuck by his investments in Italian stocks.\u201cItaly is a conservative country,\u201d Mr. Bonansinga said. \u201cI am just not sure that people want to leave the euro.\u201dAdvertisement"}

People are not arguing about whether he will win, but about the size of his victory.After 18 years of trying, and trying again, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, widely known as AMLO, may have a historic opportunity. He has said that his presidency will signal the start of Mexico\u2019s fourth revolution, following independence from Spain in the early 19th century, the liberal reforms later that century, and the Mexican Revolution in the early 20th century.Many Mexicans sincerely want to see change, believing that the country cannot endure more inequality, corruption and violence. But they also have serious reservations about his posturing and his dubious alliances, and wonder if he has what it takes to grasp the complexity of Mexico\u2019s biggest issues.The fears that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, in lacking a political counterweight, may become too powerful are well founded. But his diagnosis of what Mexico needs \u2014 a stronger domestic economy and an end to corruption \u2014 and his strategy to deal with violence, including a vast program to support the young people who have been caught up in the in the war against drugs, are on target.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador eventually rose to the head of the P.R.D., and under his leadership the party secured several governorships and seats in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies.By 2003 he had become one of Mexico\u2019s most popular politicians, with approval ratings close to 80 percent. In 2006, his presidential bid was as obvious as it was unstoppable.In terms of style, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador stands out against the more technocratic candidates, like Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, of the center-left P.R.I., and Ricardo Anaya Cort\u00e9s, of the conservative P.A.N. His message resonates with all kind of voters: the working class, and also young, highly-educated Mexicans.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador champions certain traditional leftist values: a concern for inequality and poverty and the belief that government should be a key player in the economy. He is a Christian who is not particularly concerned about gender politics, reproductive rights or sexual minorities, and a nationalist who is skeptical of political and economic formulas imposed from abroad. He has firmly stated his belief that the answers to Mexico\u2019s problems lie in Mexico\u2019s history, rhetoric that makes him something of a myth-weaver. Like most populists, he frequently invokes his connection to the Mexican people.This is his third run for the presidency. In 2006, he also led the polls, but in addition to making his own mistakes, his opponents framed him as a dangerous candidate, comparing him to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the late Venezuelan president. The trick worked and when Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador lost by a tiny margin, he refused to accept the result and accused the political and economic elite of rigging the election.For several weeks, he led protests that paralyzed Mexico City as he proclaimed himself to be Mexico\u2019s rightful president. This gamble cost him a significant amount of political capital, with many Mexicans regarding him as self-serving and disrespectful of the democratic process.In 2012, following his defeat by Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the photogenic P.R.I candidate, he left the P.R.D. to form the National Regeneration Movement, known as Morena. In less than three years, Morena has emerged as a viable alternative to the entrenched P.R.I. and P.A.N. parties.With a fierice persistence, he has forged yet another path to the presidency.To broaden his political reach, this time around Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has allied himself with a range of political players: corrupt union leaders and representatives of the far right.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s campaign has also been helped along by the current government\u2019s dismal approval ratings. Fed up with corruption, the slumping economy and the surge in violent crime during Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s six-year term, many Mexicans tend to view Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador as the only alternative for real change.In the quest to win over Mexico\u2019s business sector, AMLO has positioned himself as a political moderate. In an effort to assure they will not fall into the kind of deep debt that plagues so many leftist governments in Latin America, his advisers promise sound fiscal policy, to control foreign debt (which ballooned in 2017), and to slash a third of the country\u2019s highest-paid government jobs.Hovering over this election are the candidates\u2019 strategies for confronting the bully in the White House, defending the rights of Mexicans living in the United States, while maintaining the economic relationship with our northern neighbor that is vital to the Mexican economy. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and his team have issued a categorical defense of Nafta.During the second presidential debate on May 20, which focused on foreign affairs and United States-Mexico relations, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador reiterated that the best foreign policy is domestic policy: deal with solving the many problems inside Mexico before attempting to solve regional problems. He also suggested that Mexico\u2019s relationship with the White House would naturally improve under his stewardship because of the renewed moral authority he would bring to the presidency following Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s corrupt government.Recently, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has made his way back to the path of moderation. One of Mexico\u2019s main television stations visited him at home and presented him as a no-frills Christian man with an intelligent and charming wife.Judging by his track record as the mayor of Mexico City, it seems likely that as president he would maintain a shrewd, responsible fiscal policy, to fight corruption and expand social policies. But it also seems likely that if he secures absolute power he would mobilize his ground troops to fight his enemies, divide the world into good guys and bad guys, and use strategies such as popular referendums to avert legal obstacles.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador must understand that he will rule for all. He is right to stress that Mexico suffers from crony capitalism, and that many public institutions have been kidnapped by private interests. But he clouds the atmosphere when, during his rallies, he calls businesspeople predatory and Supreme Court judges gangsters, or when he belittles the efforts of the civil society as a mask to advance personal interests. And if he will fight corruption, he should also aim toward some of his own clique.If he wins the presidency, and takes a majority in the Congress, his proposed constitutional amendments will be fast-tracked. And his success will revive the nagging question in the mind of many Mexicans these days: Will he be an agent for change, or the strongman of yet another Mexican revolution?Guillermo Osorno is Mexican journalist and writer.

When Mr. Macron stepped down from that post two years later, Mr. Kohler asked to leave the ministry, and he joined M.S.C. months later, according to the Mediapart investigation.French law allows civil servants to work for private companies for a limited number of years before returning to public administration.While at M.S.C., Mr. Kohler helped Mr. Macron with his 2017 presidential campaign, according to reports published in the French news media.

Mr. Maloney said it would likely be more than 10 years before the new $20 note is released.Ms. Shaheen took the response as a bad sign for the plan to put Tubman on the $20 bill.\u201cI am severely disappointed by the Trump administration\u2019s failure to prioritize the redesign of the $20 bill to honor Harriet Tubman, and other trailblazing women and civil rights leaders,\u201d Ms. Shaheen said in a statement. \u201cNow that plan has been shelved without notice or reason.\u201dShe added: \u201cI\u2019ll continue to press the Treasury Department to expedite the redesign of the $20 bill and keep its promise to the American people.\u201dA Treasury spokeswoman had no additional comment.Lydia Washington, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which is overseen by the Treasury Department, said she had received no new guidance beyond that set forth by Mr. Lew. She said that the redesign process remained on schedule, but that the ultimate timeline would be dictated by the agency\u2019s ability to design security features needed to prevent counterfeiting, and by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.\u201cThe secretary of the Treasury approves all final currency designs,\u201d Ms. Washington said. \u201cOverall, the currency design process is complex, and significant testing is required for the notes and features to be production ready.\u201dMr. Mnuchin has been cryptic about Tubman\u2019s fate. The subject is sensitive, as Mr. Trump has expressed deep admiration for Jackson, a rich populist who appealed to working-class white voters when he was elected in 1828.Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington in January, Mr. Mnuchin said he was still on the fence: \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decisions on whether we will change the bill or won\u2019t change the bill.\u201dImages of Tubman, which were featured prominently on the Treasury Department\u2019s website at the end the Obama administration, were removed when Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury Department overhauled its website last year.The decision by Mr. Lew to add Tubman to the $20 came after months of public debate about putting a prominent woman on a commonly used note. Groups such as Women on the 20s launched grass-roots efforts to make the case that Tubman was the best choice to replace Jackson, a slave owner, and they continue to hope that the Trump administration will not reverse course.Advertisement"}

Global stock benchmarks and commodity prices fell.With the latest threat from Mr. Trump, the White House is warning that it could impose trade restrictions on as much as $450 billion of imports from China, a figure that is nearly equivalent to the total value of goods that China sold to the United States last year.On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, said the United States was \u201cabandoning all the consensus that has been achieved, changing its mind constantly.\u201dAcross financial markets, it appears that investors are starting to take seriously how such a trade conflict could become a drag on a global economy that\u2019s expected to grow at a relatively strong 3.9 percent in 2018, according to International Monetary Fund forecasts.In the United States, the Dow Jones Index, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite all fell on Tuesday. The Dow\u2019s drop of 1.2 percent was its worst day this month, and pushed it into slightly negative territory for the year.Industrial companies including Caterpillar and Boeing weighed heavily on the benchmarks, dropping more than 3 percent each.The trading followed declines in stock markets in Frankfurt, London and Paris. Shares in Hong Kong, Tokyo and mainland China also closed sharply lower.Investors moved their money into haven assets like 10-year United States Treasury bonds and the Japanese yen. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell below 2.90 percent early Tuesday, in a sign that at least some investors were concerned about risks to growth.In the markets for commodities, the raw materials on which the global economy runs, the declines were widespread. Copper, a barometer for industrial activity, was down, as was crude oil.Some of the sharpest drops were in the agricultural commodities markets, where the price for soybeans \u2014 a politically sensitive crop given Mr. Trump\u2019s support among farmers \u2014 plunged early Tuesday before stabilizing.

Early polling here had suggested that the $5.4 billion transit plan would easily pass. It was backed by the city\u2019s popular mayor and a coalition of businesses. Its supporters had outspent the opposition, and Nashville was choking on cars.But the outcome of the May 1 ballot stunned the city: a landslide victory for the anti-transit camp, which attacked the plan as a colossal waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. The Kochs\u2019 opposition to transit spending stems from their longstanding free-market, libertarian philosophy. It also dovetails with their financial interests, which benefit from automobiles and highways. \u201cStopping higher taxes is their rallying cry,\u201d said Ashley Robbins, a researcher at Virginia Tech who follows transportation funding. \u201cBut at the end of the day, fuel consumption helps them.\u201d\u201cOur decisions are based on what is most likely to help people improve their lives, regardless of the policy and its effect on our bottom line,\u201d he said. Koch Industries has opposed steel tariffs, for example, even though the company owns a steel mill in Arkansas, he said. The group\u2019s Nashville victory followed a roller-coaster political campaign, including a sex-and-spending scandal that led to the mayor\u2019s resignation. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more effective than actually having a human conversation with someone on events that affect them on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Akash Chougule, policy director at Americans for Prosperity, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for us to activate people in their own backyards, and we\u2019re among the first to do it in a sustained, permanent way.\u201dThe vote was set for May 1.

Other canvassers that morning included a local Tea Party leader and a lawyer-turned-fantasy-novelist who writes about a young witch who pushes back against an authoritarian government.\u201cIt\u2019s the concept of opportunity cost,\u201d said Mr. Nienow. Their data zeroed in on people thought to be anti-tax or anti-transit and likely to vote.On a laptop in her S.U.V., Ms. Venable tracked, in real time, the progress of the four pairs working that day. By 4:30 p.m. they had knocked on 230 doors and connected with 66 people, a success rate of 29 percent. \u201cExcellent,\u201d she said.In another line of attack, he also argues that ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are the future of transportation, not buses and trains. \u201cWhy would anybody ride transit when they can get a ride at their door within a minute that will drop them off at the door where they want to go?\u201d he said in an interview. Asked whether low-income people could afford to use Uber instead of a bus, he said that subsidizing their rides would still be more cost-effective.In Nashville, Americans for Prosperity played a major role: organizing door-to-door canvassing teams using iPads running the i360 software. Those in-kind contributions can be difficult to measure. According to A.F.P.\u2019s campaign finance disclosure, the group made only one contribution, of $4,744, to the campaign for \u201ccanvassing expenses.\u201dInstead, a local group, NoTax4Tracks, led the Nashville fund-raising. Nearly three-quarters of the $1.1 million it raised came from a single nonprofit, Nashville Smart Inc., which is not required to disclose donors. The rest of the contributions to NoTax4Tracks came from wealthy local donors, including a local auto dealer.Both NoTax4Tracks and Nashville Smart declined to fully disclose their funding. After Ms. Barry\u2019s resignation, Nashville\u2019s pro-transit movement struggled. Its messaging became muddled, strategists said, with supporters claiming that the plan would do everything: create jobs, benefit the environment and even boost the health and wellness of residents. Ultimately, the pro-transit camp failed to fend off criticism that the plan benefited a gentrifying downtown at the expense of more distant lower-income and minority areas. \u201cIf everyone\u2019s going to pay for it, everyone needs to benefit,\u201d said Rev. Jeff Obafemi Carr, who threw his support behind the opposition campaign and mobilized African-American voters.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Mexico Election Nears, Call for Change Finds Wider Audience", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAGUASCALIENTES, Mexico \u2014 If there is a case to be made for preserving Mexico\u2019s status quo, the citizens of Aguascalientes would seem to be the ones to make it.A new Nissan plant is hiring for the night shift, and trains loaded with mechanical parts clatter north to the Texas border and beyond. Factory jobs abound, the crime rate is low, and even in the long-neglected eastern heights, a glass-walled public swimming pool crowns a sloping ribbon of parkland.But as the presidential election nears, the discontent driving voters in the rest of the country has spread even to Mexico\u2019s central manufacturing belt, despite its buoyant economy. The national rage over corruption that is imperiling the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party has taken hold in Aguascalientes, and citizens who could once be counted on to vote conservatively now appear ready to flip.That helps explain the changing political fortunes of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the populist presidential candidate. In his last two runs presidential runs, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador barely registered here. This time, newfound support from voters in regions like Aguascalientes appears to be adding to his lead days before the July 1 vote.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, 64, a former Mexico City mayor, has been campaigning on a vow to bring down what he calls the \u201cmafia of power\u201d and to battle Mexico\u2019s entrenched inequality. The promises go hand in hand: His government will recover billions lost to corruption and waste, he vows, and steer that money back into social programs.It is an argument that resonates with Mart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez, 53, a worker at a German-owned plant in Aguascalientes that makes engine parts. He said he planned to vote for Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador.Government help does not reach the people who need it most, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cWhat we see is that the only ones who benefit these days are those who work in the government \u2014 they steal it all,\u201d he said.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s opponents argue that his policies would drive Mexico back to the disastrous 1970s, when populist presidents borrowed, spent and stole billions, plunging the country into debt and hyperinflation.Given their source, though, those warnings ring hollow to many Mexicans. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is limited to a single term by law, has led a government many Mexicans now equate with corruption \u2014 one that awarded government contracts to cronies and turned a blind eye to governors now accused of pocketing tens of millions of dollars.The president\u2019s Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, picked a technocrat, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, as its candidate because he was untainted by scandal. But he appears to be lagging in third place.The conservative National Action Party, or PAN, which governed Mexico for 12 years before Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office, has suffered its own scandals and was seen as ineffective during its time in power.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has offered few concrete details about how he will fight corruption. But he has convinced many that he will put a stop to the impunity, among them his supporters at the unionized engine parts plant.\u201cTo be a politician was to be untouchable,\u201d said Alejandro de Jes\u00fas Pe\u00f1a Ibarra, 32, a co-worker of Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s. \u201cBut if you start to place limits, then they will learn that they are no longer emperors.\u201dFrancisco Abundis, the director of the polling firm Parametr\u00eda, argues that anger over corruption looms over every other campaign issue. \u201cThe perception is that something has been taken from you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how, or how much, but you feel it.\u201dThat leads to the suspicion that anyone who has climbed up the ladder may have benefited from questionable help during the ascent.\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a question of whether I am doing well,\u201d Mr. Abundis said, explaining why a protest candidate has advanced in a region that is relatively prosperous. It\u2019s \u201chow is the person next to me doing \u2014 and what is the reason for it?\u201d\u201cWe want a change now,\u201d said Ana Mar\u00eda Andrade, 31, a mother of two girls whose husband works in the plant. \u201cThe others have had plenty of opportunity and they did not improve the country.\u201dNeither she nor any of her 12 brothers and sisters voted for Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador in the past. Now, Ms. Andrade said, most of her family have thrown their support behind him. \u201cEverybody is tired of the same promises,\u201d she said.That fatigue seems to be driving others who have switched allegiances.\u201cWe are aware that L\u00f3pez Obrador isn\u2019t coming to save the world,\u201d said Rosa Mar\u00eda Romero Centeno, 59, a retired kindergarten teacher. \u201cWe just simply would like to teach the other parties a lesson.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has won support from retired and current teachers, she said, who are suspicious of a five-year-old education overhaul they believe was intended to cut jobs.Her husband, Eduardo Antuna Villanueva, 63, a retired government employee, said that the failure of rule of law prompted him to support Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, although nobody else in his social circle agreed with him.\u201cIt\u2019s a step towards no longer being so corrupt,\u201d Mr. Antuna said, brushing off the allegations that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador would create chaos. \u201cHe has matured.\u201dOther remains unconvinced.\u201cHow many times has he run and how many times has it gone badly for him?\u201d said Misael Salazar Mac\u00edas, 42, a farmer in Pabell\u00f3n, a nearby municipality where the city\u2019s sprawl gives way to rolling cornfields. Mr. Anaya\u2019s promise to lower the cost of fuel won his vote.Mr. Salazar\u2019s wife, Rosa Elena Mac\u00edas Ram\u00edrez, 43, is still undecided. \u201cGovernments come and go, come and go,\u201d she said. \u201cThey always forget the countryside.\u201dSome voters believe that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador will destroy the economy.\u201cHe is a socialist, he has communist tendencies,\u201d said Francisco Gut\u00ederrez Jim\u00e9nez, 72, who sells raw milk from canisters on his pickup truck and plans to vote for the PRI even though \u201call politicians are thieves.\u201dIf corruption is the campaign\u2019s overriding concern \u2014 along with security in the hardest-hit states \u2014 the economy is also a worry.A unionized factory worker may earn as much as $20 a day including salary and other bonuses. Savings plans, profit-sharing, free transport, subsidized meals and other benefits add to the overall package.All the candidates have acknowledged that Mexico\u2019s wages are low, but it is Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s arguments that appear to have left the deepest imprint.\u201cL\u00f3pez Obrador would open many doors for us,\u201d said Juan Carlos \u00c1lvarez Pedroza, 42, a worker at the parts plant, which pays more than most of the city\u2019s many factories. \u201cPeople would be valued,\u201d he said, and \u201cthere would be an opportunity for better salaries and better benefits.\u201dViridiana R\u00edos, a global fellow at the Mexico Institute of the Wilson Center in Washington, said that despite breakneck growth driven by investment from global automakers in Aguascalientes and the surrounding Baj\u00edo region, there were warning signs that helped explain voters\u2019 discontent. \u201cWe have confused the term development with the term economic growth,\u201d she said.Ms. R\u00edos said: \u201cI think the most important focus of the Baj\u00edo has been the game of a race to the bottom, to offer the auto industry the best conditions \u2014 years of facilities and tax exemptions \u2014 with this goal of attracting more and more manufacturing.\u201dInstead, she said, \u201cwe need to bring the investment we want.\u201dJob growth is a magnet for migration from poorer regions of Mexico, but that depresses wages. One third of the state\u2019s wages do not meet the government\u2019s basic standard for well-being, Ms. R\u00edos said. That is up from about one-quarter two years ago.And in an ominous indicator, the homicide rate in Aguascalientes doubled last year, although it is still very low compared with most of Mexico.If Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has finally found support in the conservative Baj\u00edo, his campaign faces one additional challenge; persuading some voters to pick any candidate at all.\u201cAnybody who reaches the presidency will do the same thing \u2014 steal,\u201d said Erandi Rodr\u00edguez, 21, a stay-at-home mother with a 2-year-old daughter. Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said she had made up her mind to cross out her ballot to show her disgust.\u201cEl Peje could make a change,\u201d Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said, using Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s nickname.She hesitated a moment. Then her default mistrust returned.\u201cBut he\u2019s not going to do everything he says he will,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript: Jared Kushner\u2019s Interview With a Palestinian Newspaper", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREPORTER: What have you learned from Arab leaders on your recent trip through the Middle East?KUSHNER: That the prospects for peace are very much alive. The leaders we met with all care a lot about the Palestinian people, and know that the lives of the Palestinian people can only be made better when there is a peace deal that is agreed to by both sides. They know that it is a tough deal to make, which is why it has eluded both sides for decades, but they all acknowledge the good that will come to the region if an understanding of peace is achieved.REPORTER: What are the points that are most important to the Arab leaders to see in a peace plan?KUSHNER: They conveyed they want to see a Palestinian State with a capital in East Jerusalem. They want a deal where the Palestinian people can live in peace and be afforded the same economic opportunities as the citizens of their own countries. They want to see a deal that respects the dignity of the Palestinians and brings about a realistic solution to the issues that have been debated for decades. They all insist that Al Aqsa Mosque remain open to all Muslims who wish to worship.REPORTER: Does the deal you are working on accommodate these points?KUSHNER: I don\u2019t want to speak about specifics of the deal we are working on, but like I said in my speech in Jerusalem \u2014 I believe that for a deal to be made, both parties will gain more than they give and feel confident that the lives of their people will be better off in decades from now because of the compromises they make. It will be up to the leadership and the people of both sides to determine what is an acceptable compromise in exchange for significant gains.REPORTER: You mention \u201cup to the people.\u201d Are you saying that you could see a world in which you put out a plan and let the people vote on it?KUSHNER: I didn\u2019t say that, but that\u2019s something that the leadership of both sides should consider doing. Perhaps that\u2019s a way for them to take less political risk on endorsing a solution, but that is still a few steps ahead of where we are now.REPORTER: This conflict has been going on for so long and so many people have tried to bring a resolution on what seems like intractable problems \u2014 how is your approach different?KUSHNER: We have done a lot of listening and have spent our time focusing on the people and trying to determine what they actually want. At the end of the day, I believe that Palestinian people are less invested in the politicians\u2019 talking points than they are in seeing how a deal will give them and their future generations new opportunities, more and better paying jobs and prospects for a better life.Each of the political issues are very controversial and there are people on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides who will object to any compromise. We think that the deal should be looked at by both sides as a package and both sides should ask themselves \u2014 are we better-off with what we are getting in exchange for what we are giving?Not everyone will agree that it\u2019s the right package, but reaching for peace takes courage and the need to take the right calculated risks. Without the people pushing the politicians to focus on their needs and giving them the courage to take a chance, this will never be solved.REPORTER: What do you make of the recent statements by Nabil Abu Rudeineh, the spokesman for President Abbas, that your trip is a \u201cwaste of time and is bound to fail\u201d?KUSHNER: I think the Palestinian leadership is saying those things because they are scared we will release our peace plan and the Palestinian people will actually like it because it will lead to new opportunities for them to have a much better life.REPORTER: Have you reached out to President Abbas to see if he would meet you on this trip?KUSHNER: Not directly. President Abbas knows we are in the region and we have many mutual contacts who convey messages \u2014 he knows that we are open to meeting him and continuing the discussion when he is ready. He has said publicly he will not meet us and we have opted not to chase him.We have continued our work on the plan and on building consensus on what is realistically achievable today and what will endure for the future. If President Abbas is willing to come back to the table, we are ready to engage; if he is not, we will likely air the plan publicly.REPORTER: When will you be ready?KUSHNER: Soon. We are almost done.REPORTER: Will the breakdown in the relationship with President Abbas impact your ultimate ability to get a deal done?KUSHNER: President Abbas says that he is committed to peace and I have no reason not to believe him. More importantly, President Trump committed to him early on that he would work to make a fair deal for the Palestinian people. However, I do question how much President Abbas has the ability to, or is willing to, lean into finishing a deal. He has his talking points which have not changed in the last 25 years. There has been no peace deal achieved in that time. To make a deal both sides will have to take a leap and meet somewhere between their stated positions. I am not sure President Abbas has the ability to do that.REPORTER: What makes you think he doesn\u2019t have that ability?KUSHNER: I didn\u2019t say that he doesn\u2019t have the ability, I said I am not sure. I greatly respect that there are many things he has done well for establishing the foundations of peace, but I don\u2019t think the Palestinian people feel like their lives are getting better and there is only so long you can blame that on everyone other than Palestinian leadership. The global community is getting frustrated with Palestinian leadership and not seeing many actions that are constructive towards achieving peace.There are a lot of sharp statements and condemnations, but no ideas or efforts with prospects of success. Those who are more skeptical say President Abbas is only focused on his political survival and cementing a legacy of not having compromised than on bettering the lives of the Palestinian people.REPORTER: Do you think that is the case?KUSHNER: I hope not. My job is to work with the parties in charge, so I am ready to work with President Abbas if he is willing. There is a good deal to be done here from what I assess.REPORTER: What does \u201ceconomic prosperity\u201d look like for the Palestinian people in your view?KUSHNER: Think about the prospects for the Palestinian people over a 5-20 year horizon if they get massive investments in modern infrastructure, job training and economic stimulus. The world is going through a technological industrial revolution and the Palestinian people can be beneficiaries by leapfrogging to be leaders in the next industrial age. The Palestinian people are industrious, well educated and adjacent to the Silicon Valley of the Middle East \u2014 Israel. Israel\u2019s prosperity would spill over very quickly to the Palestinians if there is peace.Many countries from around the world are ready to invest if there is a peace agreement. I feel strongly that while in order to make a peace deal you need to define and have secure borders, economically you want to eliminate boundaries and allow the economies to become more integrated to increase the opportunity and prosperity for all of the people \u2014 including the Jordanians and Egyptians and beyond.REPORTER: So what you are working on is more regional in nature?KUSHNER: The actual deal points are between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but the economic plan we are working on can show what comes as part of a deal when it is achieved with some massive investments that will extend to the Jordanian and Egyptian people as well. This conflict has held the whole region back and there is so much untapped potential that can be released if peace is achieved.REPORTER: Can you give some details about the economic plan you are working on?KUSHNER: Yes. We believe we can attract very significant investments in infrastructure from the public and private sectors to make the whole region more connected and to stimulate the economies of the future. This will lead to increases in GDP and we also hope that a blanket of peaceful coexistence can allow the governments to divert some of their funds from heavy investments in military and defense into better education, services and infrastructure for their people.REPORTER: I know you recently hosted a conference on Gaza in the White House. Has anything come from that? What are you doing to make that situation better while we are all watching it deteriorate before our eyes?KUSHNER: Well, what\u2019s happening in Gaza is very sad. The humanitarian situation started long before President Trump came into office, but nonetheless we must try and make improvements. The level of desperation and despair shows the worst-case scenario of what happens when these problems are left unresolved and allowed to linger. The people of Gaza are hostages to bad leadership. Their economy has spiraled downward because of the inability to have connectivity with the world.As long as there are rockets being fired and tunnels being dug, there will be a chokehold on resources allowed to enter. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. I think the only path for the people of Gaza is to encourage the leadership to aim for a true cease-fire that gives Israel and Egypt the confidence to start allowing more commerce and goods to flow to Gaza. This is the only way to solve the problem from what I have seen. Many countries would be willing to invest in Gaza if there was a true prospect for a different path. It will take some leadership in Gaza though to get on that path.REPORTER: Saeb Erekat recently criticized your efforts to help Gaza saying it\u2019s a political situation that you are trying to make a humanitarian issue in order to divide the Palestinians. Is this your intent?KUSHNER: The last I checked they are divided, they are not connected by government or land and it\u2019s needlessly become a dire humanitarian situation because the Palestinian leadership has made it a political situation. While it\u2019s been on a downward spiral for a decade, long before this administration got involved, with multiple wars and a terrorist government, the political dysfunction, greatly exacerbated by the PA\u2019s salary cuts, has made Gaza ungovernable.It\u2019s time for the Palestinian Authority and Hamas to stop using the people of Gaza as pawns. The narrative of victimhood may feel good for the moment and help you grab headlines but it doesn\u2019t do anything to improve lives. President Trump cares a lot about the Palestinian people and so yes we are looking very closely at Gaza and have spent a lot of time with our partners and hope to put forth ideas to relieve some of the pressure and try to change the trajectory of the situation for the people. Finally we have said from the beginning that there is no path to peace without finding a solution for Gaza.REPORTER: Do you see a world where the Israelis and Palestinians can coexist peacefully?KUSHNER: I really hope so. A lot of people tell me that this can never happen because there is a lot of distrust and hatred that comes from years of conflict and people using politics to blame the hardships of life on others. There have been wars, conflicts, demonstrations, acts of terrorism and more. This is not exactly a solid foundation on which you can build coexistence and peace.However, I am an optimist and I have met so many people and also have seen so many examples of Israelis and Palestinians reaching out to each other and trying to forge bonds to try and circumvent a failed political process. These people know their lives will only be improved by working out the issues and moving on. So yes, there is a lot of hatred and a lot of scar tissue, but I do not underestimate humankind\u2019s ability to love. To be successful, we must be willing to forgive in the present, not forget the past, but work hard towards a brighter future.REPORTER: You clearly are very focused on improving the economic circumstances of the Palestinian people \u2014 what about the traditional core issues?KUSHNER: The traditional core issues are essential and we focus on them extensively with a strong appreciation of the historic differences between the two sides. We are committed to finding a package of solutions that both sides can live with. Simply resolving core issues without creating a pathway to a better life will not lead to a durable solution.REPORTER: Finally, if you could deliver a message directly to the Palestinian people, what would it be?KUSHNER: You deserve to have a bright future. Now is a time where both the Israelis and Palestinians must bolster and refocus their leadership, to encourage them to be open towards a solution and to not be afraid of trying. There have been countless mistakes and missed opportunities over the years, and you, the Palestinian people, have paid the price.Show your leadership that you support efforts to achieve peace. Let them know your priorities and give them the courage to keep an open mind towards achieving them. Don\u2019t let your leadership reject a plan they haven\u2019t even seen. A lot has happened in the world since this conflict began decades ago. The world has moved forward while you have been left behind.Don\u2019t allow your grandfather\u2019s conflict to determine your children\u2019s future. My dream is for the Israeli and Palestinian people to be the closest of allies in combating terror, economic achievement, advancements in science and technology, and in sharing a lifestyle of brotherhood, peace and prosperity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Hitting China on Trade, Trump Is Seen Neglecting U.S. Emerging Industries", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Behind the White House\u2019s plan to punish China with tariffs and other restrictions is a growing concern that Beijing is using industrial policy to dominate industries of the future, at the expense of the United States and other nations.On Thursday, the Trump administration laid out its case in a 35-page report entitled \u201cHow China\u2019s Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World.\u201d It exhaustively details the steps Chinese officials take to protect and promote their domestic industries and disadvantage foreign competitors, including the use of government subsidies, cyberespionage and forced intellectual property transfers to Chinese companies from American and other foreign firms.The United States is trying to derail China\u2019s dominance by punishing Beijing. But it has yet to detail how it plans to build America\u2019s dominance in industries that will power economic and job growth in the future, or cultivate what the administration officials call the \u201ccrown jewels of American technology and intellectual property.\u201dSpeaking with reporters on Tuesday, a senior administration official said Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs are designed to benefit American high-tech industries from the sort of \u201cpredation\u201d China has used in the past.Many economists say those steps are insufficient \u2014 and possibly counterproductive \u2014 to position American companies to compete in emerging, high-tech, globalized industries. They say the administration needs a proactive strategy to bolster American innovation and technology. That includes investing in federal research and development spending, worker skills and attracting more high-caliber foreign students to American graduate programs and fostering advanced industries such as biodefense and artificial intelligence.Whether industries like semiconductors thrive going forward in the United States \u201cwill depend not on America\u2019s success in curbing China\u2019s progress, but rather on its ability to sustain and support innovation by U.S. companies,\u201d Laura D\u2019Andrea Tyson, a former top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, wrote this week.China, meanwhile, targets support to companies that demonstrate a winning strategy for growth. The government forces subsidized and protected firms to compete on the global marketplace, shutting down those that are unable to perform, said Ann Harrison, an economist who specializes in industrial policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.\u201cFirms are supported, but if it\u2019s not working, they cut it out,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really different from Trump\u2019s industrial policy. What we\u2019re really doing now is, we\u2019re not supporting emerging industries. We\u2019re bailing out failing industries.\u201dMany experts worry the United States is not doing enough to help its own advanced industries compete \u2014 not just against China, but the rest of the world.Experts in artificial intelligence say the administration should push for more investment in academic and government research, instead of cutting back on scientific research across the government. They say administration immigration policies have spooked many foreign-born artificial intelligence researchers based in the United States.Canada, South Korea, France and Britain have ramped up government spending in an effort to ensure that they retain and attract top talent and promote artificial intelligence research. China has unveiled a plan to become the world leader in the field and create a domestic industry worth $150 billion by 2030, committing billions of dollars to the effort.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have the government setting big goals, then we will just see business as usual: The private sector will continue to optimize for its own problems, pulling people out of universities and not really giving back to government because that is not its priority,\u201d said Jack Clark, who oversees policy for OpenAI, an independent artificial intelligence lab based in San Francisco. \u201cAcademia will get left behind and the government will have no clear mandate in this very important area.\u201dThe United States has a long history of industrial policy, including the Obama administration\u2019s bailout of the automotive industry during the financial crisis and its subsequent efforts to foster advanced manufacturing.\u201cWe sought to have a strategic focus,\u201d said Gene Sperling, who directed the National Economic Council for much of the Obama administration, \u201cthat did accept that there were strong positive impacts for innovation and jobs in not just protecting the manufacturing base \u2014 as was done with the auto rescue \u2014 but making the U.S. the attractive place to build what comes next in manufacturing as well.\u201dThat is not China\u2019s approach.Trump administration officials outlined 53 examples of China\u2019s \u201ceconomic aggression\u201d that they contend have lifted the Chinese to domination of traditional manufacturing and positioned China to beat the world in industries like artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and blockchain technology.Many economists and lawmakers applaud the administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on Chinese intellectual property theft.Fighting Chinese intellectual property theft is critical to supporting American industries. \u201cIt is something that is very real,\u201d said Chang-Tai Hsieh, an economist who focuses on growth and development issues at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business. \u201cIt happens all the time. It is generally viewed by many of these firms as just the way you do business in China.\u201dThe Commerce Department had previously barred the company from selling into the United States for seven years because of violations of American sanctions. That earlier decision, Mr. Hsieh said, had Chinese companies \u201cterrified.\u201dJim Tankersley reported from Washington, and Cade Metz from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "A Biography Charts an Odysseus Sidelined by Mental Illness", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Kevin Hall is something of an American Odysseus: a stalwart sailor of treacherous seas, on a noble mission. A hero of strength and character whose great obsessive quest (an Olympic gold medal in high-speed, high-risk catamaran sailing) is stymied and at last crushed by enigmatic forces unleashed from within his brain and body. A near-embodiment of the proverb sometimes attributed to Sophocles: \u201cThose whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.\u201dHall is the subject of Mary Pilon\u2019s second book, \u201cThe Kevin Show: An Olympic Athlete\u2019s Battle With Mental Illness.\u201d It follows her 2015 best seller, \u201cThe Monopolists: Obsession, Fury, and the Scandal Behind the World\u2019s Favorite Board Game.\u201d Before that, Pilon had been a prolific magazine journalist and a producer for NBC Sports.Both the virtues and the defects of her immersion in the world of pop culture are on display here. The virtues offer satisfying recreational reading with moments of deep engagement. The defects tend to anesthetize the reader to the nature, provenance and consequences of chronic mental illness. Thus, while engrossing, thanks to its larger-than-life subject, the book misses an opportunity to consummate the promise of its subtitle.When Pilon writes about Hall\u2019s aspirations as an Olympic athlete, the book is absorbing and empathetic. Hall emerges as a kind of American/Athenian ideal, a man of superb intellectual and physical gifts. He is the son of two medical doctors and is a 1991 graduate of Brown University with honors degrees in mathematics and French literature. His powers of mind and body persist even as each is under attack. In the midst of his competitive sailing career, Hall manages to rebuild his elite athlete\u2019s body after each of two separate and unrelated operations for testicular cancer: the first in 1990, when he was 21; the second in the Christmas season of 1992, after which his weight dropped.Hall competed in the world\u2019s most demanding nautical races, including the 2004 Olympics and three America\u2019s Cup events, over a 29-year stretch. He left competitive sailing in 2013 after surviving the tragic capsizing of the high-speed catamaran Artemis on San Francisco Bay during a test run for the America\u2019s Cup. A crewmate, Andrew Simpson, who was known as Bart, was killed. Hall now lives with his wife, Amanda, in Auckland, New Zealand. He never realized his dream of winning an Olympic gold medal.Pilon is a paragon of dogged research. She\u2019s best in reconstructing (via hundreds of hours of interviews) the intertwined life struggles of Hall, his steadfast sweetheart and eventual wife, his vexed parents and some denizens of the competitive sailing world. Her attempts to reach Hall\u2019s \u201cinner world\u201d display levels of empathy that touch the heart, even though they are not always successful.She offers insights into the engineering, construction and navigation of the fast-evolving catamarans themselves: technological, corporate-financed marvels equipped with winglike foils \u201cthat make the entire vessel fly above the water.\u201dIt is, oddly, in the sections of the book about mental illness \u2014 the book\u2019s core, the passages that set Hall apart from a long line of star-crossed athletes, the Golden Fleece of Pilon\u2019s own quest \u2014 that prove the least satisfying, and, occasionally, the most annoying.Early on, we learn that during his college years, Hall begins to be haunted by a persistent delusion: that his life is an ongoing \u201creality show,\u201d with unseen cameras and microphones picking up his every move and utterance for the delectation of a worldwide television audience. Things are somehow orchestrated by an equally chimerical entity, the Director. \u201cLess of a voice,\u201d Hall would say later, \u201cthan a vapor of energy, a sense of will that came from another place surrounding Planet Earth.\u201d The Director has a plan for him, or rather a series of plans, that he was to carry out to \u201chelp create world peace and harmony.\u201dThis is \u201cThe Kevin Show\u201d of the book\u2019s title (a play on \u201cThe Truman Show,\u201d the 1998 Peter Weir satire that starred Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, the unsuspecting star of a lifetime reality show constructed by a television production company).The Director\u2019s fanciful demands propel Hall, the show\u2019s \u201cstar,\u201d into a series of delusional actions \u2014 leaping from a tree in Boston to land in front of a stranger whom he believed to be his \u201cOphelia,\u201d crossing a busy street in Tokyo with his eyes closed \u201cto manipulate the global economy for altruistic purposes.\u201d He scribbled wildly brilliant thoughts into his journal, and suffered a psychotic break at a California theme park after coming across a Lego construction of Salvador Dal\u00ed, a favorite artist.We accompany Hall on these recurring episodes throughout the book. Yet although the author strives at intervals to take us all the way inside her subject\u2019s disordered brain, we remain mostly on the outside looking in, spectators at \u2014 well, a show. Granted, the mysteries of chronic mental illness do not yield easily to the common language, but certain bedrock truths have been ratified within the past generation and are important to understand. Determined though her research may be, Pilon seems to make a point of protecting the reader from the grind of engaging these truths.\u201cThe conversation around medication and treatment can get wonky, jargon-filled and politically loaded pretty quickly,\u201d she writes. \u201cThinking about mental health in terms of our legal system, prisons, schools, workplaces, homeless shelters and beyond can be dizzying, and the desire for a quick and easy fix is often well intended.\u201dBut she then goes on to perpetuate some fundamentally damaging misperceptions about mental illness. Citing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she writes that \u201chalf of all Americans will have a mental health crisis \u2026 and it would be virtually impossible to draw up one single type of treatment path for every one of them.\u201dThe first part of this assertion masks a critical distinction, and the second part is fatuous. \u201cHalf of all Americans\u201d conflates two radically distinct forms of mental illness: the emotionally based eruptions of depression, fear, anger and alienation reported by those whom psychiatrists describe as \u201cthe worried well,\u201d and the incurable, biologically inherited, often catastrophic brain diseases: bipolarity, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders.Hall was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder when he was in college. Pilon reports that the doctors told Hall that his affliction \u201cwasn\u2019t likely to go away anytime soon, if at all.\u201d This is an infuriating elision of a valuable teachable moment. Pilon might have explained that \u201cit wasn\u2019t likely to go away anytime soon, if at all\u201d because bipolar disorder, unlike most complaints lumped together as mental illness, is a pernicious disease of the brain. To the extent that people remain unaware of this distinction (and the extent is great), brain-diseased people suffer greatly.Hall and his fellow sufferers make up less than 4 percent of the population. Yet they affect society, and are affected by it, in ways and numbers disproportionate to their population. One flagrant example: The respected Treatment Advocacy Center has found that some 20 percent of jail inmates and 15 percent of inmates in state prisons have a serious mental illness. In real numbers, that\u2019s about 356,000 inmates (450,000 in some estimates) with serious mental illness in jails and state prisons, or 10 times more than the 35,000-odd sufferers in state hospitals. More than one expert has remarked that America criminalizes the mentally ill and uses jails as de facto mental health institutions. The economic toll is huge: Mentally ill inmates require twice the cost of maintenance as those who aren\u2019t mentally ill. The emotional toll on these inmates\u2019 families is incalculable.Then there is the matter of suicide. More than 90 percent of suicide victims have a diagnosable mental disorder. Pilon reports that Hall has contemplated suicide more than once. At the end of the book, shortly before her upbeat closing assurance that \u201cKevin is needed, and loved, back on the shore,\u201d Pilon informs us that in 2016, during a \u201cdown period,\u201d her subject spent several days on a suicide watch.It is exactly such incongruities \u2014 breezy blandishments in the face of troubling evidence to the contrary \u2014 that hobble \u201cThe Kevin Show.\u201dRon Powers is the author, most recently, of \u201cNo One Cares About Crazy People: The Chaos and Heartbreak of Mental Health in America,\u201d a finalist for the 2018 PEN/E.O.

And they are up 45 percent from the depths of the housing crisis in 2012.The big rebound in home prices and the lure of making a quick buck drew more than 200 people on Tuesday to a MidtownManhattan hotel for a two-hour free class on flipping houses. The lunchtime program I dropped in on was part of a sophisticated come-on for a paid three-day workshop that Nathaniel \u201cThan\u201d Merrill and his FortuneBuilders company plan to hold in the New York metropolitan area. An instructor at the event said the workshop normally costs $1,197, but the company was offering it for $197.Mr. Merrill, a former professional football player, has built something of a national reputation for pitching home flipping as a way to make money for just about anyone with a little cash and a dream to become a big time real estate investor. His FortuneBuilders company bills itself as an educational firm with many satisfied customers and success stories. The company is closely tied to a private lender called Grand Coast Capital that provides short-term financing to real estate investors,many of whom are past attendees of the three-day programs.The free class on Tuesday was something of a cross between a how-to guide to buying and selling homes and an evangelical experience. The instructor at the afternoon session sought to inspire the crowd, saying that if they only had the courage, they could someday quit their day jobs and live the way they always wanted to. Judging by the enthusiastic reaction, many were buying the message.- Matthew GoldsteinThe Chinese market is valuable and distinctive from the rest of the world. Arm believes this joint venture, which will license Arm semiconductor technology to Chinese companies and locally develop Arm technology in China, will expand Arm\u2019s opportunities in the Chinese market.Arm estimates that 95 percent of all advanced chips designed in China last year were based on its technology. With China desperate to make its own chips in volume, and quickly (there\u2019s more on that theme below), the move could prove shrewd.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation is rushing to build semiconductor factories. But reports claiming that the Chinese government is probing chip makers over price-fixing demonstrate that it\u2019s not there yet.Reuters notes that, according to Trendforce, China accounts for 20 percent of all global DRAM memory sales. For now, those purchases must be made almost entirely from Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, at what the Chinese government appears to believe may be inflated prices.China\u2019s own production plants \u2014 and carefully controlled pricing \u2014 clearly can\u2019t come soon enough.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe hire shows Washington is becoming more intertwined with corporate America, as the state intervenes in M.&A. and other business dealings.

GitHub fits that vision neatly.Unless Microsoft treads carefully, some could flee to rival repositories like BitBucket or GitLab, which has seen a big spike in traffic since news of the deal broke.\u201cOf course it has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Did the Romans Ever Do for Us?", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistBut I find myself thinking, not about the fall of the Republic, but about the Pax Romana that came after \u2014 the two-plus centuries of stability that followed Augustus. Believe it or not, I think that era does have some lessons for us; this may be a sign of mental infirmity, but I\u2019m gonna let it all hang out.Not long ago, I would have said that very little about the Roman Empire was relevant to anything modern. It may have fascinated early modern Europeans like Edward Gibbon, but in the end it was a pre-industrial society, incredibly poor by modern standards, and sharing few modern values. True, the Roman Empire was bigger than most pre-industrial empires, and lasted a lot longer. But was it really different in any important way from, say, Assyria?But I read a lot of history in my spare time, and as best I can tell modern scholarship is telling us that Rome really was something special.They also achieved remarkable things on the political front. The Romans were not nice guys; they weren\u2019t Edwardian gentlemen in togas. They had no qualms about slavery, were often casually cruel, and had no compunctions at all about using extreme force to put down any challenges to imperial rule. But while the threat of violence always lurked in the background, the Roman Empire wasn\u2019t held together by a reign of terror. For the most part the Pax Romana was maintained through the willing cooperation of local elites.How did they manage that? The secret, as I read the new literature, is that Rome actually exerted a lot of soft power. Local elites were offered a good life, with attractive Roman values \u2014 Amphitheaters! Bathhouses! Wine! Stuffed dormice! \u2014 and the imperial system was open enough that especially able and ambitious provincials could aspire to move to the center of things. And that thriving, interdependent economy rewarded those who adopted Roman values and assimilated with the Roman system.Or to put it another way, Rome did so well for so long by not being too greedy, by limiting short-sighted exploitation of its power in favor of long-term system-building.Obviously some people, like my own stiff-necked ancestors, refused to be assimilated and had to be put down; and as I said, the Romans had no problem being vicious when that served their purposes. Even during the paxiest parts of the Pax Romana, there was always a war somewhere. But overall restraint and a set of values that appealed to many of their subjects produced a long run of unprecedented peace and prosperity.OK, you can probably see where I\u2019m going with this. The Pax Americana, the three generations of relative peace and prosperity that followed World War II, was different in every detail from the Roman Principate. Not only are we vastly richer than Rome could have imagined, we\u2019re also a lot nicer: America has done some terrible and shameful things, but nothing like what the Romans did when they got angry.Still, our sort-of empire, like Rome\u2019s, has been held together mainly by soft power rather than violence. Even when America was an overwhelmingly dominant economic and military power, it generally exercised restraint, getting its allies to buy in to our system rather than resorting to raw compulsion.And it worked really well. Not perfectly, of course, but we gave the world \u2014 and ourselves \u2014 an era that was incredibly benign compared with the modern Thirty Years War that came before.But now a barbarian invasion seems likely to tear it all down. And the sad thing is that the barbarians rejecting the values that made America truly great aren\u2019t at the gates \u2014 they\u2019re inside the gates, in fact in the Oval Office, because they\u2019re basically home-grown (with an assist from Russia, of course.)It\u2019s a terrible story. We built something wonderful, and we\u2019re throwing it all away for no good reason.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slovenia Elections Tilt Another European Country to the Right", "Date": "2018-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLJUBLJANA, Slovenia \u2014 Voters in Slovenia gave victory to a populist party led by a firebrand former prime minister in parliamentary elections on Sunday that tilted another European country to the right.\u201cThose who cast their ballots for us have elected a party that will put Slovenia first,\u201d Mr. Jansa told supporters at the party\u2019s headquarters in Ljubljana after the result was announced.But Mr. Jansa could struggle to form a government as most party leaders have rejected the possibility of joining a coalition with him, raising the possibility of an extended period of uncertainty and a new election if coalition talks are deadlocked.On Sunday, he called on parties on the left and right to join him in a new government \u201cto face internal and external challenges together.\u201dMr. Jansa, a veteran nationalist politician and a dissident during Communist rule, had maintained a lead throughout a two-month election campaign that was marred by disputes over the country\u2019s turbulent past and allegations of corruption within the established parties.In keeping with his campaign theme, he said on Sunday that migration was the biggest challenge facing Slovenia and Europe.\u201cI will say what I have said already before: We are for solidarity, but we are against stupidity,\u201d he said, advocating a policy of discouraging migrants from coming to Europe by improving conditions in their own countries.Mr. Sarec cast himself as an anti-establishment candidate and a leader for a new generation of Slovenians who have come of age in a democratic society and whose top concerns are the economy, jobs and social security, including a robust pension system.He congratulated Mr. Jansa for the victory on Sunday, but said his party would heed its vow not to form a coalition with the populist party. If Mr. Jansa fails to cobble together a government, Mr. Sarec would get a chance. If he too failed, the president could call new elections.Finishing third in the poll were the Social Democrats of Dejan Zidan, with 10 percent.In all, nine parties passed the 4 percent threshold to get into Parliament, including the party of Slovenia\u2019s first female prime minister, Alenka Bratusek, which received just over 5 percent.With nearly all of the votes counted, voter turnout stood at 51.8 percent.The populist leader also vowed to refuse entry to asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa. Slovenia has participated in the European Union\u2019s refugee resettlement program, taking in around 200 asylum seekers and Mr. Jansa vehemently opposes Brussels\u2019 imposition of migrant quotas on member states.An average of 20 people a year are granted international protection in Slovenia.Echoing Mr. Orban of Hungary, he has called the influx of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa a threat to European values and a danger to the continent\u2019s stability.In 2015, hundreds of thousands of migrants entering Europe passed through Slovenia, usually on the way to other countries, often Germany, to seek asylum. \u201cWe will never allow this to happen again,\u201d Mr. Jansa has said.Mr. Jansa led the government as prime minister from 2004 to 2008 and then again, briefly, in 2012. During his leadership he cracked down on political rivals and the independent news media that he called remnants of the old Communist regime. He also exerted control over major state-run companies.During this campaign, Mr. Jansa aimed to cast himself as a uniter, said Miha Kovac, a political analyst and a lecturer at the University of Ljubljana. \u201cIt was still Jansa as we know him, blaming others, especially Communists and migrants, for all of the country\u2019s problems that only he can solve,\u201d Mr. Kovac said. \u201cBut he\u2019s trying hard to be calmer and not as confrontational.\u201dStill, Mr. Kovac said, \u201cI think it will be very hard for him to form a coalition, perhaps even impossible in the first attempt,\u201d adding that it was no easy job for Mr. Sarec either, and that it could well be \u201cmonths if not years of political uncertainty and instability.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Jobs Recovery: A Longer View", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the monthly job-creation streak continuing to set records, the data shed light both on the rebound from the recession and on what\u2019s left to be desired.The United States lost nearly 8.7 million jobs in the Great Recession and its aftermath. It has gained 18.9 million since then \u2014 a powerful rebound that belied fears of another \u201cjobless recovery.\u201d (Net growth was needed just to keep pace with the working-age population, which has increased by about 10 million during the same period.)Politicians, investors and, yes, journalists love to obsess over the month-to-month swings in the job numbers. But the true story of the recovery is one of remarkable consistency. American employers have added jobs for 92 straight months \u2014 far and away the longest streak on record \u2014 and apart from a few blips, the gains have been steady.The trend in job growth is easier to see by focusing on the year-over-year growth at any point, rather than the more volatile monthly figures. Looked at this way, hiring accelerated early in the recovery, peaking in early 2015 at a pace of more than three million jobs per year. Growth gradually tapered after that, which isn\u2019t surprising \u2014 most economists expected the rate of job creation to keep falling as companies recovered from the downturn and the pool of available workers dried up.All that hiring has gone a long way toward putting Americans back to work. The unemployment rate, now 3.8 percent, is the lowest since 2000. The progress is increasingly reaching groups that often face discrimination or other disadvantages in the job market: The unemployment rate for African-Americans hit its lowest level on record in May. The jobless rates for Hispanics, teenagers and those with less than a high school education are likewise at or near multidecade lows.The unemployment rate doesn\u2019t tell the full story, however. Government statistics count people as unemployed only if they are looking for work, a definition that excludes people who are voluntarily or involuntarily out of the labor force entirely. During the recession and recovery, that distinction was crucial: The official unemployment rate ignored millions of people who had abandoned their job searches as hopeless. Eight years of job growth, however, have shrunk the pool of \u201cdiscouraged\u201d workers, and broader definitions of unemployment all show strong progress.Then there is the mystery that has loomed over the job market in recent years: lackluster wage growth. With unemployment low, companies are increasingly complaining about a shortage of qualified labor. Yet that hasn\u2019t translated into fat raises for workers.Advertisement"}

Leader Warns of \u2018Worst-Case Scenarios,\u2019 Citing Trump", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said on Wednesday that the policies of President Trump had put trans-Atlantic relations \u201cunder tremendous pressure\u201d and that Europeans should prepare for darker times.\u201cIt is my belief that, while hoping for the best, we must be ready to prepare our Union for worst-case scenarios,\u201d Mr. Tusk said.He was not more specific in his letter on Wednesday, which focused on the agenda for the next summit meeting of European leaders, scheduled for Thursday and Friday. Much of their attention will be taken up by a new political crisis over migration and efforts to shore up the backstop for the euro currency.This month, citing \u201cnational security,\u201d Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on imports of European steel and aluminum. The bloc responded with \u201crebalancing measures\u201d that hit about $3.25 billion worth of American products, a rough equivalent to the value of the penalties on European steel and aluminum.The European Union is currently preparing similar retaliation should Mr. Trump follow through on his threat to impose significant new tariffs on imported automobiles.In a briefing before the summit meeting, the French economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, said in Paris that \u201cwe do not want a trade war.\u201d\u201cBut we defend ourselves,\u201d he added. \u201cNo one can stop a person or a state that is attacked from defending himself. We are attacked; we are not the aggressors.\u201dFor now, migration is the highest priority for the leaders, with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany pressed by rivals in her own coalition government to find a way to deal with migrants who register in another country before they try to settle in Germany. That is part of a phenomenon known as secondary or onward migration, made possible by what is essentially border-free travel through much of Europe within what is known as the Schengen area.Although migrant numbers are down, the politics around the issue have propelled populist parties to success across Europe, including in Italy and in Germany, where the Alternative for Germany is the official opposition party.Alternative for Germany is also pressing Ms. Merkel\u2019s sister party, the Christian Social Union, in state elections in October. They are, in turn, pressing Ms. Merkel for a political answer.Mr. Tusk said in his letter that he wanted the leaders to endorse the establishment of \u201cregional disembarkation platforms outside Europe\u201d for migrants and refugees, a controversial effort to keep people from coming to the Continent before they are screened to see whether they qualify for asylum.He also wants the bloc\u2019s leaders to approve more funding to combat illegal migration in the bloc\u2019s next seven-year budget from 2021, including a major increase in European Union border guards and coast guard.Similarly, he said, the bloc must do more to work with other countries, like Libya, to prevent migrants from making the difficult sea journey to Europe. Part of that effort would involve continuing to pay Turkey to prevent trips by migrants to Greece, and part would be a program of foreign aid to make living conditions better in the home countries of many potential migrants, especially in Africa.Alissa J.

{"Headline": "Iranians Wonder: Why Won\u2019t Trump Talk to Us?", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 After the handshakes, the signature ceremony and the diplomatic pomp of the historic meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea, many Iranians could come to only one conclusion: We should talk, too.Yes, Mr. Trump in May unilaterally pulled the United States out of the nuclear agreement between Iran and a group of world powers. Yes, he has imposed new sanctions against Iran that are scaring away European investors. Yes, Mr. Trump has a long track record of changing his mind.Despite that, some here say that perhaps Iran\u2019s leaders should make a move similar to Mr. Kim\u2019s and propose a meeting. If Mr. Trump can sit down with the leader of such an isolated country, with its gulags, summary executions and stockpile of nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles, why not talk to Iran?\u201cWe are a country with municipal, parliamentary and presidential elections, our 80-million-strong society is open and dynamic, we share borders\u201d with many countries, said Masoud Daneshmand, a member of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIran is a much more advanced and open society, compared with North Korea. So why wouldn\u2019t Iran and America be able to sit down and have direct talks?\u201dOne reason is that Iran\u2019s leaders are ideologically opposed to talking to the United States. Like North Korea, Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States. Iranian presidents visiting the United Nations for meetings have been known to duck into a restroom to avoid being seen with an American president.Another reason is that President Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement vindicated the America-hating hard-liners in Iran. They now say that the decision to enter into direct talks with the Obama administration, under the umbrella of the nuclear negotiations, has brought only pain. Never again, they say.But it is that pain \u2014 of a faltering economy, rising prices and the restoration of old sanctions \u2014 that is causing some Iranians to say there is no other way out of the decades of tensions with Washington but through direct talks.\u201cThe economy is so bad and our leaders need to sell oil, how can they under sanctions?\u201d said Hadi Mokhatarian, 40, who owns an orange orchard near the Caspian Sea. \u201cI think in the end we have no option but to talk to America.\u201dHe said that like most people he knew, he had no inclination to rise up against Iran\u2019s leaders. \u201cBut if they talk to Trump and things will get better, I think that will be great and many people will be happy,\u201d he said.In a small shop in West Tehran, where Mohammad Shahdadi, 33, sells plastics and disposable items like cups and buckets, business was slow, as it has been for a while, he admitted. \u201cMy question is: Why should we continue our current foreign policy?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for change. For the sake of Iranians, to save us from this bad situation, our leaders should sit down with Trump and solve the old disputes between our countries.\u201dThe list of those disputes is long. In 1953, the Central Intelligence Agency organized a coup against the democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, and Washington strongly backed the authoritarian Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi for years.In 1979, Iranian revolutionary students occupied the American Embassy and took 52 Americans hostage, and after that Washington supported Iraq during its bloody eight-year war with Iran. Over the decades there have been sanctions, cyberattacks and other secret operations, terrorist attacks and various diplomatic disputes. Now, the Trump administration, besides withdrawing from the nuclear deal, is blaming the Iranian leadership for most of the problems in the Middle East and is talking about regime change.\u201cIn reality, direct talks are not realistic under the current conditions,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the Iranian government. Not only is there a lot of old bad blood, he said, President Trump also has set different conditions for Iran than he did for North Korea. \u201cHe wants Iran to give up everything, without offering any incentive in return,\u201d Mr. Laylaz said. \u201cWhy should we sit down with him under such conditions?\u201dIranian officials are also wary of Mr. Trump\u2019s mercurial nature. A government spokesman, Mohammad Bagher Nobakht, warned North Korea this week that Mr. Trump could not be taken at his word, pointing to his decision to rescind his signature on the communiqu\u00e9 of the Group of 7 meeting in Canada.\u201cI do not know who the North Korean leader is conferring with,\u201d Mr. Nobakht said. \u201cThis man is not a wise representative of America. I hope that the American nation itself will do something about him.\u201dThe idea of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, meeting with Mr. Trump in front of the world\u2019s news media and shaking hands is unthinkable. That would destroy his carefully crafted image as the leader of the \u201cresistance axis,\u201d a group of countries and groups in the Middle East that oppose United States policies.\u201cPerhaps Iran and the U.S. can talk secretly at first,\u201d suggested Mr. Daneshmand, who pointed out that Iran even sat down with its archenemy at the time, Saddam Hussein, the former Iraqi leader, to end the Iran-Iraq war. \u201cBe sure that even now, somewhere talks are going on. If North Korea becomes a success, we will see direct talks with Iran.\u201dBut others saw a different lesson in the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. Why was it that the American leader was willing to fly all the way to Singapore to meet with a 34-year-old dictator? \u201cBecause he has nuclear weapons,\u201d said Housang Tale, an Iranian nationalist. Pakistan, India, Russia, China and now North Korea all have nuclear arms and the United States talks with all of them, he said, \u201cbut not to us.\u201dIran never had a nuclear weapon, and it says the program it curtailed in the nuclear agreement was strictly for producing energy, not weapons. \u201cWe should\u2019ve made a nuclear bomb, then they would take us seriously,\u201d Mr. Tale said. \u201cNow, they can pressure us as much as they want.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How McKinsey Lost Its Way in South Africa", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "When the godfather of management consulting landed its biggest contract ever in Africa, it made the worst mistake in its storied nine-decade history.Supported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The blackouts kept coming. The state-owned power company, Eskom, was on the verge of insolvency. Maintenance was being deferred. And a major boiler exploded, threatening the national grid.McKinsey & Company, the godfather of management consulting, thought it could help, but was not sure that it should, according to people involved in the debate. The risk was huge. Could McKinsey fix the problems? Would it get paid? Would it be tainted by South Africa\u2019s rampant political corruption?In late 2015, over objections from at least three influential McKinsey partners, the firm decided the risk was worth taking and signed on to what would become its biggest contract ever in Africa, with a potential value of $700 million.It was also the biggest mistake in McKinsey\u2019s nine-decade history.The contract turned out to be illegal, a violation of South African contracting law, with some of the payments channeled to an associate of an Indian-born family, the Guptas, at the center of a swirling corruption scandal. Then there was the lavish size of that payout. It did not take a Harvard Business School graduate to explain why South Africans might get angry seeing a wealthy American firm cart away so much public money in a country with the worst income inequality in the world and a youth unemployment rate over 50 percent.And a bitter irony: While McKinsey\u2019s pay was supposed to be based entirely on its results, it is far from clear that the flailing power company is much better off than it was before.The Eskom affair is now part of an expansive investigation by South African authorities into how the Guptas used their friendships with Jacob Zuma, then the country\u2019s president, and his son to manipulate and control state-owned enterprises for personal gain. International corruption watchdogs call it a case of \u201cstate capture.\u201d Lawmakers here call it a silent coup. It has already led to Mr. Zuma\u2019s ouster and a moment of reckoning for post-apartheid South Africa.Yet despite extensive coverage of the scandal by the local news media, one question has remained largely unanswered: How did McKinsey, with its vast influence, impeccable research credentials and record of advising companies and governments on best practices, become entangled in such an untoward affair?McKinsey admits errors in judgment while denying any illegality. Two senior partners, the firm says, bear most of the blame for what went wrong. But an investigation by The New York Times, including interviews with 16 current and former partners, found that the roots of the problem go deeper \u2014 to a changing corporate culture that opened the way for an aggressive push into more government consulting, as well as new methods of compensation. While the changes helped McKinsey nearly double in size over the last decade, they introduced more reputational risk.The firm also missed warning signs about the possible involvement of the Guptas, and only belatedly realized the insufficiency of its risk management for state-owned companies. Supervisors who might have vetoed or modified the contract were not South African and lacked the local knowledge to sense trouble ahead. And having poorly vetted its subcontractor, McKinsey was less than forthcoming when asked to explain its role in the emerging scandal.Since the Eskom disclosures, much of McKinsey\u2019s business in South Africa has evaporated. Mr. Barton has made six trips there to assess the damage and make amends, and McKinsey has asked its 2,000 global partners to repay South Africa, where it is under investigation.More broadly, the scandal in South Africa \u2014 which has ensnared several other overseas companies \u2014 underscores the risks that arise as governments increasingly turn over responsibilities to consultants who operate mostly in secret, with little or no public accountability.McKinsey built its brand as the ubiquitous adviser to businesses great and small. But in recent years, it has created an increasingly powerful unseen presence as counselor to governments across the globe.The extent of that global influence is difficult to evaluate because, as a matter of policy, the firm will not reveal clients or the advice it gives.Even so, by examining government records, along with McKinsey publications and other company documents, The Times found that the firm shapes everything from education, transportation, energy and medical care to the restructuring of economies and the fighting of wars.McKinsey\u2019s clients include sovereign wealth funds worth more than a trillion dollars, as well as what one marketing brochure describes as \u201cdefense ministries, military forces, police forces and justice ministries in 15 countries,\u201d where the company consults on such matters as the maintenance and support of \u201carmored personnel carriers; minesweepers, destroyers and submarines; and fast jets and transport aircraft.\u201dMcKinsey \u201cis a hidden, unaccountable power that has a prestigious face,\u201d said Janine R. Wedel, a professor at George Mason University who has written extensively on what she calls \u201cthe shadow elite.\u201d She added, \u201cThink of them as a repository of the most intimate information that governments and others have, from what they are investing in to who wields influence.\u201dMcKinsey refused to work in South Africa until it embraced democracy in the mid-1990s, but records show that it consults for many authoritarian governments, including the world\u2019s mightiest, China, to a degree unheard of for a foreign company. Late last year, two McKinsey partners spoke at a meeting of the state-controlled conglomerate China Merchants Group that focused on carrying out Communist Party directives. McKinsey is also advising the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, as he seeks to make its economy less reliant on oil.While confidentiality is necessary in private business, it can become problematic when public money is involved, as in South Africa, or for that matter in the United States, where McKinsey has advised more than 40 federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Department and the Food and Drug Administration.Since President Trump took office, McKinsey has greatly expanded consulting for Immigration and Customs Enforcement through that agency\u2019s office of \u201cdetention, compliance and removals.\u201d Their contracts with the agency exceed $20 million. Asked about those contracts, a McKinsey spokesman said the company\u2019s work focused primarily on administration and organization and was unconnected to immigration policy, including the separation of children and parents at the border.Certainly, consulting firms other than McKinsey keep client lists confidential and work for authoritarian governments. And McKinsey has undeniably been a force for good, through its pro bono work and by helping many organizations become more efficient engines of economic growth. As for the quality of people McKinsey hires, many have gone on to run some of the world\u2019s biggest and most successful companies.That is why McKinsey\u2019s behavior in South Africa is so startling.In 2012, a new class of recruits \u2014 the worker bees in McKinsey\u2019s hive \u2014 settled in at its office in Sandton, Johannesburg\u2019s financial center, often called the richest square mile in Africa. They were part of a notably diverse group. Given South Africa\u2019s historic battle against apartheid, it was a point of pride at McKinsey that more than 60 percent of the office\u2019s 250 employees were black South Africans. Many described their work as a calling, an opportunity to make a difference in a young and still-struggling democracy.Years earlier, McKinsey\u2019s South African partners had decided that to be relevant, they had to embrace the public sector, because of its outsize role in South Africa\u2019s economy. But a South African government weakened by corruption also represented a risk to McKinsey\u2019s sterling reputation \u2014 a reputation forged by its founder, a math whiz from the Ozarks named James O. McKinsey, and nurtured by his disciple and successor, Marvin Bower.Over the decades, the firm \u2014 that\u2019s what it calls itself \u2014 became confidant to chief executives and presidents, simultaneously the secret-keeper of corporate America and its most effective evangelist, preaching the McKinsey way to companies across the globe.There came to be a not entirely hyperbolic narrative of McKinsey\u2019s preordained white-shoe path through the world \u2014 the Harvard Business School recruit turned McKinsey consultant turned rising corporate titan. And few companies have a better track record of producing them: Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who oversaw I.B.M.\u2019s turnaround in 1990s, is a McKinsey veteran. So is Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, and Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai.\u201cSo pervasive is the firm\u2019s influence today that it is hard to imagine the place of business in the world without McKinsey,\u201d wrote Duff McDonald, author of \u201cThe Firm,\u201d a 2013 book about the company.McKinsey has had its share of bad publicity, but much of it has focused on people who have already left.It looked bad. And while McKinsey was cleared of wrongdoing, the experience helped steer the company away from government work, avoiding the publicity, the ethical quandaries and the generally lower fees that came with public contracts.But if McKinsey had learned a lesson, it soon began to unlearn it.By the early 2000s, McKinsey re-entered the public sphere in a major way \u2014 and now government contracts and work with state-owned companies make up 16 percent of the firm\u2019s revenues.There was another lesson being unlearned as well: Work for a fixed fee.In the late 1980s, an up-and-coming partner in McKinsey\u2019s energy practice, Jeffrey K. Skilling, had been part of a committee considering whether payment should be based on delivered results, such as reduced costs.As Mr. Skilling told the journalist Anita Raghavan, the panel concluded it would not work, because getting paid based on impact, for example, could give McKinsey an incentive to tell clients to reduce costs even if it was not in their interest. Doing that, Mr. Skilling said, \u201ccould destroy\u201d the firm.Mr. Skilling \u2014 who would become Enron\u2019s chief executive and end up in federal prison after its vast accounting fraud was revealed \u2014 saw the ethical trap. A future generation of McKinsey partners came to a different conclusion.Starting around 2001 or 2002, McKinsey again began to rethink its fee-for-service rule. Its competitors were already changing over. After years of deliberation and study, the firm agreed in 2011 to allow \u201cat risk\u201d contracts alongside its traditional fee structure.\u201cThere\u2019s been client demand for that, clients saying we like that approach,\u201d Mr. Barton said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get the results you want, then don\u2019t pay us.\u201dWith this new pay policy and avid embrace of government work, the firm\u2019s South African partners had been handed a seductive vision of the future. Some of McKinsey\u2019s young associates in Johannesburg would end up on the ill-fated Eskom deal. But first, there was an ambitious project at the state-owned rail and port agency, Transnet.McKinsey had worked with Transnet since 2005, embedding itself so deeply that one board member wondered how the agency could ever oust the consultants should the need arise. Still, Transnet remained an underachiever, its ports inadequate, its freight rail system moribund.Then, in February 2011, Transnet got a new chief executive, Brian Molefe, who had been running the country\u2019s public pension fund.McKinsey and Mr. Molefe set out to revitalize the agency by buying as many as 1,064 new locomotives in what would be the biggest government procurement in South African history. But McKinsey would have to take on a subcontractor, under a South African law requiring companies that worked with state-owned enterprises to have black-owned partners.According to prosecutors, the Guptas saw these black-empowerment companies as a way to empower themselves, and state-owned companies like Transnet became willing accomplices. Transnet steered McKinsey toward working with a company, Regiments, owned in part by a businessman linked to the Guptas.But weeks before the winning bidders were announced, McKinsey bowed out, saying the process was moving too quickly.As it turned out, Transet agreed to pay about $1 billion more than the agreed-upon price for the locomotives. And, as leaked documents published last year in the local media revealed, one of the winning bidders, a state-owned Chinese company, paid more than $100 million to shell companies tied to another Gupta associate, Salim Essa.Although it is unclear what, if anything, Mr. Molefe knew about those payments, he left Transnet to search for a new challenge. He found it in 2015 as the chief executive at Eskom.The power company had long been the public\u2019s favorite punching bag, notorious for its high rates, sputtering from one crisis to the next. Officials worried about getting enough coal, about delaying maintenance to keep electricity flowing. During the World Cup in 2010, Eskom feared that the lights might go out at any moment with the whole world watching.To address Eskom\u2019s financial troubles, McKinsey and Eskom drew up an audacious new reorganization plan.McKinsey\u2019s team leader on the project was a popular partner, Vikas Sagar, a stylish, Porsche-driving fitness buff in his 40s, known for hugging colleagues when the spirit moved him and fiercely charting his own course. He was assisted by Alexander Weiss, a serious reverse image of Mr. Sagar, who thought little of commuting between his home in Germany and Johannesburg.McKinsey\u2019s proposal appeared perfect for a company in desperate financial straits. Eskom would pay only if the plan produced savings. Then the consultancy would get a percentage. All the risk, ostensibly, would be McKinsey\u2019s, since it might spend heavily but get nothing in the end.Yet for all the upside, the proposal had a Trojan-horse quality: Eskom would hire McKinsey not knowing what the final bill would be.The plan left several McKinsey partners uneasy. Could Eskom absorb and apply McKinsey\u2019s recommendations? And how would a contract with an anticipated payout in the hundreds of millions of dollars be received by South Africans? Also troubling was the fact that McKinsey had won the contract without competitive bidding.\u201cYou are betting the office,\u201d one former partner recalled warning colleagues. If the final payout became public, that official added, \u201cYou are going to be slaughtered just for the size.\u201dThe contract\u2019s structure \u2014 with the risks it posed for McKinsey \u2014 was not universally embraced, either. \u201cTrying to do a 100 percent at-risk contract at Eskom is trying to play God,\u201d a former partner said. \u201cYou are really guaranteeing that I can turn around everything, no problem.\u201d To accomplish that, McKinsey might need more political clout and expertise than it could deliver.Most of McKinsey\u2019s current or former partners who spoke to The Times requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. McKinsey did provide several partners for interviews on the condition that their names not be used. Mr. Sagar did not respond to repeated messages seeking an interview, and Mr. Weiss declined to speak to The Times.Concerns notwithstanding, the prospect of a big payday made the contract popular not only in Johannesburg but throughout McKinsey\u2019s global empire. Supporters included two senior partners with oversight in energy and power: Yermolai Solzhenitsyn, the novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s eldest son, in Moscow, and Thomas Vahlenkamp in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Both declined to be interviewed.In the end, Mr. Sagar and his allies carried the day.In situations like these, risk managers are supposed to serve as corporate lifeguards, ready to whistle back dealmakers if they expose the company to unnecessary legal and reputational peril. Yet the Eskom contract was approved with less scrutiny than regular public contracts. That was because state-owned enterprises were treated as private corporations, where reviews focused on commercial viability, not political risk.Had McKinsey vetted the Eskom contract properly, it might have spared itself some of the grief to come. The contract, it turned out, was illegal: The power company had failed to get a government waiver from the standard fee-for-service payment, despite assuring McKinsey that it had done so.\u201cFor the scale of the fee, they were prepared to throw caution to the wind, and maybe because they thought they couldn\u2019t be touched,\u201d said David Lewis, executive director of Corruption Watch, a local advocacy group.If McKinsey fell short in vetting the Eskom contract, the same could be said about the scrutiny of its minority partner, a company called Trillian Management Consulting.McKinsey\u2019s putative marriage to Trillian produced its first awkward moments when its chief executive, Bianca Goodson, showed up angry at the consultancy\u2019s Sandton headquarters on a January evening in 2016. Under McKinsey\u2019s agreement with Eskom, Ms. Goodson\u2019s company was supposed to provide consulting support, but with only two employees was unsure how to do that.Feeling ignored and marginalized, Ms. Goodson planned to raise her concerns at a meeting of McKinsey partners. Four hours in, she got her chance. But before she could finish, Ms. Goodson wrote in an account later submitted to Parliament, a McKinsey team leader abruptly left the room, another partner said not to worry too much about work because she would still get her financial cut, and another made \u201cwhipping sounds and gestures,\u201d an apparent inside joke, prompting laughter among the partners.Ms. Goodson left more disillusioned than before she arrived. Two months later, she resigned.During the internal debate over the Eskom deal, several partners had questioned whether McKinsey knew enough about who precisely was behind Trillian. Now rumors began reaching the McKinsey office that Trillian Management and its parent company, Trillian Capital, might have ties to the Gupta family.McKinsey knew little about Trillian \u2014 a new company, with no track record, that had broken off from McKinsey\u2019s previous minority partner, Regiments, after a business dispute. What\u2019s more, Trillian had refused McKinsey\u2019s requests to divulge its ownership.Even so, McKinsey chose to kick the can down the road and continue working. What McKinsey did not yet know was that Eskom\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Molefe, had placed dozens of phone calls to one of the Gupta brothers during and after contract negotiations.An influential senior partner in Johannesburg, David Fine, had grown increasingly uneasy about Trillian, according to his testimony to Parliament. One source of concern: Over the objections of two senior partners, McKinsey\u2019s team leader, Mr. Sagar, had been meeting with Eskom and Trillian without any other McKinsey officials present.Eventually McKinsey hired a private investigative firm to dig into Trillian\u2019s background. When that did not produce any definitive leads, Mr. Fine began running internet searches on companies named Trillian and found the name \u201cS. Essa\u201d listed as a director. Weeks later, the South African media revealed the majority owner of Trillian as none other than Salim Essa, the Gupta associate whose shell companies had received more than $100 million in the locomotive deal.On March 30, 2016, McKinsey told Eskom in writing that it was severing its ties to Trillian. But while McKinsey had finally taken a stand, it quietly undercut that decision by continuing to work alongside Trillian \u2014 independently, rather than as a subcontractor.To the consternation of some McKinsey partners, that arrangement continued until the end of June 2016. With the local media revealing ever more of the Gupta family\u2019s influence, Eskom \u2014 not McKinsey \u2014 prematurely terminated the contract. Mr. Molefe resigned that November. Mr. Molefe did not respond to requests for comment for this article; a lawyer for the Guptas declined to comment.The abbreviated tab for barely eight months of work: nearly $100 million, with close to 40 percent going to Trillian.In the United States, with an economy over 50 times as big as South Africa\u2019s, a contract that size might have gone unnoticed. But in South Africa, millions of dollars flowing out of a struggling public utility and into the pockets of consultants driving Porsches and Ferraris created an unsavory image that required a response.Yet McKinsey kept quiet, one of many decisions the firm would come to regret.Late the next year, South Africa\u2019s National Prosecuting Authority would deliver a stinging summation of the Eskom case. McKinsey, the prosecutors would allege, had been instrumental \u201cin creating a veil of legitimacy to what was otherwise a nonexistent, unlawful arrangement.\u201d That arrangement, in turn, allowed a company controlled by the Gupta associate, Mr. Essa, to profit.That conclusion was based in part on a letter obtained by a widely respected human-rights advocate, Geoff Budlender, who had been asked to investigate Trillian, including its ties to McKinsey. For the first time, McKinsey was being publicly held to account.Mr. Budlender asked to interview McKinsey but was told to put his questions in writing, which he did. In response to one question, McKinsey denied working \u201con any projects\u201d with Trillian, as either a subcontractor or a black-empowerment partner.With his trap laid, Mr. Budlender pounced. He attached a Feb. 9, 2016, letter from the McKinsey team leader, Mr. Sagar, to Eskom. \u201cAs you know,\u201d Mr. Sagar had written, \u201cMcKinsey has subcontracted a portion of the services to be performed\u201d to Trillian. The letter went further and authorized Eskom to pay Trillian directly, rather than through McKinsey, as was customary for a subcontractor.Asked to explain the conflicting answers, a McKinsey lawyer, Benedict Phiri, took weeks to respond, saying he needed to speak with his colleagues. Finally, he wrote that, given ongoing legal disputes, it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to comment.Mr. Budlender concluded that McKinsey\u2019s denial was false. \u201cI have to say that I find this inexplicable, particularly having regard to the fact that McKinsey presents itself as an international leader in management consulting and given the widespread public interest in this matter,\u201d he wrote.In the interview with The Times, the McKinsey managing partner, Mr. Barton, said the office leadership in Johannesburg had been unaware of Mr. Sagar\u2019s letter, and had only learned of it from Mr. Budlender. But three current or former McKinsey partners told The Times that Mr. Sagar\u2019s German colleague, Mr. Weiss, and the firm\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Phiri, also knew of the letter.McKinsey\u2019s lawyers said that the letter should never have been sent. Even so, they said, the authorization to pay Trillian referred to another, much smaller contract, and it was predicated on Trillian\u2019s meeting certain conditions.In late 2017, a parliamentary committee began calling witnesses as part of its own investigation of state capture. One witness was Ms. Goodson, the former Trillian executive, who said she had been told soon after being hired that Mr. Essa owned Trillian. She also testified about meeting Mr. Sagar and Mr. Essa in Melrose Arch, a wealthy enclave with high-end retail and sidewalk dining where deals are made.McKinsey sent Mr. Fine, who withstood nearly four hours of questioning. He addressed criticism head on, beginning with the size of the contract. \u201cWe should have absolutely had a fee structure that was capped,\u201d he said.Mr. Fine, who had no role in the Eskom contract, said he had been assured that Eskom did derive measurable benefits from McKinsey\u2019s consulting. Yet his comments betrayed an element of doubt. As a native South African, he said, he couldn\u2019t help asking himself, \u201cIf these benefits were there, why then has the price of electricity gone up and has the liquidity position of Eskom deteriorated?\u201dMr. Barton, in his interview with The Times, insisted that his firm helped Eskom solve important problems. He expressed frustration at the overarching narrative that McKinsey took money for little work. \u201cThere was real work being done,\u201d he said.Grieve Chelwa, an economics lecturer at the University of Cape Town, said in an interview that McKinsey\u2019s top ranks in South Africa were overwhelmingly filled by Europeans who \u201cmay not have had the political antennae\u201d to pick up potential problems.\u201cThe less charitable interpretation is that they knew,\u201d said Dr. Chelwa, until recently a fellow at Harvard\u2019s Center for African Studies. \u201cThey made a risk calculation that we know what is going on or we have an idea what is going on, but then there is 1.6 billion rand to make, and what is the probability that all this falls in our faces? They made that kind of calculation and they said, \u2018O.K., the risk is worth doing,\u2019 and they did it.\u201dIt is a risk McKinsey now regrets taking.The advocacy group Corruption Watch referred the firm\u2019s conduct to the United States Justice Department for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. McKinsey declined to say whether federal investigators had contacted the firm; the Justice Department declined to comment. The National Prosecuting Authority in South Africa has frozen the proceeds of the Eskom contract, pending the completion of the government\u2019s investigation. And several banks and corporations, including the South African arm of Coca-Cola, have said they will not do business with McKinsey until investigations are concluded.McKinsey vehemently denies breaking any laws, and says that this view has been validated by a monthslong internal inquiry involving more than 50 lawyers reviewing millions of documents and emails.The firm does admit mistakes. McKinsey will now give state-owned companies the same scrutiny it would government agencies or ministries. That policy may have a major impact in China, where McKinsey has advised at least 19 of the biggest state-owned companies as well as the country\u2019s powerful planning agency.In a statement, McKinsey said that it was \u201cnot careful enough about who we associated with,\u201d that it should not have worked alongside Trillian after cutting its ties and that it did not communicate properly with Mr. Budlender. \u201cWe are embarrassed by these failings, and we apologize to the people of South Africa, our clients, our colleagues and our alumni, who rightly expect more of our firm.\u201dAt the end of June, Mr. Barton, 55, will step down as previously planned. McKinsey\u2019s nearly 600 senior partners voted to replace Mr. Barton with Kevin Sneader, a British citizen. Last weekend, as The Times was preparing this article after weeks of questioning McKinsey about its secretive culture, The Financial Times published an interview with Mr. Sneader, who said the firm could no longer \u201chide from the outside world.\u201dMr. Sagar has left the firm with his full benefits in place. Mr. Weiss has been sanctioned, though McKinsey declined to say what that involved. The firm\u2019s Johannesburg lawyer, Mr. Phiri, resigned, and the head of McKinsey\u2019s Africa practice was transferred to Hong Kong.Mr. Fine, who now leads McKinsey\u2019s worldwide public-sector practice in London, cast the fallout from Eskom in personal terms. \u201cI have seen the anger and disappointment in my clients\u2019 eyes,\u201d he told the South African Parliament. He added, \u201cI\u2019ve experienced rejection from people that I really love and trust, and that\u2019s been hard.\u201dWalt Bogdanich reported from Johannesburg, and Michael Forsythe from New York.

Those partners have included 60 device makers that used application programming interfaces, also known as A.P.I.s, so Facebook could run on their gadgets.The European Union has passed such legislation, called the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., which forces companies such as Facebook to do a better job shielding individual data.

{"Headline": "Tax Havens Blunt Impact of Corporate Tax Cut, Economists Say", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new corporate tax cuts are unlikely to stimulate the level of job creation and wage growth that the Trump administration has promised, a trio of prominent economists has concluded, because high tax rates were not pushing much investment out of the United States in the first place.\u201cThis idea that if you cut taxes, you\u2019ll attract a lot of physical capital, a lot of investment to the United States, I don\u2019t think is supported by the evidence,\u201d said Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the paper\u2019s authors. \u201cPaper profits \u2014 that doesn\u2019t boost wages for workers. What boosts wages is actual factories.\u201dThroughout the debate over the tax bill, Republicans cast the country\u2019s corporate tax rate as uncompetitive when compared with nations such as Ireland and Canada, and said the rate was pushing American multinationals to park their profits in other countries where their tax bills would be lower.The new research concludes that assumption is wrong. \u201cMachines don\u2019t move to low-tax places,\u201d the economists write, \u201cpaper profits do.\u201dThe research by Mr. Zucman, Mr. Torslov and Mr. Wier employs a first-of-its-kind method to assess how big a share of profits multinational corporations stash overseas. They draw on international data to determine a ratio of pretax profits to wages at individual companies, for both locally owned firms and foreign firms operating in those countries.They find that multinationals operating in tax havens are far more profitable than locally owned companies in those countries, and that their profits dwarf what they pay workers. They break the numbers down to show the outsize profits are largely due to money being \u201cshifted\u201d \u2014 on paper \u2014 into those havens.\u201cIt\u2019s very striking in the sense that these multinational companies, they are the main winners from globalization. And they are also those who have seen their tax rates fall a lot,\u201d Mr. Zucman said. \u201cThis means that other actors in the economy, they have to pay more in order to take up the tax burden.\u201dMr. Zucman said the results should cause policymakers to rethink their efforts on several fronts. They suggest, he said, that advanced countries are underestimating economic growth and undercollecting corporate tax revenues, because they are missing the profits that have been shifted on paper by multinational corporations.Mr. Zucman said it was too soon to tell whether those measures would succeed. But he said it was clear that policymakers should worry less about outdoing their allies with corporate tax cuts, and instead consider steps to crack down on profit-shifting, such as taxing profits where companies register their sales.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name and surname of one of the authors of the research on corporate profits.

{"Headline": "Harley-Davidson Shows Why Corporations Cannot Keep Silent in Trade Wars", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorporate America has largely avoided sticking its head over the parapet in the trade war. That\u2019s going to become harder as the bellicose rhetoric transforms into action.Harley-Davidson\u2019s move reveals the uncomfortable choices companies face as they navigate escalating trade tensions. The company, by making more motorcycles beyond its United States factories, could draw criticism from President Trump and his supporters. But if Harley-Davidson does not adapt to the rising trade barriers, it stands to sell fewer motorcycles, which could harm its profits.So far, large companies have mostly left it to their trade groups to speak out against Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies. But when financial pain threatens to become consequential, public companies are obliged to publicly quantify it. Almost by default, then, they are forced to enter the fight. And as more companies do what Harley-Davidson did, the debate over trade wars will focus on the nitty-gritty.The European Union last week raised tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles to 31 percent from 6 percent. The company said the increase would add $2,200 on average to the cost of a motorcycle exported to Europe from the United States. Harley-Davidson said it would not raise the suggested prices of its motorcycles to cover the cost of the tariffs. It expects, at least for a little while, to bear the additional expense of the tariffs itself, which would cost the company an estimated $90 million to $100 million a year. Over the longer term, Harley-Davidson, based in Milwaukee, intends to make more motorcycles in countries that are not subject to the tariffs. That plan could take nine to 18 months to put into effect, the company said.Still, negative corporate announcements bring a jarring specificity to trade wars that can spread through financial markets and the wider economy. Harley-Davidson\u2019s stock was down over 7 percent on Monday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down 1.8 percent. The benchmark is now only up 1.1 percent since the end of 2017 and down 5.9 percent from its all-time high. The trade war appears to have halted the Trump rally. And there are a lot more Harley-Davidsons on the stock market.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Escalates Trade Fight, China Can Take the Hit", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Thanks to President Trump\u2019s tariffs, Americans will soon be paying more for a wide variety of Chinese-made goods, and some American customers may end up buying from other countries instead.For now, China can live with that.The tariffs could spread, of course. Mr. Trump escalated his trade fight with China on Monday, saying the administration would identify another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that could face 10 percent tariffs. The president criticized China\u2019s actions, saying it was determined to keep the United States \u201cat a permanent and unfair disadvantage.\u201d The question is whether Mr. Trump will make good on his threats.China could retaliate with its own tariffs on the United States\u2019 far smaller exports in the other direction across the Pacific. Plus, it could impose punitive measures against American companies doing business here.Still, the absence of immediate impact could also give both sides breathing room to calm down.\u201cThe strain on the top leadership as it tries to fend off a trade war with the U.S. as well as de-risk China\u2019s financial sector is considerable,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist with Enodo Economics, a London research firm specializing in China. \u201cThey cannot afford to drop the ball on either front.\u201dFor both sides, the issue has become far more than a struggle over nuts-and-bolts economics. It has become a battle over which country will dominate the high-wage, high-skill industries of tomorrow. Washington and Beijing alike see those industries as essential to protecting national security and to creating jobs.The Trump administration is pushing hard for curbs on China\u2019s $300 billion government program to bolster these industries, called Made in China 2025. Beijing aims to make the country a leader in the manufacturing of advanced products, including computer microchips and commercial aircraft. The Trump administration\u2019s statement announcing tariffs managed to mention the Chinese industrial policy program no fewer than five times.But China appears just as determined to preserve the program. And the trade issue has become so high profile that the Chinese public has come to expect that Beijing will push back hard against the Trump administration\u2019s trade measures.\u201cThis pressure will be high,\u201d said Tu Xinquan, the director of the China Institute of World Trade Organization Studies in Beijing. \u201cThere is no way to move back.\u201dWhile the American tariffs could hurt specific Chinese industries, they will probably do little to hit China\u2019s overall growth.Under the tariffs announced on Friday, American buyers must pay 25 percent of the wholesale cost of Chinese-made goods when they hit American docks. The tariffs will ultimately be levied on $50 billion worth of Chinese exports, including electric cars and aircraft navigational equipment.While $50 billion sounds like a lot, that represents just 0.4 percent of the Chinese economy. The details suggest the impact may be even less.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.Some American buyers of Chinese goods may simply choose to pay the newly imposed tariffs rather than find new suppliers elsewhere. Brad Setser, a Treasury official in the Obama administration who is now an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China\u2019s exports to the United States in the affected categories could easily be halved by the tariffs. But they would not disappear entirely, as some Chinese products would still be competitive in terms of cost.Some of the same goods could probably be sold to other countries at slightly lower prices, further limiting the effect on the Chinese economy, Mr. Setser said.Moreover, China\u2019s exports could grow in other areas to offset any drop. Its exports to the United States are already increasing by more than $50 billion each year, and more than 90 percent of China\u2019s exports to the United States are not covered by the tariffs.\u201cEven with tariffs on one-tenth of total imports from China, overall imports from China would likely rise,\u201d Mr. Setser said.The tariffs could have a longer-term effect on China, however.Devised as essentially a pre-emptive strike against Chinese subsidies in the Made in China 2025 program, the Trump tariffs could limit eventual sales from these industries. And with the European Union also protesting the Made in China 2025 program, those exports to Europe could suffer, too.Longer term, the tariffs could spur American companies to move their factories elsewhere. But companies have been reluctant so far to move, as China\u2019s world-class transportation system and well-trained work force still make it highly competitive in all but the lowest-skill, lowest-wage industries.On the flip side, the tariffs could help the Chinese government take the heat if the broader economy starts to falter. The economy could slow further as Beijing intensifies debt reduction efforts. Chinese leaders could blame Washington for the slowdown instead.\u201cThey\u2019ve done the things they said,\u201d said Andrew Polk, a co-founder of Trivium/China, a Beijing economic consulting firm. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give them that.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

The floor was littered with colorful condoms and other sexual accouterments.The effect was maximal, but in this show on the periphery of the Biennale, it was accomplished with economy.\u201cWe had no one funding this project, and no institution behind us,\u201d said Octave Perrault, a Paris-based architect and one of the curators of the Cruising Pavilion. \u201cIt was just friends helping out and funds from our own pockets.\u201d\u201cCruising was a common subject for us, but we noticed there wasn\u2019t a culture of exhibitions devoted to the topic,\u201d Mr. Mateos, a Paris-based curator, said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much interest from institutions, especially architectural ones, so we wanted to confront this subculture through architecture.\u201dYet even in a Biennale inspired by the theme \u201cFreespace,\u201d the Cruising Pavilion stands out as an event with skin in the game.The team found the venue, a former warehouse called Spazio Punch on Giudecca, away from the pressing crowds of the city\u2019s tourist hot spots. Getting there involves a trip by vaporetto and a stroll among buildings that once comprised one of Venice\u2019s industrial centers.As visitors step through the entryway, they are greeted by a shadowy atmosphere evoking archetypal cruising sites. Two wood-framed towers \u2014 each three stories high and accessible by internal stairs \u2014 flank the expansive interior at the architectural and artistic heart of the pavilion.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want this to necessarily look like an exhibition,\u201d Mr. Perrault said. \u201cWe wanted to get our hands dirty, to show projects and artworks, but also to work with the space directly.\u201dThe exhibition captures some of the thrill of its subject matter. On the opening night, poppers \u2014 inhalants sometimes huffed during sex for a quick high \u2014 were passed around like hors d\u2019oeuvres, and a D.J. played heavy beats for a fashionably-dressed crowd dancing in the balmy air.In foregrounding the history of this overlooked place on the sidelines of the Biennale, the exhibit made a point of reclaiming queer history and made a case for its place as a topic in contemporary architecture. Still, the pavilion predominantly focuses on cruising between gay men, though other members of the L.G.B.T. community are represented, too.But the concept for the exhibition is, by its nature, limited. The curators \u2014 who began planning the show in February, a relatively short lead time \u2014 wanted to demonstrate the balance between historical ideas of cruising and its modern forms found in hookup apps like Grindr.For the Spanish architect Andr\u00e9s Jaque, director of the Office for Political Innovation and a professor at Columbia University, who designed one of the exhibits in the Cruising Pavilion, Grindr is key to understanding how social media allows \u201cusers to create another reality that is not necessarily following the existing rules of offline space,\u201d he said.Mr. Jaque (pronounced HA-kay) recreated a domestic scene inside one of the towers. An inflatable mattress is installed on the plywood floor, accompanied by a MacBook laptop that screens films by his architecture firm. The videos illustrate Grindr\u2019s use as more than a technical expedient to hooking up.One film follows Syrian refugees living in Europe, who used the app to share hard-won wisdom with new arrivals. There, the app fostered connections between refugees, who exchanged tips for facing fundamental challenges like navigating immigration bureaucracy, looking for a job or finding a place to live.\u201cIt was an opportunity for the app to become a platform for people to offer each other support,\u201d Mr. Jaque said.The project also highlights the negative potential of the app in the hands of oppressive regimes. One film documents how Grindr has been used by government vice squads to track gay men, as in Saudi Arabia, where Mr. Jaque said individuals can face prison sentences for same-sex activity.That project, an open-air pavilion for the Swiss Expo in Yverdon-les-Bains, immersed visitors in a catwalk structure shrouded in fog and hovering over Lake Neuch\u00e2tel.\u201cThe atmosphere of the Blur pavilion was quite literally that of a steam room, a public space that makes private action possible,\u201d Mr. Renfro said. \u201cIt\u2019s the logic of an obscured atmosphere that allows for transgressive behavior to be undetected by all but the knowing participants.\u201dThe curators of the Cruising Pavilion included the full sweep of cruising\u2019s past, comparing the exhibition\u2019s recent works to historical instances of cruising. It departs from the Biennale\u2019s mainstream in both subject and format; critics have said as much, describing it as a world apart from presentations in the Giardini and a provocative \u2014 but not frivolous \u2014 take on a once-taboo topic.As it happens, the pavilion\u2019s exhibition space is not far from one of Venice\u2019s most notorious historical hookup spots: a 19th-century garden on the east side of Giudecca.The curators were able to briefly reopen the garden, which has been shuttered for decades, on the first day of the exhibition.\u201cThis,\u201d Mr. Perrault said of the garden, \u201cis where these gay heroes were going.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s New Plan to Dismantle Obamacare Comes With Political Risks", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act with a Republican-controlled Congress, the Trump administration is seizing on a different strategy for dismantling the law, one fraught with political risk. It is asking a court to throw out major elements, including hugely popular provisions that protect sick people from being denied health insurance or charged higher rates.Republicans are divided between conservatives who had vowed to eliminate the law and moderates, some in tough races, who want to preserve the popular protections for people who are sick.Asked about the Justice Department move, Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, spoke instead about the Democrats.\u201cDemocrats destroyed the health care system as we knew when they rammed Obamacare down our throats,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cand now all they can talk about is moving to a single-payer health care system.\u201dThe Affordable Care Act has already survived several court challenges, and this latest test of its durability could take months or years to go through the legal system. But the uncertainty it creates in the meantime could rattle the law\u2019s insurance marketplaces just as insurers are starting to file rate requests for next year. The companies were already nervous because of Congress\u2019s decision last year to eliminate the penalty for going without health coverage.Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, predicted that the resurrection of the issue would mobilize voters, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing quite like the administration taking an action in court to illustrate the simple fact that they are still coming after your health care.\u201dDemocrats around the country were already working hard on Friday to get that message across. In Pennsylvania, where Republicans last month nominated Representative Lou Barletta for Senate, the state Democratic Party issued a statement that warned, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s lapdog Lou Barletta will throw his full support behind this attempt to end coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201dSenator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who voted against the Republican repeal bills in the Senate last year, also expressed concern about the administration\u2019s new push, saying it \u201ccreates further uncertainty that could ultimately result in higher costs for millions of Americans and undermine essential protections for people with pre-existing conditions, such as asthma, cancer, heart disease, arthritis and diabetes.\u201dBut that was not the talking point of the party\u2019s election arm. Mr. Hunt shifted the focus to Democratic calls for a single-payer system, saying, \u201cMassive tax increases and reduced quality of care are about as popular as its architect: Nancy Pelosi.\u201dRepublicans have been trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, a centerpiece of President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, since it was enacted in 2010 without any Republican votes. Attempts to repeal it in Congress have failed, but opponents of the law have also filed scores of lawsuits challenging various provisions.The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld a major provision of the law that required most Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. The court said that while this \u201cindividual mandate\u201d exceeded Congress\u2019s power to regulate commerce, it could be upheld as an exercise of Congress\u2019s taxing power. But last year the Republican-controlled Congress eliminated those penalties as part of the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that Mr. Trump signed in December.Two months later, Texas and the 19 other states filed suit in the Federal District Court in Fort Worth, asserting that the mandate could no longer be justified as a tax and should therefore be struck down \u2014 and arguing that as a result, the rest of the law must be invalidated, too.The Justice Department brief did not go so far, but it said that Judge Reed O\u2019Connor should void both the mandate and the protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions, while leaving in place the expansion of Medicaid in more than 30 states.Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that it is \u201ca rare case\u201d for the Justice Department not to defend provisions of a law but added that he could not find any \u201creasonable arguments\u201d to support their constitutionality.If the administration prevails in the case, the full force of the decision would not hit until after the midterm elections on Nov. 6. But insurers said the legal debate alone could cause turmoil in insurance markets this summer.\u201cAt the very least it adds uncertainty at exactly the moment when plans are trying to set rates for next year,\u201d said Ceci Connolly, the chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans. \u201cAt the worst it could strip away guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.\u201dThe main trade association for health insurers came out strongly against the administration\u2019s position.\u201cRemoving those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older Americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019,\u201d said Matt Eyles, the president and chief executive of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers.The Trump administration\u2019s move fueled accusations that it was politicizing the Justice Department, which is supposed to defend the constitutionality of federal statutes in court \u2014 even if the administration in power does not like them \u2014 if reasonable arguments can be made.\u201cJust read the brief of the states that intervened to defend the law,\u201d Mr. Verrilli said in a statement. \u201cA compelling defense of the law is right there in black and white. This is a sad moment.\u201dThree career lawyers in the department\u2019s civil division withdrew from the case earlier on Thursday and did not sign the brief. A Justice Department spokeswoman said the lawyers\u2019 withdrawal had been a department decision, declining to specify whether the lawyers had personally objected to continuing on the case. But Martin S. Lederman, a Georgetown University law professor who was a Justice Department official in the Obama administration, called the mass withdrawal a likely sign of distress.\u201cJustice Department attorneys don\u2019t withdraw from cases simply because the government is making an argument the lawyers think the courts should or would reject,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch withdrawals are exceedingly rare \u2014 typically only when the argument is indefensible, as they are here.\u201dThe Texas case will be decided first by Judge O\u2019Connor, a conservative appointee of President George W. Bush. The case would then go to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where appointees of Republican presidents hold a 10-5 majority over Democratic appointees. Whatever the lower courts decide, the case seems destined to reach the Supreme Court.An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misstated Senator Susan Collins\u2019s votes on efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

{"Headline": "Four Tips on How to Rescue a Bankrupt Business", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "Wealth MattersBuying a business out of bankruptcy might seem like a good deal, but it comes with risks. Heed this advice from others who invest in distressed assets.Supported byWith distressed assets, one investor\u2019s loss can be another\u2019s gain.Robert Lomison has worked in the funeral business for nearly four decades, building his wealth buying mismanaged cemeteries and funeral homes. One of his standout acquisitions was a collection of struggling funeral homes and cemeteries in central Texas.Bruce Deifik saw a different opportunity to resurrect a business from the dead. He bought the Revel Casino in Atlantic City, which opened in 2012 but had fallen in and out of bankruptcy.Buying a business out of bankruptcy might seem like a good deal. But it is a risky investment, even in a booming economy. After all, someone else tried with the same business and failed.If the new owners are savvy, they stand to make a considerable return on their investments. But sometimes they are lucky to break even or escape without going bankrupt themselves.\u201cAnyone who wants to make money by buying businesses out of bankruptcy has to have a stomach that will digest anthrax,\u201d said Scott H. McNutt, founder and principal of the McNutt Law Group, which focuses on insolvency.The opportunity for a buyer is that any equity in the business held by former investors is wiped out in bankruptcy. Banks that hold debt on the company will accept a lower amount than they are owed. Still, the process takes time and a lot of money.\u201cIf you want to buy something from a bank, you\u2019ve got to hire lawyers and accountants and you generally have to produce a valuation methodology that justifies your price,\u201d Mr. McNutt said. \u201cYou also have to overcome objections from the people who are getting wiped out. That said, if you have a lot of capital and a strong stomach, it\u2019s sometimes an opportunity.\u201dThat opportunity calls for as much caution as strategy. Here are some takeaways from people who invest in bankrupt businesses and have survived to tell their tale.Mr. Lomison saw an opening with a group of three funeral homes and two cemeteries in Texas that he said had been mismanaged.\u201cFamilies were buying something \u2014 grave markets, headstones, burial vaults \u2014 and they wouldn\u2019t deliver it for six months,\u201d he said. \u201cFamilies were at the gates protesting.\u201dMr. Lomison paid $800,000 for a $4.6 million loan in default. But he knew that was just the beginning of his investment. He had to give clients the headstones and markers they had purchased. He also upgraded a fleet of limousines and hearses.That was 10 years ago, and now he is realizing the return on his investment. \u201cIt\u2019s a slow process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t something that happened overnight. It was customer by customer.\u201dYet he knew the space, having bought and sold some 45 funeral homes and cemeteries in his career. He also knew that well-run funeral homes and cemeteries were highly profitable.Some investors in distressed properties find partners with expertise.Ivan Q. Zinn, the chief investment officer of Atalaya Capital Management, a $3.5 billion investment fund, said he formed a partnership with a real estate investor in Colorado to buy properties at a steep discount. He said he could do that only by having someone there with a deep knowledge of the market.\u201cHe\u2019s really adding value in the context of being the on-the-ground operator,\u201d Mr. Zinn said of his partner, Andrew R. Klein of Westside Investment Partners. \u201cHe can figure out how something can go from one type of operator to another and know what these residential lots should trade for.\u201dMr. Klein gave an example of a 700,000-square-foot-building they recently bought where the main tenant, who occupied 400,000 square feet, was leaving. That would be unappealing, if not disastrous, to many owners. But for Mr. Klein, \u201cit\u2019s about managing that risk,\u201d he said.\u201cThe big false indicator is how much money the other people have already lost,\u201d Mr. McNutt said. Buyers think it is an indicator of value, but it often is not. Distressed properties often require more investment.The Revel Casino, on the north end of Atlantic City\u2019s boardwalk, cost more than $2.4 billion to build. Mr. Deifik paid $200 million to buy it out of bankruptcy, then spent another $200 million to update it. He plans to reopen it on June 28 as the Ocean Resort Casino.\u201cI\u2019m betting that it\u2019s a great buy,\u201d Mr. Deifik said. \u201cMy operating expenses are substantially less than the group that opened it in 2012.\u201dBut someone else tried before him. The previous owner, Glenn Straub, a well-known Atlantic City property owner, paid less than $90 million and reportedly spent $1 million a month for two years to cover its costs.Mr. Deifik was granted a casino license on Thursday, only a week before the casino is scheduled to open. He knows he has a lot of work still ahead. He still has to meet a $115 million annual payroll. But he is optimistic: He has plans to complete 12 unfinished floors and increase the number of rooms to 2,000 from 1,400.\u201cIf we give the customer what he wants, if we deliver service at a high level, I think the casino has an opportunity to rise,\u201d he said.\u201cThe previous owner owed everyone from the food and beverage people to the taxman,\u201d Mr. Cannon said. \u201cIt was in bad shape.\u201dThe business\u2019s economics had fallen so far that he had to compete with a buyer who wanted to tear down the diner and redevelop the land.The couple paid $3.9 million for the property, on the basis of the diner\u2019s reputation and its location at a busy intersection. Committed to restoring the property, they set about renovating it and re-establishing relationships with suppliers.Yet Mr. Cannon said their philosophy since reopening in March was to just give it a try. \u201cWe kind of fell into it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t planning for it.\u201dOne of the risks in buying any bankrupt business is that wiping out the debt may not be enough to make the business profitable. It may just make it less unprofitable, Mr. McNutt said.\u201cIt\u2019s like the old rule about buying vintage cars,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that some dermatologist wanted to spend $150,000 restoring his old Beetle does not mean it\u2019s worth $150,000. It means some dermatologist had $150,000 and wanted to spend it on his old Beetle.\u201dSo what should buyers do? Hire experts and take to the white board.That\u2019s what Peter Patel did when he bought a coal mine outside Pittsburgh.At the time, Mr. Patel had experience owning pharmaceutical companies and hotels. He had never owned or even worked at a coal mine. But when he got a call in 2016 to buy one, the opportunity made sense to him. The mine had failed for two reasons: poor management, caused by fighting between the partners, and a collapse in coal prices.Mr. Patel bought the mine for $5 million at a time when coal was trading for $80 to $90 a ton. He upgraded the equipment by buying newer pieces from other struggling companies. And he brought in a marketing team to find new markets for the coal. Then the price of coal began to rise, topping $300 a ton.Mr. Patel said his lack of knowledge about coal was not an impediment.\u201cThe most important thing I understood was, every industry needed a structure and you needed to stick to a business plan,\u201d he said. \u201cMost often, a business isn\u2019t well organized and we don\u2019t stick to the plan.\u201dHe is looking to buy a second mine in Arkansas. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stay focused no matter what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a distressed asset, a lot of problems are coming at you.\u201dThat\u2019s good advice for any business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facing Defeat on Brexit, May Gives Ground to U.K.\u2019s Parliament", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, on Tuesday promised greater control for Parliament over withdrawal from the European Union, after a threatened rebellion by lawmakers forced her into a new and potentially significant retreat in the country\u2019s troubled exit from the bloc.The day began on an ominous note with the resignation of one of Mrs. May\u2019s ministers over her plans for withdrawal, known as Brexit, and got steadily worse for the prime minister when some of her rebel lawmakers combined with opposition parties, posing the threat of a damaging defeat.The vote concerned an amendment that had been added by the House of Lords to Mrs. May\u2019s main Brexit legislation. The amendment would have given lawmakers more control over the process by, among other things, avoiding a last-minute, take-it-or-leave-it vote on whatever package the government negotiated with Brussels.Mrs. May had appealed to lawmakers not to support the amendment, arguing that it would weaken her negotiating hand with the European Union. Ultimately, they were placated by promises of a timely vote and adherence to some of the technical guarantees demanded by a Conservative rebel, Dominic Grieve, about what happens if a Brexit deal proves unacceptable to Parliament.The retreat is only the latest setback for Mrs. May who last week averted the resignation of her Brexit secretary, David Davis, then faced criticism in leaked comments from her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who accused her government of lacking \u201cguts.\u201dAll this is before Mrs. May meets other European Union leaders at a summit this month for talks that are likely to be difficult.The way the withdrawal was being pursued was \u201cdetrimental to the people we are elected to serve,\u201d added Mr. Lee, who will remain a lawmaker.Since losing her parliamentary majority last year, Mrs. May has been forced to adjudicate between warring factions within her Conservative Party, something that has led her to postpone a number of important decisions.As a consequence, almost two years after the 2016 referendum that mandated British withdrawal, the British government has been unable to outline what type of economic relationship it wants with the European Union, which is its biggest trading partner.Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet is split between those who want to keep close ties, in order to protect the economy, and hard-line Brexit supporters who want to cut free in the hope of striking trade deals further afield.A fierce dispute has also broken out over a British contingency plan to prevent the imposition of border checks between Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland which will remain in the European Union.This idea would involve keeping many European trade rules until technological tools \u2014 like tracking devices or online customs declarations \u2014 are ready that would eliminate the need for border checks. Some Brexit supporters fear that such a plan could keep Britain tied indefinitely into Europe\u2019s regulatory system.On Tuesday, the pro-Brexit Conservative lawmaker, Edward Leigh, warned that defeating Mrs. May on the Lords amendment \u201cwould be a catastrophe for the government,\u201d whose opponents, he said, want to \u201ccreate a situation in which the whole process is frustrated.\u201dDominic Grieve, one of the Conservative rebels, told lawmakers that \u201cthe irrationality of the debate we are having on the details of Brexit is truly chilling.\u201dElsewhere in Parliament, Arron Banks, a high-profile businessman who helped finance one of the pro-Brexit referendum campaigns in 2016, played down the significance of meetings with Russian diplomats, and said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of collusion with Moscow over the campaign of British withdrawal.Mr. Banks, the combative founder of Leave.EU, appeared before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee two days after it emerged that, in addition to a lunch he had made public with Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador to Britain, there had been two further meetings, and that he had discussed a potential Russian mining venture, which was not pursued.At one encounter, after the American elections, Mr. Banks and his spokesman Andy Wigmore passed along contact details for the Trump transition team, which they had gotten on a visit to Trump Tower in New York, where they met the incoming president.During their occasionally confrontational testimony, Mr. Banks and Mr. Wigmore admitted that they sometimes exaggerated to journalists, particularly during the referendum campaign.Finally, as the hearing ran long, Mr. Banks cut short his appearance saying that he had a lunch appointment, telling the lawmakers that they could join him if they wanted.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Taunting Mexico, Trump Takes Action With Tariffs. But Do Mexicans Still Care?", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 For more than two years, Donald J. Trump has attacked Mexico to excite his political base, threatening walls, mass deportations and an end to a nearly 25-year free trade deal between Mexico and the United States.As frequent targets of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire, many Mexicans have learned to take it in stride, finding that the bark is often worse than the bite.Almost immediately, Mexico responded with a round of countertariffs, retaliations aimed straight at the heart of Mr. Trump\u2019s base of political support. The reprisal had been drawn up for some time, in anticipation of the tariffs, which were first announced in March and delayed until now.Yet there was no hand-wringing by Mexico, no public uproar or Twitter storm. Just a series of countermeasures, explained in a measured release.Mexico\u2019s response, in some ways, is a reflection of just how accustomed the nation has grown to the actions taken by Mr. Trump. Its position regarding cooperation with the United States \u2014 on trade, migration or security \u2014 \u201cwill not vary, neither because of offensive rhetoric, nor because of unilateral and unjustified measures of this kind,\u201d said Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray.Mexico has adopted a poised and consistent stance in its responses, one it has refined over the course of the two years that Mr. Trump has lashed out at the country with insults and threats, first as a candidate, then as president-elect and now as president.To many analysts, Mexico has learned to soldier past the taunts.\u201cIt is not that we don\u2019t care, it is just that Mexicans have internalized it,\u201d said Carlos Heredia, a professor at CIDE, a Mexico City university. \u201cIt no longer carries the element of surprise. We have been dealing with it and hearing it for two years, so it has already had its effect.\u201dMexico has said repeatedly that the issue of steel tariffs will not define the negotiations over Nafta. And, more broadly, Mexican officials have also said they will not sign anything that is not in their country\u2019s national interest.That Mr. Trump imposed the tariffs on Mexico as part of a global strategy also takes much of the sting out.To many here, the steel tariffs are simply a stronger attempt \u2014 moving from words to action \u2014 to forcefully impose his worldview on the bilateral relationship. Rather than abide by current agreements, or understandings, the United States government has been subsumed by the compulsive, often personal agenda of the president, analysts said.\u201cWhat Trump is doing is imposing his vision of the world,\u201d said Carlos Elizondo, a professor at the School of Government at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education. \u201cThe Mexican government is not letting this pass, but rather putting out the message that we are playing by the rules and that we are all in the same game.\u201dThere are two potential implications for Mexico: One is electoral, the other commercial.Mexico is gearing up for one of the most consequential presidential elections in more than a decade, with the voting set for July 1. But so far, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions have done surprisingly little to move the needle.The candidates largely backed the Mexican government retaliation on Thursday, and more generally they speak with the same voice when it comes to not allowing Mr. Trump to bully Mexico.It has been that way through much of the election cycle here, where domestic issues have dominated the discourse, and Mr. Trump\u2019s potshots have long since become background noise for voters.On the commercial side, however, the implications could be greater. While Mexico responded forcefully, and immediately, any further escalation would certainly carry a price with it \u2014 for both countries.Along with tariffs on flat steel imports from the United States, Mexico will impose tariffs on lamps, pork legs and shoulders, sausages and prepared foods, apples, grapes, cranberries, various cheeses and other products.The products were selected to affect exporters in states that are politically important to Mr. Trump. American agricultural exporters have been particularly concerned that Mexico would retaliate against their products.Mr. Trump\u2019s move could also disrupt the steel market in the region, experts warned, forcing Mexico to look to other trading partners for their supplies. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s obsession with reversing trade deficits, the country that runs a deficit in steel is Mexico, not the United States.According to Mexico\u2019s steel industry association, the United States sold $3.6 billion more to Mexico over the past two years than Mexico sold to the United States.Experts said that tariffs would have an impact on some Mexican steel producers who export specific products to the United States, but that the larger effect might be on the companies in Mexico that import American steel for use in the auto industry.The decision by the Trump administration was explained as a national security measure, a move that summoned sharp rebukes from all nations affected, including Mexico.The administration also said it was conducting a similar investigation into imported cars \u2014 a market where the Mexican economy is deeply intertwined with the United States.For renegotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement, some experts think that the move on Thursday could heighten tensions between the nations during already tense talks. Now that the United States has taken concrete action, the stakes are higher, potentially leading Mexico and Canada to dig in their heels more in the face of American demands.\u201cTrump had delayed the tariffs on Mexico and Canada pending results from the negotiations, and threatening to impose them to pressure more,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Weldon, director of the political science program at the Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology. \u201cTrump may have seen the end of the line.\u201dThe tariffs are also unlikely to force the Mexican government\u2019s hand, especially given current electoral dynamics. The candidate of the governing party, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, is a distant third in polls and is unlikely to win. That means there is little pressure to sign a deal quickly simply to help his campaign.In the short term, analysts expected that the trade battle now underway would quickly result in price increases on certain products on supermarket shelves in Mexico as the retaliatory tariffs take effect.A greater, enduring fear, according to Enrique Dussel Peters, an economist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, is that Mr. Trump will suddenly pull the United States from Nafta, as he has threatened.Mr. Weldon said he has been expecting it. \u201cOthers say, \u2018No one can be that dumb\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cMy response has always been: Don\u2019t bet against his base.\u201d\u201cThat would be a much more serious thing,\u201d he said, \u201cand that would directly hit Mexico.\u201dAzam Ahmed and Kirk Semple contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

Transnational terrorism, waves of displaced populations and seemingly intractable wars present global threats that affect countries far from the region.In Qatar, we believe that the crises in the Middle East are interconnected and require comprehensive solutions, and that peace and stability will be restored only when the region\u2019s countries agree to work together to reach consensus on key challenges, including the destabilizing influence of sectarianism, rising youth unemployment and our common need to diversify our energy-dependent economies.But at a time when Arab allies should be united in facing the atrocity of the mass killings in Syria, the escalating war in Yemen, and the rebuilding of state institutions in Libya and Iraq, some regional players have chosen to pursue petty grievances and selfish ambitions that undermine our unity. Exhibit A: the blockade of my country.For the past year Qatar has been subjected to a reckless and ill-considered blockade imposed by four countries: Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. These nations felt threatened by Qatar\u2019s independent foreign policy and in response, they have closed our borders and barred flights to our country. The blockading countries may have expected to bring Qatar to its knees. If that was their intention, their effort has clearly backfired.Today, Qatar is stronger than it was a year ago. Within 24 hours of the imposition of the blockade, we quickly established new sources and alternate, more sustainable supply routes for basic goods, like food and medicine. In the weeks and months that followed, we signed new, long-term contracts for economic cooperation, at the same time accelerating plans to diversify our economy by diminishing our reliance on our hydrocarbon resources. Last October, months into the blockade, the International Monetary Fund reported that Qatar\u2019s economy was the fastest growing in the Gulf.Meanwhile, the Middle East remains in turmoil. The government of President Bashar al-Assad has consolidated power in Syria, shifting the regional and geopolitical landscape; besieged Palestinians in Gaza have risen up in protest, focusing new attention on the need for a workable peace plan between the Palestinians and the Israelis; and Yemen is entering its third year of war, with tens of thousands already dead and no end in sight. These issues are important to the people of the Arabian Peninsula, and all of them cry out for a united Arab voice.Qatar believes that the stakes are too high, and the time too limited, to focus on differences between and among the Arab states. The administration in Washington clearly shares this view. My counterpart, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has stressed the importance of Gulf unity. President Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to see the Gulf dispute resolved. All agree it is time for this sorry chapter in Gulf history to come to an end.The blockade of Qatar \u2014 now widely viewed as instigated under false pretenses \u2014 has undermined the Middle East\u2019s stability. By now it should be clear that there can be no \u201cwinners\u201d in this dispute. It is therefore time for the blockading nations to abandon their delusions of victory, prioritize the security interests of the entire Middle East and end the blockade.Qatar believes that the Gulf states need to establish a new framework for advancing peace and security. Historically, the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2014 an organization of which three of the blockading countries are a part \u2014 has played a stabilizing role in Gulf affairs. But the G.C.C. was never meant to serve as a regional court, an advocacy group or a policymaking body.The issues confronting the nations of the Arabian Peninsula require a broader platform for dialogue and negotiation. Qatar\u2019s government believes that a new regional pact, unencumbered by the recent rift, could bring back the positive leadership and authority that once existed and that this would help our region to address the economic and political challenges we face. Qatar believes that the current G.C.C. stalemate, in particular, highlights the urgent need for such an agreement.We hope that wisdom will prevail and that our neighbors will join us in creating a new mechanism to promote our collective security interests and advance the cause of peace. By restoring Gulf unity and establishing a new framework for conflict resolution, we can make our region, and the world, more stable and secure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Says He Would Welcome a Meeting With Trump", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said on Sunday during a visit to China that he would meet President Trump \u201cas soon as the American side is ready\u201d but insisted Russia was in no hurry to win readmission to the Group of 7 nations because it already belongs to a Chinese-led grouping that he described as more important.Mr. Putin was speaking at the end of the Shanghai grouping\u2019s annual meeting of leaders in the Chinese port city of Qingdao. The Shanghai organization, which Beijing began in 2001 as an alternative to American-dominated diplomatic groups, includes China, Russia, India, Pakistan and the nations of Central Asia.These nations have more people, more land and, Mr. Putin said, more economic power when output is calculated by purchasing power parity, than the Group of 7, a grouping of American allies, mostly in Europe. The G-7 countries used to dominate the world economy, but lost their edge as China and India surged and Europe and Japan stagnated.The Group of 7 still represents nearly half of the world\u2019s total gross domestic product, but it has slipped behind the nations of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, or S.C.O., when economic power is measured using a formula that adjusts for the relative value of currencies and their purchasing power.\u201cTrue, the seven are still richer in per capita income, as they say, but the S.C.O. economies are larger, and their population is much larger, too \u2014 half the world\u2019s population,\u201d Mr. Putin told reporters in Qingdao, according to a transcript of his remarks issued by the Kremlin.Expelled from the club of rich nations in 2014 after it seized Crimea from Ukraine, Russia has tried to rebrand itself as an Asian power rather than a European one, abandoning visions once eagerly embraced by Mr. Putin of a common economic space stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok.As part of its pivot to the East, Moscow has expanded ties with Beijing and built up its own regional economic and political bloc, known as the Eurasian Economic Union.The shift has yielded only modest economic benefits, with Russia\u2019s two-way trade with China still less than half what it is with Europe, but it has allowed Mr. Putin to slough off his country\u2019s isolation from the West.Asked in Qingdao about the G-7\u2019s tumultuous meeting Friday and Saturday in Canada, Mr. Putin focused on the rift between Europe and the United States on tariffs, which he said \u201cis more significant than any emotional outbursts.\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, the president of the United States said the U.S. is considering the possibility of regulating the additional supply of automotive equipment in the U.S. market,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a serious matter. This can really hurt the economic interests of so many countries, above all European, of course.\u201dNoting that Russia and other members of the Eurasian Economic Union \u201calso have disputes and do not unanimously sign everything at the same time,\u201d he played down the furor over Mr. Trump\u2019s undiplomatic diplomacy: \u201cWe can see that there are internal problems there. Well, it happens.\u201dHe also said he agreed with Mr. Trump on the need for a meeting between the leaders of Russia and the United States.\u201cThe president of the United States has repeatedly said that he considers this meeting expedient,\u201d he said, \u201cand I agree that this is indeed the case.\u201dMr. Putin said that during his last telephone conversation with the American president, Mr. Trump \u201cexpressed his concern about the threat of a new round of the arms race.\u201d\u201cI agree with him,\u201d he said.He said a personal meeting with Mr. Trump would help both countries, whose relations have plunged to their lowest ebb in decades after a series of tit-for-tat sanctions and diplomatic expulsions.\u201cAs soon as the American side is ready, this meeting will be held immediately, depending on my work schedule,\u201d Mr. Putin said.Austria and other European countries, he said, have been discussed as a possible venue for a United States-Russia meeting.\u201cBut I think this is a technicality,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is important is that the meeting, if it takes place, is filled with specific content.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Oil Auction Provides Brazil a Needed Boost", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Oil companies bid for offshore drilling rights in an auction here on Thursday that provided some welcome good news for Brazil\u2019s economy after weeks of political uncertainty and unrest.Thursday\u2019s auction signals that Brazil, Latin America\u2019s biggest economy, could become a more important source of oil for the rest of the world and possibly make up for lower production volumes from countries like Iran and Venezuela. The International Energy Agency has predicted that Brazil will be second only to the United States among non-Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in contributing to the growth in oil supplies over the next several years.The government offered four blocks that hold at least 4 billion barrels of recoverable oil under a thick layer of salt, according to IHS Markit, a research and consulting firm.A consortium of oil companies that included Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and others won one block. Chevron previously won stakes in four exploration blocks in a March auction, which was the first time the company had participated in a Brazilian auction since one of its fields near Rio de Janeiro had an oil spill in 2011. Another consortium made up of Exxon Mobil, Equinor and others, won a block that is considered the most promising of the four areas offered on Thursday. Exxon now owns a stake in 25 blocks in Brazil.A third consortium, which included Petrobras, Equinor and others won the third block; no company was declared the winner of the fourth. Petrobras exercised its option under Brazilian law to take a stake in all three blocks and serve as operator in each one.Once thought to be complex and costly, blocks like those auctioned Thursday \u2014 known as pre-salt areas \u2014 in Brazil have become competitive as oil companies have used improved technology to reduce costs of deepwater drilling and worked in consortiums to reduce their financial risk.\u201cYou are not seeing this in any other area of the world,\u201d said Ricardo Bedregal, who specializes in Latin American oil and gas for IHS Markit.But Brazil\u2019s oil industry remains subject to extensive government interference, as demonstrated by the recent strike. President Michel Temer agreed to subsidize diesel at the pump to get truckers to end their strike.The strike and the government\u2019s response prompted the reform-minded chief executive of Petrobras, Pedro Parente, who had won praise for restoring stability to the company, to resign because he said he could no longer help the company and government.Analysts say the government might be tempted to intervene in the industry and the economy again ahead of a presidential election in October. Brazil\u2019s economy is expected to grow 2.18 percent in 2018, according to a survey of analysts released on Monday by the country\u2019s central bank. That\u2019s down from a predicted 2.7 percent just four weeks ago.An earlier version of this article misstated the type of fuel being subsidized by the Brazilian government. It is diesel only, not gasoline and diesel.Advertisement"}

From Ottawa to Brussels to Seoul, our trading partners are fed up with the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs, and they have given up on trying to charm President Trump or persuade him that free trade is good. To reduce their economic dependence on the United States and their exposure to a potential global trade war, they are forging trade deals that leave us out of the picture altogether.On June 14, Canada\u2019s government asked Parliament to ratify a new version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the United States backed out of last year. On June 18, the European Union trade commissioner visited Australia and three days later, New Zealand to begin negotiations for free-trade agreements; and on June 22, South Korea announced plans to pursue negotiations for its first free-trade agreement with Russia.These moves are a direct response to the Trump administration\u2019s unreliability and unpredictability, and they are a clear sign that the administration\u2019s trade policy priorities \u2014 renegotiating deals and punishing violations \u2014 are not working out as expected.Instead, our closest trading partners are scrambling to find new markets for exports subject to tariff increases by the United States, and to secure new suppliers for the American products that their own countries are planning to hit with retaliatory tariffs.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, for example, has worked diligently to build close ties with the president. But now Japan\u2019s top exports, autos and auto parts, are suddenly facing the threat of a 25 percent tariff. As Mr. Abe told Japanese legislators: \u201cIt\u2019s hard for Japan to understand, and we cannot accept it.\u201dThe tone and policies of the Trump administration have even managed to bring two longtime rivals, China and Mexico, closer together. The two countries once competed head-to-head as low-cost manufacturers, with the United States as the most important market. After Mr. Trump began beating the drum for tariffs and a possible withdrawal from Nafta, Mexico\u2019s economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, called a visit last year to China \u201cstrategic leverage,\u201d saying it \u201csends the signal that we have alternatives\u201d to the United States.China, meanwhile, is on a mission to woo trading partners. Beijing\u2019s campaign to be viewed as a champion of free trade and guardian of the multilateral trading system has been met with considerable skepticism. But efforts by China to promote stronger commercial ties with Japan, India and other countries are making headway. After a meeting in May with China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, Mr. Abe said he wanted to \u201clift up the Japan-China relationship to a new stage.\u201dRegrettably, this leaves the United States on the margins as the rest of the world builds a new trading structure without us. Our workers, farmers and companies will be locked out of important markets. We will lose our chance to help write the rules and set standards for trade in advanced technology, such as alternative-fuel vehicles, 3-D printing and artificial intelligence. Global and regional supply chains will increasingly bypass the United States. And years of efforts by the United States to curb China\u2019s unfair trade practices will lose critical international support.To be sure, as the world\u2019s largest economy, the United States will remain a major player in international commerce. Our market is a magnet for imports and our export competitiveness in manufacturing, services and agriculture is strong. The dollar remains the primary global reserve currency, with much of the world\u2019s commerce denominated in dollars.There is a danger, however, in overestimating our negotiating leverage. Trade patterns will shift as our partners look elsewhere. We have spent decades building trust with our allies.

{"Headline": "The Millionaires Are Fleeing. Maybe You Should, Too.", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sharma is a contributing opinion writer.Tracking the rich has become a voyeuristic global industry, a form of celebrity worship. But it can also provide serious clues about where countries are headed.When a country begins to fall into economic and political difficulty, wealthy people are often the first to ship their money to safer havens abroad. The rich don\u2019t always emigrate along with their money, but when they do, it is an even more telling sign of trouble.In most countries it is fair to assume that any millionaire exodus is composed mainly of locals, and not foreign investors, because the wealthy classes will be dominated by citizens or longtime residents. In 2017, the largest exoduses came out of Turkey (where a stunning 12 percent of the millionaire population emigrated) and Venezuela. As if on cue, the Turkish lira is now in a free fall. There were also significant migrations out of India under the tightening grip of its overzealous tax authorities, and from Britain under the cloud of Brexit.On the flip side, slowing outflows can be a welcome sign, and in 2017 the biggest shift for the better came in that caldron of anti-rich hostility, France.Equally surprising was the lack of change in the United States, where the arrival of a billionaire president did not seem to attract or repel millionaires. A net total of 9,000 millionaires migrated to the United States last year, but they represent a drop in the ocean of five million American millionaires.Just like the less wealthy, millionaires seemed unsure of America\u2019s direction under an unpredictable president who offers tax cuts and deregulation for the rich, but also bashes foreigners and occasionally talks like a pitchfork-waving populist.Britain and France appeared to be trading places as magnets for wealth. For decades the rich had been drawn to Britain by circumspect banks, loose regulations and the comforts of London. Until 2016, Britain had a sizable influx of millionaires every year, but the flow suddenly reversed last year with a net exodus of 3,000, amid fears that as Britain exits the European Union, London will fade as a financial capital. It did not help that in 2017 the government raised taxes on foreigners who buy property.France had long been seen as the anti-Britain, a left-leaning bastion of prying bureaucrats and high taxes that scared off the wealthy, despite the charms of Paris. But the growing exodus of millionaires peaked in 2016 with a net outflow of 12,000, then slowed sharply to just 4,000 last year. The most likely reason: the May election of Emmanuel Macron, the youngest president in French history, who promised a lighter-touch bureaucracy less hostile to business and lowered wealth and capital gains taxes.Granted, displaced millionaires get little if any sympathy, but no country gains by losing the talent and capital of its wealthiest residents, particularly not emerging countries like India. Stunningly, India in 2017 suffered a net loss of 7,000 members, or 2 percent, of its millionaire population. That exodus came despite global optimism about India\u2019s growth prospects and matched the flight from the stagnant and sanction-battered economy of Russia, which also lost 2 percent of its millionaire population.This unusual flight from India\u2019s high-growth economy may be driven by the elite\u2019s growing concerns about an official anticorruption drive and \u201ctax terrorism\u201d \u2014 unlimited authority given to tax officials to target the rich. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government has lately begun catering to the nation\u2019s deep socialist streak, wielding state power to flush out and tax hidden pockets of wealth.In the worst cases, bouts of capital flight can gain momentum until the value of the currency collapses, plunging the nation into crisis. Balance of payments records show that 10 of the last 12 major currency crises, dating back to the Mexican peso meltdown of 1994, began when residents started sending money abroad, which was typically two years before the currency collapsed. Often politicians blamed \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cimmoral\u201d foreign speculators for these crises, but it was the locals who first saw trouble coming.Right now, this forensic accounting offers clear evidence of looming financial difficulty in only one major country: Turkey. Starting early last year, affluent Turks began effectively moving large sums of money out of the country by exchanging their lira bank deposits for dollars and euros, while foreigners continued to buy Turkish assets.The 12 percent decline in Turkey\u2019s millionaire population last year was by far the largest of any major economy, and second only to the 16 percent decline in Venezuela, with its small, hyperinflationary economy. Turkey\u2019s millionaires appear to be fleeing both deteriorating financial conditions marked by very high inflation, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s crackdown on his critics, including those in business.Millionaire migrations can be a positive sign for a nation\u2019s economy. The losses for India, Russia and Turkey were gains for havens like Canada and Australia, joined lately by the United Arab Emirates. Owing largely to the stability and glitter of the most famous emirate, Dubai, the United Arab Emirates in 2017 had a net inflow of 5,000 millionaires, increasing the size of its affluent population by 6 percent, the largest gain in the world. Britain was among the millionaire havens until 2016, but may continue losing ground until it can resolve the uncertainties raised by Brexit.Savvy locals are also the first to return when a country\u2019s fortunes begin to turn for the better. In seven of the last 12 major currency crises, residents started bringing money back earlier than foreigners.More broadly, economists and politicians might rethink the blame they heap on \u201cimmoral\u201d foreigners in periods of capital flight. They assume global money managers are more sophisticated than provincial locals \u2014 but those longtime residents are in fact quicker to spot and respond to trouble in their own backyards. They might also assume that residents are more loyal than foreigners. But the drive to protect one\u2019s assets often trumps patriotism.Millionaires move money mainly out of self-interest, to find more rewarding or safer havens. There aren\u2019t a lot of them, but they can tell us a great deal about what is going wrong \u2014 and right \u2014 in a country\u2019s economic and political ecosystems. Leaders who create the right conditions to keep millionaires home will find that all of their residents \u2014 not just the wealthy ones \u2014 are richer for it.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Era of Easy Money for Eurozone Nears Its End", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIGA, Latvia \u2014 The European Central Bank took a major step on Thursday toward winding down life support for the eurozone economy.The bank said it did not expect to raise interest rates, which are at historic lows, until the fall of 2019 at the earliest. Mario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, also held out the possibility that policymakers could still ramp up stimulus if needed.The bank had not been expected to lay out so clearly its road map for the months ahead. The mere fact that the topic of reducing the stimulus program was on the agenda was significant.The shift away from a decade of extraordinarily easy money will be a delicate one \u2014 as the Federal Reserve, which raised its benchmark interest rate in the United States by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, has learned to its peril.In 2013, the Fed provoked a global sell-off of riskier investments when it announced that it would begin scaling back its quantitative easing program.To avoid the same reaction, the European Central Bank has been moving with extreme caution, adjusting the language in its public statements to signal a gradual exit from the stimulus program.Most recently, the bank indicated that debate about when to end the bond-buying program had officially begun within the Governing Council, the bank\u2019s main decision-making body.That was a shift from late April, when Mr. Draghi insisted after a meeting on monetary policy that members had not even discussed the bond-buying program.On Thursday, the council went further, setting out the timeline under which it would pare back the program.The central bank said it would continue buying bonds at the same pace at least through September, and would then slow the process for the subsequent three months before ending it entirely.Analysts had been divided on whether the European Central Bank would announce a firm timetable for ending the purchases on Thursday, or if it would wait until the next monetary policy meeting, in July.In the end, the central bankers opted to outline their road map, apparently deciding they could not wait much longer. Inflation has been rising toward the bank\u2019s official target of 2 percent. By law, the European Central Bank\u2019s main task is to keep inflation under control.The first step, before raising interest rates, would be to end the bond buying.Mr. Draghi is likely to give some flavor of the discussion when he holds a news conference in Riga after the Governing Council meeting.Though the eurozone economy has not been mired in the seemingly constant crises of recent years, the timing of the European Central Bank\u2019s move may not be ideal.After booming in 2017, growth in the eurozone has slowed in recent months, and every day seems to bring new warnings that all is not well. On Wednesday, for example, the European Union statistics agency said industrial production in the eurozone fell 0.9 percent in April.European businesses are confused and unsettled by President Trump\u2019s war of words on longtime allies like Germany and Canada, and his decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. At the same time, Italy is in the grips of populism, and Britain \u2014 not a eurozone member, but a major trading partner of the common currency area \u2014 is struggling to work out terms of its divorce with the European Union.The uncertainty is making businesses reluctant to invest, and causing growth to slow.\u201cThere is a psychological effect,\u201d said Ulrich Spiesshofer, the chief executive of ABB, a company based in Zurich that supplies equipment for power grids.\u201cIf you go to the Middle East, there is uncertainty; if you go to Asia, there is uncertainty; if you look at Europe, there is uncertainty; and then you go to Washington and there is uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Spiesshofer said. \u201cWe have to deal with all of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Magic Ronaldo Moment Is All Portugal Needs vs. Morocco", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 At age 33, Cristiano Ronaldo doesn\u2019t so much run anymore as he threatens to run. Let the other players sprint and chase all game, he signals with his exquisite lack of industriousness. I will wait here, or maybe just over there, until it is time to do the scoring.Ronaldo mostly has jogged at this World Cup. More often, he has walked. It is not that he cannot run, or doesn\u2019t want to; he is just in no hurry until he has to be. A good striker only needs to be in the right place once or twice a game to be world class, after all, and no one in the world spots those one or two places better than Ronaldo, who ran his World Cup scoring lead to four goals in the blink of an eye on Wednesday afternoon.Ronaldo\u2019s goal came early \u2014 a fourth-minute header after Morocco inexplicably lost track of him on a corner kick \u2014 but it was enough for a 1-0 victory that put Portugal on the verge of the knockout stage. It also made Morocco, now last in Group B, the first team eliminated from the World Cup.But the match did have Ronaldo. And for him, the goal, and the result, were more than enough.\u201cThe most important was to win the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew if we lost we could be out. But we managed to score a goal \u2014 I managed to score a goal. And it was very beautiful to me.\u201dDefeat seemed harsh for Morocco, which was better than Portugal in the second half, creating a half-dozen excellent chances that might have produced a tying goal, and because only the day\u2019s schedule sent them out of the World Cup before Saudi Arabia, which has not played nearly as well and lost to Uruguay, 1-0, in the day\u2019s second game.But Ronaldo\u2019s score also was the worst possible start for the Moroccans, who dropped their opening game against Iran on a 95th-minute goal and promptly fell behind Portugal after only four.Portugal had won a corner kick, and Ronaldo casually jogged into the center of the penalty area to receive it. Everyone knew the cross would come to him, no one more than Morocco\u2019s Manuel Da Costa, who accepted the challenge of staying between Ronaldo and the ball.Except that Da Costa did not. A shift of the hips and a half-dozen quick strides by Ronaldo \u2014 speed he now reserves for only the most appetizing moments \u2014 and he was free. The ball arrived on his forehead and just like that was redirected into the net. Portugal led. Ronaldo preened. And four minutes into their second game of the World Cup, Morocco wondered if it might be on its way out.Ronaldo mostly stalked the rest of the match \u2014 a threatening presence more than a particularly active one \u2014 while Morocco banged away without success at the other end.\u201dWe should have been much more effective,\u201d Morocco Coach Herv\u00e9 Renard said. \u201cJust like in our opening game, we had lots of scoring opportunities. But those who know how to be in the penalty area and are the most gifted players know how to make a difference.\u201dPortugal will have to be better than it was if it is to challenge in the later rounds here, Santos said: more disciplined, more creative, more willing to impose itself on teams rather than wait to counterattack. \u201cWe played well,\u201d Santos said, \u201cbut I think we need more than that.\u201dBut Santos rejected the assumption, posed by more than one reporter, that his team had been poor, and that Ronaldo had looked ineffective or, worse, old.\u201cCristiano is like a port wine,\u201d Santos said. \u201cHe knows how to refine his capacity and age at his best.\u201dThe secret, he said, is what was plain to see: Ronaldo is not the same player he was in his 20s. He is more efficient now \u2014 deadly so, at least through two matches \u2014 and aware of what he can do.\u201cHe\u2019s always evolving,\u201d Santos continued. \u201cBecause he knows himself and he knows what he can do. He doesn\u2019t want to do the things he did two or three years ago, and he will not be doing the same things two or three years from now.\u201d\u2014\u2014Here\u2019s how Portugal beat Morocco, from Victor Mather:A long free kick by Morocco bounces around in the box tantalizingly. It\u2019s Benatia again, it\u2019s over the bar again.Benatia of Morocco pats Pepe on the back. Pepe goes down hard, then leaps up and yells at Benatia. Pepe, 35, has been known in his career for a hot temper.Suddenly Ziyech is free in the box for Morocco: a dribble and a shot, but it\u2019s blocked. Five minutes of added time.Morocco brings down Ronaldo right on the penalty line. It\u2019s judged to be just outside the box, so a very dangerous free kick, not a penalty. Ronaldo ... everyone grabs their cameras ... off the wall. He has a big smile afterward. After the free kick, Ronaldo goes to ground but does not get a call.Portugal, Morocco, Portugal, etc. Ziyech misses on a corner. Pepe kicks the ball onto his own hand. Action at both ends.Ziyach takes a free kick from the right, which goes to Benatia. He can\u2019t get his head on it, though, and the shot goes wide.Morocco is racing around the pitch, playing hard defense, passing nicely, getting some crosses and free kicks. They just haven\u2019t been able to finish.A loss in this game would eliminate them from the World Cup. They have yet to score a goal in two games.A good extended period of control ends with a free kick to Morocco just outside the box. But Ziyech sends it over.Guerreiro has struggled all game against Amrabat.

Portugal cannot shut Morocco out of the game.A free kick for Morocco ends up on the foot of Mehdi Benatia, who turns and shoots. Over the bar.While we\u2019ve been praising the offenses, a word for the fine play from the rest of the teams. Portugal\u2019s keeper Patrico has made several good saves, and Morocco has foiled Portugal counters by having their defensemen regularly in the right places.And it\u2019s Morocco again.

Portugal was forced into 17 clearances in the half.Header by Belhanda goes wide. Morocco still attacking.Morocco\u2019s attacking style leaves them a wee bit open at the back, and Ronaldo finds Goncalo Guedes, who forces a one-handed save, then fluffs the rebound.

Three rotations. He\u2019s fine.Long-range effort by Ziyach of Morocco was saved. Portugal is going to want to get control of the ball a bit more. The thing is, if teams get enough shots and enough chances, the ball eventually goes in.

{"Headline": "One County Thrives. The Next One Over Struggles. Economists Take Note. ", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe gap between places doing well and those that aren\u2019t is widening, and that\u2019s a challenge for people trying to shape national policy.Loudoun County, Va., and Jefferson County, W.Va., share bucolic countryside and a 14-mile border. But there are two big differences between them that capture something fundamental about our age. Economically, Loudoun County is humming from the technology boom in Washington\u2019s suburbs, with the number of businesses rising 49 percent from 2005 to 2015. But on the other side of that border, Jefferson County doesn\u2019t have the same economic dynamism: The number of businesses in the county fell 11 percent in the same period, according to census data. The two counties have diverged politically, too. Back in 2004, both favored George W. Bush for president by a similar, moderate margin. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won Loudoun by 17 percentage points; Jefferson favored Donald J. Trump by 15 points. This divergence is more than a statistical curiosity. It is one more piece of evidence for a shift that is causing some leading thinkers on economic policy to make location and geography more central to their work. Historically, within the same country, poorer places have tended to converge with richer places. Policymakers and macroeconomists could focus on trying to improve overall national well-being, with confidence that a higher growth rate or lower unemployment would be, over time, widely shared.But averages can mask a lot of discontent. If growth in jobs, incomes and output is concentrated in a few areas, the overall national numbers might look perfectly fine even as people in huge areas of the country feel despair and a lack of opportunity.Path dependence may be one cause of recent trends. In a place with a depressed economy, for example, the most ambitious people move to places with more opportunity, leaving an even bleaker situation behind.Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, has done extensive work arguing that the divergence has roots in the rise of more technologically intensive industries combined with the offshoring of lower-skilled work, such as manufacturing. Many of the thriving areas are places where these technologically advanced companies and their employees cluster.\u201cConvergence used to be the order of the day,\u201d said Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary. \u201cNow if anything divergence is the order of the day. There\u2019s a lot more to understand, but at a minimum we need to start recognizing place as a legitimate construct in our thinking.\u201dThe paper says targeted tax subsidies in those areas could create broad benefits. So, for example, if the earned-income tax credit, which enhances the after-tax income of low-income workers, were more generous in lagging areas than in thriving ones, it might pull more people into the work force and offer greater social and economic benefits than the current one-size-fits-all version.But the more widespread idea that these geographical differences are really important to understanding the economy doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to a coherent set of policies. \u201cI think what\u2019s happening is we may have a better understanding of the dynamics of these lagging regions, and we may be able to better describe what is contributing to that, but we don\u2019t have a new set of ideas policy-wise to address them,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.Would it be better, for example, to help people stay, or to help them go? Invest in transportation infrastructure or better schools, or ease relocation to more dynamic places? \u201cIncome inequality is a moral issue, but this is a different type of inequality \u2014 it\u2019s inequality of opportunity,\u201d Mr. Kessler said. \u201cThe question is how do you make sure that more people who do not have a college degree or come from the right place are able to have opportunity.\u201dIndividual proposals aside, experts haven\u2019t formed a consensus on how to make economically moribund places feel more like economically dynamic ones. But it is clearer than ever that this divergence explains much of what ails the United States\u2019 economy, and just maybe its politics, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dandy Is Dead", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sartorial order of the day is anything but refined. In fact, as designers like Demna Gvasalia and Rick Owens are proving, it\u2019s downright fugly.FLORENCE, Italy \u2014 While the wider world may have doubled down on cargo shorts, flip-flops and whatever passes for a male uniform in the world of open-space workplaces, here on the streets of this Renaissance city and throughout the trade pavilions crammed inside the 25-acre walled Fortezza da Basso for the huge Pitti Uomo men\u2019s wear fair, it\u2019s dandy time.Suddenly, it seems, every cobbled lane (and Instagram feed) is chockablock with men in Homburg hats or straw boaters, suits with nipped jackets and pleated trousers cropped short to reveal two-tone spectator shoes. There are capes and canes and foulards and billowing pocket squares, beards of every imaginable cut and even waxed mustaches. Sometimes, seen walking two or three abreast, the Finnish and Korean and Russian and Chinese and Japanese buyers or vendors seem dressed as if for some arcane form of cosplay. All of it is decorative, anachronistic, highly refined and considered \u2014 and more than a bit silly.And it has all begun to change. The advance guard of this particular development has been clomping around for more than a year now, ever since the introduction of Balenciaga\u2019s Triple S, the $895 dad sneaker designed by the label\u2019s creative director, Demna Gvasalia. With its stacked, wave-form sole bulging in every direction, its bloated and aggressively clunky silhouette, the Triple S is so ostentatiously unlovely it induced near fatal apoplexy in the American designer Ralph Rucci, that champion of elegance.Taking to Instagram in May, Mr. Rucci let rip with an unfettered attack on designs emanating from the house of Balenciaga, venting spleen on what he saw as desecration of its founder, the couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga. \u201cThey have taken his name and have conveniently used it as a springboard for such mediocrity, such tastelessness, such ugly ideas,\u201d Mr. Rucci wrote.Who you calling ugly? What Mr. Rucci derided as Balenciaga\u2019s \u201cwhorish greed to sell a gym shoe\u201d has not only spurred a huge boost in sales but propelled the brand into the consciousness of a new population. What nearly everyone in fashion has been attempting for years, Mr. Gvasalia neatly accomplished: Snagging the sneakerheads. That he did so may be attributable to his canny understanding of a population that cares less about how wearable something may be than its likelihood to attract online eyeballs.\u201cSocial media is the culprit here,\u201d Nick Sullivan, the fashion director of Esquire, said last week. By tradition, the best-dressed men tended to be those whose clothes you did not instantly recognize. If logo and label dressing changed all that, Instagram raised the ante, making it necessary for designers to produce products whose iconography produces a pop on a smartphone screen. \u201cDesigner brands have become beacons of fugly precisely because people have replaced shopping for things with posting them and then regramming them,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cOld-fashioned taste at the moment is out of taste.\u201dWhat takes its place is stuff so deliberately and uproariously awful, so defiant of traditional canons of taste you almost have to applaud it. Although certain of the male superstars at the recent Billboard Music Awards \u2014 think Lil Pump \u2014 were clad in big-name styles, the net effect was of sartorial mayhem: pink dreads, studded cowboy wear, neck tats and braces.Increasingly, for a consumer whom Jian DeLeon, the editorial director of Highsnobiety, characterizes as \u201ca jaded, postironic and highly engaged fashion acolyte,\u201d this style represents a growing confidence among informed consumers who aren\u2019t constrained by sartorial don\u2019ts. \u201cThese are garments that almost dare you to wear them,\u2019\u2019 Mr. DeLeon said referring to rompers, Crocs, Uggs, fanny packs, chef pants, dad-style double denim or Rick Owens\u2019 new Birkenstocks, the ergonomic cave man footwear made from what appears to be Wookie pelts.\u201cIn some ways what\u2019s changed is that there\u2019s no dictating aesthetic anymore,\u201d Mr. DeLeon said. \u201cGuys are free to pick and choose what they want to wear in a way that reflects the fast-paced social media economy.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s super-important that the tailored jacket with full canvas lining is still represented here,\u201d said Mr. Wooster, who this season is presenting a capsule collection in collaboration with Paul & Shark. \u201cWhat makes Pitti relevant is that they leave room for that core tailoring consumer, but they\u2019re also moving on.\u2019\u2019Although old enough at 57 to be a granddad, Mr. Wooster saw in the Triple S sneakers he bought this year not a dad shoe (one that, weighing seven pounds a pair, might give dad a hernia) but an object whose every dimension was fastidiously designed.\u201cLook, we\u2019re in a time now where you can joke with fashion,\u201d said Josh Peskowitz, the co-owner of Magasin, an influential specialty men\u2019s wear retailer in Los Angeles. \u201cBut kind of like in a meme-y way.\u201d Now that so much fashion is pitched to an online fan base, what propels the men\u2019s wear market forward is often less a matter of taste than of one-upsmanship: \u201cThe people pushing the fugly narrative are hip-hop artists and Marc Jacobs,\u201d Mr. Peskowitz said.\u201cSomebody threw in something ugly and different? Cool,\u201d he added, referring to the dad sneakers he and Mr. Jacobs are seldom seen without. \u201cNow I have this thing with my friends: \u2018That is so ugly; I\u2019ll take it in a medium.\u2019\u201d An earlier version of this article implied incorrectly that Lil Pump wore a custom design to the Billboard Music Awards.

{"Headline": "New Amsterdam Figured Out Religious Tolerance 361 Years Ago", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Shorto has written extensively about the Dutch Republic\u2018s influence on the United States.As a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to enact a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslim immigration to the United States, and his administration has worked diligently to make good on that promise. Civil rights organizations report that religion-based hate crimes and religious discrimination have been on the rise, with hate groups seemingly taking their lead from the president\u2019s tweets.Those who consider all of this to be antithetical to America\u2019s founding principle of religious liberty have looked to the First Amendment to the Constitution as their salvation. Unfortunately, the First Amendment is vague in its language, which gives wide latitude for interpretation.But an earlier assertion of this fundamental principle is quite clear. Kenneth Jackson, the great historian of New York City, has called the Flushing Remonstrance \u2014 an appeal to religious liberty in the Dutch colony of New Netherland, precursor to New York \u2014 \u201ca forerunner of the First Amendment\u201d and \u201ca major statement\u201d of \u201cthe right to practice the religion of your choice.\u201d This document should serve as a guide in the fight over religious liberty.And now we have fresh perspective on the Flushing Remonstrance itself. Last month, the New Netherland Research Center, the nexus of scholarship on the Dutch colony that gave rise to New York, published a volume of translations of the colony\u2019s records that covers the years 1656 to 1658, the period of the Flushing Remonstrance, giving us context on the document. The story that emerges from this long-ago era turns out to be surprisingly similar to the one we find ourselves in today. It shows both religious intolerance borne of fear of the other and a steadfast determination to conquer it.New Netherland \u2014 with its capital of New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island \u2014 was a Dutch settlement, but it was a mix of peoples, thanks to the diversity in the Dutch Republic itself. In the 16th and 17th centuries, that tiny country rose to become the greatest trading nation on earth, and the enormous influx of wealth helped spawn the famed Dutch Golden Age.A hallmark of the Dutch success was the statement of religious freedom \u2014 or, to be more precise, of freedom of conscience \u2014 that was enshrined in the de facto Constitution of 1579, which asserted that \u201cno one shall be persecuted or investigated because of his religion.\u201d That declaration was a watershed in human history. It was issued at a time of religious strife in Europe, when intolerance was official policy in England, Spain and elsewhere, when maintaining a state religion was considered a matter of stability and common sense. The Dutch went in precisely the opposite direction, and proved that tolerance could actually strengthen a society.New York became the epicenter of American diversity and trade thanks in part to features it inherited from its Dutch forebears, including the principle of religious toleration. But Peter Stuyvesant, the director-general of the colony of New Netherland, put that toleration to the test when a group of Quakers arrived in Manhattan in 1657.Quakers were generally reviled at the time for their strange, spiritually induced behavior \u2014 \u201cquaking\u201d and the like. The rulers of the New England colonies occasionally went so far as to hang Quakers who showed up there. The Dutch were more broad-minded, but the restrictive nature of Dutch tolerance required those with alternative practices not to make a show of themselves. The Quakers, though, were downright flamboyant in their displays.\u201cThe religious leaders in the community were up in arms about the Quakers,\u201d Charles Gehring, translator of the documents, told me. \u201cPeople believed they were outside the norms of the faith \u2014 that if they didn\u2019t punish them for their behavior it might bring down the wrath of God.\u201d Whether out of his own bigotry or to appease his base, Stuyvesant wanted them out.New Netherland\u2019s diverse population included English inhabitants, who settled in several villages on Long Island. A small number of Quakers sought refuge in one of these towns: Vlissingen, later Flushing (which, it\u2019s worth noting, is today one of the most ethnically and religiously mixed communities in America). After Stuyvesant sent word that no one in the town was to harbor the Quakers, 30 inhabitants, who were not themselves Quakers, put their signatures to a remarkable document.\u201cWe are bound by the law to do good unto all men,\u201d they declared. \u201cThe law of love, peace and liberty\u201d in the Dutch Republic, they asserted, extended even to \u201cJews, Turks and Egyptians,\u201d all of whom were considered \u201cthe sons of Adam.\u201d They had no choice, they concluded, under Dutch law as well as their own consciences, but to accept the Quakers.Stuyvesant reacted with an aggressive crackdown \u2014 not on the Quakers themselves, but on the leaders of Flushing, who he decided had defied a law against \u201cillegal conventicles.\u201d He ordered arrests, drew up lists of interrogatories, coerced apologies and confessions, issued fines and threw people in prison. He barred the residents of Flushing from holding town meetings, and decreed that their \u201cheresy and unseemly lawlessness\u201d would be rectified by the appointment of a \u201cgood, devout, God-fearing and orthodox minister,\u201d whose salary would be paid for by the townspeople. While the Dutch Republic was far and away the most tolerant European nation, Stuyvesant himself frankly admired the relative purity of the New England colonies to the north and complained that his own comprised \u201cthe scrapings of all nations.\u201dThe series of actions Stuyvesant took to try to prevent the Quakers from settling is almost a template for what President Trump has done to restrict Muslim immigration.Religious bigotry in New Amsterdam was tied to a fear of the other. Mr. Trump appeases a segment of the population today that holds a similar fear. (\u201cI think Islam hates us,\u201d he said during the campaign, to the delight of his base.) And as with Stuyvesant, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions have tended to favor a particular religious community.One might give Peter Stuyvesant a break: His was a different time, after all. The current president of the United States, by contrast, seems determined to turn the clock back. It\u2019s as though the last three and a half centuries \u2014 not to mention the Constitution and its Bill of Rights \u2014 never existed.But the New Netherland story goes on \u2014 and offers some guidance for those who are anguished that our leaders are moving the country in the wrong direction. For the residents of Flushing had another card to play. Four years later, a Flushing Quaker named John Bowne traveled to Holland to appeal Stuyvesant\u2019s decision to punish him for holding an illegal religious service in his home. Bowne won. Stuyvesant\u2019s superiors forced him to permit Quakers to live and worship in the colony.That decision was practical, and it too has echoes for our time. While some people today are motivated by fear, many others support basic freedoms not just out of airy principle but because they\u2019re good for business. According to pollsters, millions of Americans believe that immigrants contribute to the nation\u2019s economy.The same was true in the 17th century. The directors of the West India Company, which oversaw New Netherland, were keen to attract settlers. Dutch diversity was a draw, both in the home country and in the North American colony. The colony\u2019s directors feared that Stuyvesant\u2019s bigotry would dissuade others from settling. And contrary to Stuyvesant\u2019s fears that they were a danger, the Quakers went on to become some of the great pacifists of American history.In her dissenting opinion in the travel ban case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor (who was born and raised in the Bronx) found that Mr. Trump\u2019s ban \u201cwas motivated by hostility and animus toward the Muslim faith.\u201d She summarized her opposition to the majority succinctly: \u201cThe United States of America is a nation built upon the promise of religious liberty. Our founders honored that core promise by embedding the principle of religious neutrality in the First Amendment. The court\u2019s decision today fails to safeguard that fundamental principle.\u201dThe episode from America\u2019s early colonial days offers both perspective on that failure and encouragement to push onward. It reminds us that freedom of religion is in a constant struggle with fear of the other, that basic rights are never secure, but are only upheld by constant vigilance. Despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, \u201cthe law of peace, love and liberty,\u201d as the residents of Flushing put it, applies just as well in the 21st century as it did in the 17th.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia Find Agreement on Oil Policy", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 It is unusual for the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia to see eye-to-eye, much less try to achieve common energy policy goals, even indirectly.But that is what seems to be happening, and it is taking the edge off the yearlong rise in oil and gasoline prices. Even if those countries have their own reasons for welcoming the surge in production, it is also reducing the influence of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which will meet in Vienna next week to discuss production cuts put in place in early 2017.The cheerleader, if not the ringmaster, in this effort is President Trump, who took to Twitter on Wednesday to criticize OPEC for high crude prices. \u201cOil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again,\u201d he wrote in his second such statement since April. \u201cNot good.\u201dOil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!Whatever happens at the OPEC meeting, two of the biggest players in the global oil market \u2014 Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2014 appear to have already calculated that it is in their immediate interest to crank up production, effectively sidelining the Saudis\u2019 fellow cartel members.Between them, the two countries have already each added more than 100,000 barrels a day to global oil supplies. Mr. Trump wants even more crude sloshing around the market to tamp down energy prices ahead of the congressional elections in November, and it looks like he may well get it.It is perfectly normal for Republican and Democratic administrations to try to nudge oil prices down, but rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 has the effort been so blunt and public. For decades, whenever presidents faced rising gasoline prices, American officials privately called Saudi Arabia seeking help in getting OPEC to boost production \u2014 something that the Trump administration has done, as well.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will discuss oil and other issues on Thursday as their teams face off in the World Cup. The stars appear to be aligned for them to work together to keep oil prices from climbing too high, too fast, despite the collapse of Venezuelan crude production and the expectation that new American sanctions will target Iranian oil exports.\u201cThere\u2019s a commonality of interest that fortunately and coincidentally came together,\u201d said Larry Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation. \u201cPutin is under pressure domestically to export more oil, the Saudis got a little nervous when the Brent price hit $80 a barrel, and the U.S. is nervous about their Iranian policy and the possibility of soaring gasoline prices.\u201dThe result has been a partial reversal in energy prices, which should cheer elected leaders and economists who worry that high energy prices could hurt global economic growth.But whatever the advantages for consumers and American foreign policy, oil price relief could be modest and short-lived.Mr. Trump, for instance, is pursuing several policy goals that cut against each other. He wants lower gasoline prices to keep the economy humming. At the same time, he wants to squeeze Iran and Venezuela with sanctions, which would inevitably lower the amount of oil on the world market. Venezuela\u2019s oil exports are falling by tens of thousands of barrels every month, and Iranian exports could fall by between 200,000 and a million barrels a day by next year, analysts say.A boom in oil production in the United States has helped increase global supplies in recent years even as OPEC countries cut back to raise prices. But experts believe a shortage of pipelines will limit the amount of oil that companies can extract from the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the main source of new American production, until late 2019.Scott D. Sheffield, chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas oil producer, said if there were a significant decline in Venezuelan and Iranian exports, \u201cand Saudi doesn\u2019t increase output, we\u2019re going to see $100 oil by the end of the year.\u201dJust a few years ago, $100 a barrel was considered normal. But prices collapsed in 2014, falling in the United States to below $30 in early 2016, as a glut of oil filled up tankers. Now the world\u2019s big oil producers are seeking a sweet spot for oil prices.American and global oil prices rose modestly on Wednesday despite Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism.Even as he has criticized OPEC, Mr. Trump has found a willing ally in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh has long argued against the Iran nuclear deal, and pressed the United States to put more pressure on the Shiite Islamic regime. The Saudis are fighting Houthi rebels backed by Iran in neighboring Yemen and have been trying to counter Iranian influence in Syria and elsewhere.Iran would like higher oil prices, because it needs money to invest in its weakened oil industry and ailing economy. But its exports could falter with the return of sanctions that were removed under the nuclear deal. And other OPEC members will seek to take advantage of Iran\u2019s misfortune by selling more oil to big markets like China and India.\u201cIf you are the Saudis, you want to do Trump a favor and get him off your back,\u201d said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, a consulting firm.Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, said Russian and Saudi Arabian leaders \u201cwill look at gradual but steady increases of overall supply, easily between one and 1.2 million barrels a day by year-end.\u201dThe two countries will probably lobby other oil-producing nations to also raise output, particularly Kuwait and United Arab Emirates, both OPEC members.Besides juicing economic growth, Russia has other reasons to export more oil.Two years ago, Russia agreed to slash 300,000 barrels per day to help OPEC stabilize prices. But more recently, Rosneft and other Russian oil companies have been lobbying Mr. Putin to increase production to take advantage of higher prices and for tax reasons, energy experts say.The Russian oil companies, increasingly active in Venezuela and the Middle East, have recently raised their production capacity. They also prefer lower prices because they pay higher marginal corporate tax rates when prices go above $75 a barrel.\u201cRussian firms have long been pushing to produce more,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cThey have invested heavily in new production capacity and see far more upside from additional production rather than higher prices.\u201dThe Russians are aligned with Iran in Syria and support the Iran nuclear deal, but they stand to gain financially if the agreement falls apart.

But short-term considerations have held sway since Mr. Trump jabbed at OPEC in April.Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the post caught the attention of oil-producing nations. \u201cThe tweet was critical and derailed the entire discussion heading into the OPEC meeting 100 percent,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Escalating Clash With Canada, Trump Is Isolated Before North Korea Meeting", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump escalated a bitter clash with some of America\u2019s closest allies on Sunday, lashing out through his advisers at Canada\u2019s prime minister in unusually personal terms and leaving himself with a diplomatic crisis as he arrived in Asia to negotiate a nuclear agreement with North Korea.Whether Mr. Kim sees Mr. Trump\u2019s combative approach as a sign of strength or weakness, the rupture with other major powers was sure to shadow the session between the two in Singapore on Tuesday, the first time leaders of the United States and North Korea will have met in person. Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy for pressuring Mr. Kim to give up his nuclear weapons has depended on isolating North Korea, but he arrived in Singapore looking isolated himself.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Robert D. Hormats, who advised Republican and Democratic presidents at a dozen Group of 7 summit meetings, starting at the first in Rambouillet, France, in 1975, when it was still the Group of 6.\u201cThe irony is this institution that was designed largely by the United States was really designed to shore up alliances and political relationships and resolve economic issues. This just served to do the opposite of that.\u201dBut his foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, told reporters that if anyone should be insulted, it was Canada, because Mr. Trump had cited a national security justification for his tariffs on steel and aluminum. \u201cThe national security pretext is absurd and frankly insulting to Canadians, the closest and strongest ally the United States has had,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is where the insult lies.\u201dAs for the comments by Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, she said, \u201cCanada does not believe that ad hominem attacks are a particularly appropriate or useful way to conduct our relations with other countries.\u201dOther members of the Group of 7 stood with Canada against Mr. Trump.\u201cInternational cooperation can\u2019t depend on anger and small words,\u201d France\u2019s \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said in a statement. \u201cLet\u2019s be serious and worthy of our people. We spent two days obtaining a draft and commitments. We stick to it. And anyone who leaves and turns their back on them shows their inconsistency.\u201dPrime Minister Theresa May of Britain issued a statement through an aide saying she was \u201cfully supportive of Justin Trudeau.\u201d The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, on Sunday called on European nations to stick together following Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement.\u201cIt\u2019s actually not a real surprise,\u201d Mr. Maas told reporters in Berlin. \u201cWe have seen this with the climate agreement or the Iran deal. In a matter of seconds, you can destroy trust with 280 Twitter characters. To build that up again will take much longer.\u201dMr. Trump never really wanted to attend the Group of 7 meeting, but aides pressed him to go even as they feared it would be a disaster because he was being forced to do something he did not want to do. He rebelled by showing up late and leaving early.During closed-door meetings, Mr. Trump largely listened through most issues, firmly crossing his arms and swiveling a bit in his seat, according to people who were in the room. At points, he looked around trying to catch the eyes of others, as if looking for reassurance, the witnesses said. Some smiled back; others did not.He arrived 18 minutes late for a Saturday session on gender equality and did not bother putting his headphones on for translation when President Emmanuel Macron of France spoke. At some points, Mr. Trump closed his eyes in what people in the room took to mean he was dozing off.But he came alive whenever trade was mentioned, mocking and insulting other leaders, particularly Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, according to the witnesses. Ms. Merkel was clearly not happy but largely kept quiet, evidently not wanting to provoke more conflict. Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation was described by European officials as stream of consciousness, filled with superlatives but not following a linear argument.Negotiators worked late Friday night to craft a statement that all seven leaders could sign. Mr. Trump\u2019s delegation objected to the term \u201crules-based international order\u201d until negotiators compromised by expressing support for \u201ca\u201d rules-based order rather than \u201cthe\u201d rules-based order.In a section on trade, the Americans insisted on using the word \u201creciprocal,\u201d one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite terms. They compromised by expressing support for \u201ccreating reciprocal benefits.\u201d They did not refer directly to the Iran nuclear agreement, which Mr. Trump just pulled out of, but the Europeans included a reference to the United Nations Security Council resolution that endorsed the deal.The negotiators included agree-to-disagree language on climate change and on an international commitment to reduce plastics in the world. And then the statement was released on Saturday night, only to have Mr. Trump disavow it. Mrs. May learned only as her helicopter arrived at the airport for her to board her plane to return to London.\u201cIt started out as a good summit because we were actually talking to each other, instead of past each other,\u201d said Peter Beyer, the German government\u2019s coordinator on trans-Atlantic relations. But he added, \u201cIt looks like the U.S. is no longer a reliable partner in international agreements, and that\u2019s bad.\u201dJosef Braml of the German Council on Foreign Relations said Mr. Trump considered diplomacy a waste of time. \u201cHe is about to destroy what\u2019s left of the liberal world order because he thinks rules and institutions help America\u2019s rivals, China and Europe,\u201d he said.Laurence Nardon, director of the North American program at the French Institute of International Relations in Paris, said Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior was a negotiation trick. \u201cIt\u2019s like when a person leaves the room and slams the door, but is hoping the other person will run after them and follow them into the corridor,\u201d she said.In Washington, Democrats and some Republicans were upset at the outcome. But Mr. Trump received support from a few Republicans who cheered his tough stance.Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, called the episode a \u201cwarning shot to Kim Jong-un\u201d in keeping with Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to negotiations. \u201cThis is the Trump style of getting things done,\u201d he said. As to the wisdom of such a public clash, he said, \u201cIt depends on how it turns out. This president lives on a high wire, and so far it\u2019s been working.\u201dReporting was contributed by Katrin Bennhold from Berlin, Steven Erlanger from Brussels, Maggie Haberman from New York, Andrew Higgins from Moscow, Catherine Porter from Toronto, Motoko Rich from Singapore, Alissa J.

{"Headline": "Pardon Me!", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ConversationMs. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week.I wonder if he\u2019d send me a pardon if I failed to meet my deadline. Seems to work for everybody else. Give me your predictions of who else you think will get a presidential get-out-of-jail card.The pardon power, historically, is supposed to be an instrument of individual mercy \u2014 like Lincoln\u2019s many pardons of Union soldiers with \u201ccowardly legs\u201d \u2014 and a means of political reconciliation, like Ford\u2019s controversial-but-wise pardon of Nixon. I\u2019m not sure exactly when it became an instrument of personal or political self-dealing, though Bill Clinton\u2019s disgraceful pardon of Marc Rich just as he was leaving office in 2001 comes to mind.The Marc Rich pardon was appalling, but at least nobody worried about Clinton making a career out of that sort of thing.In short, it is the kind of politicization of the pardon power that you might expect in, say, present-day Caracas, now coming to you from the White House.So let me bring up something we might actually be able to disagree about. The economy. What do you think? Is this the gift of the tax cuts? A warning that because of the tax cuts, the whole thing could implode again like it did in 2008?I think it\u2019s mainly a natural progression of the Obama recovery and I\u2019m just hoping that the tax cuts will not screw it up. Pretty sure they aren\u2019t really helping.So why not just acknowledge that much of what Trump has done has been good for the economy? The reach of the regulatory state had grown too far under Obama, a fact that coastal liberals stubbornly refused to see (a blind spot, by the way, which helped elect Trump). The ease of doing business in the United States as measured by the World Bank had declined, too. Corporate taxes were way too high and bringing them down was a smart thing to do \u2014 something Obama himself had once acknowledged, although he differed from Republicans on the specifics.As you will have noticed, Trump\u2019s poll numbers have been climbing higher, and the chances of Democrats taking Congress have diminished accordingly. I\u2019m afraid Democrats aren\u2019t helping themselves by screaming themselves hoarse at everything Trump does.What am I missing?It is true that less regulation is often good for business.A lot of the Trump pro-business agenda isn\u2019t about efficiency so much as favoring big donors. Almost nobody thinks freezing the fuel standards is going to be good for us. Neither is strong-arming big energy consumers into using loser coal companies and deteriorating nuclear power plants.Wow, I\u2019m getting roused up here. Let\u2019s talk about something more relaxing. Any post-Roseanne-Barr thoughts?By the way, I know it\u2019s early in the pardon parade to make any judgments, but chats with Kim Kardashian aside, it\u2019s interesting that while Trump has forgiven the sins of several well-known bigots, the only black person he\u2019s done any favors for has been dead for more than 70 years.And since we keep circling back to pardons, what do you make of Trump\u2019s new legal theory that he has a right to pardon himself? Pardon my French, but I think that\u2019s %#*\u00a5&!.Think there\u2019s any chance?The Democratic tilt toward progressives may be an interesting way of testing the proposition that the party does best when it runs left-wing candidates who can appeal more powerfully to their base than they do to more purple parts of their constituencies. We\u2019ll see, but I\u2019m skeptical. If Democrats fail to take either house of Congress this November, that\u2019ll be the reason.The silver lining might be that a defeat in the midterms will teach Democrats to revert to their moderate instincts. Alternatively, a big Republican defeat might chasten conservatives about the wisdom of handing their party over to Trump. Either way, something to hope for \u2014 and something to fear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget Tax Cuts. Trump Wants to Rally the G.O.P. Base Over Immigration.", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Republicans try to keep their midterm election strategy focused on the economy, tax cuts and falling unemployment, President Trump sent his clearest signal yet on Monday that he intends to make divisive, racially charged issues like immigration central going into the campaign season.Facing bipartisan criticism over his administration\u2019s family separation practice on the border, Mr. Trump renewed the sort of bald and demagogic attacks on undocumented immigrants that worked well for him politically in his 2016 presidential campaign. He inveighed against \u201cthe death and destruction that\u2019s been caused by people coming into this country\u201d and vowed that \u201cthe United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility.\u201d\u201cPeople don\u2019t turn out to say thank you,\u201d said Corey Lewandowski, one of the president\u2019s top political advisers. \u201cIf you want to get people motivated, you\u2019ve got to give them a reason to vote. Saying \u2018build the wall and stop illegals from coming in and killing American citizens\u2019 gives them an important issue.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an issue folks are emotionally attached to,\u201d said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump aide. \u201cI know that upsets some people in the donor class, but it\u2019s the reality of where the party is.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant remarks are aimed at the conservative base of the party that elevated his candidacy and is dominant in red states and House districts, especially those with largely white populations. The Republican grass-roots were already hawkish on immigration, while the president\u2019s takeover of the party has further diminished its pragmatist wing. And while hard-line Republicans are a minority of the country\u2019s voters, the G.O.P. cannot retain its grip on Congress without this bedrock of its base going to the polls.The issue of Germany and migrants has resonated for Mr. Trump for more than a year, people close to him say. When he thinks of Chancellor Angela Merkel, he is reminded of her difficulties with immigration far more than his clash with her at the G-7 or any bilateral issues.The danger for Republicans is that the political map this year is sharply bifurcated: the most competitive House and Senate contests are taking place in strikingly different parts of the country.Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides against Hispanic migrants, like his criticism of black athletes who will not stand for the national anthem, may resonate in the deeply red states where the battle for control of the Senate is playing out. But such culture war attacks will likely alienate voters in the affluent, heavily suburban districts Republicans must win to keep control of the House.\u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think that putting kids in cages is likely to go over very well with suburban moms,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster uneasy about running on the culture wars. Mr. Ayres said his party should campaign on \u201cthe concrete accomplishments of a Republican-held government.\u201d\u201cA fabulously strong economy, a record stock market, ISIS defeated and a world without any major wars that are killing lots of Americans on a weekly basis,\u201d he said, laying out the case.Republicans got a lesson last year about the risk of elevating immigration in campaigns where they depend on suburbanites. In the Virginia governor\u2019s race, the Republican nominee, Ed Gillespie, thought women in vote-rich Northern Virginia could be won over with a get-tough message on MS-13, the gang with ties to Central America that has gained a foothold in the Washington, D.C., region. But voters in suburban Fairfax and Loudoun counties overwhelmingly rejected these appeals, supporting Gov. Ralph S. Northam with landslide margins in large part to send a message about their disdain for Mr. Trump.The unease with a hard-line approach on immigration is strongest among House Republicans who hail from diverse districts.Many of these lawmakers signed a discharge petition that would have forced a vote offering legal status for Dreamers, children brought to the country by undocumented immigrants.And as Liesl Hickey, a veteran Republican strategist who previously ran the House congressional campaign arm, pointed out, it is Republican lawmakers like Representatives Carlos Curbelo of Florida, Will Hurd of Texas and Steve Knight of California who face some of the most daunting re-election challenges.\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that this is not a winning issue in the form that some want to take it,\u201d said Ms. Hickey, alluding to the hard-line approach.In a sign of the Republican alarm about the family separations at the border, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said Monday that he would ask the Trump administration \u201cto stop needlessly separating children from their parents.\u201dYet some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have told the president he needs to live up to what he promised voters on immigration. These aides have told him that what he is doing is similar to what President Obama did, and suggested that the news media is cherry-picking images of children that can be used to portray Mr. Trump\u2019s policy in the harshest of lights.Mr. Trump, absorbing these arguments, has related to allies that he thinks he is being mistreated by the media and sought to shift the conversation to the broader immigration debate. But Democrats believe he is making a costly mistake by taking his rhetoric too far.\u201cHe has taken an issue that is a decent wedge in swing places for Republicans and turned it into this preposterous notion that Democrats are responsible for family separation, Democrats are responsible for all immigrant crime, and Democrats are responsible for MS-13,\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. \u201cNobody believes that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Breaking Down the Frequent Flier Mile Programs", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerGetting the most out of these programs can be tricky. Here\u2019s a basic rundown of some of the more popular ones and what you can expect from them.We all dream of flying in first class, glass of prosecco in hand, away from the screaming children and armrest battles. But for most, that doesn\u2019t happen very often \u2014 if ever. Frequent flier programs can help, landing travelers who spend a lot of time in the air free drinks and snacks, the occasional upgrade, and miles to redeem for flights. But negotiating the world of airline rewards can be onerous. Ever-changing rules, low reward-flight availability, and depreciating or disappearing flight charts can make it tricky to get the most of these programs. Here\u2019s a basic rundown of some of the more popular ones, and what you can expect from them.Even if you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re going to be flying a lot with a particular airline, I recommend signing up for an airline-specific frequent flier program. You never know what future travel may hold, and every mile counts: American Airlines, for example, offers one-way flights within the United States for as few as 7,500 miles \u2014 an amount that can be earned within just a couple of trips. But you ultimately may want to put your focus on just one or two programs. Before you do, consider where you live and where you\u2019ll be traveling. Alaska Airlines may not be a great fit for East Coasters; JetBlue and Southwest, two beloved low-cost carriers, won\u2019t help too much if you frequently travel to Europe.The lowest level, Silver status, is available to fliers who log 25,000 qualifying miles (or 30 Delta segments flown) as well as earn $3,000 worth of qualifying dollars. Qualifying miles are determined by miles flown and what class you fly; qualifying dollars are pegged to how much money you spend on flights. Silver status is within reach for semi-serious travelers \u2014 a cross-country trip every other month should do the trick \u2014 and comes with some decent benefits, including a free checked bag (for you and up to eight traveling companions) and complimentary access to preferred seating. Silver fliers can get upgraded to first class, too, but as the lowest ranking elite members, it doesn\u2019t happen often.Executive Platinum members have a slightly lower earning threshold compared to Delta Diamond Medallion members: They must earn 100,000 qualifying miles and 12,000 qualifying dollars to achieve top status. In return, they\u2019ll receive four systemwide upgrades, three free checked bags and priority boarding. Executive Platinum and Platinum Pro members also receive automatically requested upgrades on all domestic flights \u2014 the two lower tiers, in an odd quirk of the American Airlines system, have to use 500-mile upgrade certificates on flights over 500 miles in length (for example, you\u2019d need to use five to go from Los Angeles to New York). Four certificates are earned per 12,500 qualifying miles flown.Silver status, at the bottom, has a few modest benefits, including access to Economy Plus seats at check-in, a free checked bag and better access to Saver awards (those requiring fewer miles) on United award flights. At the 1K level, fliers can expect more frequent upgrades, waived fees to book or change award travel, and 11 miles per dollar spent.There are a few nice benefits that come with Gold status, achieved after hitting 6,000 qualifying dollars and 50,000 qualifying miles. One is that it automatically confers Star Alliance Gold status \u2014 usable across all applicable airlines and lounges in the network. Not only do you get access to lounges overseas, but also priority check-in and boarding, and occasionally even fast-tracked security lines. There are also crossover benefits with certain travel-related partners: Holders of Gold status can receive elite status with Hertz and Marriott, for example.Mileage Plan has just three tiers, instead of four: MVP, MVP Gold and MVP Gold 75K. Earning MVP status requires 20,000 miles; MVP Gold 75K requires (you guessed it) 75,000 miles. Top status holders will receive a 125 percent bonus on the miles they fly, as well as 50,000 bonus miles for qualifying. Distributing award miles by actual mileage will allow most midlevel, nonbusiness-class fliers to rack up miles more quickly than with revenue-based airlines.The downside? The network isn\u2019t as comprehensive as the three legacy carriers. But if your travel is mostly confined to the western half of the United States, as well as coast-to-coast trips, Alaska could very well make sense for you.The Companion Pass, attained by earning 110,000 points or flying 100 segments, is one of the best deals currently available in the flying world. Once earned, it\u2019s valid for the rest of the year, plus the entire following year (if earned in June 2018, for example, it would be valid through the end of 2019). The holder is allowed to fly a designated companion along with him or her for free, anytime, anywhere Southwest flies. Companions even fly free when the pass holder books a flight with points. The best part? Points earned with any of Southwest\u2019s credit cards, including sign-up bonuses, count toward those 110,000 qualifying points.Southwest may not be the most luxurious ride in the sky \u2014 there are no premium seats on its planes \u2014 but isn\u2019t free better than fancy?Advertisement"}

These are all things that North Korea badly needs.The infrastructure company, a state-owned enterprise specializing in tunnel construction and real estate development, recently won a contract under the Belt and Road initiative to build railroad tracks in China\u2019s far western region of Xinjiang, its website says.North Korea experts in China have predicted that Beijing will try to extend the initiative to North Korea. The main question, they say, is whether that can happen while sanctions are still in place.Mr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, also visited the agricultural research institution while he ruled North Korea, in 2006, one of more than two dozen factories and plants he inspected during seven trips to China. Over many decades, it was at the forefront of introducing technology and management techniques that transformed China\u2019s agricultural sector.It seems the elder Mr. Kim never put what he learned there into practice, as North Korea still struggles to feed its own people.\u201cThere\u2019s great potential for China-North Korea cooperation regarding agricultural technologies,\u201d said Li Zonglin, director of the College of Economics and Management at Yanbian University.Another poster turned part of the summit agreement into a slogan: \u201cLet\u2019s exert joint efforts to alleviate the acute military tension and eliminate the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula!\u201dThe posters\u2019 emphasis on peace and reconciliation, like Mr. Kim\u2019s shift to diplomacy, are a drastic departure from last year, when North Korea helped drive the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war by conducting a series of nuclear and missile tests and exchanging threats of nuclear annihilation with the Trump administration.While exhortations for reunification and inter-Korean cooperation have been standard fare in North Korean propaganda, the new posters were also conspicuously lacking in anti-American messages. But it remains to be seen whether, after the Trump-Kim talks in Singapore, North Korea will take down its widespread anti-American propaganda and replace it with a softer message toward the United States.\u201cKim Jong-un\u2019s visit to China took place a full week after the North Korean-U.S. summit in Singapore,\u201d the newspaper said. \u201cIn addition, the Sino-U.S. trade war is now raging. These two points have been widely mentioned by the United States, South Korea and the Western media.\u201dBut it also warned that people who like \u201cto use everything as \u2018cards\u2019 to fight are very guilty.\u201d As two sovereign states, China and North Korea have \u201cthe right to develop friendly relations,\u201d it said.While Mr. Kim was touring Beijing, a conservative South Korean newspaper, JoongAng Ilbo, lamented that China had too much control over the process that is supposed to lead to North Korea\u2019s denuclearization.\u201cThe denuclearization process seems to be following a Chinese road map,\u201d JoongAng Ilbo said. \u201cChina must not ease up on sanctions to weaken Kim\u2019s will to denuclearize.\u201dChoe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea, and Luz Ding contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

The image may look dire, but he (Brill, that is; no one can say how the poor eagle feels) hasn\u2019t given up hope yet.\u201cIs the world\u2019s greatest democracy and economy broken?\u201d Brill asks at the outset of \u201cTailspin: The People and Forces Behind America\u2019s Fifty-Year Fall \u2014 and Those Fighting to Reverse It.\u201d \u201cNot compared to the Civil War years, or to the early 1930s.\u201dThe comparison is presumably meant to be reassuring, though not so reassuring that you\u2019ll resist another 400 pages devoted to American decline. The country may not be in utter shambles, Brill argues, but it\u2019s getting there. President Trump is just the latest manifestation of rampaging anger and resentment. Declining social mobility, a shrinking middle class, widening income inequality, crumbling infrastructure \u2014 there\u2019s plenty to be mad about, and plenty of blame to go around.Brill says the idea for his book came before the November 2016 election, when he landed at a \u201cgrimy terminal\u201d at Kennedy Airport and got stuck in traffic on the \u201cdirty, pothole-filled\u201d Van Wyck Expressway. The bumpy road jolted him into thinking about everything from politics \u201cto economic opportunity to health care to simple civility.\u201d \u201cHow had things deteriorated so badly?\u201d he wondered. He spent the next two years combing the country to find out.He explains that Republican opposition to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act made no sense \u2014 unless you viewed it as simple obstructionism. Obama\u2019s system of private health care exchanges without a public option was in fact an enormous concession to the medical industry, what Brill calls \u201ca classic Republican/business lobbyists\u2019 solution.\u201d Obama had \u201cdeferred the fight over costs and profits in order at least to get expanded access.\u201dYou can almost feel Brill\u2019s exasperation emanating from the page, though it\u2019s not the fury of the stymied leftist but the frustration of the disappointed centrist. Nothing seems to inflame him more than partisan grandstanding interfering with his idea of sensible policy.But the main split, Brill says, isn\u2019t Democrats versus Republicans; it\u2019s \u201cthe protected versus the unprotected,\u201d or the self-preservationist elite versus everyone else. He dates the beginning of the \u201ctailspin\u201d to the 1960s, when school reformers set out to replace the old-boy aristocracy with a system more open, more fair, more meritocratic.A meritocracy seemed like an improvement \u2014 in theory. Brill argues that reformers ended up creating a new aristocracy even more entrenched than the one it supplanted. Meritocrats \u201cwere able to consolidate their winnings, outsmart and co-opt the government that might have reined them in, and pull up the ladder so more could not share in their success or challenge their primacy.\u201d The winners in this new dispensation feel their privilege has been earned, rendering them self-satisfied and unresponsive.The argument isn\u2019t new. Chris Hayes made a similar case in his prescient 2012 book \u201cTwilight of the Elites.\u201d (He used the pulled-up ladder metaphor too.) But \u201cTailspin\u201d arrives at a different moment. Hayes was writing when the clouds were just visible on the horizon; Brill is writing from the eye of the storm.Still, Brill does have some stunners in store. The most surprising parts of \u201cTailspin\u201d come at the end, when he tries to forecast what might happen next, offering a rather extraordinary mix of doomsaying and wishful thinking. He envisions a day when things get so bad that President Trump\u2019s supporters will awaken to \u201cthe debacle that their choice produced.\u201d He foresees coal miners deciding to \u201cmarch on Washington and demand help in transitioning to an energy industry of the future.\u201d He anticipates the productive \u201cpublic fury\u201d that would erupt \u201cif a bridge collapses on the same day or in the same week that two trains derail, a big city loses electricity and a school system finds out that its water fountains are gushing lead.\u201dThat Brill sees hope emerging from the literal rubble shows the limits of a certain strain of politics, one that sees public policy mainly in terms of incentives, with the most desirable outcome being an electorate that \u201cwill now settle in the middle.\u201d Call me pessimistic, but if a bridge collapsed on the same day as two train derailments, a blackout and another water crisis, chances are the result wouldn\u2019t be less rancor but more.Advertisement"}

I wrote the book one administration too soon.That\u2019s the conclusion to draw from Donald Trump\u2019s long-promised and now bluntly delivered imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico, Canada and the European Union. And that was just after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin decided to put tariffs on China \u201con hold\u201d to allow negotiations to continue.Never mind restoring a bust of Winston Churchill to the Oval Office. The spirit that really hovers over this White House is Herbert Hoover\u2019s.The same might be said for many U.S. executives who know something about how the tariffs will work. On Friday I spoke with Gary Stein, C.E.O. of Houston-based Triple-S Steel, which sells about one million tons of steel products a year, mostly for construction and heavy manufacturing. He calls the tariffs \u201cjust juvenile.\u201d\u201cThese guys in Washington don\u2019t understand how real supply lines work,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t crack the economy on the end of a whip like that when you are dealing with real jobs and real people and real products coming across borders. There\u2019s a lot of special stuff that comes from only one mill, and now suddenly you can\u2019t get it or it\u2019s going to cost you 25 percent more.\u201dSo what motivates the president to pick these fights? Rust-belt politics surely plays a role. But it\u2019s also the same ideological obsession he has held since at least the 1980s \u2014 as dated and ugly as his mullet \u2014 not to mention his sneering indifference to what was once called \u201ca decent respect to the opinions of mankind.\u201dThe darker echoes of the 1930s are sounding louder.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Potemkin Economy", "Date": "2018-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAccording to legend, Grigory Potemkin, one of Catherine the Great\u2019s ministers (and her lover), created a false impression of prosperity when the empress toured Ukraine. He supposedly did this by setting up fake villages, or possibly just facades, along her route, then dismantling them after she passed, and setting them up again further down the road.There probably isn\u2019t much if any truth to the story \u2014 among other things, Catherine was too smart and tough-minded to be that easily deceived \u2014 but never mind: the legend has become a byword for the general idea of prettifying reality to please a tyrannical ruler. And it seems highly relevant to some of the economic \u201cnews\u201d coming out of the Trump administration the past few days.Just to be clear, the U.S. economy is still doing quite well overall, continuing the long expansion that began during Obama\u2019s first term. Those of us who thought the economy would be hurt by political uncertainty have been wrong so far.Actually, I\u2019m waiting to hear that GM is really a Democratic company in league with the deep state.But meanwhile, how is the administration responding? By making stuff up.Now, making stuff up is actually standard operating procedure for these guys. We\u2019re talking about an administration that\u2019s taking children away from their parents and putting them in cages in response to a wave of violent immigrant crime that doesn\u2019t, you know, actually exist. Trade policy itself is being driven by claims about the massive tariffs U.S. products face from, say, the European Union \u2014 tariffs that, like the immigrant crime wave, don\u2019t actually exist.But these are negative fictions, tales of wrongdoing by others. When it comes to Trump\u2019s own economic policies, by contrast, it\u2019s all puppies and rainbows \u2014 happy stories with no basis in reality.Actually, the deficit is rising fast, mainly because of a plunge in corporate tax receipts \u2014 the direct result of the tax cut:The administration later tried to walk back Kudlow\u2019s claim, saying that he was talking about great things that will happen in the future, not current events. Right.OK, so Trump and company are making claims about the results of their policies that bear no relationship to reality. But reality has a well-known liberal bias. Will Trump\u2019s habit of making things up, and his advisors\u2019 willingness to celebrate imaginary policy triumphs, make any difference?Actually, I think they might. The trade war is rapidly escalating, with our trading partners retaliating against US actions and reports that Trump wants to withdraw from the World Trade Organization. The best hope for breaking the cycle of retaliation would be for Trump to realize that the trade war is going badly, take a deep breath, and step back from the brink.But who will tell him how things are really going? Given what we\u2019ve seen the past few days, they\u2019ll respond to plant closings and economic disruption with fantasies of triumph, while Trump will dismiss reports of problems as fake news. Reality will take a long time to break through, if it ever does. And by then the world trading system may be broken beyond repair.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "White House\u2019s Nafta Approach Frustrates Businesses, Panicked Emails Show", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A rocky process has plagued President Trump\u2019s attempt to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement from the start, as internal divisions and a thinly staffed bureaucracy often left big American companies with much at stake shut out of deliberations, according to internal administration emails.The White House approach has put the future of the 1994 trade pact in doubt and left Canada, Mexico and many of the biggest American companies frustrated and bewildered.Documents show corporations and trade groups \u2014 such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, or NAM \u2014 struggling to get their voices heard within a supposedly business-friendly administration and sending increasingly panicked emails to the United States trade representative\u2019s office about its approach to rewriting the pact.Throughout last spring and summer, high-level trade negotiators repeatedly canceled meetings with the chamber, instead finally sending a 24-year-old deputy to meet with a delegation that was expected to include representatives from more than 50 of the largest American companies and organizations, including Walmart, U.P.S., the Walt Disney Company, General Electric, General Motors, Caterpillar and Boeing.Last August, ahead of the second round of Nafta negotiations in Mexico, an official at the United States Council for International Business pleaded for \u201can urgent meeting with you and your team before you head to Mexico for Round 2.\u201d\u201cI cannot emphasize enough the degree of concern in the business community based on the press reports we have seen of major changes in U.S. policy,\u201d the official, Shaun Donnelly, wrote. A trade official set up a meeting for the next week.Even the manufacturing industry \u2014 which Mr. Trump has put at the core of his economic agenda \u2014 has found its concerns to be largely an afterthought, struggling to change the White House\u2019s approach.\u201cIt is hard to have a discussion when no details are provided of where the administration is really going even at a broad level until after decisions have essentially been made,\u201d Linda Dempsey, the vice president for international economic affairs policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, said in an email to a top United States trade representative official in October, just before another round of talks between Canada, Mexico and the United States was about to take place.The email and other documents were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by American Oversight, a nonprofit set up to investigate the Trump administration. The documents, which include emails to the United States trade representative, cover the period from February 2017, when many of the agency\u2019s top staff members had yet to be appointed, through November, when the United States had shared its primary negotiating goals for Nafta with Canada and Mexico.The emails reveal a bare bones operation as the United States embarked on a rewrite of a trade deal that has become critical to the many North American businesses that have built up supply chains around Nafta. The talks are now at a standstill over deep divisions among the three countries. The Trump administration has hit Canada and Mexico with tariffs on steel and aluminum to force concessions, but the measure has so far only prompted retaliatory levies.The White House approach has fueled widespread criticism from both business and Republican lawmakers, who have publicly and privately tried to persuade trade officials not to undermine a pact that is critical to companies in their states.On Wednesday, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, criticized the Trump administration for throwing \u201ca huge wet blanket of uncertainty on an economy that otherwise they were responsible for making red hot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just dumbfounded,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said during an interview on Bloomberg Television.On issues ranging from reducing taxes to cutting regulation, the administration has moved largely in lock-step with business groups like the U.S. Chamber and the National Association of Manufacturers. But on trade, Mr. Trump\u2019s populist bent has put those alliances at odds.The administration has been unapologetic about its approach, viewing the rewrite as necessary to fix a trade deal that it believes has benefited multinational corporations at the expense of American workers.\u201cWe have always understood that draining the swamp would be controversial in Washington,\u201d she continued.Later that month, in comments to reporters, Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, compared the proposed changes in Nafta to taking \u201ca little of the sugar away\u201d from American corporations.But administration officials have not always been aligned on the approach or the message.In May 2017, John Melle, the chief Nafta negotiator, criticized comments by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who had remarked publicly that the Nafta talks were likely to be \u201clong and complicated\u201d and could potentially result in separate bilateral deals.\u201cNot helpful \u2014 and not the message ARL was delivering!\u201d Mr. Melle wrote, referring to Ambassador Robert Lighthizer. The response came in an email to Ms. Dempsey of the National Association of Manufacturers, who had forwarded Mr. Melle the commerce secretary\u2019s remarks.In spring 2017, employees from the trade representative\u2019s office described their team as \u201cthin\u201d and compared their work to \u201cdrinking out of a fire hose.\u201dAustin Evers, the executive director at American Oversight, said the emails showed an administration trying to rewrite a trade deal with huge economic implications largely on the fly.\u201cIn order to match the president\u2019s highly charged and aggressive public statements, officials are left scrambling to turn tweets into policy,\u201d Mr. Evers said. \u201cYou have Trump promising major wins on trade negotiations, while an inside look at what\u2019s going on shows they were building the airplane while they were flying it.\u201dMr. Trump tasked his trade negotiators with enormous responsibilities, including renegotiating an agreement with South Korea and carrying out a sweeping investigation into China\u2019s potential intellectual property violations. That also included seeking significant changes to the sprawling North American pact that governs nearly every industry on the continent, a task that Trump advisers initially said could be completed in a matter of months.But it took months for the administration to nominate \u2014 and for Congress to confirm \u2014 many of the appointees for the trade office\u2019s top posts, including those assigned to oversee trade. Mr. Lighthizer was not confirmed until May 2017, and three of his top deputies were not confirmed until the next March.Those staff shortages and an ambitious timeline for rewriting Nafta curtailed the agency\u2019s ability to communicate with some of America\u2019s biggest firms, the emails show, adding to uncertainty and anxiety that have prompted some North American companies to halt investment.Ms. Davis rejected the idea that staff shortages have had any effect on the outcome of Nafta negotiations.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be prouder of the outstanding work done by the career professionals at U.S.T.R. in helping to advance the administration\u2019s trade agenda,\u201d she said.\u201cObviously, it would have been better if Congress had not waited eight months after Ambassador Lighthizer\u2019s confirmation to confirm his deputies. Nevertheless, this delay had no effect on our efforts to revise Nafta or Korus,\u201d she said, referring to the United States trade agreement with South Korea.Even once the bodies were in place, many industries found they were getting information about significant changes only after the administration\u2019s plans had been cemented and straining to confirm rumors about a potential withdrawal from Nafta.\u201cThere are all sorts of disturbing rumors about a withdrawal notice being issued,\u201d Ms. Dempsey wrote in April 2017. \u201cI would hope that there would be actual conversations with the NAM and others before that happens. We are very much interested in a Nafta renegotiation, but withdrawal puts at risk millions of manufacturing jobs.\u201dThe rift between the business community and the administration stems largely from the differing views about the benefits of Nafta. Mr. Trump\u2019s America First policy has prompted the United States to make demands like scrapping investment protections that large companies favor but that the president\u2019s administration criticizes as corporate welfare. The White House has also proposed drastically raising the threshold for the proportion of an automobile that needs to be manufactured in North America to qualify for Nafta\u2019s zero tariffs.Those demands have angered Canada and Mexico and worried many businesses, which argue that the administration\u2019s policies will actually end up hurting the people they intend to help \u2014 including manufacturers.As rumors of a potential withdrawal swirled last spring, Ms. Dempsey pointed out in an email to the administration that over one-third of American manufactured exports were sold just to Canada and Mexico. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough that North America is U.S. manufacturing\u2019s largest market,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
